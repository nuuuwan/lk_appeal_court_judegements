JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) has

been indicted in the High Court of Emblipitiya in High Court Case No.

HCE 124/2019.

2. The charges in the indictment are as follows:

Charge 1

That during the period 01.02.2015 to 28.02.2015, at

Embilipitiya in the District of Ratnapura, within the

jurisdiction of this Court, the accused-appellant has

committed the offence of kidnapping, of a minor who was

less than sixteen (16) years of age at the time, from the

lawful guardianship of her mother, an offense punishable

under section 354 of the Penal Code.

3

Charge 2

That in the course of the same transaction, the accused-

appellant committed rape on the said victim, who is under

sixteen (16) years of age, and have thereby committed an

offense punishable under section 364(2)(e) of the Penal

Code as amended by Act No.22 of 1995.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge has found

the appellant guilty of the charges in the indictment and sentenced

the appellant as follows;

Charge 1

Term of 05 years rigorous imprisonment and a

fine of Rs. 10,000 with a term of 06 months

simple imprisonment in default of the payment of

the fine.

Charge 2

20 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.

15,000 with a term of 06 months rigorous

imprisonment in default of the payment of the

fine.

Compensation of Rs. 250,000 to be paid to PW1, with a term of 12

months simple imprisonment in default of the payment of the same.

The Learned High Court Judge has also ordered that 20% of the

amount fined and 20% of the amount awarded as compensation to

be deposited to the Victims and Witnesses Protection Fund.

4. The appellant being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentencing

order has preferred the instant appeal to this Court

Case of the prosecution

5. The appellant has been known to the father of PW1. In those

circumstances, the appellant has visited the residence of PW1 on

several occasions. During such visits, the appellant has developed an

acquaintance with PW1. Thereafter, as planned, the appellant has met

PW1, when she was on her way for extra lessons, lured her to visit a

motel, and have engaged in sexual intercourse with PW1 thereafter.

Case of the appellant

6. The appellant has denied any acquaintance with PW1 and also denied

that he had sexual intercourse with PW1.

7. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Learned Counsel for

the appellant urged the following grounds of appeal;

i. The prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond

a reasonable doubt.

ii. The Learned High Court Judge has erred in law in

regard to the burden of proof and the quantum of

proof.

iii. The Learned High Court Judge has erred in law in

applying the provisions in section 166 of the Code of

5

Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 to convict the

appellant.

iv. In any event, the sentence is excessive.

8. The evaluation of evidence in a trial is a fundamental aspect of the

judicial process. It is vital for ensuring that justice is served and that

legal outcomes are based on factual and reliable information adduced

through evidence. Further, the evaluation of evidence can significantly

affect the outcome of a trial. A strong case supported by credible

evidence may lead to a conviction while insufficient evidence can

result in an acquittal. The evaluation of evidence in a trial is also a

multi-faceted process that requires careful consideration of various

factors including the type of evidence present and the standards by

which it is evaluated.

9. When one search through the disputed judgment it is apparent that

the evidence adduced through the examination of witnesses of the

prosecution and those of the appellant have been summarised by the

Learned High Court Judge. Thereafter, such evidence had been

evaluated. When evaluating the evidence adduced through the

examination of witnesses, the Learned High Court Judge has adopted

the test of probability, consistency, etc. Additionally, he has drawn his

attention to the contradictions marked together with the omissions

drawn to the attention of Court, in the cross-examination of such

witnesses. The Learned High Court Judge has detailed the reasons for

the materialisation of those contradictions and omissions. As regard

to the evidence of PW1, her upbringing, her age, it being her first visit

to a police station and the confusion occurred as a consequence of

psychological trauma suffered by her have been taken into

consideration and given thought to when analysing the same.

6

10. PW6, Dr. S. J. Palliyaguru has examined PW1 at the office of the

Judical Medical Officer at the District Hospital of Embelipitiya on

02.05.2015, beginning 12.25 hrs and prepared a medico-legal report.

Such report has been marked as -2. The Learned High Court Judge

has drawn his attention to the contents of such report and given due

weightage to the same.

11. Consequent to the evaluation of evidence presented at the trial, the

Learned High Court Judge has held that the prosecution has

presented cogent evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt

that the appellant has committed the offences referred to in the

indictment. In doing so, the Learned High Court Judge has given

thought to the ingredients of the offences and applied the evidence

divulged accordingly. He has also concluded that the evidence

adduced on behalf of the appellant has failed to create a doubt in the

prosecution's case.

12. Though, conclusive evidence as regard to the date which the

appellant took PW1 to a motel has not been forthcoming, the Learned

High Court Judge, perusing the obtainable evidence has fixed the date

on which such incident occurred as 09.03.2015. Though, the date

fixed is not compatible with the time period set out in the charges in

the indictment, the Learned High Court Judge has proceeded to

explain as to why such an incompatibility was not material. Having

considered the appellants defence, concluded that the appellant has

not been misled by such incompatibility in the time period referred to

in the charges in the indictment.

7

13. Section 166 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 is

as follows;

Any error in stating either the offence or the particulars

required to be stated in the charge and any omission to

state the offence or these particulars shall not be regarded

at any stage of the case as material, unless the accused

was misled by such error or omission.

14. In the decided case of D. R. M. Pandithakoralege (Excise

Inspector) vs. V. K. Selvanayagam 56 NLR 143, Swan, J, has

stated,

There can be no doubt that the accused was in no way

misled by the mistake as regards the date in the plaint. In

the case of William Edward James 1 it was held that a

mistaken date in an indictment, unless the date is of the

essence of the offence or the accused is prejudiced, need

not be formally amended. In the course of his judgment

dismissed the appeal the Lord Chief Justice referred to the

judgment of Atkin J in the case of Dossi 2 where it was

held that from time immemorial a date specified in an

indictment has never been considered a material matter

unless time was of the essence of the offence.

15. The psychological and physical effects of rape are profound and far-

reaching. Rape is not merely a violation of individual rights, it creates

a ripple effect that impacts families, communities and society at large.

Therefore, it is imperative to implement a robust legal response to

8

ensure that legal frameworks recognise the seriousness of the offence

and hold the perpetrators accountable.

16. In determining the appropriate punishment, the Court is required to

consider the same from the point of view of the convict as well as the

public.

17. In Attorney General vs. H. N. de Silva 57 NLR 121, Basnayake,

ACJ, explaining the matters that should be taken into consideration

in determining a sentence has stated as follows;

In assessing the punishment that should be passed on

an offender, a Judge should consider the matter of

sentence both from the point of view of the public and the

offender, Judges are too often prone to look at the question

only from the angle of the offender. A Judge should, in

determining the proper sentence, first consider the gravity

of the offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself

and should have regard to the punishment provided in the

Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is

charged. He should also regard the effect of the

punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it

will be effective. If the offender held a position of trust or

belonged to a service which enjoys the public confidence

that must be taken into account in assessing the

punishment. The incident of crimes

of the nature of which the offender has been found to be

guilty and the difficulty of detection are also matters which

should receive due consideration. The reformation of the

criminal, though no doubt an important consideration is

9

subordinate to the others I have mentioned. Where the

public interest or the welfare of the State (which are

synonymous) outweighs the previous good character,

antecedents and age of the offender, public interest must

prevail.

18. The legal implications of a rape conviction extend far beyond the

Court room. Convictions for rape carry significant implications not

just for the victim but for the society as a whole ensuring that

individuals convicted of serious offences are dealt with appropriately

is crucial for justice and further deterrence of future offences. The

legal consequences imposed on individuals convicted of rape are

designed to reflect the seriousness of the crime.

19. S. N. Silva, J, as he was then, in assessing the aggravating

circumstances as regards to the offence of rape has stated as follows

in Attorney General vs. Ranasinghe [1993] 2 SLR 81,

It is also appropriate to cite an observation made by the

Lord Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal of England, with

regard to the sentence to be imposed for an offence of rape. In

the case of Roberts (4) at page 244. It was observed as follows;

Rape is always a serious crime. Other than in

wholly exceptional circumstances, it calls for an

immediate custodial sentence. This was certainly so in

the present case. A custodial sentence is necessary for a

variety of

reasons. First of all to mark the gravity of the offence.

Secondly to emphasise public disapproval. Thirdly to

10

serve as a warning to others. Fourthly to punish the

offender, and last but by no means least, to protect

women. The length of the sentence will depend on all the

circumstances. That is a trite observation, but these, in

cases of rape vary widely from case to case.

In the case of, Keith Billam (5) the Lord Chief Justice

repeated the foregoing observations and stated that in a

contested case of rape a figure of five years imprisonment

should be taken as the starting point of the sentence, subject to

any aggravating or mitigating features. He observed further as

follows:-

The crime should in any event be treated as

aggravated by any of the following factors : (1) violence is

used over and above the force necessary to commit the

rape; (2) a weapon is used to frighten or wound the

victim; (3) the rape is repeated ; (4) the rape has been

carefully planned ; (5) the defendant has previous

convictions for rape or other serious offences of a violent

or sexual kind ; (6) the victim is subjected to further

sexual indignities or perversions ; (7) the victim is either

very old or very young ; (8) the effect upon the victim,

whether physical or mental, is of special seriousness.

Where any one or more of these aggravating features are

present, the sentence should be substantially higher than

the figure suggested as the starting point.

11

20. It is seen that several of these aggravating circumstances are present

in the instant case. The fact that PW1 was very young below the age

where she may have consented to sexual intercourse, the degree of

pre-planning by the appellant and the repeated commission of the

offence, are some of those aggravating circumstances. Public interest

demands that a custodial sentence be imposed on the appellant in

this case.

21. Accordingly, under those circumstances, I am not inclined to

interfere with the disputed judgment and the sentencing order. I

dismiss the appeal.

22. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment

to the High Court of Embilipitiya for compliance.
