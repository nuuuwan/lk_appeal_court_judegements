Charge 03 That during the same period and same place as mentioned above, but at a date other than the date mentioned in the 01st and 02nd charges above, the accused-appellant did commit the offence of rape, on the said minor, and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 364(2)(e) of the Penal Code as amended by Act No. 22 of 1995.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has found

the appellant guilty of the charges, convicted him there of and proceeded to sentence the appellant as follows;

A term of 18 years rigorous imprisonment each in respect of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd charges. A fine of Rs.10,000 each in respect of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd charges with a term of 6 months each in default of payment of the fine. Directed that the terms of rigorous imprisonment shall run concurrently. 4. The appellant aggrieved by the disputed judgement and the sentencing

order has preferred the instant appeal in this Court.

Case of the prosecution

5. PW01 has been born on February 03, 1994. Due to their impoverished

circumstances, PW01s parents have struggled to provide for her. As a result, at a very young age, PW01 has been sent to live in the household of the appellant. During her time there, PW01 has attended school and contributed to the household by doing odd jobs when she was not in class.

Page 4 of 11

6. When PW01 was residing in the household of the appellant, he has

allegedly engaged in sexual intercourse with PW01. The fact that PW01 was sexually abused by the appellant has not been disclosed to a 3rd party until a teacher at school has observed a change in PW01s behaviour and questioned her about it. Upon PW01 divulging the incidents regarding the appellant, the school authorities have notified the probation officer of the area, which has subsequently led to a complaint being made to the Police. In response, the Police has initiated an investigation. 7. PW01 has been examined by Dr. K. Gunathilake, the Judicial Medical

Officer of the Gampaha Base Hospital. The medico-legal report has been marked -1.

Case of the appellant

8. The appellant has asserted that the allegations made against him are

unfounded and untrue.

Ground of appeal

9. The Learned Counsel for the appellant urged the following ground of

appeal when the matter was taken up for argument; i. Has the Learned High Court Judge properly evaluated the evidence led at the trial prior to delivering the disputed judgment?

10. The Learned Counsel for the appellant has raised concerns regarding the

testimony of PW01, asserting that it lacks sufficient detail about the incidents specified in the charges, particularly regarding penetration by the appellant.

11. In page 53 of the Appeal Brief, an admission has been documented,

confirming that the appellant does not dispute the fact that PW01 was residing in the appellants home at the time referenced in the charges, and that she was under the custody of the appellant. 12. In her testimony, PW01 has stated that during her time in the appellants

home she experienced sexual abuse. She has indicated that there were

Page 5 of 11

two or three occasions where the appellant engaged in sexual intercourse with her in the sitting area of the residence in the evening. These facts are detailed in pages 54 and 55 of the Appeal Brief.

[pages 54 and 55 of the Appeal Brief]

Page 6 of 11

13. PW01 has consistently maintained her narrative throughout the

proceedings. The patients history provided to Dr. Gunathilake i.e. PW05, aligns with her testimony, suggesting a coherent account of events. However, it is essential to recognise that though PW01 has provided detailed descriptions of the incident, they may be limited to an extent, due to her tender age at the time of the occurrence.

14. Additionally, PW01s desire to forget the traumatic experiences and focus

on moving forward with her life could impact the depth of her recollections. Furthermore, the prolonged delay in testifying in Court may also have influenced the narrative, as time can affect memory recall and emotional processing.

15. PW01 has stated that the incidents referred to in the charges occurred

when she was around 11 years old. It is important to consider that she has been very young at that time. Childrens memories are not uniform; they can vary from one child to another. Furthermore, if PW01 was in a state of mind where she would have preferred to forget her traumatic past, it would be unreasonable to expect her to provide exact dates or detailed information.

16. The nature of the admission recorded indicates that the appellant has

not contested the fact that PW01 was residing in the appellants home during the relevant time frame mentioned in the charges. PW01s narrative aligns with this period. Given these circumstances, the appellant would have had an awareness when the alleged incidents referred to by PW01 took place.

[vide pages 58 to 61 of the Appeal Brief]

Although a contradiction has been noted as V1, during the cross-examination of PW01, the appellant has failed to prove the statement of PW01 through which the contradiction was noted.

Page 8 of 11

As such, the appellant has failed to establish the existence of the alleged contradiction.

Although several contradictions were marked when the accused gave evidence, the proper procedure had not been followed. When a witness is to be contradicted, the proper procedure is set out in section 145 of the Evidence Ordinance. This section contemplates that when a witness is to be contradicted his attention must be first drawn to the fact of having made a previous statement, and thereafter, more specifically, to the parts of the statement which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him. It is only after that, the actual writing with which the witness was contradicted with, can be proved. vide Gamini Sugathasena and Another vs. The State [1988] 1 SLR 405.

Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the contradiction marked V1 pertains solely to PW01s disclosure of incidents of sexual abuse by a third party to the appellant upon the inquiry made by the latter. In this context, it does not directly relate to the core of PW01s testimony.

17. Also, it has been pointed on behalf of the appellant that PW01 has

acknowledged the suggestion indicating that it was the appellant who took her to hospital after she revealed the incidents of sexual abuse. When considering the totality of evidence, it is clear that the investigators have directed PW01 to undergo a medical examination, rather than the appellant. This indicates that PW01 may have been factually misled.

18. Rape is a horrific offence that not only violates an individuals physical

anatomy but also inflicts profound psychological trauma leaving lasting scars on victims. The seriousness of the offence necessitates a robust legal response that serves not only to punish the offender, but also to deter potential future offences. Deterrent punishment aims to convey a strong societal message that such behaviour will not be tolerated, thereby, fostering a sense of safety and justice. 19. In determining the appropriate punishment, the Court is required to

consider the same from the point of view of the convict as well as the public.

20. In Attorney General vs. H. N. de Silva 57 NLR 121, Basnayake, ACJ,

explaining the matters that should be taken into consideration in determining a sentence has stated as follows;

In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an

offender, a Judge should consider the matter of sentence both

from the point of view of the public and the offender, Judges are

too often prone to look at the question only from the angle of the

offender. A Judge should, in determining the proper sentence,

first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from the

nature of the act itself and should have regard to the punishment

provided in the Penal Code or other statute under which the

offender is charged. He should also regard the effect of the

punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it will be

effective. If the offender held a position of trust or belonged to a

service which enjoys the public confidence that must be taken

into account in assessing the punishment. The incident of crimes

of the nature of which the offender has been found to be guilty

and the difficulty of detection are also matters which should

receive due consideration. The reformation of the criminal,

though no doubt an important consideration is subordinate to the

others I have mentioned. Where the public interest or the welfare

of the State (which are synonymous) outweighs the previous

good character, antecedents and age of the offender, public

interest must prevail.

21. Convictions for rape carry significant implications not just for the

victim but for the society as a whole, ensuring that individuals

convicted of serious offences are dealt with appropriately, is crucial for

justice and further deterrence of future offences. The legal

consequences imposed on individuals convicted of rape are designed to

reflect the seriousness of the crime.

Page 10 of 11

22. S. N. Silva, J, as he was then, in assessing the aggravating

circumstances as regards to the offence of rape has stated as follows in

Attorney General vs. Ranasinghe [1993] 2 SLR 81,

It is also appropriate to cite an observation made by the

Lord Chief Justice in the Court of Appeal of England, with regard

to the sentence to be imposed for an offence of rape. In the case

of Roberts (4) at page 244. It was observed as follows;

Rape is always a serious crime. Other than in wholly

exceptional circumstances, it calls for an immediate

custodial sentence. This was certainly so in the present

case. A custodial sentence is necessary for a variety of

reasons. First of all to mark the gravity of the offence.

Secondly to emphasise public disapproval. Thirdly to serve

as a warning to others. Fourthly to punish the offender,

and last but by no means least, to protect women. The

length of the sentence will depend on all the

circumstances. That is a trite observation, but these, in

cases of rape vary widely from case to case.

In the case of, Keith Billam (5) the Lord Chief Justice repeated

the foregoing observations and stated that in a contested case of

rape a figure of five years imprisonment should be taken as the

starting point of the sentence, subject to any aggravating or

mitigating features. He observed further as follows:-

The crime should in any event be treated as

aggravated by any of the following factors : (1) violence is

used over and above the force necessary to commit the

rape; (2) a weapon is used to frighten or wound the victim;

(3) the rape is repeated ; (4) the rape has been carefully

planned ; (5) the defendant has previous convictions for

Page 11 of 11

rape or other serious offences of a violent or sexual kind ;

(6) the victim is subjected to further sexual indignities or

perversions ; (7) the victim is either very old or very young

; (8) the effect upon the victim, whether physical or mental,

is of special seriousness. Where any one or more of these

aggravating features are present, the sentence should be

substantially higher than the figure suggested as the

starting point.

23. It is seen that several of these aggravating circumstances are present in

the instant case. The fact that PW01 was very young below the age

where she may have consented to sexual intercourse, the degree of pre-

planning by the appellant and the repeated commission of the offence,

are some of those aggravating circumstances. Public interest demands

that a custodial sentence be imposed on the appellant in this case.

24. Accordingly, under those circumstances, I am not inclined to interfere

with the disputed judgment and the sentencing order. I dismiss the

appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

25. The Registrar of this Court is requested to communicate this judgment

to the High Court of Gampaha for compliance.
