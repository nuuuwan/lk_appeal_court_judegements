The Petitioner of this application, G. A. Wasana Ginigaddara, residing at No. 9B/166Jayawadanagama housing scheme of the National Housing Development Authority (hereinaftersometime referred to as NHDA) at Battaramulla, claims that her residence is situated in lot No.

09 as depicted in the Survey plan bearing No. 144A annexed to the petition marked as P2.The Petitioner further claims that she purchased this property from the 1st Respondent by theDeed of transfer bearing No.4695 and at the time of the said transfer, the 1st Respondentassured her that

a) Access for motor vehicles to her property would be from the East b) Footpath for regular access would be provided from the West c) Motor vehicle access and parking/garage space was at the end of the said access from

the East

The area designated for the aforesaid access and parking/garage facility was intended to besituated within an approximate portion of Lot No. 15, which lies adjacent to the Petitionersproperty, and was to be regarded as common property for the benefit and use of the

4

residences bearing Nos. 9B/165, 9B/166, and 9B/167, situated at Jayawadanagama,Battaramulla.

From 1986, a Sub Post Office had been in existence in the plot of land described as Lot 15 andthe 5th Respondent has served as the Sub Postmistress from around 2007. In 2016 thePetitioner being reliably informed that the areas demarcated as G1 and G2 of the land shown inthe sketch annexed to the petition marked P3 is to be sold to the 5th Respondent, had sent aletter dated 10th February 2016 to the 2nd respondent communicating her objections anddemanding withdrawal of the said decision.

Petitioner states that considering the boundary stones erected depicting the portion of land tobe sold she has reasonable apprehension and fear the access road and the parking facilitiesenjoyed by her will be denied or withdrawn by the said unlawful actions of one or more of theRespondents and that their actions may have been influenced by collateral motives and taintedwith mala fides.

An appeal dated 4th April 2016 addressed to the 3rd Respondent, demanding to uphold thePetitioners legitimate entitlement to the said access road and parking area, had received noresponse, and an attempt to secure a meeting with the 3rd Respondent had also failed. Inaddition, the Petitioners proposal submitted to the 2nd Respondent, whereby the Petitioner,along with other interested neighboring parties, had expressed willingness to purchase the saidportion of land at a reasonable price, had also been disregarded.

The Petitioner has filed this Application seeking, inter alia, the following substantive reliefs:

(b) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st to 3rd

Respondents and/or their servants and/or agents and/or those exercising powersunder them from proceeding to any further steps to convey or dispose of any landsfrom and out of the area depicted morefully as Lot 15 on survey plan bearing No. .144A marked "P2" above, to anyone other than the Petitioner and those residents ofhouses bearing No's. 9B/165, 9B/166 and 9B/167 in a manner that would deny thePetitioner her motor vehicle access and garage/parking area as hitherto occupied andenjoyed;

(c) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 3rd

Respondents and/or their servants and/or agents and/or those exercising powersunder them to take immediate action according to law, to carry out and conclude acomprehensive inquiry/investigation into the Petitioner's above Appeal dated 4th April2016 marked "P7" above prior to proceeding to any steps to convey or dispose of anylands from and out of the area depicted more fully as Lot 15 on survey plan bearing No.

. 144A marked "P2" above to anyone other than the Petitioner and those residentsof houses bearing No's. 9B/165, 9B/166 and 9B/167 in a manner that would deny thePetitioner her motor vehicle access and garage/parking area as hitherto occupied andenjoyed;

(d) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 3rd

Respondents to offer the said land area, in terms of law for sale to the Petitioner andthose residents of houses bearing No's. 9B/165, 9B/166 and 9B/167, in the event thereis a lawful need to so dispose of same by sale, depicted morefully as Lot 15 on surveyplan bearing No. . 144A marked "P2" above, which was the area allocated to thePetitioner for her motor vehicle access and garage/parking area as hitherto occupiedand enjoyed;

(e) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari, directing the 1st to 3rd

Respondents, in the event a purported decision has been made by the 1st to 3rd

Respondents during the pendency of this application without the knowledge of thePetitioner to sell or convey to the 5th Respondent any areas of land depicted morefullyas Lot 15 on survey plan bearing No. . 144A marked "P2" above, to produce samein Your Lordships' Court and quashing same or permit, the Petitioner to amend herprayer accordingly seeking a quashing order of same;

The petitioners application is based on the survey plan bearing No. . 144A marked "P2".However, P2 is a plan depicting Lot No. 09, and this plan merely shows that its easternboundary is Lot. No. 15 and does not depict the extent, roadways or the boundaries of LotNo.15. The Petitioner has annexed as P3 an enlarged sketch purported to show Lot Nos. 08, 09,10, 11, 12 and 15. Although P3 appears to show the existing Sub Post Office building, the accessroad and the parking area, there is no indication as to who has prepared this sketch or its scale.Further, as the 1st to 4th Respondents have not accepted P3, and as such, no reliance can beplaced on its accuracy. I am unable to consider the P3 sketch in support of the Petitionerscontentions.

The Petitioner does not claim ownership over Lot No.15. The Petitioners rights over Lot No.15stems from the claim that at the time of purchasing her property the 1st Respondent assuredher that the vacant area of Lot No. 15 will be considered as common property on behalf ofherself and her neighbors to be used for vehicular and pedestrian access to their properties andwould also be available for parking. The Petitioner states that this assurance was one of thereasons that motivated her to purchase the property (Lot No.09), and since the said purchase,she has been making use of Lot No.15 for the aforesaid purposes. Under the circumstances, thePetitioner claims a legitimate expectation that she would be permitted to continue to avail

6

herself of the said access and parking facilities within Lot No. 15 without obstruction orinterference.

As recognized by Sri Lankan jurisprudence, for a legitimate expectation to arise, it must bebased on a clear representation, promise, established practice, or a consistent course ofconduct by a public authority1. Mere hopes, desires, wishes, or aspirations, however genuine orsincere, fall short of the threshold required to establish a legitimate expectation. The burden ison the individual claiming legitimate expectation to demonstrate that an unqualifiedrepresentation was made.2

The 1st to 4th Respondents has vehemently denied that any assurance or undertaking was givenat any time to the Petitioner indicating that the petitioner will have access or parking spacefrom Lot No.15. The Petitioner has been unable to submit any official or independent proof thatany such understanding or arrangement existed regarding Lot No.15, other than to annex as P4photographs which inter alia supposed to depict the vehicles parked in Lot No.15. This pictorialevidence has also been denied by the 1st to 4th Respondents and the 1st to 4th Respondents hadfurther submitted that the Petitioner has unlawfully constructed a garage on land to which shehas no title.

The Petitioner has further referred to the portion of the Deed of transfer bearing No.4695(annexed marked as P1) at page 4 which state that the Petitioner is entitled for all commonrights of way and servitudes, in order to claim that there was an expressed assurance orundertaking between the Petitioner and the 1st Respondent. This, however is a common clausein a transfer deed and cannot be considered to refer to vehicular or pedestrian access throughLot No.15 or its usage to park vehicles.

On the above grounds, I hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish the existence oflegitimate expectations regarding her purported rights over Lot No.15.

Further, the conflicting positions of opposing parties represent disputed facts. In Sri Lankan writjurisdiction, the principle of disputed facts plays a crucial role in determining whether the Courtwill exercise its discretionary power to grant prerogative writs. In Thajudeen v Sri Lanka TeaBoard and Another3 it was held: Where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result ofthe facts is subject to controversy and it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed ina suit where parties would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses so that theCourt would be better able to judge which version is correct, a writ will not issue.

The position of the 5th Respondent (the prospective purchaser of the disputed land) is that theexisting Sub Post Office is situated on Lot No.14 and not Lot No.15 as declared by the petitionerand the land she is attempting to purchase is the said Lot No.14. As proof of, the 5th

Respondent has submitted the letter dated 12th February 2023 (annexed to the objections as5R4) of Colombo District Manager of NHDA, requesting to provide the 5th Respondent a surveyplan of Lot No.14 as it is decided to transfer the building bearing No. 95/4 to the 5thRespondent. The 5R4 letter and the plan issued by NHDA marked as 5R5 clearly shows that theplot of land and the building the 5th Respondent is attempting to purchase is Lot No. 14 and notLot No. 15. The 5th respondent in her objections has categorically stated that she has no claimregarding Lot No.15.

In addition to the rights claimed by the Petitioner arising from the doctrine of legitimateexpectation, the Petitioner further contends that having regard to the purpose, scope, andstatutory framework of the National Housing Development Authority Act, the purportedattempt by the Respondents to alienate or dispose of the disputed portion of land is ultra viresand/or unlawful. However, the Petitioner has failed to specifically establish in what manner theactions of the Respondents amount to a contravention of the express provisions of the said Act.

The Petitioner, in her written submissions, has further asserted that the conduct of theRespondents is procedurally improper and/or unreasonable. However, other than theallegation that the 3rd Respondent failed to respond to the Petitioner, no material has beensubmitted to substantiate any claim of unreasonableness or procedural impropriety on the partof the Respondents. Moreover, it is pertinent to note that, at least subsequent to the filing ofthis application, there have been multiple attempts by the parties to resolve the matteramicably. In the circumstances, it cannot be reasonably contended that the Petitioner wasdeprived of an opportunity to be heard.

The position of the 1st to 4th Respondents throughout has been that they intend to lawfullyhand over a block of land to the 5th respondent for the purpose of maintaining a post office, andthis land does not coincide with any part of the land that is lawfully owned by the petitioner.Further, the Respondents have submitted that the petitioner cannot institute legal proceedingsto compel the Respondents to sell state land to her and her neighbors.

The petitioner has failed to establish any of the grounds on which they relied upon for the reliefprayed. In the circumstances, I do not find any merit or justification for judicial intervention.This application is accordingly dismissed. I make no order as to costs.
