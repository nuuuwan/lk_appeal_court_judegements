    "text": "The Respondents main objection is that the Petitioners are guilty of laches. Let me now consider the said objections. As per the material before Court it is undisputed that the corpus was acquired in the year 1971. Section 38A publication is dated 28.05.1971 (P27). The Petitioners did not challenge the said Gazette and waited till July 2022 to challenge the said Gazette which is nearly 50 years after the acquisition. In explaining the delay, it was submitted by the Petitioners that initially the original owners did not challenge the acquisition as they were afraid of political revenge. This argument cannot be accepted and not tenable, as the Petitioners have failed to place any material independent of what the Petitioners assert, to substantiate any kind of political interference in the acquisition process. Further, the Petitioners contended that they had at various times written to the Minister of Lands of successive Governments after 2014 pertaining to the irregularities in the acquisition procedure. However, the only document that the Petitioners have tendered to this Court to substantiate this contention is the document marked as P40, which is a letter written by an Attorney-at-Law on the instruction of the Petitioners to the Minister of Lands. The said letter does not challenge the acquisition based on a defective Notice pursuant to section 2. In the said letter, the Petitioners only contention is that the land acquired was not utilized for the public purpose it was acquired for.",
