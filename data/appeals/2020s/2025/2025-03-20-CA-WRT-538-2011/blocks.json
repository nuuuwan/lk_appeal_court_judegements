After loading the said consignment of Kerosene, said Padmakumara had called the Stores Assistant R.M.A. Rajapaksha and had informed him that he was on his way to the Camp. Said Rajapaksha had informed Padmakumara that there are no Navy personnel and Barrels to unload Kerosene at the Camp, and therefore to sell the Kerosene. Thereafter, Rajapaksha had spoken to the Bowser Driver Wehella and had inquired about selling the consignment of kerosene. Wehella had called Padmakumara back and had informed him that he knows of a place to sell kerosene and had asked Rajapaksha to call him. Then said Padmakumar had called said Rajapaksha and had handed over the phone to Wehella to speak to Rajapaksha directly. Afterwards, Bowser driven by Wehella had left Kollonnawa along with said Padmakumara and one Rathnasiri. The bowser had gone to a certain location identified by Wehella and had reached a petrol station. At the Petrol Station, Wehella and Rathnasiri had stepped out of the Bowser and had spoken to a motorcyclist who was there. Thereafter, said",

The Petitioner complains that the recording of the Summary of Evidence for the third time from the witnesses namely S.B. Kaluarachchi, B.G.C.S. Lakmal and M.H. Kosala is contrary to the due procedure of recording the Summary of Evidence as stipulated in Sri Lanka Navy Orders 0512 [P4]. Nevertheless, the proceedings of the Court Martial commenced on 23.06.2010. The third Summary of Evidence of the above three witnesses was recorded from 11.02.2010 to 25.02.2010 before the commencement of the Court Martial. In terms of Section 31 of the P4, if it appears to the Commanding Officer or Convening Authority that additional evidence is required, additional evidence may be obtained by recording an additional Summary of Evidence. Furthermore, it is observed that the Charge Sheet [P7] was not amended subsequent to the third Summary of Evidence.",

Consequently, the Petitioner contends that Niroshan has intentionally altered his evidence and provided false testimony to align with the narrative given by his friends. Anyhow, the Summary of Evidence is not evidence before the Court Martial. Furthermore, merely because witnesses sit in such a manner or speak with each other does not necessarily mean that they were close friends, and it does not seem as a reason for Niroshan to give evidence in agreement with the testimony given by the other two.

The Petitioner claims that the evidence in rebuttal could be allowed only when the Prosecution is taken aback by surprise. Section 134 of the Navy Act (as amended) provides that, subject to other provisions of this part, the rules of evidence to be adopted in proceedings before a court martial shall be the same as those followed in the civil courts in Sri Lanka. Hence, it is viewed that the Evidence Ordinance applies to a Court Martial. The Petitioner relies on the Law of Evidence by E.R.S.R.Coomaraswamy and the Supreme Court decision in K.S. Sediris v.

The official driver of the Petitioner Niroshan has given evidence stating that he accompanied the Petitioner to the Kaduwela in the official vehicle leaving the wardroom at Welisara by 9.00 p.m. It is observed that the Petitioner had failed to suggest to any of the Prosecution witnesses that he remained in the wardroom at Welisara camp during the time he was said to have seen in Kaduwela, the place of the crime. Alibi being the main defence of the Petitioner, witnesses of the Prosecution before the Court Martial should have at least been suggested by the defence that the Petitioner had remained somewhere else during the relevant time but not at the site of the crime. Hence the consistency of the defence of the alibi has been called into serious question. In Jayatissa v. Hon Attorney General [2010] 1 SRI L.R.279, the Supreme Court observed, that;",

Thus, despite these doubts, rather than acquitting the Petitioner, the Court Martial opted to impose a lighter sentence.
