Judgment

1. The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) has filed the instant

appeal against the judgment dated 09.10.2020 delivered by the learned High Court

Judge of Vavuniya. Although several grounds of appeal were initially urged, learned

Counsel for the appellant, at the hearing, confined her submissions solely to the

question of the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge.

2. The relief is sought in terms of section 333 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No

15 of 1979 as amended by the Act No 25 of 2024. The appellant further prays that this

Court be pleased to order that the prison sentence take effect from the date of conviction

3. By the said amendment, a proviso to section 333(5) was added, which reads:

Provided that, the Court of Appeal may, in appropriate cases, order that the time spent

by an appellant in custody pending the determination of his appeal and any time spent

in custody prior to the conviction, such time not having been considered as part of his

sentence passed at the time of his conviction by the court of first instance, be considered

as part of his sentence ordered at the conclusion of his appeal.

4. This Act empowers the Court of Appeal to treat the period an accused person has spent

in custody before their conviction as part of the sentence ultimately imposed. In

practice, this means that if a person has been held on remand for a significant length of

time while awaiting trial or judgment, that period will be credited towards their final

sentence.

5. The principle underlying this provision is that pre-conviction detention is not a neutral

period of time; it is, in effect, a curtailment of liberty that carries the same hardships

and stigma as imprisonment after conviction. To ignore such a period would be to

disregard a real and tangible deprivation experienced by the accused.

6. The amendment to the Act seeks to ensure that no individual is punished twice over:

first through lengthy detention while awaiting trial, and then again through the full

imposition of a custodial sentence without credit for that prior confinement. In many

instances, delays in investigation, prosecution, or court proceedings lie beyond the

control of the accused. To compel such an individual to serve a sentence calculated

without regard to this time would risk producing sentences that are manifestly excessive

and unjust.

7. In the present case, the appellant was indicted in 2015 for committing rape on a female

under the age of 18 an offence punishable under section 364(2) e of the Penal Code as

amended by the Act No 22 of 1995. The trial had been conducted an on 30.11.2016, the

judgment delivered convicting the appellant.

8. Subsequently, he made an appeal against the judgment, and the Court of Appeal set

aside the judgment and ordered trial de novo. The re-trial commenced on 19.07.2019

and on 09.10.2009 the learned High Court Judge of Vavunia convicted the appellant

and imposed a 12 years rigorous imprisonment. The appellant was also imposed a fine

of Rs 10000.00 with a default sentence of 3 months simple imprisonment. Furthermore,

the appellant was ordered to pay the prosecutrix a sum of Rs 300000.00 as

compensation carrying a default sentence of 18 months simple imprisonment.

9. The judgment after trial de novo was delivered on 09.10.2020 and the learned High

Court Judge straight away imposed the aforementioned sentence on the appellant. It

could be observed, that the appellant was not accorded an opportunity to make

submissions in mitigation. Hence, the appellant was denied his right to submit

mitigatory facts for the consideration of the Judge when imposing the sentence.

10. On a perusal of the case record of the High Court, it could be observed that the appellant

had spent a considerable period in remand before he was sentenced. The learned High

Court Judge was not able to consider the remand period as no submission for mitigation

was made.

11. As can be seen from the journal entries of the High Court Case Record, the appellant

was in remand from 23.11.2016 to 02.04.2020, where he was released on bail.

Thereafter, on 09.10.2020 the appellant was found guilty after the trial de novo and

sentenced. Since then, the appellant has been in remand. Approximately, the appellant

has spent 8 years in remand custody by now.

12. The sentence imposed on the appellant is 12 years. Having considered the period he

had already spent in remand, I consider it is appropriate to deduct that period from the

sentence as it meet the ends of justice. Furthermore, it appears that the appellant has no

previous convictions. Hence, it is my considered view that it does not cause any

injustice to anyone if the sentence is ordered to take effect from the date of the

conviction.

13. Accordingly, I direct that the period of eight (08) years which the appellant has already

spent in remand custody be deducted from the sentence imposed. The appellants term

of imprisonment is therefore reduced to four (04) years, which shall take effect from

the date of conviction. The order as to fine, compensation, and the default sentence shall

remain unaltered. Subject to the aforesaid variation, the appeal is partly allowed.
