JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred as the Appellant)

was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of Colombo under

Sections 54A (b) and 54A (d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance as amended by Act No.13 of 1984 for the Trafficking and for being

in Possession of respectively 2.18 grams of Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) on 29th

April 2015.

Following the trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed a sentence of life

imprisonment on him on the 24th of June 2020.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent for this matter to be argued in his absence. During the

argument he has been connected via Zoom platform from prison.

CA/HCC/0079/2020

The learned Counsel, even though he raised several grounds of appeal in his

written submissions, restricted his argument to the following 03 grounds of

appeal.

1. That the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable

doubt.

2. The inward journey of the materials has not been proved.

3. The dock statement of the Appellant was not taken in to consideration

by the learned High Court Judge.

At the trial, PW1 SI/Lional, PW3 PC 88669 Jayasinghe, PW10

CI/Rajakaruna and PW11 Government Analyst Chandani Priyadharshika

were called by the prosecution to give evidence. The Appellant made a dock

statement and called his mother as a defence witness.

Background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

PW1, attached to the Police Narcotics Bureau had received an information

via PW3, about the trafficking of Heroin in the Panadura area. According to

the information, a person called Dilan has been expected to arrive carrying

Heroin to be delivered to somebody near Thattaya Bridge. Acting on this

information, PW1 had gone for the raid accompanied by five police officers.

He had used a double cab bearing plate no. WP GC 2941 for this purpose.

After reaching Angulana, PW3 had contacted the informant and he had

arrived at the spot at 18:55 hours. As the informant had mentioned that the

Appellant was expected to be late, PW1, PW3 and the informant had got into

the cab and driven in the direction of the Angulana Railway Station. After

about 10 minutes of their arrival, the Appellant had arrived on a motorbike.

Following the confirmation by the informant, the Appellant was stopped

before he could pass them and subjected to a body search. A cellophane bag

was recovered from the right-side pocket of the pair of shorts worn by the

Appellant. When the cellophane bag was checked by PW1 some brown

coloured substance was found, which he identified as Heroin relying on his

CA/HCC/0079/2020

4 | P a g e

experience in dealing with narcotics. The Appellant was taken into custody

immediately for further investigation.

During inquiry, the Appellants name was found to be Alankarage Dilan

Prasanga alias Kannadiya. Before they could proceed to the Police Narcotics

Bureau, the detectives had gone to the Appellants house for a search and

they had not been able to locate any illegal items from the search.

The recovered substance was weighed at the Police narcotics Bureau and the

weight of the substance with the cellophane bag had been around 15

grammes. PW1 had sealed the production and kept it in his personal locker

until it was handed over to the production officer.

According to the Government Analyst Report, 2.18 grammes of pure Heroin

(diacetylmorphine) had been detected from the substance, which was

subjected for analysis.

When the prosecution had closed the case after leading the prosecution

witnesses mentioned above, the defence was called, and the Appellant had

made a dock statement and closed his case.

According to the 1st ground of appeal, the learned Counsel for the Appellant

contends that the prosecution has not proved the case beyond reasonable

doubt as the learned Trial Judge had failed to appreciate the inconsistency

between the evidence given by PW1 and PW3 as to how they arrested the

Appellant on the date of incident.

According to PW1, the appellant was arrested before he could pass PW1 and

PW3. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

On this point, upon examination-in-chief of the evidence given by PW3, the

Appellant had come in a motor bike and had been stopped after passing the

bridge named as Thattaya Palama. The relevant portion is re-produced

During the cross examination of PW1, he had tried to change his stance by

saying that the Appellant had stopped the bike.

At this time the learned State Counsel had tried to amend the evidence given

by PW1 to tally with PW3 regarding how the Appellant was arrested by the

police. As the defence Counsel vehemently objected to this move, the learned

High Court Judge ruled that the Appellant was arrested after he was stopped

by the police. The ruling of the learned High Court Judge is re-produced

below:

With the above ruling it is very clear that the prosecution witnesses have

taken contradictory positions with regard to how they apprehended the

Appellant when it came to the part regarding the motor bike.

CA/HCC/0079/2020

7 | P a g e

In drug-related cases, contradictions within the prosecutions evidence or

between the prosecution and defence can seriously weaken the case and may

even result in an acquittal. While minor inconsistencies are generally not

decisive, major discrepancies can damage witness credibility and create

reasonable doubt about the accuseds guilt, particularly when they concern

crucial facts in dispute.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond a reasonable doubt against the accused person. In a case of this

nature, the prosecution needs to not only prove the case beyond a reasonable

doubt with cogent and credible evidence sans any contradictions or

omissions but should also ensure that the arrest, detection, weighing and

sending the substance for analysis is conducted in accordance to due

process which will otherwise affect the root of the case.

In Iswari Prasad v. Mohamed Isa 1963 AIR (SC) 1728 at 1734 His Lordship

held that;

In considering the question as to whether evidence given by the witness

should be accepted or not, the court has, no doubt, to examine whether

the witness is, an interested witness and to enquire whether the story

deposed to by him is probable and whether it has been shaken in cross-

examination. That is whether there is a ring of truth surrounding his

testimony.

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 Denning J in the

Kings Bench held that:

The evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in

a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is

well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of

probability

CA/HCC/0079/2020

8 | P a g e

In this case although PW1s stance was that they stopped the Appellant and

checked him, PW2 in his evidence very clearly stated that the Appellant was

only checked when he stopped his motorcycle after passing the bridge. This

is a very serious contradiction between important prosecution witnesses.

Further, this inter se contradiction raises very serious questions as to the

credibility of the so-called detection.

The effect of a valid and serious contradiction in a criminal trial has been

discussed in several judicial decisions. A contradiction which affects the root

of the case will certainly overturn the original decision pronounced by the

trial court. The appellate court will not encourage the provision of a second

chance to the prosecution to rectify the ambiguity created by the police

investigators in a case of this nature.

In Udagama v. AG [2000] 2 SLR 103 the court held that;

Material questions and contradictions go to the very root of the

prosecution case.

In the Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa [2011] 2 SLR

292 the court held that:

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgment on the nature of the inconsistency

or contradiction and whether they are material to the fact in issue.

The learned High Court Judge had not properly evaluated this inter se

contradiction in his judgment. This clearly shows, as contended by the

learned Counsel for the Appellant that the learned High Court Judge has

gone beyond evaluating the evidence that had been led before him and has

CA/HCC/0079/2020

9 | P a g e

arrived at his own conclusion, which is not supported by the evidence that

was led in the trial. It shows that he arrived at the decision based on

assumptions.

When the appellant satisfactorily proves that an inter se contradiction affects

the root of the prosecution case, the court has no option but to award the

benefit of that doubt to the Appellant. Therefore, I conclude that this ground

of appeal has merit and afford the benefit of the doubt to the Appellant

accordingly.

PW1, under cross examination admitted that he gave false evidence with

regard to who approached the Appellant when he was apprehended. It was

the position of PW1 that he together with PW3 and the informant had

approached the Appellant in order to search him. But in the cross

examination, he had said that the informant did not come with them. This

clearly affects the credibility of the witness.

Next, I will consider the third ground of appeal advanced by the Appellant.

In that ground the Appellant complains that the learned trial Judge has

failed to properly evaluate the dock statement in accordance with legal

principles.

The Appellant had denied that he was arrested as stated by the prosecution

witnesses. He had admitted that he was a drug addict and that he had gone

to a house where he could purchase Heroin. The learned High Court Judge

in his judgment disregarded the dock statement of the Appellant on the basis

that he had only made a dock statement and failed to create a doubt on the

prosecution case during the cross examination of prosecution witnesses.

In Samantha Jayamaha v. Attorney General CA Appeal 303/2006 and

C.A.L.A. 321/2006 decided on 11/07/2012 the court held that:

Even if the dock statement is rejected the burden always remains on

the prosecution of proving the case against the accused, beyond

reasonable doubt Whether the evidence of the defence or the dock

CA/HCC/0079/2020

10 | P a g e

statement is sufficient to create a doubt cannot be decided in a vacuum

or in isolation because it needs to be considered in the totality of the

evidence that is in the light of the evidence for the prosecution as well

as the defence Finally, having considered the case for the prosecution

as well as the dock statement it is only then the learned Judge can

decide whether or not the dock statement is sufficient to create a doubt

in the case for the prosecution.

In Udagama v. AG [2000] 2 SLR 103 the court held that:

(1) Evidence is infirm, unsafe and unreliable to act upon

considering the following, (iii) failure to evaluate and consider the dock statement of accused.

Test of reasonable doubt plays a vital role in the evaluation of defence

evidence. The evidence of the Appellant may not be so convincing yet it may

be capable of creating a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.

Hence, I agree that the failure to properly consider the dock statement of the

Appellant as argued by the learned Counsel, would have a detrimental

impact on the prosecution story.

The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial is the

observance of the principle of equality of arms between the defence and the

prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed throughout the trial,

means that both parties are treated in a manner ensuring their procedurally

equal position during the course of a trial.

When the defence evidence creates a reasonable doubt on the prosecution

case, the benefit of the same should be given to the Appellant.

CA/HCC/0079/2020

11 | P a g e

The failure of the witnesses to pass the test of credibility and probability and

the inter se contradiction of the prosecution witnesses are substantial

enough to vitiate the conviction.

Due to the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the conviction and the sentence

dated 24/06/2020 imposed on the Appellant by the learned High Court

Judge of Panadura. Therefore, he is acquitted from both charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of Panadura

along with the original case record.
