The trial commenced before the Judge of the High Court of Badulla as the

Appellants and the other Accused had opted for a non-jury trial. After the

conclusion of the prosecutions case, the learned High Court Judge had

acquitted the Appellants and the 2nd Accused in respect of counts Nos. 01,

02, 03, 04, 05 and 06 on the basis that the prosecution had not established,

that they were members of an unlawful assembly. The 2nd accused was

acquitted in respect of counts number 07, 08, 09,10 and 11. The above-

named Appellants were convicted for the aforesaid counts number 07, 08,

09, 10 and 11 and sentenced them to death. In respect of count number 11,

CA/HCC/162 ABC/15

6

the Appellants were convicted of causing hurt under Section 315 of the Penal

Code and they were sentenced to a term of 2 years rigorous imprisonment.

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the Hight Court dated 16.10.1997

the Appellants had preferred an appeal before the Court of Appeal and the

Court of Appeal in its judgment dated 08.11.1999, sent this case back to the

High Court of Badulla to conduct a fresh trial on the same indictment.

Upon the said order of the Court Appeal, a retrial was commenced on

23.03.2000 and the Appellants had preferred a jury trial at that time. When

this case was called on 10.01.2001, they had withdrawn their previous

request for a jury trial, and elected a non-jury instead.

When this matter was called on 01.08.2005, the 1st Appellant had absconded

the court. Hence, evidence was led under Section 241(1) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act and the case was fixed in absentia of the 1st

Appellant.

At the tail end of the prosecution case, the 1st Appellant was arrested and

produced before the court by the police on 05.11.2013. After an inquiry

under Section 241(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979,

the learned High Court Judge of Badulla refusing a trial in de novo,

continued the case. After marking the deposition of PW1 under Section 33 of

the Evidence Ordinance, the prosecution had closed their case. The learned

High Court Judge having satisfied there is a case to be answered by the

Appellants, called for the defence and explained their rights. The 1st

Appellant and the 2nd Appellant had opted to give evidence from the witness

box and the 3rd Appellant gave a statement from the dock.

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had acquitted the Appellants from counts number 01, 02, 03,

04, 05 and 06. They were convicted for counts number 07, 08, 09, and 10

and were sentenced to death on 28.08.2015. For the 11th Count the

Appellants were found guilty under Section 315 of the Penal Code and were

CA/HCC/162 ABC/15

7

sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5000/- and

a default sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid convictions and sentences the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court. For clarity the arraignment of the

Appellants in the High Court Trial is as follows:

1st Appellant (1st Accused in the indictment)

2nd Appellant (3rd Accused in the indictment)

3rd Appellant (4th Accused in the indictment)

The learned Counsels for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants had given consent for this matter to be argued in their absence.

During the argument, the Appellants were produced via zoom platform from

prison.

Background of the Case albeit briefly is as follows:

As PW1 had passed away before the re-trial commenced, the prosecution

had commenced the case by leading the evidence of PW2, Nadarajah

Chandramohan. According to him, he was 15 years old when the incident

occurred. The deceased were his mother, sister and two brothers. The

younger brother who died in the incident was only 4 years old.

On the day of the incident, as usual when he was at home with the others,

the 2nd Accused who was a known person had come to his house under

influence of liquor, had a chat with them and left the house only after some

time. The 2nd Accused had given a toffee to PW2 before he left the house.

After a while at about 8.15 p.m. the 2nd Accused had come to his house with

all the other Appellants and had first closed the main door. At that time, PW2

had received a blow on his body and received a cut by the 1st Appellant who

was yielding a long knife. It had struck the left side of his neck. At that time,

the 2nd Accused had opened the door and had paved a way for him to escape.

CA/HCC/162 ABC/15

When he came out of house, he had heard sounds similar to flesh being cut.

In the meantime, he had seen his brother, PW3 also outside the house

without any injury. At that time, due to anger he had rushed inside the house

armed with a mamoty, but had been restrained by the 2nd and 3rd Appellants.

As he had fallen down on the floor, he had been dealt with another blow from

the knife. He was unable to say what happened thereafter. This witness had

clearly identified all the Appellants at that time.

During the cross examination, PW2 had said that when all the Appellants

entered the house, the 1st Appellant had shouted that he came to kill all of

them.

PW3, Nadarajah Ravichandran who gave evidence next too corroborated the

evidence given by his brother PW2. He too identified the Appellants and the

knife at the trial.

As PW1, Kadiravel Nadarajah the father of PW2 and PW3, had passed away

before the trial, his evidence given in the non-summary inquiry was admitted

under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance. He too had corroborated the

evidence given by PW2 and PW3.

According to the JMO who produced the post-mortem reports of all the

deceased, all deceased had sustained cut injuries to the vital parts of the

body.

The knife had been recovered upon the statement of the 2nd Appellant.

The First Appellant had filed the following grounds of appeal.

1. The 1st Appellant was deprived of a fair trial due to failure of the

learned High Court Judge to afford him an opportunity to cross-

CA/HCC/162 ABC/15

9

examine the witnesses in terms of Section 241(3) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

2. It appears from the Judgment that the learned High Court Judge

had examined the statement of the witnesses.

3. The entire judgment is a narration of the witness testimonies and

does not contain any analysis.

4. The learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself regarding the

burden of proof.

The 2nd Appellant had filed following grounds of appeal.

1. The evidence of the prosecution does not pass the test of credibility.

2. The learned High Court Judge erred in law in arriving at the

conclusion that the 2nd Appellant had entertained the common

murderous intention.

The 3rd Appellant had filed following grounds of appeal.

1. The learned High Court Judge had failed to appreciate whether the

presence of the 3rd Appellant was a participatory presence.

2. It appears from the Judgment that the learned High Court Judge

had examined the statement of the witnesses.

As the appeal grounds raised by the Appellants are interconnected, all

grounds will be considered together hereinafter.

The learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for the 1st Appellant

contended that his client was deprived of a fair trial due to either the failure

of the learned High Court Judge to afford him an opportunity to cross-

examine the witnesses in terms of Section 241(3) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

The Sri Lankan Constitution by Article 13(3) expressly guarantees the right

of a person charged with an offence to be heard by person or by an Attorney-

CA/HCC/162 ABC/15

10

at-law at a fair trial by a competent Court. The right to a fair trial led to the

proper determination of whether an accused is innocent or guilty. This is an

internationally recognised human right. Fair trials help to establish the truth

and are vital for everyone involved in a case. They are a cornerstone of

democracy, helping to ensure fair and just societies, and limiting abuse by

governments and state authorities.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim

the benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side,

and a Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an

umpire to see that the rules of the game are applied by both sides.

A Judge is an administrator of justice, not merely a figure-head,

he has not only to direct and control the proceedings according to

recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done.

In this case after arraignment, the 1st Appellant had absconded the court

and the trial continued in his absence up to leading all prosecution

witnesses. Just before the closure of the prosecution case he was arrested

and produced before the court by the police. The learned High Court Judge

had conducted an inquiry under Section 241(3) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act and decided that his absence in court is not bona fide but was

mala fide. Hence, the application for the recall of all prosecution witnesses

was turned down by the learned High Court Judge.

In Rajapaksha v The State [2001] 2 SLR 161 the court held that:

In terms of S. 241 (3) the accused person if he appears before Court

and satisfies court that his absence at the trial was bona fide, the court

shall set aside the conviction/sentence/order and the trial then would

be fixed de - novo.

CA/HCC/162 ABC/15

11

In this case, all Appellants named in the indictment had been given a fair

trial by the trial judge. The court has followed all procedures correctly and

had treated all parties equally.

Next, the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Appellant and the Counsel

for the 3rd Appellant contended that the learned High Court Judge had

examined and referred the statement of the witnesses in the judgment.

In general, a judge cannot peruse all police statements when making a

judgment. A court can only consider police statements that have been

properly admitted as evidence, usually through contradiction or other

means.

K. A. Shantha Udayalal v The Hon. Attorney General SC. Spl. LA. No.

57/2017 dated 30.01.2018 the Supreme Court held that:

I would like to refer to a judicial decision in Punchimahaththaya Vs.

The State 76 NLR page 564 wherein the Court held as follows: Court of

Criminal Appeal (or the Supreme Court in appeal) has no authority to

peruse statements of witnesses recorded by the Police in the course of

their investigation (i.e. statement in the Information Book) other than

those properly admitted in evidence by way of contradiction or

otherwise. Section 122(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code which enables

such statements to be sent for to aid the Court is applicable only to

Courts of inquiry or trial.

The learned Counsels referred the following portion of the judgment to

substantiate their argument that the learned High Court Judge had referred

to the statements of witnesses.

The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Considering the portion of the judgment referred above, it is not clear

whether the learned High Court Judge had referred or compared the evidence

given by the witnesses with their statements. The learned High Court Judge

had only considered the evidence led in the trial to form his decision.

Next the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Appellant contended that the

entire judgment is a narration of witness testimonies and does not contain

any analysis.

One can see judgment writing as more of an art rather than a science.

Therefore, like art, the standard and quality of a judgment depends on the

subjectivity and individual style of the creator the judge.

In Alexander Machinery (Dudley) Ltd. v. Crabtree (1974) LCR 120 it was

observed:

"Failure to give reasons amounts to denial of justice. Reasons are live

links between the mind of the decision taker to the controversy in

question and the decision or conclusion arrived at. Reasons substitute

subjectivity by objectivity. The emphasis on recording reasons is that if

the decision reveals the "inscrutable face of the sphinx", it can, by its

silence, render it virtually impossible for the Courts to perform their

appellate function or exercise the power of judicial review in adjudging

the validity of the decision. Right to reason is an indispensable part of

a sound judicial system, reasons at least sufficient to indicate an

application of mind to the matter before Court.

CA/HCC/162 ABC/15

13

Although, the learned Presidents Counsel strenuously contended that the

judgment sans an analysis, on a careful perusal of the judgment, I conclude

that the learned High Court Judge has adequately dealt with and analyzed

the evidence presented in the trial to arrive at his conclusion.

In his final ground of appeal, the 1st Appellant argues that the learned High

Court Judge misdirected himself regarding the burden of proof which he

wrongly cast upon the Appellants.

The presumption of innocence is a cornerstone of justice, operating under

the premise that an accused individual is deemed innocent until proven

guilty. Shifting the burden of proof undermines this principle by obliging the

accused to demonstrate their innocence, thereby inverting the traditional

burden of proof. This practice can lead to unjust outcomes, as it unfairly

compels the accused to substantiate a negative assertion. Such a shift is

often regarded as inequitable, placing the onus on the accused rather than

the prosecution. Conversely, the accused may bear the legal responsibility of

refuting a statutory presumption or establishing a statutory defence or

exception to liability.

Considering the judgement of the High Court Judge, I am of the opinion that

nowhere in the judgement has the Learned High Court Judge reversed the

burden onto the Appellants obliging them to prove their innocence.

Counsels for the 2nd and 3rd Appellants jointly contended that the

prosecution has failed to prove that the Appellants had entertained common

murderous intention in committing the murder of the deceased.

Common Intention is depicted under Section 32 of the Penal Code of

Sri Lanka. It reads:

When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the

common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in

the same manner as if it were done by him alone.

CA/HCC/162 ABC/15

14

Common Intention implies a pre-arranged plan and acting in concert

pursuant to the plan. Common Intention comes into being prior to the

commission of the act, but a long gap in time need not be present. To bring

this section into effect a pre-concert is not necessary to be proved, but it may

well develop on the spot as between several persons and could be inferred

from the facts and circumstances of each case.

In The Queen v. Mahatun 61 NLR 540 the court held that:

Under section 32 of the Penal Code, when a criminal act is committed

by one of several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all,

each of them is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done

by him alone. If each of several persons commits a different criminal act

each act being in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of them

is liable for each such as if it were done by him alone.

To establish the existence of a common intention it is not essential to

prove that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to a pre-

arranged plan. A common intention can come into existence without pre-

arrangement. It can be formed on the spur of the moment.

In S. Fernando v. H. De Silva 68 NLR 166 the court held that:

In order to sustain the charge based on common intention it is essential

that both the accused persons must have participated in the offence, in

the sense that they must be physically present at or about the scene of

offence.

Although the accused did not commit any physical act, yet liability could be

imposed upon him on the basis that his presence was a participatory

presence. All these are generally established through circumstantial

evidence.

According to the evidence of PW1, adopted under Section 33 of the Evidence

Ordinance, all Appellants had come together and entered the house. A knife

CA/HCC/162 ABC/15

15

was noticed in the hand of the 1st Appellant. He had witnessed the 1st

Appellant attacking his son PW2 first.

PW2 in his evidence corroborating the evidence given by his father PW1,

stated that he ran away from the house with the help of the 2nd Accused who

opened the door for him to escape. In the meantime, when PW2 had gone

into the house armed with a mamoty to rescue the inmates of the house, the

2nd and 3rd Appellant had restrained him inside the house. The relevant

portion of the evidence is re-produced below:

Further, the 3rd Appellant in evidence had confirmed the presence of all the

Appellants at the time of the incident. The evidence clearly established that

the Appellants were together until they left the house after the horrific event.

CA/HCC/162 ABC/15

16

It is not disputed that when the 1st Appellant cut the deceased to death, the

2nd and 3rd Appellants were inside the house. They have not disassociated

until they left the house together. The knife which was used in the incident

was recovered upon the statement received from the 3rd Appellant.

The evidence presented by the prosecution had clearly established that the

Appellants were together when the incident had taken place inside the

house. The learned High Court Judge had accurately considered the evidence

presented by the prosecution that the Appellant had committed the offence

upon actuating common murderous intention.

In this case the evidence given by PW2 and PW3 are cogent and lacks any

ambiguity whatsoever. When this gruesome incident happened PW2 was

only 15 years and PW3 was only 13 years old. Their family members had

been murdered in front of them in a gruesome manner. Even though both

were children at the time of the incident, both had given evidence without

any major contradictions about the main incident. As such, the Trial Judge

is correct to conclude that the prosecution had presented a prima facie case

against the Appellants. Hence, referring to the Ellenborough dictum, the

judgement had not caused any prejudice to the Appellants.

Finally, the learned Counsel for the 2nd Appellant contended that the

contradictions highlighted are important and sufficient to affect the

credibility of PW2 and PW3. The learned High Court Judge in his judgment

had correctly considered the said contradictions and had correctly held that

the contradictions highlighted are not sufficient enough to disturb the core

of the case.

In Bandara v. The State [2001] 1 SLR 63 the Court held that:

Discrepancies and inconsistencies which do not relate to the core of the

prosecution case, ought to be disregarded especially when all

probability factors echo in favour of the version narrated by a witness.

CA/HCC/162 ABC/15

17

In this case the learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence

presented by both parties to arrive at his decision. He had properly analyzed

the evidence given by both sides in his judgment. As the evidence adduced

by the Appellants failed to create a doubt over the prosecution case, the

conclusion reached by the learned High Court Judge in this case cannot be

faulted.

As discussed under the grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellants, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating evidence against the

Appellants. The learned High Court Judge had accurately analyzed all

evidence presented by all the parties and come to a correct finding that the

Appellants were guilty of the charges levelled against them. Therefore, I

dismiss the Appeal and affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed on

them on 28.08.2015 by the learned High Court Judge of Badulla.

The appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgement to the High

Court of Badulla along with the original case record.
