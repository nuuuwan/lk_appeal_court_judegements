This is an application for Restitutio-in-integrum under Article 138 of the Constitution of

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

The Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner, Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Priyantha

Dhananjaya Dissanayake (hereinafter sometimes will be referred to as the Petitioner) has

appealed the order dated 6th of December 2022 of the High Court of Kandy, in the case No.

ARB/85/2020 against the Applicant-Petitioner-Respondent- Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes will be referred to as the Respondent). Accordingly, the Petitioner has prayed

the following,

I. Issue notice on the Respondents

Page 4 of 7

II. Set aside and/ or vacate the order dated 6/12/2022 pronounced by the learned High

Court Judge.

III. Set aside and/ or vacate the decree dated 6/12/2022 of the learned High Court Judge.

IV. Set aside and/ or vacate the order dated 29/2/2024 of the learned High Court Judge.

V. Grant relief prayed for by the Petitioner in the prayer to the Petition dated 6/2/2024

VI. Issue and grant an interim order preventing the Respondent and his Agents from

selling/auctioning the property of the Petitioner described in the schedule to the

Petition at public auction and engaging in further activities based on the auction

notice dated 13/3/2024 and /or suspending the auction described in the auction notice

dated 13/3/2024 until hearing and final determination of this application by your

Lordships Court.

VII. Grant costs and;

VIII. Grant such other and further reliefs that your Lordships Court seems meet.

The Respondent entered into a loan agreement with the Petitioner on 14th of February 2019,

for a principal amount of Rs.15,000,000.00 which also contained an arbitration agreement.

The arbitration agreement stipulated that any disputes arising from the agreement would first

be attempted to be resolved through mutual negotiation and, if unsuccessful, would be

submitted to arbitration. Having failed the initial mutual negotiation, the issue was refereed to

arbitration and an arbitral award was entered on 9th of October 2019 and both parties have

agreed to adhere to the terms of the settlement entered therein. Thereby, the Petitioner is

required to pay an amount of 26 million odd to the Respondent within the following 53

installments.

As per the terms agreed upon by both the parties, the Petitioner is obligated to pay a total sum

of Rs. 26,820,828.00 to the Respondent in 53 installments from the 25th of November 2019 to

the 25th of March 2024. However according to the Respondent, as of the 1st of November

2023, the Petitioner has only remitted Rs. 12,303,891.00. Consequently, the Respondent

initiated proceedings in the High Court of Kandy under Section 31(1) of the Arbitration Act

No. 11 of 1995 to enforce compliance with the arbitral award. Thereby, on the 18th of January

2024, the learned High Court Judge issued a writ authorizing the seizure of the Petitioner's

property and ordering payment of the outstanding amount of Rs. 14,516,936.97 (fourteen

million five lacks and sixteen thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six and ninety-seven cents)

to the Respondent.

Accordingly, the Arbitration settlement which was entered on the 9th of October 2019,

encompasses specific clauses as follows:

(1)

2019/02/14 KDLEEP1900130600

(.26,820,828.00)

In respect of the Arbitral award entered on the 9th of October 2019, the Petitioner has agreed

to pay a sum of Rs. 26,820,828.00 to any branch of Peoples Leasing and Finance PLC for

the account number KDLEEP1900130600, on or before the 25th day of every month.

Furthermore, the parties have agreed that if two consecutive installments are missed or, if the

total amount is not settled by 25th of March 2024, such failure will constitute a breach of the

settlement agreement. Consequently, the Respondent shall be entitled to enforce the arbitral

award to recover the outstanding balance, after deducting any payments made to date.

It is accepted by the Petitioner that he has come to a settlement to pay the said amount to the

Respondent before the 25th of March 2024, within 53 installments. However, it is amply

evident that the Petitioner has failed to comply with the said undertakings. Furthermore,

clause five of the arbitral award specifies the payments made as of the date when the

settlement was entered at the arbitration proceedings and does not reflect any subsequent

payments.

In the Arbitration Agreement the word used in clause five is which means up to

the date of the settlement. Therefore, legally the Respondent was entitled to obtain a writ for

such amount. Instead of the word if the word is used, the Respondent is

bound in law to make a deduction up to the date of writ of enforcement. However, it is

observed that the decree was drafted and issued on 6th of December 2022. It is a well-

accepted rule that the writ have to be in accordance with the decree entered. As per the

materials presented before me, it is evident that most of the payments claimed by the

Petitioner are subsequent to that date and it is obvious that these payments are not reflected in

the writ of execution.

However, once the writ is executed the Respondent is bound by law to give due credit to any

such payments made thereafter. Furthermore, I observe that there are certain charges such as;

check return charges, which were not duly considered by the Petitioner. When considering all

the materials presented to this court, I do not see any discrepancies as claimed by the

Petitioner.

Therefore, I do not observe any irreparable loss or prejudice to the Petitioner to invoke the

exceptional jurisdiction of Restitutio in Integrum granted to this court under Article 138 of

the Constitution of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

Hence, this application is dismissed.

No costs.
