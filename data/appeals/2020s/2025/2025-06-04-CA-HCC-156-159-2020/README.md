JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused- Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) were indicted before the

High Court of Kalutara for committing the offence of murder of one Hettige Premajiwa

alias Ranji on 23.06.2007 punishable under Section 296 read together with Section 32 of

the Penal Code as amended.

Page 3 of 14

The Prosecution led the evidence through eleven witnesses and marking productions from

P1 to P6 and thereafter closed its case. The Accused gave evidence from the dock and

called one witness in defence. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge

by judgment dated 07.09.2020, found the Accused guilty of murder and imposed the death

sentence.

Being aggrieved by the afore-mentioned conviction and the sentence, the Accused has

preferred this appeal to this Court.

The grounds of appeal as urged by the Accused are as follows;

1. The High Court has not considered the contradictions in the prosecution case

2. The Court did not properly consider the defence case.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has not properly considered the weaknesses and

the non-credibility of the Prosecution witnesses.

4. The order was given in contradiction to the evidence placed before the Court.

According to the evidence placed before the Learned High Court Judge, the prosecution

has relied on three dying declarations made by the deceased to PW1, PW3, and PW4.

Before we analysing the legal issues, it is pertinent to delve into the facts as revealed at

the trial Court.

According to PW1, Kannan Thudawage Kanthi who is the wife of the deceased, before the

incident happened on 23.06.2007, she had lodged a complaint to the Bulathsinhala Police

on 27.05.2007 about an incident of cutting the tire of the deceaseds bike by the 1st and 2nd

Accused which was settled.

Later, she had lodged another complaint to the Bulathsinhala Police on 13.06.2007 about

a threat made by the 4th Accused to PW1 that, .

However, such complaint was not investigated.

Page 4 of 14

According to her, the deceased had told her that the 4 Accused in this case have an enmity

with the deceased.

As stated by PW1, on the day in question, the deceased had left home with the equipment

and had asked PW1 not to bring lunch as usual but he would come home for lunch. Then

she had received a call around 1.15 PM saying the deceased had fallen on the estate. Then

she had managed to send her brother, Shantha Kumara, PW3, and an aunt to the scene

as she was not in a position to go because of the child.

Later, the deceased was taken in a three-wheeler by the said brother, and the aunt and

PW1 had joined her brother to take the deceased to the hospital. When she saw the

deceased, he was bleeding. Right after she got into the said three-wheeler, the deceased

had told her that Upul, Upendra, Indika, and Dora, who are the Accused in this case had

hit him.

According to her, the deceased was in a state where he could speak when he said that to

her.

Later, when the deceased was taken to the Bulathsinhala Hospital, they were asked to

take him to Horana Hospital as his condition was serious. Accordingly, he was admitted

to the Horana Hospital. Later, on the same day around 7.30 to 8 PM, the Police has

informed PW1 that her husband passed away.

According to PW3, Kannan Thudawage Shantha Kumara, when PW1 informed him about

the incident, he went to the scene, and the deceased fell lying on the middle of the road.

Then the deceased had said to PW3 that, .

Then, the deceased was taken to the hospital by a three-wheeler, and on the way, his

sister, PW1 also got into the vehicle. Then he was transferred to another hospital from

the Horana Hospital where the deceased passed away.

According to PW4, Hewage Don Nilantha Kumara, when PW1 had called one Sujith

Priyankara saying that Ranji was hit and there was no one to take him to Colombo

Hospital. Then the said Sujith Priyankara called PW4 and then he went to Horana

Hospital. When he went there, the deceased was lying on the hospital bed, then PW4

asked the deceased who did this.

Later, the deceased was taken to the hospital and passed away there.

According to the PW11, Dr. Tharaka Priyajeewa Elwitigala, the Judicial Medical Officer,

he performed the post-mortem of the deceased. There were 9 external injuries. Injury No.

1 and 2 were lacerations that had caused skull fractures. Further, injury No. 2 had caused

internal bleeding in the brain of the deceased. Injury No. 3 was a cut injury. According to

PW11, the injuries done to the head and the effect those had on the brain were the cause

of death.

Page 7 of 14

When we consider these three dying declarations made by the deceased, it is apparent

that the deceased had consistently mentioned the names of the 4 Accused to all three

witnesses. There is no doubt created about such names.

We are mindful of the opinion expressed by His Lordship H.N.G. Fernando S.P.J

regarding dying declarations in Queen vs. Anthonypillai 69 NLR 34 on 38 (also reported

in 68 CLW 57)

Apart from the medical evidence, the second important factor was the statement

made to the Police by the deceased woman. With regard to this statement the

learned Judge gave the following directions:-

" This statement is evidence. The law permits you to take into consideration

this piece of evidence. Usually a witness's evidence is tested by cross-

examination and in this case the deponent is dead. In spite of the fact that

there is no cross-examination because she is dead, still the law permits you

to examine that evidence. It is in the nature of a dying declaration. Examine

that evidence and if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, accept what

has been stated there. Do not forget that there was no other witness to the

incident and the deponent herself is not before you, the law regards her

statement as evidence in regard to the cause of death, and the

circumstances which led to her death. "

In our opinion this direction only instructed the Jury that they could act upon the

deceased's statement. But there was no caution as to the risk of acting upon the

statement of a person who is not a witness at the trial, and as to the need to

consider with special care the question whether the statement could be accepted

as true and accurate.

Page 8 of 14

This dictum was considered by His Lordship Sisira de Abrew J in Gamini Mahaarachchi

vs. The Attorney General, CA 106/2002, Decided On 22.08.2007, held that:

When a dying declaration is sought to be produced as an item of evidence against an

accused person in a criminal trial. the Trial Judge or the jury as a case may be, must

bear in mind on the following weakness;

1. Statement of the deceased person was not made under oath.

2. Statement of the deceased person has not been tested by cross-examination

vide King vs. Asirivadan Nadar 51 NLR 322 and Justin Pala vs. Queen 66 NLR

409/

3. That the person who made the dying declaration is not a witness at the trial.

As there are inherent weaknesses in a dying declaration which I have stated above,

the trial Judge or the jury as a case may be, must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt

on the following matters;

a. Whether the deceased in fact made such a statement

b. Whether the statement made by the deceased was true and accurate

c. Whether the statement made by the deceased person could be accepted

beyond reasonable doubt.

d. Whether the evidence of the witness who testifies about the dying

declaration can be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.

e. Whether the witness is telling the truth.

f. Whether the deceased was able to speak at the time the alleged declaration

was made.

g. Whether the deceased was able to identify the assailant.

(Similar legal principles related to dying declarations were considered by His Lordship

Sisira De Abrew in Ranasinghe v Attorney-General [2007], 1 S.L.R 218)

Page 9 of 14

His Lordship Ranjith Silva, J in Sigera Vs. Attorney General, 2011 (1) SLR 201 at 214

held that,

First of all this court has to decide whether the dying declaration in question was

a true and accurate one. It is only then the learned High Court Judge could be

justified in treating the dying declaration as substantive evidence against the

Appellant, which is an exception to the hearsay Rule.

Further held that;

Therefore it is seen that first and foremost a judge must apply his mind and decide

whether the dying declaration is a true and accurate statement.

Further held that,

In view of the inherent weaknesses in the dying declaration, enumerated above,

the trial judge or the jury as the case may be must be satisfied beyond reasonable

doubt on the following matters; whether the deceased in fact made such a

statement, whether the deceased was able to speak at the time the alleged

statement was made, whether the deceased was able to identify the assailant,

whether the statement made by the deceased was true and accurate, whether the

statement made by the deceased person could be accepted beyond reasonable

doubt, whether the evidence of the witness who testifies about the dying

declaration can be accepted as credible.

Applying the principles in the above judicial decisions, the Court has to consider whether

the dying declaration was true and accurate.

The main argument put forward by the Defence Counsel was that these dying declarations

were not corroborated by any other independent witnesses. The question is whether it is

a requisite to have corroborations when the Court considers dying declarations as

evidence.

Page 10 of 14

We are mindful that the defence had not disputed that the deceased had made three dying

declarations and that the witnesses were telling the truth. Further, they are not disputing

the fact that the deceased was able to identify the Accused persons.

According to Sarkar on Evidence on pages 678,

Corroboration of Dying Declaration. It is well settled that there is neither a rule

of law nor a rule of prudence which has hardened into a rule of law that a dying

declaration cannot be acted upon unless it is corroborated.

Further on page 679,

Relying on the dying declaration alone the conviction can be maintained. No

corroboration is necessary if the dying declaration is believed to be truthful one

and not vitiated in any other manner. Court must not look out for corroboration

unless it comes to a conclusion that dying declaration suffered from any infirmity

by reason of which it is necessary to look out for corroboration. The Court as a

matter of prudence has to gauge whether the statement of the deceased was the

result of either tutoring, prompting or product of his imagination. A dying

declaration is admitted in evidence on the principle of necessity. The fact that it is

not tested by cross-examination on behalf of the accused necessitates the obligation

on the Court to scrutinize these aspects. A dying declaration is an independent

piece of evidence like any other piece of evidence neither extra strong nor weak

and can be acted upon without corroboration if it found to be otherwise true and

reliable, conviction based on the evidence of doctor that the deceased was capable

of deposing and was in a fit condition and senses at the time of recording statement

would not be lightly interfered with. Doctor is an independent witness and there

is no reason for him to depose falsely.

Page 11 of 14

In Sigera Vs. Attorney General (Supra, on page 215) His Lordship Ranjith Silva, J held

that;

This cannot in my opinion prejudice the defence in any event as corroboration is

not the sine qua non in proving a dying declaration. As I have enumerated in a

different chapter of his judgment an accused can be convicted for murder based

mainly and solely on a dying declaration made by a deceased without corroboration

under certain circumstances.

The same dictum was considered by His Lordship K. Priyantha Fernando J in Athukorala

Kankanamge Susantha alias Chuti and Another vs. The Attorney General, CA/HCC/305-

306/2018 decided on 07.06.2022.

His Lordship had referred to the following Indian judgments to come to the conclusion.

Smt. Paniben Vs. State of Gujarat (1992) 2 S.C.R. 197 at page 205 207,

Though a dying declaration is entitled to great weight, it is worthwhile to note that

the accused has no power of cross-examination. Such a power is essential for eliciting

the truth as an obligation of oath could be. This is the reason the Court also insists

that the dying declaration should be of such a nature as to inspire full confidence of

the Court in its correctness. The Court has to be on guard that the statement of

deceased was not as a result of either tutoring, prompting or a product of imagination.

The Court must be further satisfied that the deceased was in a fit state of mind after

a clear opportunity to observe and identify the assailants. Once the Court is satisfied

that the declaration was true and voluntary, undoubtedly, it can base its conviction

without any further corroboration. It cannot be laid down as an absolute rule of law

that the dying declaration cannot form the sole basis of conviction unless it is

corroborated. The rule requiring corroboration is merely a rule of prudence. This Court

Page 12 of 14

has laid down in several judgments the principles governing sole basis of conviction,

which could be summed up as under:

(i) There is neither rule of law nor of prudence that dying declaration cannot

be acted upon without corroboration. Mannu Raja v. State of M.P., (1976) 2

SCR 764

(ii) If the Court is satisfied that the dying declaration is true and voluntary it

can base conviction on it, without corroboration. State of M.P. v. Ram Sagar

Yadav, AIR 1985 CS 416; Ramavati Devi v. State of Bihar, AIR 1983 CS

164.

(iii) This Court has to scrutinise the dying declaration carefully and must

ensure that the declaration is not the result of tutoring, prompting or

imagination. The deceased had opportunity to observe and identify the

assailants and was in a fit state to make the declaration. Ram Chandra

Reddy v. Public Prosecutor, AIR 1976 S.C. 1994.

(iv) Where dying declaration is suspicious it should not be acted upon without

corroborative evidence. Rasheed Beg v. State of Madhya Pradesh, [1974] 4

S.C.C. 264.

(v) Where the deceased was unconscious and could never make any dying

declaration the evidence with regard to it is to be rejected. (Kake Singh v.

State of M.P., AIR 1982 S.C. 1021)

(vi) A dying declaration which suffers from infirmity cannot form the basis of

conviction. (Ram Manorath v. State of U.P., 1981 SCC (Crl.) 531)

(vii) Merely because a dying declaration does not contain the details as to the

occurrence, it is not to be rejected. (State of Maharashtra v. Krishnamurthi

Laxmipati Naidu, AIR 1981 SC 617)

Page 13 of 14

(viii) Equally, merely because it is a brief statement, it is not be discarded. On

the contrary, the shortness of the statement itself guarantees truth.

Surajdeo Oza v. State of Bihar, AIR 1979 SC 1505)

(ix) Normally the court in order to satisfy whether deceased was in a fit mental

condition to make the dying declaration look up to the medical opinion. But

where the eye witness has said that the deceased was in a fit and conscious

state to make this dying declaration, the medical opinion cannot prevail.

(Nanahau Ram and another vs. State, AIR 1988 SC 912)

(x) Where the prosecution version differs from the version as given in the dying

declaration, the said declaration cannot be acted upon. (State of U.P. v.

Madan Mohan, AIR 1989 S.C. 1519)

Jayabalan Vs. U.T. of Pondicherry (2009) 15 (ADDL) S.C.R. 736

19. With regard to the issue of dying declaration raised by the appellant, it is well

established legal position that a dying declaration can be made the sole basis of

conviction of an accused provided the dying declaration is found to be true and

voluntary and is not a result of tutoring or prompting or a product of imagination.

This Court in the case of Paniben vs. State of Gujarat (1992) 2 SCC 474 has

succinctly summarized the law on the on the point as follows in para 18.

In the instant application, according to the medical evidence, the deceased may have had

the ability to speak. Further, we note that the defence never challenged the evidence of

PW1, PW3, and PW4 on the fact that the deceased made the dying declarations. They

challenged such depositions on corroboration. As I mentioned earlier, if the Court believes

that the said dying declarations were made by the deceased and he was able to speak,

identify the assailants, in fact it was true and accurate, there is no reason for us to

Page 14 of 14

overturn the decision of the High Court Judge who had accepted the dying declaration as

evidence against the Accused.

Another ground urged by the Accused was that the injuries caused to the deceased were

in result of a fall from a moving vehicle. We are mindful that the medical evidence

establishes that the deceased had two defence injuries namely injury no. 6 which was a

stab injury.

Considering the totality of the evidence, we are of the view that the Learned High Court

Judge had arrived at the correct finding.

Therefore, we affirm the judgment delivered by the Learned High Court Judge on

23.06.2007.

The appeal of the Accused-Appellant is accordingly dismissed.
