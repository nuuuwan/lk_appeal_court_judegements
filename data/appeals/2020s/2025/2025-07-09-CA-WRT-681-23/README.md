JUDGEMENT

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J

Introduction

1. According to the journal entry dated 13.02.2025, the respondents were

granted time to file their objections and this has been set for argument

for 20.06.2025. However, the respondents have failed to file the

objections as permitted. The learned State Counsel informed that the

1st and 2nd respondents have not filed written objections but would

make legal submissions. The learned Counsel for the petitioner did

object to hearing the State Counsel. However, overruling the same, the

matter was taken up for argument.

2. The petitioner is seeking a writ of certiorari to quash a purported

decision, that is said to appear on document A-11, to certify the name

of the 3rd respondent as the owner of the permit and to quash the

registration of the ownership of the 3rd respondent by prayer (d); a writ

of mandamus is sought to compel the 1st respondent to cancel the

registration of the ownership of the 3rd respondent by prayer (e); and

also to compel the holding of an inquiry to determine the lawful

successor of the deceased Vidana Pathiranage Gimarahamy for the

succession rights subject to the land upon summoning the petitioner

and the 4th respondent.

WRT/0681/23

Facts

3. The original grantee of the grant issued under Section 19(4) of the Land

Development Ordinance (hereinafter referred to as the LDO) was

Vidana Pathiranage Gimarahamy (A-1). The said grantee died on

09.01.1994. There was no successor nominated. The Divisional

Secretary upon an inquiry determined the 3rd respondent to be the

successor. The petitioner is not person coming within the Third

Schedule but claims to be a relative to whom the grantee is alleged to

have handed over possession of the corpus in or around 1987. It is the

petitioners position that Gimarahamy promised to transfer the said

land with the sanction of the Divisional Secretary to the petitioner. The

petitioner also claims to have developed the land by cultivating

cinnamon since then.

4. The 3rd respondent is a daughter of the original owner/grantee. The 4th

respondent is the grandson, and his father Piyasena was the eldest son

of Gimarahamy. Piyasena died on 10.09.1999. The petitioner alleges

that the 3rd respondent began to disturb her possession and then a

matter has in fact been instituted under Section 66(1) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act. The learned Primary Court Judge has granted

the order in favour of the petitioner who then had continued to be in

possession.

5. Then, at some point of time, on an application of the 3rd respondent,

the 1st respondent (being the Divisional Secretary) held an inquiry to

determine the succession upon the demise of the grantee Gimarahamy.

The 1st respondent held the inquiry upon summoning the 3rd

respondent and the petitioner. Thereafter, by letter A-11 dated

09.06.2023, the 1st respondent had informed that the said land would

devolve to the 3rd respondent on basis of succession in accordance with

the Third Schedule, as amended by Act No. 11 of 2022. The petitioner

is now challenging the same.

WRT/0681/23

6. When this matter was taken up, the learned State Counsel appearing

for the 1st and 2nd respondents took up the legal objections that the

petitioner lacks locus standi, that necessary parties have not been

named, that the alleged decision to be quashed is not annexed or

produced and that the document A-11 does not contain a decision.

Applicable law

7. The petitioners primary argument is that the Divisional Secretary erred

in applying the provisions of the LDO as amended by Act No. 11 of 2022

in determining the issue of succession. Assuming that A-11 refers to a

decision, it is if at all the finding that the 3rd respondent is the successor

to the said holding based on the provisions of the LDO as amended by

Act No. 11 of 2022. The learned Counsel for the petitioner argued that

the determination of the successor in accordance with the Third

Schedule as amended by the Act No. 11 of 2022 is erroneous. This Act

amended the original Schedule and the order of succession. Prior to the

amendment, the eldest male son was the preferred successor. However,

upon the amendment, the eldest child was considered, whereby the

gender bias was rectified. Mr. Muthukumarana for the petitioner

argued that as reflected in paragraph 2 of A-11, the determination of

the successor had been made on the provisions of the LDO as amended

by Act No. 11 of 2022. As the original permit holder died in 1994, he

argues that the pre-amended provisions were applicable and the eldest

surviving son should be the legitimate successor. The 4th respondent

happens to be the son of Piyasena, the eldest son of Gimarahamy.

Piyasena was living at the time of Gimarahamys death but died

subsequently without seeking nomination.

8. The 3rd respondent, Seelawathi is the eldest surviving child, but is a

daughter Piyasena, being the eldest son of Gimarahamy, though

younger to the 3rd respondent, happened to be the eldest surviving male

successor at the time of the death of Gimarahamy. As such it is the

petitioners position that determining the 3rd respondent to be the

WRT/0681/23

Page 5 of 11

successor is contrary to the provisions of the LDO read with the Third

Schedule as it prevailed at the time of the death of the original

owner/grantee in 1994.

9. The primary challenge and the complaint of the petitioner is that the

applicable law as considered by the 1st respondent is erroneous. The

Divisional Secretary has applied the provisions of the LDO as amended

by Act No. 11 of 2022. This was the law as it stood at the point of

determining the issue of succession in 2023. What the learned Counsel

for the petitioner argues is that the applicable law should be the law as

it stood on the date of the death of the owner/grantee.

10. Succession under the LDO is different and distinct from the succession

by an heir to a deceased persons estate under the general law. The right

to inherit to the inheritance by an heir is governed by the general law,

the Roman Dutch law principles. The basic principle is that upon the

death of the testator, the right to inherit accrues to the heirs immediately

with the death of such testator. Thus, be it testate or intestate

succession, the heirs step into the shoes of the testator immediately

upon the death of the owner of the property. This had been reiterated in

Wijayawardane vs. Malini Wijayawardane [1999] 3 SLR 130 and also

in Mohamed v. Public Trustee [1978-79-80] 1 Sri LR 1.

11. The petitioner, in their written submission, specifically submits that the

law applicable to the entitlement of the heirs should be considered on law

as it prevailed as at the date of the death of the testator. The petitioner

appears to base this submission and argument on the general law

principles of succession. However, succession under the LDO is

governed by the provisions of the LDO and the legal regime applicable to

intestate/testate succession by heirs has no application. This is

specifically provided for by Section 170, which reads as follows:

170.(1) No written law (other than this Ordinance) which provides

for succession to land upon an intestacy and no other law relating

WRT/0681/23

Page 6 of 11

to succession to land upon an intestacy shall have any application

in respect of any land alienated under this Ordinance.

(2) No person shall, by virtue of any appointment in any last will,

have or acquire any title to succeed to any land alienated under

this Ordinance save and except a successor duly nominated by

last will under the provisions of Chapter VII.

12. The relevant consideration under the LDO is not inheritance, but

succession. Succession takes three forms: firstly, the permit holder or

grantee/owner may nominate a successor; secondly, the spouse of a

permit-holder or owner has a statutory right to succeed on the basis of

his/her life interest; and finally, in the absence of any express

nomination and the failure of a spouse to succeed, the persons in rule 1

of the Third Schedule of the LDO are entitled to be named as successor.

In the present application, no nomination had been made by the owner.

Therefore, it will come within the final category. The legal issue for

determination in this application is whether provisions of the LDO as

amended by Act No. 11 of 2022 is applicable in this instance. According

to the petitioner, as the original permit holder died on 09.01.1994, the

law of succession as it prevailed then is applicable. As opposed to that,

the Divisional Secretary, following the instructions and the Circular of

the Land Commissioner General, bearing no. 2022/04 (annexed to A-

12) has applied the provisions as amended by Act No. 11 of 2022.

13. In respect of succession under the LDO, especially where no nomination

had been made, the Divisional Secretary is required to determine the

succession as per the Third Schedule. It is evident that the Divisional

Secretary is vested with a discretion to determine and nominate the

successor according to the subjoined table to the rules of succession

under the Third Schedule of the LDO. It is only upon such nomination

that such successor will acquire the right, title, and interest to such land

under the permit or the grant. Therefore, the applicable law to determine

WRT/0681/23

Page 7 of 11

the successor should be the law as it prevails at the time of making such

determination, and not as at the date of the demise of the original owner

or permit holder. When the person entitled to succeed is so determined

in view of the provisions of Section 73 the title to the said land will be

deemed to have devolved on such person from the date of the death of

the permit holder or the owner. Section 73 reads as follows:

73. Title to a land alienated on a permit or to a holding shall be

deemed to have devolved on any person entitled to succeed to the

land or holding under the provisions of section 72 as from the date

of the death of the permit-holder or owner of the holding if such

permit-holder or owner died without leaving behind his or her

spouse, or, if such permit-holder or owner died leaving behind his

or her spouse, upon the failure of such spouse to succeed or from

the date of the death of such spouse, as the case may be.

14. A deeming provision imputes an attribute which otherwise is not there.

It is a legal fiction. Section 73 ensures the continuity of title from the

date of death of the permit holder/owner up until the succession. This

provision further confirms that the successor to an LDO permit or grant

acquires and assumes right, title, and interest only upon the nomination

being accepted and confirmed by the Divisional Secretary. This puts it

beyond doubt that the right to succession under the LDO does not

accrue to such successor until and unless it is so determined by the

Divisional Secretary and entered upon the relevant land ledger, and

accordingly registered. Section 73 had been enacted to provide for the

absence of title during the intervening period between the death and the

determination of succession. Therefore, Section 73 further confirms that

succession by persons referred to in the Third Schedule will be operative

only upon the Divisional Secretary accepting and registering the same.

In these circumstances, in determining succession under the Third

Schedule under Section 72, when a successor has not been nominated

or when the nominated successor fails to succeed, the applicable law is

the law as it stands on the date of considering such succession by the

WRT/0681/23

Page 8 of 11

Divisional Secretary. Therefore, to my mind, the instructions contained

in the said Circular of the Land Commissioner General, bearing no.

2022/04 (annexed to A-12), is in accordance with the aforesaid, and the

Divisional Secretary determining the succession in accordance with the

amended provisions of the Third Schedule is correct and lawful.

Accordingly, the argument advanced on behalf of the petitioner in this

regard is misconceived.

Locus standi

15. The next argument advanced is that the 4th respondent being the heir

of the eldest son of the owner ought to have been called for an inquiry

by the Divisional Secretary. The petitioner submits that the entitlement

of the 4th respondent, who is a grandchild of the owner, if at all, would

be on the pre-amended provisions of the LDO. Even if that be so, I

observe that the 4th respondent appears to have abandoned his right to

succession and declined. This is evident by the petitioners written

statements tendered at the said inquiry, where the petitioners

specifically state that the 4th respondent declined to succeed. The said

statement is annexed to A-12, in which the petitioner has stated as

follows: ...,

( ...),

. ,

. .

16. The said Nihal Wanniarachchi, son of Piyasena Wanniarachchi, is the

4th respondent. For all purposes, if the persons in the line of succession

specified in the Third Schedule are unwilling to succeed, the Divisional

Secretary is required to name the next in line to be the successor in

respect of the said land. This is provided for by rule 04 of the Third

Schedule, which is as follows: If any relative on whom the title to a

holding devolves under the provisions of these rules is unwilling to

WRT/0681/23

Page 9 of 11

succeed to such holding, the title thereto shall devolve upon the relative

who is next entitled to succeed under the provisions of rule 1.

17. As admitted by the petitioner, the 4th respondent has been unwilling to

succeed. Accordingly, even if it is assumed that the law as it stood prior

to the Amendment is applicable, yet for all, on the own assertion of the

petitioner, the 4th respondent had been unwilling to succeed. As such,

the Divisional Secretarys determination to nominate the 3rd respondent

will thus be in accordance with the rules and provisions of law applicable

to succession under the LDO and be lawful and correct.

18. On the other hand, the petitioner does not claim to be a person entitled

to succession within the table of the Third Schedule. Her apparent basis

of making a claim or interest is being in possession and developing the

land, and the alleged promise of the original grantee to transfer the

property with the consent of the Divisional Secretary. The prejudice that

is caused to the petitioner, as submitted by the learned Counsel, is that

the petitioner is now liable to be evicted, unless the 4th respondent is

nominated as successor, who according to the petitioner, has intimated

his willingness to convey his interest in the corpus to the petitioner. The

petitioner by this application is seeking the indulgence of this Court for

a mandamus directing the 1st respondent to summon the 4th respondent

and hold an inquiry and to determine the issue of succession afresh.

The petitioner does not claim to be entitled to succession under the Third

Schedule. The petitioner claims her entitlement on an alleged promise

of the original grantee and the 4th respondent. In these circumstances,

the petitioner has no status to participate in proceedings pertaining to

the determination of successors.

19. Further, the petitioner is now seeking a fresh inquiry with the

participation of the 4th respondent. In effect, the petitioner is attempting

to make this application for and on behalf of the 4th respondent as to

succession. As the petitioner does not have any right to succession, the

petitioner does not have locus standi to prefer this application in the

WRT/0681/23

Page 10 of 11

present form and seek the relief in the manner as done. Therefore, I hold

that the petitioner lacks locus standi and is not entitled to have and

maintain this application.

Prejudice

20. It is settled law that if there be no prejudice, no writ would issue. The

determination of succession to title under the LDO is a matter, if at all,

between the issues of the deceased Gimarahamy. The petitioner,

admittedly, is neither an heir nor does she come within the table of the

Third Schedule. The tenor, effect, and import of the averments and the

relief sought is to obtain a fresh inquiry with the participation of the 4th

respondent. The learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that

prejudice would be caused to the petitioner if she is evicted upon an

application made by the 3rd respondent at a future point of time. He also

did submit that there is an understanding between the petitioner and

the 4th respondent to transfer any interest the 4th respondent may

receive to the petitioner. The issue for determination and decision is the

right of succession under the Third Schedule of the LDO. The petitioner,

not being entitled to succeed under the Third Schedule, cannot claim to

be prejudiced due to a determination on the issue of succession under

the LDO. At this point therefore, in the absence of prejudice, the

petitioner is not entitled to a writ as prayed for (Seneviratne and Others

vs. Urban Council of Kegalle and Others (2001) 3 Sri L.R. 105).

21. On the perusal of the totality of the pleadings and documents, it is also

apparent that the petitioner, in collusion with the 4th respondent, is now

attempting to abuse the process of this Court to obtain a relief to which

the petitioner is not entitled and has no standing. Writ jurisdiction is an

extraordinary discretionary power of this Court. Persons seeking such a

remedy should necessarily come with clean hands. As I observe, this is

a dubious attempt to abuse the process of this Court. The petitioner in

this circumstance has failed to prove legal right and standing to have

and maintain this application. Thus, the petitioner is not entitled to the

WRT/0681/23

Page 11 of 11

as relief prayed for and to have and maintain this application.

Accordingly this application is refused and is hereby dismissed.

22. As I am of the opinion as there is an attempt by the petitioner to abuse

the process of Court, this application is dismissed subject to State costs

in a sum of Rs. 5,000/=.
