Accordingly, the Respondents are restrained from arresting or taking any action against the Petitioner in the aforesaid case before the learned Magistrate. Moreover, the interim orders were issued subject to a travel ban imposed on the Petitioner. Thereafter, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner sought permission for the Petitioner to leave to Singapore for medical treatment. Since the State has objected to such application the matter was fixed for inquiry. After inquiry, this Court permitted the Petitioner to travel to Singapore for medical treatment. It is born out from the case record that the Petitioner has with permission of this Court travelled on two or more occasions to Singapore for medical treatment and returned to the island. In those circumstances, it appears to this court that it is reasonable and appropriate to allow this application. The attention of this Court is drawn to the report filed by the Judicial Medical Officer dated 17/02/2025 wherein it is stated that rehabilitation, physiotherapy can be done in Sri Lanka. Since the surgeries have already been performed in Singapore, it is appropriate to obtain rehabilitation and physiotherapy in Singapore as well.",
