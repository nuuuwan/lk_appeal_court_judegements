D. Thotawatte, J.

The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as theRespondent) privately filed information by an affidavit dated 8th March 2018 under

3

Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 (hereinaftersometimes referred to as the PCPA), in the Magistrate Court of Kegalle alleging that theRespondent-Petitioner-Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as theAppellants) had, on 4th and 5th March 2018, unlawfully obstructed a 15-foot-wideroadway running through the Appellants lands Dangolla and Thunmuduna which theRespondent claims to have utilized for more than a decade to access his familys landknown as Kapukotuwa Hena, thereby precipitating the risk of a breach of the peacebetween the parties.

The Respondent has explicitly claimed prescriptive rights over this roadway and sought,inter alia, removal of the obstruction. The learned Magistrate issued notice on the 1st

Appellant, with the 2nd Appellant subsequently intervening as a party to the case.Thereafter, all parties have filed affidavits and attachments supporting and opposing therespective positions.

The Appellants, although accepting that the Respondents mother owns Lot No. 01 ofKapukotuwa Hena, denied the existence of any such right as described by theRespondent and maintained that the roadway traversing Dangolla and Thunmudunaundivided lands belonging to the Appellants family were intended solely for the use offamily members. Appellants had further asserted that the Respondents mothersproperty was accessible by an alternative roadway. The Appellants had also contendedthat there was no likelihood of a breach of the peace, as the police inquiring into acomplaint by the Respondent had not filed information in court, reflecting the absence ofan actual breach of the peace.

The learned Magistrate, acting as the Primary Court Judge, after the conclusion of theinquiry, had delivered the Order on 24th July 2018, granting reliefs prayed by theRespondent, declaring that the Petitioner (Respondent in the instance case) is entitled tothe right of way for the time being and ordering the Appellants to remove all obstacles.

Being dissatisfied with the order of the learned Magistrate of Kegalle, the Appellantsinvoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of Kegalle by petition dated 30th July2018. On 09th August 2018, the High Court dismissed their application in limine, holdingthat no exceptional circumstances existed to justify intervention. Aggrieved by the saidorder of the Learned High Court Judge of Kegalle, the Appellants had preferred theinstant appeal challenging both the Primary Court and High Court orders to the Court ofAppeal.

4

The main grounds upon which the Appellants preferred the revision application to theHigh Court of Kegalle are as follows:

1. Jurisdictional Error

Whether the learned Primary Court Judge acted within the ambit of Section66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, No. 44 of 1979, in entertaining theRespondents private information and proceeding to make orders in the absenceof a police report confirming a likelihood of breach of the peace.

2. Absence of a Proper Prayer

The learned Judges of the Primary Court and the High Court erred in law ingranting relief not prayed for by the Respondent, who had merely sought removalof the obstruction, without claiming any right of way or a right in the nature ofservitude under Section 69 of the said Act.

3. Lack of Locus Standi

The Respondent in the Primary Court had no locus standi to maintain theapplication, as the alleged dominant tenement was owned by his mother, and heneither claimed nor instituted proceedings as her representative.

4. Failure to Consider Evidence and Objections

The learned Judges failed to properly evaluate the preliminary objections,affidavits, and submissions filed by the Appellants, disregarded the documentmarked X, and failed to address the position relating to the alternative access.

The Appellant has based his Appeal to the Court of Appeal on substantially the samegrounds as above together with the additional ground that the learned High Court Judgeerred in failing to appreciate that the cumulative effect of the errors (as perceived by theAppellant) listed in paragraph 12 of the petition submitted to the High Court, whichconstituted exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction.

Jurisdictional Error

The Appellants contend that the police, having investigated, did not file information andhad observed no obstruction, which would indicate there was no likelihood of a breach ofthe peace, and as such, the learned Magistrate did not have jurisdiction to entertain therespondents application. However, jurisprudence recognises that the jurisdiction of the

5

Primary Court is not ousted by police inaction. In Velupillai and Others v. Sivanathan,1itwas observed that when private information is filed without a police report, theMagistrate should proceed cautiously, but nevertheless has jurisdiction. Thus, theabsence of a police report does not negate jurisdiction, though it heightens the duty ofscrutiny. However, the heightened duty of scrutiny in the observation appears to bereferable to section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law, where the Magistratesjurisdiction depended on his own satisfaction that a dispute was likely to cause a breachof the peace.

His Lordship Justice Samayawardana traced the statutory evolution in Jayasinghe andOthers vs. Loku Bandara.2 Under Section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law No.44 of1973, which is comparable to Section 66 of the PCPA, Jurisdiction was conferred only ifthe Magistrate himself had reason to believe a breach of the peace was likely.

Inquiriesinto disputesaffectinglands.

62(1)Whenever a Magistrate, on information furnished by anypolice officer or otherwise, has reason to believe that theexistence of a dispute affecting any land situated withinhis jurisdiction is likely to cause a breach of the peace, hemay issue a notice

(a)fixing a date for the holding of an inquiry into thedispute; and

(b)requiring every person concerned in the dispute toattend at such inquiry and to furnish to the court,on or before the date so fixed, a written statementsetting out his claim in respect of actual possessionof the land or the part in dispute and in respect ofany right which is the subject of the dispute.

(emphasis is mine)

Without this belief, jurisdiction did not arise. However, in subsection (2) of Section 66 ofthe PCPA (which replaced section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law), expresslystates that once information is filed, the Primary Court shall have and is hereby vested

1(1993) 1 SLR 1232[2019] 2 SLR 202/ CA PHC-76-2018

6

with jurisdiction to inquire into, and make a determination or order. The Keydifference under the present law is that whoever files the information, the Magistrate isautomatically vested with jurisdiction to inquire into and determine the matter; there is norequirement for the Magistrate to independently assess whether a breach of the peace isthreatened.

Further, in Jayasinghe and Others vs. Loku Bandara,3His Lordship Justice Samayawardana,addressing the appellants preliminary objection on jurisdiction, has stated:

Breach of the peace does not mean fisticuffs, grievous hurt or attempted murder. It issufficient if there is a present fear that there will be a breach of the peace stemmingfrom the dispute unless the Court takes control of the matter.

In Ananda Sarath Paranagama V Dhammadhinna Sarath Paranagama and others,4 theCourt also reiterated Bonser C.J.s dictum in Perera v. Gunathilake5, stressing that Courtsmust discourage the resort to force in the assertion of civil rights, since even minorquarrels can escalate to serious violence:

In a country like this, any attempt of parties to use force in themaintenance of their rights should be promptly discouraged. Slight brawlsreadily blossom into riots with grievous hurt and murder as the fruits. It is,therefore, all the more necessary that Courts should be strict indiscountenancing all attempts to use force in the assertion of such civilrights.

Considering the facts and circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that there existed areal likelihood of a breach of the peace at the time the Magistrate issued summons onthe appellant pursuant to the first information filed by the Respondent.

Absence of a Proper Prayer

It is the position of the Appellant that the Respondent, in his prayer in the informationsubmitted to the Magistrates Court, had not expressly requested a declaration that he isentitled to the specific right; the learned Magistrate could not have made an orderstating that the Respondent is entitled to the right of way.

The Appellants submit that, in the absence of a prayer under Section 69(1) of the PCPA,the Primary Court lacked competence to order the removal of obstructions under Section69(2). Reliance was placed on the observation of Her Ladyship Madawala, J. In H.A.Prasanji Thusitha Kumara Dias & N.L.D.G. Uthika Dias vs Hettiarachchige Dias & JasinthuHewage Kalyanawathie Dias, 6where the Magistrate erred in ordering restoration ofpossession when such relief was not sought. In support of this position, the Appellant hasfurther cited Surangi vs Rodrigo,7 a divorce case. However, in Surangi, the basis wasthat Section 40(e) of the Civil Procedure Code requires the plaint to contain a demand forthe relief claimed.

While the general rule is that courts cannot grant relief outside the prayer, Sri Lankanjurisprudence does recognise limited exceptions, particularly where:

1. Incidental or consequential relief is necessary to give full effect to the main relief

sought.2. Equity and justice demand intervention, even if the precise wording of the prayer

does not cover it.

However, this proposition has since been revisited. In Eshan Abeywickrama Danapala v.Kalupahana Mesthrige Ariyasena and Another,8His Lordship Justice Janak de Silva clarifiedthat, in applications under Section 66(1)(b) of the PCPA, it is not incumbent upon thepetitioner to specifically pray for restoration of possession. The statutory duty imposedon the Magistrate includes determining and declaring the party entitled to possession,irrespective of whether the relief is expressly prayed for.

Commenting on the decision in Dias and another v. Dias and another9, His LordshipJustice Janak de Silva has stated;

with the greatest respect to their lordships in Dias and another v. Diasand another (supra), I hold that in a private information filed under Section66(1)(b) of the Act it is not incumbent on the petitioner to specifically pray

6H.A. Prasanji Thusitha Kumara Dias & N.L.D.G. Vthika Dias v. Hettiarachchige Dias &Jasinthu Hewage Kalyanawathie Dias, (Short citation - Dias and another v. Dias and another) CA Rev. Appl. No. 63/2016, C.A.M. 12.08.20167[2003] 3 SLR 0358CA PHC 215/2015, C.A.M 31.01.20209supra

for restoration to possession. That is a relief that the learned Primary CourtJudge is under a statutory duty to consider and grant after due inquiry..

In keeping with the reasoning that goes back to Ramalingam v. Thangarajah10 andKanagasabai v. Mylvaganam11, Her Ladyship Murdu N.B. Fernando, PC. J (as she was then)stated in R.Malkanthi Silva v. L.G.R.N. Perera12:

Thus, I have no hesitation in holding that the scheme embodied in Part VIIof the Primary Courts Procedure Act is geared to achieve the object ofprevention of a breach of the peace. The action taken by a Magistrate ispurely preventive in nature. The orders made by the Magistrate is a stop-gap step and provisional, pending final adjudication before a competentcivil court with regard to the rights of the parties.

Confirming that the function of the Primary Court under Part VII of the PCPA is essentiallypreventive and not dependent upon technical pleading. Thus, the absence of a specificprayer does not, in my view, vitiate the jurisdiction or competence of the Primary Courtunder Section 66 of the PCPA to determine possession or a right.

Lack of Locus Standi

In the application to the High Court of Kegalle, the Appellants had challenged the Lack ofLocus Standi of the Respondent on the grounds that the Respondent, being the owner ofthe dominant tenement, is a prerequisite to initiate proceedings in an action for right ofway. In the written submissions filed by the Appellant dated 16th January 2014, theAppellant is relying on and quoting from Velupillai v. Subasinghe and another13 hassubmitted that ...It is submitted that a servitude cannot be granted by any other thanthe owner of a servient tenement, nor acquired by any other than by him who owns theadjacent tenement... "

Velupillai v. Subasinghe and another is a civil case under principles of Roman-Dutch lawas applied in Sri Lanka, specifically dealing with praedial servitudes and the right of alessee to claim or acquire a servitude by prescription or necessity.

The jurisdiction established by Section 66 of the PCPA is preventive and regulatory ratherthan adjudicatory in the sense of finally determining ownership. The Courts role is toensure peace and order in society while leaving substantive civil rights to be determinedby competent civil courts. By contrast, praedial servitudes are substantive real rights inproperty law, attached to a dominant tenement and burdening a servient tenement.Section 66 of the PCPA and praedial servitudes under Roman-Dutch law are grounded indifferent legal regimes.

In Nimalasena Jayakody v. Mallikaratne and Others14, it was held that the relevant inquiryis not one of servitude as recognised under Roman-Dutch property law, but with regardto whether there exists a dispute affecting land as defined in Section 75 of the PCPA,which includes disputes over rights in the nature of a servitude. As such, the notionthat there exists a requirement to establish ownership or prescriptive title ismisconceived.

This challenge by the Appellant appears to arise from a persistent effort to mergeconcepts belonging to two distinct branches of law, which would undermine the purposefor which the PCPA was enacted. As such, the contention of the Appellant that theRespondent lacks Locus Standi is unattainable.

Failure to Consider Evidence and Objections

The allegation that the learned Judges failed to properly evaluate preliminary objectionsand affidavits is unfounded. It is evident that both the Primary Court and the High Courtcorrectly considered the pleadings and affidavits in light of the preventive purpose of PartVII of the PCPA. The High Courts duty in considering the revision application was limitedto examining the legality of the Primary Courts order, not to rehear or re-evaluateevidence in detail.15

The contention that such evidence was disregarded cannot stand in view of the recordedreasoning of both Courts. The position of the Appellants that the Courts erred indisregarding document X is devoid of merit, as it was belatedly introduced at the stageof final submissions without being mentioned in the affidavits. The Primary Court rightlyrejected it as inadmissible, as allowing its inclusion would have prejudiced theRespondent.

The Appellant has further argued that the learned Magistrate and the learned High CourtJudge have not considered the existence of an alternate road access to the Respondent'smothers land. However, such arguments pertain to substantive civil rights, such as whenclaiming a servitude of necessity and thus fall outside the preventive and provisionalscope of Section 74 of the PCPA. Questions of alternative access or servitude of necessityare for District Court adjudication, not for Primary Court proceedings.

In R. Malkanthi Silva v. Perera (deceased) and others,16 the Appellant likewise argued thatthe Respondent had other roadways. The Supreme Court, while not expressly ruling onthe necessity issue, upheld recognition of the Respondents right of way, implicitlyaffirming that the existence of alternative access does not defeat such entitlement.

Exceptional Circumstances

In Aysha Hameed and others Vs. Mohomed Mohideen Shaul Hameed and others17, HisLordship Prasantha De Silva, J. has stated:

It is trite law that revision is an extraordinary jurisdiction vested in AppellateCourts, which can be exercised under exceptional circumstances, if no otherremedy is available. Since revision is a discretionary remedy, it will not beavailable unless the application discloses circumstances which shock theconscience of Court.

It has been held in the case Rustom Vs Hapangama [ 1978-1979 2 SLR 225]that court can intervene by way of a revision even where right of appeal isavailable but the revisionary jurisdiction can only be invoked under exceptionalcircumstances. and as to what such exceptional circumstances are isdependent on the facts of each case.

In the instant case, the Appellant is relying upon the cumulative effect of the perceiveddefects in the orders of the subordinate courts. The Appellant has been unable toestablish any Jurisdictional Error, Illegality, miscarriage of justice, unreasonableness,abuse of process or a Violation of natural justice; as such, the learned High Court Judgewas correct in ruling that the Appellant had failed to establish the required exceptionalcircumstances justifying the intervention of the High Court.

In my view, the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge are justified in theirconclusions, and thus, I do not see merit in any of the grounds urged by the learned

Counsel for the Appellant to interfere with the decision of the learned Magistrate ofKegalle or the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle. I accordingly affirm the order of thelearned Magistrate of Kegalle dated 24th July 2018 and the judgment of the learned HighCourt Judge of Kegalle dated 09th August 2018 and dismiss the appeal with costs.
