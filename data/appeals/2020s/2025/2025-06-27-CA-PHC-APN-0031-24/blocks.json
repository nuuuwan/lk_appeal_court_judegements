Polwatte vs. The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and Others (supra). As already observed by us, when deciding the above case, this Court had never intended to impose an additional requirement of submitting a written directive given by the commission when forwarding an indictment by the Director General CIABOC to High Court other than following the provision already identified under section 12 (1) and (2) of the CIABOC Act. If the Director General is directed under section 11 of the CIABOC Act by the CIABOC to forward an indictment, he is only bound to follow the provisions of section 12 (1) and (2) of the CIABOC Act. In the absence of any complaint that the Director General CIABOC had failed to comply with sections 12 (1) and (2) of the CIABOC Act when forwarding the indictment before the High Court at Bar, it is correct in refusing the jurisdictional objection raised on behalf of the 2nd accused before the High Court at Bar. The trial Judge before whom the indictment is filed is therefore bound to accept the indictment and take up the trial unless there is material to establish that Director General CIABOC had failed to comply with the provisions of section 12 (1) and (2) of the CIABOC Act. Any party who intends to challenge an indictment forwarded by the Director General CIABOC on the basis that the CIABOC had failed to comply with section 11 of the CIABOC Act, the said challenge would only be raised in an appropriate action filed before an appropriate forum.",

Don Caster Amalgamated Collieres Ltd (1940) AC 1014, 1023 in the words: \"If the choice is between two interpretations, the narrower of which would fail to achieve the manifest purpose of the legislation, we should avoid a construction which would reduce the legislature to futility and should rather accept the bolder construction based on the view that parliament would legislate only for the purpose of bringing about an effective result.\" Lord Reid enunciated the same view in Luke Vs. Inland Revenue Commissioner (1963) 1 ALL ER 655, 664 \"How then are we to resolve this difficulty? To apply the word literally is to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature and to produce a wholly unreasonable result. To achieve the obvious intention and produce a reasonable result, we should do some violence to the words. This is not a new problem... The general principle is well",
