ORDER

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J

1. The petitioner has tendered an amended petition to which the

respondents objected, and this order is in respect of the said objection.

2. The petitioner by his original application, sought the following

substantive relief: a writ of certiorari quashing the proceedings of the

Branch of the Debt Conciliation Board holden in Kurunegala,

WRT/0400/24

Page 4 of 10

application bearing No. 43018; a writ of certiorari quashing the Order

dated 04.10.2023 made in the Branch of the Debt Conciliation Board

holden in Kurunegala, application bearing No. 43018 produced marked

P8 and/or any consequential orders made thereafter in the said

Branch of the Debt Conciliation Board, including the Order dated

08.05.2024 marked P10; and a writ of prohibition preventing any

further proceedings being conducted in the Branch of the Debt

Conciliation Board holden in Kurunegala, application bearing No.

43018.

3. The petitioner also sought the following interim relief: an interim order

until the final hearing and determination of this application, staying the

operation of the Order dated 04.10.2023, made in the Branch of the

Debt Conciliation Board holden in Kurunegala, application bearing No.

43018 and/or any consequential Orders made thereafter in the said

Branch of the Debt Conciliation Board including the Order dated

08.05.2024; and an interim order until the final hearing and

determination of this application, staying the conducing of any further

proceedings of the Branch of the Debt Conciliation Board holden in

Kurunegala application bearing No. 43018.

4. Though this application was filed on 24.06.2024, this is yet to be

supported. No interim relief had been granted up until now. After the

initial filing of the application, the Debt Conciliation Board issued

several more orders. Consequently, the petitioner filed an amended

petition on 29.04.2025, which included the following subsequent

documents, and several new prayers for writs to quash the same:

further objections dated 23.07.2024 (P10A);

the Board's Order dated 30.10.2024 (P10B) rejecting those

objections;

a certificate issued under section 32(2) of the Debt Conciliation

Board Act dated 20.11.2024 (P11); and

WRT/0400/24

Page 5 of 10

a letter dated 08.01.2025 (P12) from the Board to the Kegalle

Land Registry to register P11. The amended petition also

expanded the reliefs sought to include quashing P10B, P11, and

P12 and staying their operation.

5. The 1st and 2nd respondents objected to the amended petition, on the

basis that the petitioner was attempting to alter the causes of by

introducing new facts and documents that arose after the initial filing

of this application. They contended that this would bring in a new cause

of action, that has arisen after the institution of this application. Citing

Kusala Hasanthi Perera and another vs. Gayantha Karunatilleke

and others, CA/WRIT/224/2017, it was argued that a different cause

of action that accrued after the date of filing the application cannot be

allowed to be brought in by way of an amended petition.

6. The petitioner, by written submissions dated 29.07.2025, submits that

the precedents relied upon by the respondents is not applicable because

the proposed amended petition was filed before formal notice was

issued. The petitioner maintained that the crux of their case remains

the impugning of the original Order P8 and that all subsequent added

documents (P10A to P12) are consequential orders and/or documents

flowing from P8.

The facts as narrated by the petitioner.

7. The petitioners submission stems from a land transaction between the

petitioner and the 1st respondent, followed by contentious proceedings

before the Debt Conciliation Board. The petitioner submits that he

agreed to purchase the 1st respondent's land at "Budugewatta" for Rs.

2,000,000/-. According to the petitioner, an initial payment of Rs.

200,000/- was made to the 2nd respondent (the 1st respondent's Power

of Attorney holder) in September 2012; the petitioner later learned that

the property was mortgaged to Sampath Bank under two bonds (Primary

Mortgage Bond No. 269 dated December 29, 2006, and Secondary

WRT/0400/24

Page 6 of 10

Mortgage Bond No. 484 dated December 14, 2007) and that the 1st

respondent had defaulted on loan payments.

8. To avoid an auction, the 1st respondent requested the petitioner to pay

Rs. 1,700,000/- to cover the outstanding loan and retain the excess. The

petitioner subsequently transferred Rs. 1,057,500/- to the 1st

respondent's account for Sampath Bank dues, paid Rs. 172,500/- to the

2nd respondent, and received the property keys. Upon executing the

Deed of Transfer (No. 9378 dated November 5, 2012), the petitioner paid

an additional Rs. 270,000/- to the 2nd respondent and Rs. 60,000/- to

the Notary Public, bringing the total paid to approximately Rs.

2,000,000/-. Crucially, the petitioner discovered that only one of the two

mortgage bonds had been released by Sampath Bank. Around April

2013, the petitioner took possession and undertook developments on

the property.

9. Subsequently, the 1st respondent, through the 2nd respondent, filed

police complaints alleging forceful entry but did not initiate legal action

in court to recover possession. On December 5, 2013, the 1st

respondent, via the 2nd respondent, applied to the Debt Conciliation

Board under Section 14 of the Ordinance to release the property. The

Board, in an order dated October 4, 2023, found that the Deed of

Transfer was merely a security for the amount owed to the petitioner,

not an outright transfer. The petitioner sought a review, which the Board

reaffirmed on May 8, 2024. The petitioner then objected, arguing that

the application could not be made through a Power of Attorney. Despite

the Board finding that the 1st respondent lacked locus standi to institute

proceedings via a Power of Attorney holder, it overruled the petitioner's

objections on October 30, 2024. On November 20, 2024, the Board

issued a certificate under section 32(2) of the Act, stating that the

petitioner must pay an additional Rs. 1,200,000/- and that the

respondents were debtors, not vendors. This certificate was sent to the

Kegalle Land Registry for registration on January 8, 2025.

WRT/0400/24

10. The petitioner alleges that the Board failed to consider key aspects of

Section 21A of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance, such as the petitioner's

possession of the property, the Deed's clear language of vacant

possession, the lack of an interest agreement, and the 1st respondent's

failure to prove the Deed was a mortgage. The petitioner claims the 1st

respondent is perpetrating fraud by not discharging the secondary

mortgage, a fact discovered when attempting to obtain a loan from

Commercial Bank, and asserts he is a bona fide purchaser.

Furthermore, the petitioner contends that the Board's order of October

4, 2023, was invalid as it was signed by only two members, falling short

of the required three-member quorum under Section 3(2) of the

Ordinance.

Timeline.

11. This application was filed on 24.06.2024. It was due to be supported on

08.07.2024, on which day the petitioner has been directed to support

with notice to the respondents. Then, this matter was mentioned on

11.07.2024, on which day it was fixed for support for 06.08.2024. Once

again, order has been made to support upon issuing of notices.

Thereafter, the matter has been fixed for support for 21.10.2024. The

petitioner has then moved the matter out and the matter was then

refixed for support for 11.02.2025. On 11.02.2025, the petitioner has

moved to file an amended petition, which had been allowed, subject to

objection. On 06.03.2025, further time appears to have been granted.

Then, on 30.04.2025, the amended petition has been tendered and the

respondents granted time to inform if they are objecting. On 02.06.2025,

the counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondents has informed that they are

objecting to the same, and the inquiry into this was fixed for 17.07.2025,

on which day the matter was taken up, and this Order is accordingly

made.

12. This application is yet to be supported. For all purposes, this

application has been filed on 24.06.2024. That date remains static

WRT/0400/24

Page 8 of 10

notwithstanding the applications to amend the petition. Even if the

petitioner is permitted to file the amended petition, yet for all the date of

instituting action will remain as 24.06.2024; this will be so even if notice

is yet to be granted. This is so, as the application is to amend the petition

and if the application is allowed, what will subsist is the petition as so

amended, referred to as the amended petition.

13. In these circumstances, even prior to the matter being formally

supported, the petitioner cannot by a process of amending the petition,

bring in any fresh matters that are in the nature of new causes of action,

that may have arisen after the filing of this application. The decision

challenged in the initial petition is P-10, being an order dated

08.05.2024 and P-8, the determination 04.10.2023. What is relevant

and critical is that the determination pronounced by the Debt

Conciliation Board, upon hearing the application, is P-8 dated

04.10.2023. The petitioner has not preferred any application to this

Court immediately after the pronouncement of the said determination

P-8. It appears that the petitioner has then made an application for

review under Section 54 (1) of the said Ordinance, which had been

considered and by Order dated 08.05.2024 the said application has been

rejected and refused. This Order is marked P-10. The initial petition is

in respect of challenging these two orders. Since the filing of this

application, the petitioner has once again preferred an objection to the

issue of the certificate, by the Debt Conciliation Board by an application

dated 23.07.2024. The said objection had been rejected by the order

dated 30.10.2024 (marked P-10B). The Debt Conciliation Board has

then issued the certificate under Section 32 (2) of the Ordinance and

forwarded the same for registration by letter dated 08.01.2025 (marked

P-12). The said certificate is dated 20.11.2024 (marked P-11).

14. The petitioner, by an amendment, is now seeking to include P-10a, P-

11 and P-12 and also the order dated 30.10.2024 (P-10B), to be brought

into this application, and is seeking to quash the same. The objection of

WRT/0400/24

Page 9 of 10

the learned State Counsel is that these are subsequent and different

orders made after the filing of this application. The Order P-8 is the

determination upon the inquiry. All other orders that have been made

the subject matter of this application, as well as added to the amended

petition (P-10a, P-10b, P-11, and P-12) are applications and orders made

after the pronouncement of the determination P-8, especially, P-10a, P-

10b, P-11, and P-12, are matters that had arisen or raised after P-8. To

that extent, they are different causes of action and orders,

notwithstanding so arisen in the course of the Debt Conciliation Board

matter.

15. The principle as determined in Kusala Hasanthi Perera and another

vs. Gayantha Karunatilleke and others, CA/WRIT/224/2017, is that

a petitioner cannot be allowed to amend the petition in order to

accommodate new causes of action, which arose after the filing of the

application. In that matter, the initial application was to quash a vesting

order and a notice under Section 2 and Section 38 of the Land

Acquisition Act. Subsequently, an order in respect of compensation had

been made. The petitioners then sought to amend and add the said order

to the said application. Samayawardhena, J., held as follows:

The acquisition process ends with an award of compensation to

the persons whose lands have been acquired. Notwithstanding the

acquisition process and compensation process are interconnected

and cannot be considered in watertight compartments, they are

two different processes for which different principles apply. In my

view, an award of compensation is a different cause of action,

which has accrued, according to learned Counsel for the Petitioners

himself, after the filing of this application.

16. Similarly in this application, the issuing of the certificate is a different

process and issued on 20.11.2024 long after the initial order made on

04.10.2023. In these circumstances, the above principle is applicable.

Accordingly, the objection is upheld, the application to amend the

WRT/0400/24

Page 10 of 10

petition is not allowed, the amended petition is not accepted, and the

same is accordingly rejected. The matter will now proceed on the initial

petition. However, the petitioner is permitted to amend the caption to

include the names of the members of the Debt Conciliation Board.

17. Application for amendment is dismissed.
