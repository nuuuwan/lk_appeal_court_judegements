Most teenagers doubt the validity of their feelings or concerns. This uncertainty can prevent them from taking steps to speak up about the issues that mattered to them. Young people may also delay in making a complaint simply because they do not know the proper channels or the procedures to follow. There might be confusion about whom to approach, what to say or how to articulate their concerns effectively. Sometimes, teens might also downplay the seriousness of their concerns.
