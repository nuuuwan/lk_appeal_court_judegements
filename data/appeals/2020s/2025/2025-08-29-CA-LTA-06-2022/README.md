JUDGEMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Petitioners, who are the Defendants in the Wakfs Tribunal case No. WT 268/2019,

being the Trustees of the N.D.H. Abdul Gaffoor Trust (hereinafter referred to as the

Trust), have filed this leave to appeal application seeking permission to set aside the

order of the Wakf Tribunal dated 03.09.2022.

The Plaintiff-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Respondents) in terms of the

provisions of the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Act No. 51 of 1956 as

amended (hereinafter referred to as the Act) instituted action before the tribunal against

the Defendant Petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioners) inter alia;

i. Issue notices and/ or summons of this action to the Defendants;

ii. Remove the Defendants from their position as trustees of the Muslim

1935.11.21 attested by John Wilson of Colombo, Notary Public;

iii. Appoint fit and proper persons to the position of trustees of the Muslim

charitable trust established by the deed/indenture of trust bearing no: 2125

dated 1935.11.21 attested by John Wilson of Colombo, Notary Public;

iv. Direct the Defendants to submit a statement of accounts to the Tribunal or the

Wakf Board for the years 2015/2016, 2016/2017, 2017/2018.

v. Grant and Issue an interim order appointing special trustees for the Muslim

charitable trust established by the deed/indenture of trust bearing no: 2125

dated November 21st, 1935 attested by John Wilson of Colombo, Notary Public;

vi. Grant and Issue an interim order and/or stay order preventing the Defendants

respect of the land and premises described in the first and schedule hereto,

pending the final determination of the application for interim injunction;

viii. pending the final determination of this action grant and issue an interim

injunction preventing the Defendants from dealing with and/or disposing of

and/or transferring and/ or granting any lease in respect of the land and

premises described in the first and schedule hereto;

ix. grant and issue a permanent injunction preventing the Defendants from

management of the premises described in the first and second schedule hereto

pending the final determination of this application.

xi. Grant Costs;

xii. Grant such and other further relief as shall seem meet to Your Honours'

Tribunal.

At the hearing before the tribunal, Learned Counsel for the Petitioners raised preliminary

objections regarding the maintainability of the action. It was contended that the trust in

question does not qualify as a Charitable Muslim Trust within the meaning of the relevant

statute. Consequently, Counsel argued that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear and

determine the dispute brought forward by the Respondent, as the said Trust does not fall

within the scope of the provisions of the governing Act.

By its order dated 03.09.2022, the Learned Tribunal overruled the preliminary objections

raised by Counsel for the Petitioner, who had challenged the maintainability of the action

on jurisdictional grounds. The Tribunal held that it possessed the requisite jurisdiction to

hear and determine the dispute and accordingly fixed the matter for further hearing. This

Page 9 of 24

application for leave to appeal is filed against the said order, seeking appellate review of

the Tribunals determination on jurisdiction.

Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on the basis, inter alia, of several substantial

questions of law arising from the impugned order of the Wakfs Tribunal. The Petitioner

contends that: (a) the Tribunal erred in failing to appreciate that the N.D.H. Abdul

Gaffoor Trust does not qualify as a Muslim Charitable Trust within the meaning of the

relevant statute; (b) the Tribunal failed to recognize that the Trust is not, in fact, a

charitable trust at all; (c) the proceedings before the Tribunal were tainted by bias,

rendering its order illegal; (d) the Tribunal improperly engaged in a speculative inquiry,

amounting to a voyage of discovery beyond the scope of its mandate; (e) the Tribunal

erroneously applied the doctrine of estoppel in circumstances where it was inapplicable;

(f) the Tribunal incorrectly held that its jurisdiction over the matter was a settled issue;

and (g) the Tribunal misrepresented material facts in its order, thereby undermining the

integrity of its findings.

Before delving into the legal submissions advanced by the parties about the foregoing, I

consider it appropriate to first outline, in summary, the factual matrix underpinning the

present application.

Factual Matrix

The Ghaffooriya Arabic College was established in 1931 by Abdul Ghaffoor, the Settlor,

predating the formation of the N.D.H. Abdul Ghaffoor Trust. Initially, the College was

managed by the Settlor, for several years, and subsequently by the Trustees of the N.D.H.

Abdul Ghaffoor Trust including the settlor (vide Admission No. 9 at page 75 of the Brief).

The Trust Deed marked P1 (hereinafter referred to as the Deed) outlines two parcels

of land conveyed by the Settlor to the Trustees, namely:

(a) A plantation property comprising approximately 17 acres situated in Maharagama,

which includes buildings on about 2 acres and the remaining 15 acres designated

exclusively for plantation use, as described in the First Schedule to the Deed (hereinafter

referred to as the Maharagama Land); and

(b) A property measuring approximately 386 perches located in Grandpass, Colombo 14,

as described in the Second Schedule to the Deed (hereinafter referred to as the Grandpass

Property).

Page 10 of 24

According to the objectives of the aforesaid Deed No.2125, the Trustees shall,

a. Employ the rents from the said premises in the Second Schedule (i.e. Grandpass

Land) particularly described (vide Clause 2 of the Trust Deed P1), a) for the

purpose of paying and discharging the rates and taxes imposed on the said

premises in the second schedule and for keeping and maintaining the plantations

on the premises in the first schedule hereto (i.e. Maharagama Land) particularly

described in a fit and proper state of management and cultivation.

b. for keeping in good and substantial repair the buildings standing on the said

premises in the first and second schedules (i.e. buildings of both Grandpass Land

and Maharagama Land),

c. for paying and discharging all costs, charges and expenses of the trustees of or

incidental to the administration of the trust,

d. the balance remaining after payment of the above expenses for the education in

Arabic and maintenance of Muslim boys at the Arabic Language School founded

by the settlor in the buildings standing on the premises in the first schedule .

The Maharagama Land comprises a large plantation of approximately 15 Acres, and at

the Northwestern end of the land, buildings stand on an extent of about 2 further acres.

About the selection of the students the Settlor has stated that; subject to the stipulation

that 25% of the Muslim youths educated and maintained at the Arabic Language School

shall be Ceylon Moors, descended from parents with long-standing residence in Colombo,

the Trustees shall have the sole and unfettered discretion to select the Muslim youths to

be educated and maintained, and to determine the duration and manner of such education

and maintenance as they deem appropriate. (Vide Clause 3 of the Trust Deed marked

P1).

Further, in terms of the Trust, the trustees are inter alia entitled and empowered to,

a. use their "uncontrolled discretion (to) educate and maintain such youths for such

period and in such manner to them shall seem meet"

b. the Trustees shall and may at all times hereinafter peaceably and quietly

possess and enjoy allotment of land and receive the rents income and profits

Page 11 of 24

thereof without any interruption or disturbance whatsoever by the settlor or other

person, and

c. to claim all costs charges and expenses incurred in the administration of the

trust.

d. appoint new Trustees to fill any vacancy upon death, being unwilling to act or

being incapacitated. Only the remaining Trustees can fill any further vacancy.

(Vide clause 2(c), 3, 4 and 6 of the Trust Deed "P1" marked to the Petition)

Moreover, the Settlor has expressly stipulated that the English law of trusts shall govern

the subject Trust (vide Clause 6 of the Trust Deed marked P1).

Having set out the factual background surrounding the N.D.H. Abdul Ghaffoor Trust, I

now proceed to examine the grounds of argument advanced by the Petitioners. Central to

their case is the preliminary and jurisdictional question of whether the Trust qualifies as

a Muslim Charitable Trust within the meaning of the relevant statutory framework. The

Petitioners contend that, in the absence of such classification, the Wakfs Tribunal lacks

the legal authority to entertain and adjudicate the dispute brought before it. This

threshold issue forms the foundation upon which the Petitioners challenge the Tribunals

assumption of jurisdiction and the validity of its subsequent proceedings.

The Petitioners principal objection is that the Trust does not fall within the ambit of a

Muslim Charitable Trust. Accordingly, they contend that the Wakf Tribunal lacks the

requisite jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate upon the present dispute.

According to section 9E (1) of the Act, which states thus,

General power of the Tribunal.

(1) The powers of the Tribunal under this Act shall include the power to hear and

determine any application made in respect of a Muslim charitable trust or wakfs

for an order providing for all or any of the following purposes.. [Emphasis is

mine]

Page 12 of 24

In their written submissions, the Petitioners have advanced, inter alia, four principal

arguments in support of their contention that the subject Trust does not constitute a

Wakf. These arguments may now be examined.

We are mindful that Section 55 of the said Act expressly excludes only Sections 100 to

109 of the Trusts Ordinance from its application, thereby indicating the legislative intent

for the remaining provisions of the Trusts Ordinance to continue to apply.

Upon perusal of the said Deed, it is evident that the Settlor has directed that the balance

remaining, after payment of the specified expenses, be allocated towards the education in

Arabic and the maintenance of Muslim boys attending the Arabic language school.

According to the Respondents, the Trust in question was established to benefit Muslim

youths by facilitating their education in the Arabic language. The Tribunal, upon

consideration, formed the view that the Settlor intended to create an Arabic school

specifically for Muslim youths through the establishment of the Trust. It is noted,

however, that the said school had already been founded prior to the execution of the Trust

Deed. Nonetheless, the Tribunal concluded that the primary objective of the Deed was to

support Arabic language education for Muslim youths. In reaching this conclusion, the

Tribunal relied on Section 32(1) of the Wakfs Act to determine that the Trust qualifies as

a Charitable Trust within the meaning of the Act.

While it is true that the Settlor intended to provide Arabic language education for Muslim

youths, the Trust Deed clearly states that such support is to be funded only from the

remaining balance after covering the specified expenses.

In order to ascertain whether the instrument in question qualifies as a trust within the

meaning of the law, it is necessary to refer to Section 6 of the Trusts Ordinance, which

sets out the essential elements required for the creation of a valid trust.

6. Subject to the provisions of sections 5 and 107, a trust is created when the author of the

trust indicates with reasonable certainty by any words or acts -

(a) an intention on his part to create thereby a trust,

(b) the purpose of the trust,

(c) the beneficiary,

Page 13 of 24

(d) the trust property, and

(unless the trust is declared by will or the author of the trust is himself to be the trustee)

transfers the trust property to the trustee.

Illustrations

(a) A bequeaths certain property to B, " having the

fullest confidence that he will dispose of it for the

benefit of" C. This creates a trust so far as regards A

and

(b) A bequeaths certain property to B, "hoping he will

continue it in the family". This does not create a trust,

as the beneficiary is not indicated with reasonable

certainty.

(c) A bequeaths certain property to B, requesting him

to distribute it amongst such members of C's family

as B should think most deserving. This does not

create a trust, for the beneficiaries are not indicated

with reasonable certainty.

(d) A bequeaths certain property to B, desiring him to

divide the bulk of it among C's children. This does not

create a trust, for the trust property is not indicated

with sufficient certainty.

(e) A bequeaths a shop and stock in trade to B, on

condition that he pays A's debts and a legacy to C.

This is a condition, not a trust, for A's creditors and

C. [Emphasis is mine]

Page 14 of 24

In the Trust Deed bearing No. 2125, the Settlor has indicated that the income allocated

for educational purposes specifically for the Arabic Language School is to be drawn from

the residual funds remaining after the discharge of expenses enumerated under Clause

2(a), (b), and (c) of the said Deed. Accordingly, it becomes pertinent to examine Clause 2

in detail, as it governs the financial priorities and operational framework of the Trust.

Particular attention may be drawn to Clause 2(a) of the governing provisions of the Trust

Deed, wherein the Settlor has directed the Trustees to maintain the plantation situated

on the property described in the First Schedule in a fit and proper state of management

and cultivation. However, in issuing this directive, the Settlor has not expressly clarified

whether the profits derived from the said plantation are to be applied toward the specific

charitable object namely, the provision of education in Arabic and the maintenance of

Muslim boys at the Arabic Language School established by the Settlor within the

buildings located on the said premises (Hereinafter called and referred to as the

Charitable Purpose).

On the other hand, the Deed includes a provision indicating the Settlors intention

regarding how the profits from the cultivation are to be applied.

That provision reads as follows;

....settlor doth hereby covenant with the trustees that the trustees shall and may

at all times hereinafter peaceably and quietly possesses and enjoy the said

allotment of land and receive the rents income and profits thereof without any

interruption or disturbance... [Emphasis added]

A joint reading of the relevant provisions reveals that the Settlor placed significant

emphasis on the plantation property, which encompasses approximately 15 acres. It is

particularly noteworthy that, at the time of executing the Trust Deed, rubber cultivation

was a prominent contributor to the national economy. Supporting documentation

indicates that the estate described in the First Schedule comprised rubber plantations,

underscoring the Settlors intention to generate sustainable income through agricultural

means for the benefit of the Trusts objectives.

Page 15 of 24

Nonetheless, within this context, the Settlor has not expressly indicated whether the

income generated from the plantation is to be applied toward the charitable objectives of

the Trustspecifically, the promotion of Arabic education and the maintenance of Muslim

boys at the Arabic Language School situated on the premises. This omission gives rise to

a material ambiguity regarding the intended allocation of the estates income, thereby

warranting a careful and purposive interpretation of the Settlors overarching intent as

reflected in the Trust Deed.

Conversely, Clause 6 of the Trust Deed authorizes the Trustees to enjoy the profits.

However, there is no explicit indication that the term balance remaining is intended to

include profits generated from the estate itself. The Settlor has specifically stated that

the balance remaining after payment of the above expenses is to be drawn from the rents

of the premises mentioned, without providing any clarification as to whether this

encompasses income derived from the plantation or other portions of the estate. This

ambiguity raises questions regarding the scope of the Trusts income sources and the

Settlors precise intention in allocating funds for charitable purposes.

This ambiguity gives rise to a pivotal legal question: What is the legal effect of the phrase

balance remaining? More precisely, does this phrase carry sufficient clarity and

certainty in its meaning and scope to support the administration of the Trust? If it does

not, then it becomes necessary to examine whether the Trust Deed satisfies the essential

requirements for the creation of a valid trust as set out under Section 6 of the Trusts

Ordinance. The resolution of this issue is fundamental to determining the legal character

of the instrument and the enforceability of its provisions.

The principle of certainty of subject matter in trust law is foundational and has been

elaborated upon in various legal texts. The following authorities discuss this concept in

detail and may be cited accordingly:

In Trust by L.J.M. Cooray, page 78, wherein it states;

The following elements must concur for the creation of a trust under chapter II: (

the three persons concerned in a trust (settlor, trustee, beneficiary,) must have the

capacity to enter into the transaction; (ii) there must be certainty as to the

intention to create a trust, the beneficiary of the trust and the property affected by

the trust; (iii) the trust must not offend the rule against perpetuities; (iv) it must

be for a lawful purpose; (v) the formalities prescribed by law for the creation of

Page 16 of 24

such an interest must be observed and the trust property must be transferred to

the trustee.[Emphasis is mine]

Further, it is elaborated on Page 86 that,

There must be certainty both of the property intended to be affected by the trust,

and as to the beneficial interest to be taken by each of several beneficiaries. The

latter has been considered in relation to the requirement of certainty of beneficiary

in article 24.c. Illustration (d) to section 6 which seems to be based on Palmer v.

Simmonds, gives an example of uncertainty of trust property"A bequeaths

certain property to B, desiring him to divide the bulk of it among C's children."

Before 1918, a direction to hold the bulk of certain property in trust was

surprisingly upheld.53 But a trust of surplus income was held to be void...

[Emphasis is mine]

Equity and the law of trusts, by Dr. U.L. Abdul Majeed at page 81

In order to have a valid trust, the three certainties must be present, namely, (a)

certainty of words or intention, (b) certainty of the subject and (c) certainty of the

object. Lord Eldon said: "in order for a trust to be valid, first that the words must

be imperative..., secondly, that the subject must be certain.... and thirdly, that the

object must be as certain as the subject." See Wright vs. Aykyns,

In the case of Knight vs. Knight (supra), Lord Longdale declared that, for a trust

to be validly created, three things are necessary. They are: (1) the first concerns

the question whether what the putative settlor did or said amounts to a declaration

of a trust over his property. (2) the second requires that the subject matter of the

trust that is to form the trust corpus is identifiable, and must be certain, and (3)

the objects or the persons intended to be benefited, i.e., the beneficiaries, must be

certain. These three requirements have often been termed the "three certainties"

of a valid trust.

The certainty of intention should be distinguished from the other two, as certainty

of intention is like the 'intention to create legal relations' in contract law; it

concerns the question whether the putative settlor really meant to create a trust

Page 17 of 24

at all or a power of appointment or an outright gift. The second and third

certainties will be easily workable if the intention of the settlor is very clear.

Section 6 of the Trusts Ordinance states: Subject to the provisions of sections 5 and

107, a trust is created when the author of the trust indicates with reasonable

certainty by any words or act-

a)An intention on his part to create thereby a trust,

b)The purpose of the trust,

c)The beneficiary,

d) The trust property, and

(unless the trust is declared by will or the author of the trust himself to be the

trustee) transfers the trust property to the trustee.

As found in section 6(a) of the Trusts Ordinance, the intention of the author or

settlor of the trust is paramount for the creation of the trust

Under this section, a trust can be created even orally if the words are reasonably

certain of the creation of the trust.

(1)Certainty of Words/Intention

The maxim 'Equity looks to the intent rather than the form' fully applies to the

declaration of trust.

There is no need for any technical expression or particular formula to be used to

constitute a trust. It is a question in every case of construction of the words used

to ascertain whether they, together with any admissible extrinsic evidence,

establish an intention to set up a trust. The certainty of intention requirement

looks only to the intention of the settlor.

Though for the sake of brevity we refer to the intention of the settlor, it is more

correct to speak of the settlor's 'manifestation of intention' to create a trust.

In the Indian case of Maharajah Manindra Chandra Nandi vs. Raja Durga

Prashad Singh, the Privy Council held that that, In construing the terms of a deed,

Page 18 of 24

the question is not what the parties may have intended, but what is the meaning

of the words which they used. This decision was followed by L.W. De Silva J. in the

local case of Fernando vs. Jossie.

It is a generally accepted principle that the intention as gathered from the whole

document is paramount as against specific words. In the case of a last will, the

intention of the Testator is paramount. In the case of Fan Fyre vs. The Public

Trustee, de Kretser J. held that "In the interpretation of a will the paramount rule

is to look for the intention of the testator as it is expressed and clearly implied in

the general terms of the will. When the intention is found on satisfactory evidence,

to that must be sacrificed inconsistent clauses and words.

A provision for the education and maintenance of children without any definite

sum being mentioned with respect to each does not amount to a legacy. The dicta

of Coleridge J. in Morrall vs. Sutton, is relevant to mention here.

"The paramount rule is that before all things we must look for the intention of the

testator as we find it expressed and clearly implied in the general terms of the will,

and when we have found that on evidence satisfactory in kind and degree, to that

we must sacrifice the inconsistent clause or words, whether standing first or last,

indifferently."

In light of the aforementioned authorities, the key issue that emerges is whether the

Settlor intended, through the Trust Deed, to establish a trust specifically aimed at

promoting Arabic education and supporting the upkeep of Muslim boys at the Arabic

Language Schoolan objective that is ostensibly charitable. However, it must be noted

that there is a degree of uncertainty surrounding the availability of funds to sustain this

charitable purpose once the designated expenses have been met. For example, should the

Trustees fail to collect rent, or if the costs of maintaining the plantation surpass the rental

income, the Trust may be rendered incapable of fulfilling its intended charitable

functions.

The Settlor has focused exclusively on the income generated from the building, without

making any reference to revenue derived from the broader estate. Although the Deed

stipulates that rental income is to be utilized for the maintenance of the estate, it does

not expressly provide that profits arising from the estate itselfsuch as those from

Page 19 of 24

plantation activitiesare to be directed toward any charitable objective. This omission

introduces a degree of uncertainty regarding the scope of the Trusts charitable

application and raises questions about the Settlors true intention in relation to the use of

estate-generated income.

Therefore, the Trust Deed does not clearly demonstrate that the Settlor intended to

dedicate both parcels of land exclusively for charitable purposes. In the absence of such

express intention, and given the uncertainty surrounding the use of income derived from

the estate, it must be concluded that the Deed does not meet the requirements of a valid

trust as set out in Section 6 of the Trusts Ordinance.

It is pertinent to refer to illustration (d) of the said Section 6 of the Trusts Ordinance,

which reads thus;

(d) A bequeaths certain property to B, desiring him to divide the bulk of it among

C's children. This does not create a trust, for the trust property is not indicated

with sufficient certainty.

Accordingly, we are of the considered view that the Settlor did not intend to create a trust

for charitable purposes, and that the Trust Deed fails to satisfy the requirements of a

valid trust owing to the absence of sufficient certainty in its terms.

Be that as it may, the question remains whether the said Deed satisfies the prerequisite

criteria for a valid Muslim Charitable Trust under, and in terms of, the Muslim Mosques

and Charitable Trusts Ordinance No. 51 of 1956 (as amended).

It is pertinent to observe that the Settlor has appointed himself as one of the Trustees of

the purported Trust, and has named, in the Trust Deed, several other individuals as co-

Trusteesall of whom are members of his immediate family.

According to clause 4 of the deed, which may be reproduced verbatim, the same as follows,

4. The trustees shall not be less than ten in number and in the event of any of the

said Trustees dying or being unwilling to act or incapacitated from acting the

vacancy shall be filled by the appointment of a new Trustee by the remaining

Trustee and in the event of a difference of opinion among them by the majority of

them.

A close examination of the above clause reveals that the Settlors intention was to retain

the administration of the purported trust within the family. Moreover, he has expressly

stated that

Page 21 of 24

....the settlor doth hereby covenant with the trustees that the trustees shall and

may at all times hereinafter peaceably and quietly possesses and enjoy the said

allotment of land and receive the rents income and profits thereof without any

interruption or disturbance whatsoever by the settlor or other person or persons

whomever lawfully claiming any right or title thereto... [Emphasis is mine]

Furthermore, the Settlor has conferred upon the Trustees the discretion to select the

Muslim youths to be educated under the Trust. This provision indicates that the Settlor

has retained a measure of control over the administration of the property, which is

purported to be the subject of a wakf. Such retained discretion is inconsistent with the

irrevocable and absolute dedication typically required for the creation of a valid wakf.

Mahommedain Law , volume I, by Sybd Ameer Ali, at page 381:

When once a property has been dedicated or declared to be wakf, the right of the

person dedicating "drops" absolutely. Thenceforth the property is 'tied-up" in the

ownership of the Almighty, and nobody has a right to deal with it in any shape-

neither the wakf, nor his heirs, nor the beneficiaries under the wakf.

According to The Muslim Law of Succession, Inheritance and waqf in Sri Lanka by M. S.

Jalden, at page 275,

The Waqif should immediately divest himself from the property waqfed.

The waqif has no right to interfere or intermeddle with the property which is the subject-

matter of the waqf. The ownership of the property vests in God.

The legal issue referred to above was neither duly nor adequately addressed by the Wakfs

Tribunal, thereby resulting in an error of law on its part.

The next question is why the settlor has indicated that the said so-called trust deed is

governed by English Law?

One of the principal objections raised by the Petitioner is that the trust in question

constitutes a private trust rather than a charitable one. Upon examining the Trust

Deed, the Court is of the view that the Settlors intention was to retain the land

Page 22 of 24

within the family. This inference is clearly supported by the contents of the Deed

itself.

The English Law of Trusts shall apply to the Trust herein created, and Grantor

doth hereby covenant with the Trustee that the Trustees shall and may at all times

hereafter peaceably and quietly possess and enjoy the said allotments of land and

receive the rents, income and profits thereof without any interruption or

disturbance whatsoever by the grantor or other person or persons whomever

lawfully claiming any right or title thereto that the Grantor has good right to

convey and assign in manner aforesaid the said allotments of land and that the

same are free from encumbrance and that the Grantor shall and will at all times

hereafter warrant and defend the title to the said allotments of land and premises

and every part or portion unto the Trustees against any and every person or

persons whomever and shall and will at all time hereafter at the request cost and

expense of the..

While the Settlor did indicate that any remaining funds could be used to support

Muslim youth in learning the Arabic language, it is important to note that the

term used profit does not encompass the residual balance. The trustee is entitled

to enjoy the profits from the estate, and this distinction suggests that the Settlor

expressly intended for the Trust to be governed by English law.

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the ownership of the subject property has consistently

remained with the trustees, who are relatives of the settlor. It is also important to consider

the settlors intention, as reflected in the trust deed, which explicitly stipulates that the

trust is governed by English law. This indicates a deliberate choice to exclude the

application of Muslim Law under the relevant Act. Consequently, this raises the question

of whether private wakfs are recognized under Muslim law.

The Muslim Law of Succession, Inheritance and Waqf in Sri Lanka, M.S. Jaldeen, at page

272

Ameer Ali Classifies waqfs under three heads:_

Page 23 of 24

1. Public waqfs- designated masalih-al- aamma- for example, the building of a

mosque or school;

2. Quasi public waqfs- a trust created primarily for a pious purpose and partly for

the benefit of a particular persons or embers of the family of the settlor,

3. Private waqfs-primary object of which is to benefit individuals, including members

of the settlors family.

Although the Muslim Law provides for family trust according to Muslim Law in Sri Lanka

by Dr. H.W. Tambiah Q.C. Ph.D. and Mohammado Markhani AAL at page 76 it states

thus,

The Muslim Law governing private trusts is no part of our law. Muslim law

provides for family trusts by a written instrument creating a trust, in the English

sense, in which event the Trusts Ordinance (Cap. 87) will apply, and if this

Ordinance is silent, then resort is had to English law.

In my respectful view, the Settlors principal objective in executing the Deed appears to

have been the preservation of the estate within the family, ensuring that its benefits

remained under familial control. The reference to Arabic education and the support of

Muslim boys at the Arabic Language Schoolan institution that existed prior to the

Deedseems to have been a secondary consideration. Moreover, the Settlors decision to

apply English law appears to have been driven by this underlying intent, rather than by

any genuine aim to create a charitable trust in the strict legal sense.

The Settlor clearly stipulated that the Deed would be governed by English law, thereby

intentionally refraining from invoking Muslim law. This deliberate choice reflects his

intention to establish an express private trustan arrangement that is not recognized

under traditional Muslim legal principles.

Accordingly, Case No. WT 268/2019, presently pending before the Wakfs Tribunal, is

hereby dismissed on the ground that the Trust Deed in question is governed by English

Page 24 of 24

law and does not fall within the purview of Muslim law. As such, the matter lies outside

the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

Accordingly, the application is allowed.
