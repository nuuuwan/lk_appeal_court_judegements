VIII. For a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st

N.D.H. Abdul Ghaffoor Trust;

IX. For costs;

X. For such other and further relief as to Your Lordships' Court may seem

meet.

According to the petition, the 1st RespondentDirector of the Mosque and Muslim

Charitable Trust (Wakfs)referred a matter concerning the N.D.H. Abdul Gafoor

Trust to the Wakfs Tribunal, implicating the Petitioners. Subsequently, the

Page 8 of 15

Tribunal issued a notice, marked as X20, summoning the Petitioners to appear

before it. As stated in document X20, the Director had informed the Tribunal via

a letter dated 19.08.2020 that the Old Boys Association of the relevant school had

lodged a complaint. They alleged that the Petitioners, acting as trustees, had

withheld financial assistance intended for the management of the Arabic College

and Hostel. Furthermore, the Association requested the formation of a new

management committee to oversee the school and hostel. In response, the Wakfs

Tribunal directed the Petitioners to appear before it on 13.02.2021.

In response to the said reference, the Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction of this

Court. The core of their grievance is that the 1st Respondent failed to adhere to the

procedural requirements prescribed under the Mosque and Muslim Charitable Trust or

Wakfs Act No. 51 of 1956, as amended (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"). As stated in

paragraph 30 of the petition, the Petitioners assert that upon applying for and obtaining

the case records pertaining to Wakfs Tribunal Case No. 273/2020, they discovered that

the reference made by the 1st Respondent to initiate proceedings before the Tribunal was

marked as X21.

The Petitioners contend that the reference made by the 1st Respondent was not in

accordance with the provisions of the law. Consequently, they assert that the said

reference is unlawful, procedurally flawed, and legally untenable, and therefore ought to

be quashed.

Therefore, it is pertinent to refer to the relevant section in the Act. Section 9E(2) and (3)

of the Act are hereby reproduced verbatim the same.

General power of the Tribunal.

(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3), every application in respect of a

Muslim charitable trust or wakfs shall be made by the Director upon a direction

given by the Board in that behalf, or any five or more persons interested in that

trust or wakfs.

(3) No application, other than an application made by the Director, shall be

entertained by the Tribunal under this section unless the application is

accompanied by a certificate under the hand of the Director that the application

has been approved by the Board.

Page 9 of 15

The issue before this Court is whether the Wakfs Board had issued a directive in the

matter, and whether, at the time the 1st RespondentDirector submitted his application

to the Tribunal, he furnished a certificate evidencing that the application had received

prior approval from the Board.

Pursuant to Section 9E(3) of the Act, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to entertain any

application unless it is accompanied by a certificate issued by the Director. Upon close

scrutiny, there is no indication of when the 1st Respondent referred the matter to the

Tribunal. Specifically, as of 19.08.2020, there is no evidence to suggest that the Wakfs

Board had approved the reference, nor that a certificate was filed along with the

application. It is therefore relevant to reproduce the document marked as X21, which is

the original in Tamil, and X21(a), its corresponding English translation.

Page 10 of 15

Page 11 of 15

It is clear that, 1st Respondent has failed to submit the relevant certificate along with his

application.

In Muslim Law in Sri Lanka by Dr. H.W. Tambiah Q.C. Ph.D. and

Mohammado Markhani AAL at page 75 ;

Every application in respect of a Muslim charitable trust or wakf shall be

made by the Director upon a direction given by the Board in that behalf, or any

five or more persons interested in that trust or wakf. It was also provided that

no application other than an application by the Director, shall be entertained

by the Tribunal under Section 9E unless the application is accompanied by a

certificate under the hand of the Director that the application has been

approved by the Board.

Failure to file the directors certificate along with the application was considered in

Sheriff and Others v. Jamaldeen, 2000 (2) SLR 190 at page 192, Weerasuriya, J held that;

Further, Section 29(7) as amended prohibits any application to the Wakfs

Tribunal other than by the Director to be entertained unless the same is

accompanied by a certificate under the hand of the Director that the

application has been approved by the Board. Thus, one is justified in

asserting that these provisions have no relevance to the instant case.

Learned Counsel for the plaintiff-appellants contended that plaintiff-

appellants base their case in terms of Section 9J and that a certificate from

the Director is totally unnecessary. However, it is to be observed that

Section 9J provides the Wakfs tribunal to have exclusive jurisdiction to

inquire into matters relating to Muslim Charitable Trust or Wakfs as

provided for by Section 9E(1). Nevertheless, one has to be mindful that

Section 9E(1) encompasses an inclusive provision.

It is convenient at this stage to consider the position the Director is placed

with, in regard to the institution of proceedings in the District Court and

Wakfs Tribunal.

Page 12 of 15

Section 39(1) empowers the Director upon a direction given by the Board in

that behalf in respect of a Muslim Charitable Trust or Wakf to institute

action in the District Court to obtain relief as provided for in Section 39(1)

(a) and (b).

Section 9E(2) authorises the Director upon a direction given by the Board

in that behalf to make an application in respect of a Muslim Charitable

Trust or wakf to the Wakfs Tribunal for relief in terms of Section 9E(1)(a)-

(i).

It is a remarkable feature of these sections that the right of five or more

persons to institute proceedings in the District Court in terms of Section

39(1) or the right to institute proceedings in the Wakfs Tribunal in terms of

Sections 29(1) and Section 9E(2) is preceded by a condition that such plaint

or application before the District Court or the Wakfs tribunal as the case

may require, be accompanied by a certificate by the Director that such

plaint or application as the case may be, has been approved by the Board.

In fact, in all these provisions, District Court or the Wakfs Tribunal is

precluded from entertaining such plaint or application as the case may be

unless the same is accompanied by a certificate from the Director, Thus, it

is a sine qua. non for persons interested in the trust or mosque to obtain a

certificate from the Director if they wish to invoke the jurisdiction of the

District Court or Wakfs Tribunal as the case may require. [Emphasis is

mine]

It is also noted that the 1st Respondent has submitted documents marked as R1.

According to the contents of R1, the Wakfs Board convened a meeting on 20.12.2020,

during which a board paper dated 11.12.2020 was tabled by the Director. Through this

paper, the Director sought a direction from the Board pursuant to Section 9E(2) of the

Act.

However, the document labeled X21 contains no reference to any requisite board

approval, which is a mandatory prerequisite for invoking the jurisdiction of the Wakfs

Tribunal. It clearly indicates that the director submitted an application to the Tribunal

Page 13 of 15

without first obtaining the boards consent. Consequently, he has not adhered to the

procedural requirements prescribed by the statute.

Therefore, it is evident that for the Wakfs Tribunal to validly assume jurisdiction, strict

compliance with Section 9E(3) is imperative. In particular, the director must obtain prior

approval from the Wakfs Board in accordance with Section 9E(2). This approval

constitutes a mandatory condition precedent, without which the Tribunal cannot lawfully

exercise its jurisdiction.

(3) No application, other than an application made by the Director, shall be

entertained by the Tribunal under this section unless the application is

accompanied by a certificate under the hand of the Director that the application

has been approved by the Board.

Therefore, we hold that failure to file the certificate is fatal and bad in law.

There is no indication in the referenced document marked as X21 that the

Director obtained approval from the Wakfs Board. In fact, under the relevant

provisions, the Wakfs Tribunal is expressly barred from entertaining any

application unless it has been duly approved by the Board. In other words, for the

Director to invoke the jurisdiction of the Wakfs Tribunal, prior approval from the

Board is a mandatory prerequisite.

In the present case, the Director has failed to secure such approval, thereby

neglecting to comply with the procedural requirements outlined in Section 9E(2)

and (3) of the Act. This non-compliance with a statutory condition precedent

results in a fundamental lack of jurisdiction. Consequently, any order issued by

the Tribunal in this matter is void ab initio.

Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 12th edition, Pg. 328, referring to 'conditions

precedent to jurisdiction' states that,

Where an act or thing required by statute is a condition precedent to the

jurisdiction of a tribunal compliance cannot be dispensed with and, if it be

impossible, the jurisdiction fails. It would not be competent to a court to dispense

Page 14 of 15

with what the legislature has made the indispensable foundation of its

jurisdiction.

This was considered by Sureshchandra, J in Antony Fernando V. Deepthi Lakmali [2012]

2 SLR 81.

In the document marked X21, it is clear that X21 did not indicate that the 1st Respondent

had obtained approval and direction from the board to file this application in the tribunal.

In the circumstances, without obtaining the direction of the board, assuming the

jurisdiction of the tribunal constitutes a patent lack of jurisdiction. Whatever orders made

thereafter are void ab initio and a nullity.

The said error could be itemized as procedural impropriety under judicial review.

The concept of procedural impropriety was discussed by His Lordship Janaka De Silva in

P.R. Madduma Banda Mawanella Hemmathagama Multipurposes Co-Operative Society

And Others C.A. (PHC) 68/2010 in CA Minute 05.10.2018 wherein his Lordship states,

I have described the third head as "procedural impropriety" rather than failure to

observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural fairness

towards the person who will be affected by the decision. This is because

susceptibility to judicial review under this head covers also failure by an

administrative tribunal to observe procedural rules that are expressly laid down

in the legislative instrument by which its jurisdiction is conferred, even where such

failure does not involve any denial of natural justice. [Emphasis is mine]

In the present case, there is substantial evidence indicating that, before the reference

made by the 1st Respondent, no approval was obtained from the Board. As such, the

proceedings initiated thereafter are rendered void ab initio and constitute a legal nullity.

It is pertinent to refer to the words used by His Lordship Justice Samayawardena in

Wathukarage Samatha Merril Kumara Vs. National Gem and Jewellery Authority and 7

Others SC/MISL/04/2014 decided on 07.02.2025 at page 7 wherein it was held that,

If a decision is ultra vires, it is a nullity for all intents and purposes. It is void, not

voidable. Everything that stems from a decision which is a nullity also

automatically becomes a nullity without further ado.

Page 15 of 15

In light of the foregoing reasons, the proceedings in WT/273/2020 are deemed void ab

initio and of no legal effect. Accordingly, the documents marked X20 and X21 are hereby

quashed.

It is pertinent to note that, as per our determination in Case No. CA/LTA/0006/22, the

deed bearing No. 2125 does not constitute a Muslim Charitable Trust. Accordingly, there

is no necessity to revisit or adjudicate that issue within the scope of the present

application.

Consequently, the Wakfs Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the issue concerning

the alleged trust. Hence, the application stands allowed.

Accordingly, the relief sought in the petition dated 11 June 2021 is hereby granted. A Writ

of Certiorari is issued, thereby quashing the purported reference dated 19 August 2020,

marked X 21, as well as the purported notice dated 22 January 2021, marked X 20.
