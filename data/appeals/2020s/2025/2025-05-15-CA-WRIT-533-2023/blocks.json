Learned Counsel for all parties concurred that, where notice of an industrial dispute had been brought to the notice of the Commissioner, recourse to the procedure set out in section 3(1)(b) of the said Act, where an endeavour to settle the industrial dispute by conciliation is envisaged, is permissible and, in fact, common place since it is the Industrial Disputes Act that has specifically the authority for the Commissioner to initiate an inquiry upon any complaint relating to an industrial dispute received by him/her.

In this context, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the employment of the Petitioners constituted a trade within the meaning ascribed to such term in the Wages Boards Ordinance, although a Wages Board has not been established for same. This position was not challenged by the Respondents. As submitted by learned Presidents Counsel at the hearing and detailed in their written submissions, the Petitioners argument is based on the proposition that there is a fundamental and inherent obligation to pay salary to a workman even if there is no obligation cast on the employer to provide work. The Petitioners have sought to rely on section 2 of the Wages Boards Ordinance as statutory authority for such proposition.",

SR de Silva in his Law of Dismissal states, It is settled law that the employer has no right of suspension. Ordinarily, therefore, the absence of such power either as an express term in the contract or in the rules framed under some statute would mean that the master would have no power to suspend a workman and even if he does so in the sense that he forbids the employee to work, he will have to pay wages during the so called period of suspension. Abeysekere in his Industrial Law and Adjudication concurs. \"The right to suspend, in the sense of a right to forbid a servant to work, is not an implied term in an ordinary contract between master and servant. Such a power can only be created by statute governing the contract, or by express provision in the contract. If a master nevertheless, suspends in the sense of forbidding an employee to work, he will be liable to pay wages for the period of suspension. This Sri Lankan authorities suggest that a suspended worker is entitled to full wages during suspension. (at p. 11)",

Provided I pay my cook her wages regularly she cannot complain if I choose to take any or all of my meals out (emphasis added). In addition to the aforementioned statutory and judicial authorities, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners also referred to the prior conduct of the Commissioner, in particular to the fact a Tripartite Agreement had been entered into by the Commissioner and several Trade Unions (on behalf of the workmen) and the Employers Federation (on behalf of the employers) during the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 permitting the employer to pay only half-wages, if the employer had no work to offer to workmen. The learned Presidents Counsel contended that, such agreement was an affirmation of the fact that the law requires full wages to be paid, even if there is no work to be offered, and that it is only through agreement that such obligation to pay wages could be reduced, and, that, the Commissioner had accepted such position by being a party to the said agreement. However, it is noted that the aforementioned Tripartite Agreement is not binding upon the parties to the instant case. In view of the specific provisions of section 2 of the Wages Boards Ordinance and the aforementioned judicial authorities cited, I am inclined to accept the proposition that the said Ordinance articulates and recognizes the obligation of an employer to pay wages to a workman employed in any trade to which it applies and that such obligation is not linked or dependent upon the employers ability to offer work to the workman. Since the decision of the Commissioner contained in P35 and P37 was made on the basis that the salaries not paid to the Petitioners during the period of compulsory no-pay leave could not be considered as earned wages, it would be convenient at this juncture to examine the maintainability of such a proposition. In this context, the Petitioners contend that, since the Wages Boards Ordinance does not distinguish between workers who are given work and those who are not given work, the mere",

    "text": "fact of being employed, despite not physically engaged in work during the period of compulsory no-pay leave, entitles them to the payment of their salary. They further contend that compulsory no-pay leave was imposed upon them by a unilateral directive of the 4th Respondent, and, as such, they were prevented from working. In fact, the Petitioners had requested to be scheduled for flights and had, at no time, refused to work. Another material consideration alluded to by the Petitioners is that they were retained in employment and, although they were not rostered for flights, were required to keep their pilots licences updated and undergo on-ground training during the period of compulsory no-pay leave. It is recalled that the position of the 4th Respondent was that it was compelled to adopt austerity measures, including placing the Petitioners on compulsory no-pay leave due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the airline industry and restrictions imposed by local and foreign regulatory authorities. In fact, in its written submissions filed in the instant application and at the inquiry marked P27/P33, the position has been taken that such restrictions constituted an event of Force Majeure that had the effect of frustrating the contracts of employment between the Petitioners and the 4th Respondent. However, the Petitioners contend that the 4th Respondent did operate certain types of flights, and, such contention appears to be well-founded in the light of the notice dated 19.05.2021 issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Sri Lanka (CAASL) marked 4R3 (attached to the statement of objections of the 4th Respondent) which inter alia, permits aircraft departures with passengers and inbound freighter operations, notwithstanding other restrictions. There is also a reference to the fact that the utilization of pilots at 20% of normal levels in the 4th Respondents statement of objections (vide paragraph 13). Thus, the Petitioners alleged that they were discriminated against by the 4th Respondent in rostering for flights and imposing salary reductions vis--vis local pilots. Although I do not consider it necessary to address the allegation of discrimination in these proceedings, I am nevertheless of the view that the justification advanced by the 4th Respondent for the necessity to place the Petitioners on compulsory no-pay leave is untenable in the light of the aforementioned circumstances. It is also my view that the necessity for a workman to earn wages would only arise in circumstances where the workman is offered work. Hence, if the workman is not offered work by the employer, such as by placing him/her on compulsory leave as in the instant case, the necessity to earn wages cannot arise. The maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia to the effect that the law does not require or compel a person to do something impossible, would militate against such a requirement being imposed upon the workman. Hence, I am inclined to hold that the finding made by the Commissioner that the Petitioners were required to earn wages during their period of compulsory leave is contrary to the provisions of section 2 of the Wages Boards Ordinance and the law. Viewed from this perspective, the Commissioner appeared to have relied on irrelevant considerations in determining the Petitioners entitlement to salary.",

    "text": "It is also apparent that at the inquiry held by the Department of Labour, neither the inquiring officer nor the Commissioner appear to have considered the same at all in arriving at the decisions in P35 and P37. Contrary to the allegation made by the 4th Respondent in its written submissions, the Petitioners had specifically drawn the attention of the inquiring officer to the applicability of the provisions of the Wages Boards Ordinance, most significantly in their written submissions marked P25, P29 and P34. It is also observed that no explanation has been provided for such omission in the statement of objections of the 1st to 3rd Respondents. Furthermore, no explanation has been provided by the Commissioner for the departure from the recommendations made in P10 on the same issue. Since the Long Title of the Wages Boards Ordinance describes it inter alia, as an Ordinance for the regulation of wages and other emoluments of persons employed in trades and its application to the disputing parties in the instant case was not in doubt, I am inclined to treat such failure on the part of the 1st to 3rd Respondents as a substantial error of law. Viewed in this light, the position taken up by the counsel for both 1st to 3rd Respondents and the 4th Respondent, that the Industrial Disputes Act does not provide for the recovery of unearned wages is misconceived in law, as it ignores the provisions of the Wages Boards Ordinance that specifically regulate the payment of wages in trades and the Commissioner has been paying attention upon a statute that does not contain any specific or substantive provisions relating to wages. As submitted by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners, substantive and regulatory provisions relating to the payment of wages in the private sector are regulated by three statutes: the Wages Boards Ordinance in relation to workmen employed in trades; by the Shop and Office Employees (Regulation of Employment and Remuneration) Act, No. 19 of 1954 (as amended) in relation to workmen employed in shops or offices and the Factories Ordinance, No. 45 of 1942 (as amended) in relation to workmen employed in factories, as defined in such statutes. The importance of timely payment of salary to a workman has been emphasized by this Court in Siddadurage Kalyani Silva v. Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital Board and others,8 which considered similar provisions relating to payment of salary in the Shop and Office Employees (Regulation of Employment and Remuneration) Act.

As a consequence of such entitlement to salary, the Petitioners are entitled to EPF and ETF payable thereon, which are statutory entitlements provided under the Employees Provident Fund Act and the Employees Trust Fund Act. Hence, I hold that all EPF and ETF payments due to the Petitioners in respect of such period should also be paid to them, as provided by their terms and conditions of employment and the law. The Petitioners have further alleged that the Commissioner has failed to provide reasons for the decision in P35 and P37 in violation of the principles of natural justice, relying upon the authority of Karunadasa v. Unique Gemstones Ltd and others.10 In this context, the Petitioners characterized the said orders as being perfunctory, terse and totally bereft of reasons. I am unable to agree with this position. Although the reasons given in P35 and P37 may be flawed, as discussed earlier, they nevertheless communicate to the Petitioners the reasoning or basis for the finding made therein. In interpreting the duty to give reasons, it is my view that a distinction should be maintained between the existence of reasons given by the decision-maker to arrive at his/her decision and the merits or otherwise of such reasons. 2.

Thus, it is observed that, excluding Part II, the Wages Boards Ordinance provides for the recovery of payments due to workmen by the Commissioner by two principal means; either by instituting proceedings in the appropriate Magistrates Court by recovering the sum due as a fine (section 3D) or by instituting a civil suit for the recovery of the sum due in a court of competent jurisdiction (section 56). It is further observed that the Ordinance vests the Commissioner with the discretion regarding the choice of procedure to be adopted, and, if the Commissioner to institute proceedings in the Magistrates Court, section 3D(2) requires the Commissioner to form an opinion that that recovery under any other provisions under the Ordinance is impractical or inexpedient. I am of the view that the aforementioned statutory provisions cast a statutory duty upon the Commissioner to recover payments due to workmen under the Ordinance from defaulting employers. However, it is also evident that the 1st Respondent does not appear to have considered such provisions in recovering the payments due to the Petitioners in the instant case. In contrast, the 1st Respondent appeared to have considered the dispute between the Petitioners and the 4th Respondent as an industrial dispute and invoked the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act to inquire into and endeavour to settle such dispute by conciliation. By P35 at the conclusion of the inquiry, the 1st Respondent had sought the consent of the Petitioners to refer the dispute to arbitration as provided for in section 3(1)(d) of the said Act. At the hearing of this application, learned State Counsel for the 1st to 3rd Respondents submitted that the Industrial Disputes Act contained adequate provisions to determine the entitlement of the Petitioners and obtain the payment of same, and in particular made reference to sections 3(3), 17, 40A and 43 thereof. Whilst the Commissioner undoubtedly has the discretion to invoke the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act to inquire into and resolve industrial dispute, the issue that presents itself to Court is whether the decision to seek the consent of the Petitioners to refer the dispute between the Petitioners and the 4th Respondent to arbitration is rational and reasonable, in light of the facts and circumstances of the instant case.",

Hence, they argue that such material was available at the inquiry held by the Labour Department, and, as such, there is no necessity for an arbitrator to inquire afresh into such matters. According to the Petitioners, such an inquiry is also likely to cause further delay and prejudice. In the absence of a plausible response on the part of the Respondents on such issue, I am inclined to agree with the position taken up by the Petitioners.",

It is re-iterated that the Commissioner has also not adduced any compelling reasons for such a choice. Since the Petitioners have specifically objected to reference to arbitration in the instant application, it would have been incumbent upon the 1st Respondent to offer a specific explanation on the issue, and I was unable to find the same either in the statement of objections or in the submissions made at the hearing. Hence, the decision of the 1st Respondent also appears to be at variance with the well-established legal maxim relating to statutory interpretation generalia specialibus non derogant to the effect that things general do not restrict or detract from things special.15 Such reasoning seems to be fortified by the provisions of section 65 of the Wages Boards Ordinance itself which provide as follows;",

(G) Immigration Appeal Tribunal (2005) 1 W.L.R. 1445]. Our Courts have held that where a party fails to invoke alternative remedies judicial review can be refused. [Rodrigo v. Municipal Council Galle (49 N.L.R. 89); Gunasekera v. Weerakoon (73 N.L.R. 262); Obeysekera v. Albert & others (1978-79) 2 Sri L.R. 220); Rev. Maussagolle Dharmarakkitha Thera and another v. Registrar of Lands and others (2005) 3 Sri L.R. 113]. The general principle is applicable even where the alternative remedy is an administrative procedure, such as in this case and Courts will require the party seeking judicial review first to exhaust such administrative procedure before invoking the discretionary power of judicial review [R (Cowl) v. Plymouth City Council (2002) 1 W.L.R. 803; R. v. Barking and Dagenham LBC Ex. P. Lloyd (2001) L.G.R. 421; R. (Carnell) v.

It maybe that judicial review is capable of providing immediate means of resolving the dispute in which case it may be the more appropriate procedure.

Under section 2 (a) of this Ordinance the Employer was required to pay \"the worker\" his wages without any deduction other than an authorised deduction. A deduction from the wages such as in this case does not come within the term \"an authorised deduction\". Such a deduction not being an authorised deduction was forbidden under section 2 (a) to which reference has already been made. The Ordinance also declares such a deduction to be a penal offence triable in the Magistrate's Court (vide Sections 4 and 61 of the Ordinance). On conviction of the Employer, repayment of this deduction to the worker was also provided (vide Section 4(2) of the Ordinance, as amended by Ordinance No. 27 of 1957). The remedy open to the applicant was therefore to submit his complaint to the Commissioner of Labour for a charge to be laid against the appellant under the relevant Section of the Ordinance. The applicant has mistakenly or otherwise sought the wrong Forum (emphasis added).",

Furthermore, the reliefs sought by the Petitioners arise out of statutory entitlements under the Wages Boards Ordinance, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and the Employees Trust Fund (ETF). In fact, the terms and conditions of employment in the employment contract marked P3 itself make specific reference to EPF, ETF and the Payment of Gratuity Acts.",

    "text": "I have also carefully considered the authorities cited by the 4th Respondent in its written submissions, namely, Ratnayake v. C. D. Perera,26 Galle Flour Milling (Pvt) Limited v. Board of Investment of Sri Lanka,27 Jayawardena v. Peoples Bank,28 Meragala v. Peoples Bank and others,29 M. S. S. Salahudeen v. Sri Lankan Airlines Limited,30 Perera v. Municipal Council of Colombo and others31 and Mendis v. Seema Sahitha Panadura Janatha Santhaka Pravahana Sevaya.32 It is observed that all such cases related to a contractual relationship between the Petitioner and the public authority (except in Ratnayakes case where the contractual relationship was between a member and elected committee of a trade union) and the decision impugned was a decision made by the public authority or state enterprise as a contractual partner. I am compelled to observe that the factual matrix in the instant case is substantially different to such cases in several aspects: firstly, the impugned decision is not of the contractual partner (the 4th Respondent) but of the Commissioner, who is a third party; secondly, the impugned decision relates to the exercise of a statutory function by the Commissioner; thirdly, the reliefs sought in the instant application are secured and enforceable by statute. Hence, in my view such decisions do not constitute binding or persuasive authority to the facts and circumstances arising in the instant case. Accordingly, I overrule the preliminary objection raised by the 4th Respondent on this matter.",

    "text": "In its written submissions, the 4th Respondent has raised the above legal objection that, where the Legislature has vested a public authority with discretion, a writ of Mandamus will not lie to direct such public authority as to how that discretion should be exercised. The said legal objection is raised specifically in relation to paragraph (d) of the prayer to the Petitioners petition. Whilst I am in full agreement with the submissions made and authorities cited by the 4th Respondent that the Court should exercise extreme caution in intervening with the exercise of prosecutorial discretion vested in a public authority, I am also mindful that the fullest effect that this objection would be to preclude the Court from granting relief under prayer (d), as it is formulated. In this context, I wish to emphasize that the findings made by me herein regarding the entitlement of the Petitioners to the unpaid salaries and statutory dues and the statutory duty on the Commissioner to recover same on behalf of the Petitioners from the defaulting employer under the Wages Boards Ordinance is not in any manner affected or invalidated by such objection. Hence, the objection will be considered by the Court when formulating the reliefs to be granted.",

In view of the considerable delay that has already occurred and the statutory prescriptive limits that may apply, the 1st Respondent is further directed to consider adopting the most expedient and expeditious course of action available under the applicable statutes to secure the payments due to the Petitioners. Application is allowed.",
