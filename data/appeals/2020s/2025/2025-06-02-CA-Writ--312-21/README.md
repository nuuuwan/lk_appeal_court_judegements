Argued on: 20.07.2023 and 04.06.2024

Decided on: 02.06.2025

S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner was a Professor attached to the Department of Economics in the

University of Jaffna (the 1st Respondent). By the letter dated 12.07.2012 (D27), he was

appointed as the acting Head of the Department of Economics for one month in terms

of Section 51(3) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 (the Act) as the Head of the

Department was made the Dean of the Faculty of Arts. The appointment of the

Petitioner made under Section 51 (3) of the Act was extended thrice for three months.

By the letters dated 04.10.2012 and 30.01.2013 (D28), he had requested from the then

Vice Chancellor to make his appointment permanent for three years in terms of Section

51(1) and 51(2) of the Act. Nevertheless, the Petitioners appointment was not made

permanent for the reason that if his appointment as the Head of the Department had

been made permanent, there would be unrest among the students, as there were

complaints from the female students against him about the sexual harassment.

The Petitioner received the letter dated 03.06.2013 marked as P2 requesting to attend a

preliminary investigation about those complaints and to record his statements. The 25th

and the 26th Respondents were appointed by the University Council to conduct the

preliminary investigation, but the Petitioner objected for the appointment of the 26th

Respondent as he is junior in the academic service to the Petitioner and therefore is not

entitled to conduct the inquiry in terms of paragraph 6.2 of Chapter XXII of the

10

Establishment Code of the University Grants Commission and Higher Education

Institutes (the Code). By the letter dated 05.06.2013 (marked as P4), the Petitioner was

informed to place his objections regarding the inquiry panel before the Council, and the

inquiry was postponed to 13.06.2013. Consequent to the Petitioners request, the

objections placed were tabled at the Council meeting and by the letter dated 11.06.2013

(marked as P6), the Petitioner was informed that the Council had confirmed the

appointments of the 25th and 26th Respondents to the inquiry panel. Thereafter, the

preliminary investigation proceeded in the absence of the Petitioner as he did not

participate in the proceedings, and the 25th and 26th Respondents submitted the

preliminary investigation report marked as P8 to place before the Council meeting. The

Petitioner alleges that in his absence, the preliminary investigation had been completed

ex parte on 27.06.2013, violating the principles of natural justice. Thereafter, the

charge sheet dated 23.07.2013 marked as P10 was issued alleging the abuse of power

in the form of improper conduct, namely sexual harassment, against the female

students. The Petitioner argues that P10 contravenes the provisions of Chapter XXII of

the Code, as the charges are vague and ambiguous, and the charges do not indicate a

specific offence. The Petitioner argues that an explanation of charges should be

provided within 15 days from the date of the charge sheet (P10), and alleges that the

relevant documents were provided to him only on 12.08.2013, despite his request to

provide them. Thereafter, the Petitioner submitted his explanation on 26.08.2013 (P12).

By the letter dated 30.09.2013 marked as P13, the Petitioner was informed that the

11

Council did not accept his explanation and therefore will proceed with the formal

inquiry. By the letter marked as P13, the Petitioner was interdicted with effect from

01.10.2013 and declared the university premises out of bounds from 07.10.2013.

The Council appointed the 27th to 29th Respondents to conduct the formal inquiry

against the Petitioner. At the commencement of the formal inquiry, the Counsel

appeared for the Petitioner raised a preliminary objection about the appointment of 25th

and 26th Respondents to the preliminary investigation committee for the reason that the

25th Respondent is junior to him in the academic staff and the 26th Respondent was

appointed by the then Vice Chancellor without any power to appoint him in

contravention to the paragraph 1.1(b) and 1.3 of the Chapter XXII of the Code. Further,

the Petitioner has taken up the position that the preliminary investigation was carried

out by the 25th and 26th Respondents, without recording his statement, and therefore,

the principles of natural justice were violated. However, the inquiry tribunal consisting

of the 27th to 29th Respondents dismissed the preliminary objections raised by the

learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner by the order dated 26.07.2014 marked as

P15(a) - VII. The Petitioner states that, thereafter, when the formal inquiry commenced

on 30.08.2014, an amended charge sheet dated 30.08.2014 marked as P14, which was

identical to P10, was served on him. At the formal inquiry, evidence was led by both

prosecution and defence, and the formal inquiry was concluded on 01.07.2017.

Thereafter, the parties were allowed, to file written submissions and the tribunal which

was consisted with the 27th to 29th Respondents submitted their inquiry report dated

12

29.12.2017 marked as P18, where the Petitioner was found guilty to all the charges by

the 27th and 28th Respondents with the partial agreement of the 29th Respondent

(P18(a)). Then the Petitioner filed the Writ Application bearing No.88/2018 seeking to

quash the inquiry report marked P18. While this application was pending, the 29th

Respondent submitted a detailed inquiry report prepared by him, dated 15.07.2018,

marked as P30, where he has concluded that the Petitioner should be exonerated from

the charges against him. When this matter was taken up on 30.10.2018 in this Court,

the learned State Counsel appeared for the Respondents made an application to appoint

a different committee (review panel) to consider the evidence already recorded and to

make fresh recommendations to the Council and for the Council to come to a final

determination on the said recommendations (P31). The review panel by the report dated

12.03.2019 marked as P34 recommended that if the Council decide to hold a fresh

inquiry, it to issue a charge sheet and complete the inquiry within two months. The

Petitioner, by letter dated 06.04.2019 marked as P35, objected to the said

recommendations and requested to exonerate him from the charges. The 3rd

Respondent, by letter dated 03.06.2019 marked as P37, informed the Petitioner that the

Council at its 436th meeting accepted the recommendations of the review panel and the

letter marked as P35 will be tabled at the next Council meeting. Thereafter, the

Petitioner has withdrawn the Writ Application No.88/2018, reserving his rights to file

a fresh Writ Application (P38).

13

The 3rd Respondent issued a charge sheet dated 09.08.2019, marked as P39, to the

Petitioner based on the abuse of power and improper behaviour towards the female

students. The Petitioner argues that the charges in P39, in essence, are identical to the

previous charges in the charge sheet marked as P14, it has been issued without

jurisdiction, and the Review panel acted beyond their scope. The Petitioner further

argues that the 29th Respondents report marked as P30 has been disregarded when

framing charges, and the charge sheet contains previously disregarded findings and

includes the findings of the Preliminary Investigation Committee. Furthermore, the

Petitioners legitimate expectation that the disciplinary authority would act in terms of

the Code has been violated. Therefore, the Petitioner argues that the charge sheet

marked as P39 is ultra vires, illegal and null and void.

The Petitioner, by letter dated 18.06.2014 marked as P16, requested the Council to

reinstate him in terms of the Public Administrative Circular No. 6/2004 dated

15.12.2004 (P21(a)). He has been reinstated by the letter dated 01.01.2015 marked as

P17 with effect from 01.10.2013 in terms of the Circular marked as P21(a) and the

Public Administrative Circular No. 6/2004(1) dated 30.12.2011 (P21(b)). According to

the letter marked P17, the Petitioner has been paid his full salary and placed on

compulsory leave with effect from 01.01.2015. The Petitioner argues that the

reinstatement is contrary to the Circulars marked as P21(a) and P21(b) and therefore is

illegal and null and void.

14

Under the above-stated circumstances, before instituting the instant Application, the

Petitioner had instituted a Writ application bearing No. CA Writ 373/2019 in this Court

seeking relief addressing his above-stated grievances. The CA Writ 373/2019 was

supported on 15.09.2020, the learned Senior State Counsel appeared for the

Respondents gave the undertaking that the second formal inquiry will be completed

within 3 months. Thereafter, by the letter dated 19.09.2020 marked as P43, the

Petitioner submitted his explanation to the charge sheet marked as P39. The Petitioner

states that on 29.01.2021, the learned Senior State Counsel appeared for the

Respondents, sought further time to conclude the inquiry. However, the inquiry did not

commence by March 2021. By the letter dated 24.03.2021 marked as P45, the 2nd

Respondent requested the Petitioner to attend the inquiry on 29.03.2021. The Petitioner

states that he had requested the list of witnesses by the letter dated 23.10.2020 marked

as P44.

The Petitioner states that he has sought a postponement of the inquiry as he was given

very short notice of the inquiry and had no information provided as to the inquiry panel

members and the list of witnesses. Thereafter, by the letter dated 31.03.2021 marked as

P45A, the Petitioner was informed that the inquiry has been fixed to be held on

07.04.2021. The Council, on its 447th meeting held on 26.2020 (B27), has appointed a

three-member tribunal (33rd to 35th Respondents). The Petitioner states that even though

a three-member tribunal was appointed, only two members took part in the inquiry on

07.04.2021. At the inquiry, the Petitioners Counsel had raised objections regarding the

15

composition of the tribunal, the format of the charge sheet and the fact that the list of

witnesses was not issued to him to participate in the inquiry. Thereafter, by the letter

dated 08.04.2021 marked as P47, the Petitioner had raised concerns on the conduct of

the inquiry.

On 18.04.2021, which was the second day of the inquiry, the Petitioner had attended

the inquiry in person and informed the tribunal that he is waiting for a reply to the letter

marked P47. Thereafter, the inquiry was re-fixed for 26.04.2021. On the third day of

the inquiry, the Petitioner submitted a written submission (P50) on the objections to the

tribunal. The Petitioner states that the tribunal disregarded his submission and informed

him that a ruling on the objections will be given at the end of the inquiry, and attempted

to resume the inquiry. The Petitioner further avers that he objected to the tribunals

attempt to question a witness who was residing in the USA via Zoom video

conferencing, however, as the tribunal disregarded his objection and continued with the

inquiry, the Petitioner and his Counsel walked out of the inquiry. The Petitioner states

that in terms of the proceedings dated 26.04.2021 marked as P47A III, the inquiry was

proceeded ex parte after the Petitioner walked out of the inquiry. The Petitioner states

that he received a letter dated 27.04.2021 informing that the next hearing of the inquiry

will be held on 28.04.2021, and thereafter, by the letter dated 27.04.2021 marked as

P51, informed his inability to attend the inquiry. Petitioner alleges that the inquiry held

on 28.04.2021 had been conducted ex parte and had recorded evidence of a witness via

Zoom video conferencing. Therefore, the Petitioner argues that the entire inquiry

16

proceeding is arbitrary, unreasonable, ultra vires and violates the legitimate expectation

of the Petitioner.

Therefore, being aggrieved by the aforesaid factors, the Petitioner has invoked the Writ

jurisdiction of this Court seeking the following substantive reliefs, inter alia,

b. Grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the charge sheet produced marked

P39 issued by the 2nd Respondent

c. Grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Report of the Preliminary

Investigation Committee produced marked P-8

d. Grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the appointment of the members

of the Preliminary Investigation Committee

e. Grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the determination of the Council

of the 1st Respondent (2nd to the 23rd Respondents), if any, made in pursuance

of the recommendations of the Review Panel (P34)

f. Grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st Respondent

of placing the Petitioner on Compulsory leave and declaring the University

premises out of bounds (P17)

g. Grant and issue a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st and/ or 2nd and/or the

Council (2nd to the 23rd Respondents) from taking further steps in pursuance of

17

the recommendations of the Review Panel and charge sheet issued in pursuance

thereof, produced marked P39

h. Grant and issue a Writ of Prohibition restraining the 1st and/or the 2nd, 6th to

23rd, 36th to 40th Respondents or any one or more of them from taking any steps

and/or making any decision or determination in furtherance of the purported ex

parte proceedings and Report, if any

i. in the event any steps and/or decision or determination is made by the 1st and/or

the 2nd, 6th to 23rd, 36th to 40th Respondents or any one of them in furtherance

of the purported ex parte any one or more of proceedings and Report, grant and

issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing any such decision or determination made by

1st and/ or the 2nd, 6th to 23rd, 36th to 40th Respondents or any one or more of

them made in furtherance of the purported ex parte proceedings and Report

j. Grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and/or the 2nd, 6th to 23rd,

36th to 40th Respondents to make a decision/determination according to Law on

the basis of the findings of the Review Panel (P34)

k. Grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and/or 2nd. 6th to 23rd.

36th to 40th Respondents to release his increments withheld during his period of

compulsory leave in terms of Paragraph 14.3 of Chapter X of the Establishment

Code for UGC & HEIs, marked in P11(A)

18

l. To issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and/or 2nd 6th to 23rd 36th to 40th

Respondents to rectify the effective date of the Petitioner's full salary and

compulsory leave as 23.07.2014, and to pay the increments during Compulsory

Leave

m. Grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent and/or the

2nd, 6th to 23rd, 36th to 40th Respondents) to release the half salary withheld

during his period of interdiction from 01/10/2013 to 31.12.2014 and to release

the two increments due on 29.11.2013 and 29.11.2014

This Court first observed that, apart from the facts and reliefs sought relating to the

conduct of the second formal inquiry, all the other facts, issues raised and reliefs sought

by the Petitioner in the instant Application are identical to those of CA Writ 373/2019.

Except for the reliefs prayed for in prayers (h) and (i) in the instant Application, the rest

of the reliefs prayed for are identical to the reliefs prayed for in the Petition of CA Writ

373/2019. I have addressed all the reliefs prayed for in the prayer to this Application,

except prayers (h) and (i) in CA Writ 373/2019. Therefore, this Court will not address

the relief prayed for in prayers (b) to (g) and (j) to (m).

The Petitioner argues that the entire inquiry proceeding is arbitrary, unreasonable and

ultra vires and has violated his legitimate expectation of a fair and speedy disciplinary

proceeding. The Petitioners argument is based on the following grounds,

19

1. The inquiry tribunal consisted of only two members (the 33rd and the 34th

Respondents) instead of three members in violation of paragraph 8.5 of Chapter

XXII of the Code.

2. Not recording the objections raised by the Petitioner and not providing a ruling

at the time he raised objections before the inquiry tribunal violates paragraph

11.5 of Chapter XXII of the Code.

3. Conducting the inquiry ex parte violates paragraph 11.2 of Chapter XXII of the

Code.

4. The evidence recorded is not in line with the period mentioned in the charge sheet

marked as P39

5. Delay in conducting the inquiry

The first ground is on the constitution of the inquiry tribunal. The Petitioner argues that

the Council has appointed three members to the inquiry tribunal (33rd to 35th

Respondents), and if three members are appointed, it is mandatory for all the members

to participate in the inquiry. However, only two members conducted the inquiry, which

is a violation of paragraph 8.5 of Chapter XXII of the Code. Paragraph 8.5 reads as

follows,

In the case of serious offences in which persons holding high office in the

commission or a higher educational institution are involved, the disciplinary

authority may in its discretion appoint a tribunal of inquiry consisting of not more

20

than three persons drawn from those to whom power to hold disciplinary inquiries

has been dedicated in paragraph 6

The argument of the Respondents on this is that one of the members was unable to serve

in the tribunal and the members were appointed by the Council in terms of paragraph

6,1 of Chapter XXII of the Code. Paragraph 6,1 reads thus,

Either the Disciplinary Authority or a person or persons comprising a tribunal,

drawn from those in sub-para 6:1:1 may hold a disciplinary inquiry or a

preliminary disciplinary inquiry.

It is evident from paragraph 8.5 that, as the disciplinary authority, the Council has the

power to appoint a tribunal not exceeding three members. Nowhere in the said

paragraph indicate that if three members are appointed, they all should participate in

the inquiry proceedings, and there is no requirement that a minimum of three members

should be present. According to paragraph 6.1, even a single member is empowered to

carry out an inquiry. Therefore, this Court cannot agree with the argument of the

Petitioner that once three members are appointed, there should be three members

throughout the inquiry proceedings.

Petitioner also argues that not recording his objections and not providing a ruling at the

time he raised objections is a violation of paragraph 11.5 of Chapter XXII of the Code.

Paragraph 11.5 reads as follows,

21

Where any matter of procedure or any objection or procedural grounds is raised

at a disciplinary inquiry, the decision of the Tribunal/Inquiry Officer shall be

final. The principle on which decision may be taken is that the objective of the

inquiry is to arrive at the truth speedily, and that technicalities whether

procedural or otherwise should not be allowed to impede the progress of the

inquiry. All objections and rulings thereon with reasons where necessary should

be recorded at the stage at which they are raised.

Citing the last sentence of paragraph 11.5, the Petitioner argues that his objections

marked as P50 were not recorded in the inquiry proceedings marked as P47A-III and

the tribunal stated that a ruling will be given after the inquiry. In this regard, the

Respondents argue that all the objections were recorded and considered by the inquiry

tribunal. When reading paragraph 11.5 as a whole, it is clear that when any objection is

raised before the inquiry tribunal, the decision of the tribunal with regard to such

objection shall be final, and such decision can be taken with the view of completing the

inquiry on time without any hindrance from such objections. The Petitioner himself has

stated the fact that the inquiry panel has stated that a ruling would be given on the

conclusion of the inquiry. Paragraph 11.5 does not imply that when an objection is

raised, it should be provided a ruling at the time it is raised. Therefore, considering the

above facts, this Court cannot agree with the argument of the Petitioner that the inquiry

tribunal has violated paragraph 11.5 of the Code.

22

The Petitioner further argues that on the third and fourth days, the inquiry had been

conducted ex parte in violation of paragraph 11.2 of Chapter XXII of the Code. Thus,

creating procedural irregularities violating the basic principles of natural justice.

Paragraph 11.2 reads as follows,

If the accused person absents himself without any valid reasons, the inquiry

should be adjourned and he should be warned that proceedings will be held ex-

parte. The inquiry, when resumed, should be proceeded with ex-parte if the

accused person persists in his absence".

The Petitioner contends that the inquiry was conducted ex parte on the third day of the

inquiry after he walked out of the inquiry due to his objections as to examining a witness

via Zoom video conferencing was disregarded by the inquiry tribunal. Further, the

inquiry has also been conducted on the fourth day despite his request (P51) not to

conduct the inquiry owing to procedural irregularities. The argument of the

Respondents regarding this is that, in terms of paragraph 1.5 of Chapter XXII of the

Code, any order made under the provisions of the Code should not be invalidated for

the reason of non-compliance with any provision unless it results in a failure of justice.

Paragraph 1.5 reads thus,

No proceedings or orders made under these provisions shall be invalid by reason

only of any infirmity or the non-observance of any provisions, if these have not

resulted in a failure of Justice.

23

The Respondents argue that there is no failure of justice as the Petitioner was given the

right of legal representation by allowing the witnesses to be cross-examined by the

Petitioners Counsel, and all the statements and objections made were recorded. The

Respondents argue that the Petitioner has acted maliciously and with a deliberate

intention to avoid the inquiry proceedings.

This Court will now look into whether there is a violation of paragraph 11.2 of Chapter

XXII of the Code resulting in a procedural irregularity. Whether the tribunal had failed

to follow the proper procedure laid down in the Code depends on whether the provisions

of the Code are mandatory or directory in nature. N. S. Bindras Interpretation of

Statutes (12th edn) at page 435 states thus,

One of the important tests that must always be employed in order to determine

whether a provision is mandatory of directory in character is to consider

whether the non-compliance of a particular provision causes inconvenience or

injustice and, if it does, then the court would say that that provision must be

complied with and that it is obligatory in its character.

Accordingly, if injustice has been caused, the Courts can direct the parties to comply

with that particular provision. In terms of paragraph 1.5, the proceedings or an order

made under the Code cannot be invalidated for non-observance of any provision in the

Code unless it results in a failure of justice. However, in the case of Council of Civil

24

Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service,1 Lord Diplock described procedural

impropriety as one of the grounds for judicial review as follows,

I have described the third head as procedural impropriety rather than failure

to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural fairness

towards the person who will be affected by the decision. This is because

susceptibility to judicial review under this head covers also failure by an

administrative tribunal to observe procedural rules that are expressly laid down

in the legislative instrument by which its jurisdiction is conferred, even where such

failure does not involve any denial of natural justice

Considering the above, this Court is of the view that the tribunal should have warned

the Petitioner that the inquiry will be carried out ex parte if the Petitioner abstains

himself from participating in the inquiry and thereafter the tribunal should have re-fixed

the inquiry without continuing the inquiry proceedings in terms of paragraph 11.2 of

Chapter XXII of the Code. The tribunal should have given such a warning to the

Petitioner when he walked out on the 3rd day of the inquiry. The tribunal had the power

to provide such a warning in terms of paragraph 11.2 and continue the inquiry if the

Petitioner persisted in not appearing before the tribunal on the day the inquiry was

refixed after such warning. The Respondents argue that no failure of justice was caused

to the Petitioner and therefore, in terms of paragraph 1.5, there is no requirement to

comply with paragraph 11.2. However, this Court is of the view that there is a violation

1 [1985] AC 374.

25

of the right to be heard as the inquiry proceeded ex parte. In the case of B. Surinder

Singh Kanda v The Government of the Federation of Malaya,2 Lord Denning held that,

If the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything, it must carry

with it a right in the accused man to know the case which is made against him. He

must know what evidence has been given and what statements have been made

affecting him: and then he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or contradict

them.

Considering the above, this Court is of the view that the tribunal had failed to follow

the procedure laid down in the Code by not warning the Petitioner of the ex parte

hearing and thereby causing a failure of justice as he was denied the opportunity to

know the evidence presented against him and to challenge it.

The Petitioner argues that the evidence recorded is not in line with the period mentioned

in the charge sheet marked as P39. The Petitioner states that the 1st witness, Suvedda

Piratheepan, had studied under the Petitioner in her second year in 2011. Even though

the 1st witness was admitted to the University in 2007, she rejoined in the year 2010

after ending the civil war that prevailed in the country, and according to the sworn

translation of the inquiry proceedings (CA-2), the witness has admitted that she studied

the subject taught by the Petitioner in 2011. The 3rd witness, Ms. Thevakumaran Janani

had admitted to the University for the academic year 2010/2011 and had studied under

2 [1962] UKPC 10

26

the Petitioner in her 1st year in 2011 (CA-4) and the 4th witness Ms. Sasitha Mohanraj

had admitted to the University in 2009 and studied the subject which the Petitioner has

taught in her 2nd year (CA-5). Therefore, the contention of the Petitioner is that the

Petitioner did not teach these three witnesses within the period mentioned in the charge

sheet marked as P39 (12.10.2012 to 15.04.2013). The argument of the Respondents in

this regard is that by the order of the tribunal, the identification of the witnesses was

verified by the Assistant Registrar (Admission Branch) of the 1st Respondent along with

the relevant documents, including the student identification cards.

Even though the Respondents had produced the student identity cards of the 1st, 3rd and

4th witnesses marked as R42(a) to R42(c), those identity cards only indicate the date of

admission of these witnesses to the University and not the period during which the

Petitioner has taught them. When examining the inquiry proceedings marked as CA-2

to CA-4, this Court can observe that the 1st witness had been a student of the Petitioner

in 2011, the 3rd witness had been admitted to the 2010/2011 academic year and studied

under the Petitioner in the second year in 2011 and the 4th witness had been admitted in

2009 and studied under the Petitioner in her 2nd year. Even the Assistant Registrar

(Admission Branch) of the 1st Respondent in her evidence (CA-5) had confirmed the

fact that the 1st, 3rd and 4th witnesses had studied the Petitioners subjects in the years

2010, 2011 and 2010 respectively. Considering the above facts, this Court agrees with

the Petitioner that the evidence of those witnesses is not in line with the period

mentioned in the charge sheet. Therefore, this Court decide that the prosecution has

27

failed to prove that the witnesses were taught by the Petitioner in the years mentioned

in the charge sheet.

The Petitioner further argues that the delay in the conclusion of the inquiry for more

than 10 years is a severe breach of procedural fairness and a violation of the principle

of natural justice. The Petitioner has drawn the attention of Court to the fact that the

preliminary investigation has commenced in 2013, first formal inquiry was concluded

in 2017, the second charge sheet P39 was issued on 09.08.2019 and thereafter the

second formal inquiry was commenced on 07.04.2021 and concluded on 28.04.2021

and the final inquiry report dated 25.06.2021 marked as CA 9(a) was delivered to this

Court on 06.06.2022. The Petitioner also drew the attention of the Court to the fact that

the Respondents have failed to adhere to the undertaking given by the learned State

Counsel appearing for the Respondents before this Court to conclude the inquiry within

three months in CA Writ Application No. 373/2019. The Respondents drew the

attention of the Court to the fact that the delay in conducting the second formal inquiry

was due to the difficulty in gathering members of the tribunal and witnesses under the

Covid-19 restrictions that prevailed in the country at that time. This Court can accept

the fact that the reason to conclude the second formal inquiry was due to Covid-19

pandemic prevailing in the country. However, the question remains as to the delay

within the period from commencing the preliminary investigation (17.04.2013) up to

the date of the second charge sheet marked P39 (09.08.2019). Even though the

Petitioner has filed CA Writ Application No. 373/2019 seeking reliefs relating to the

28

aforesaid period, the Petitioner has not raised the issue of the delay in completing the

inquiry proceedings. C.D. Fields Law relating to estoppel revised by Gopal S.

Chaturvedi3 states thus,

In order to constitute abandonment or waiver, it must be a voluntary act on the

part of the person possessing the rights. Acquiescence or standing by when there

is a duty to speak or assert a right creates an estoppel. In such cases knowledge

of the act must be brought by the acquiescing party. Acquiescence does not mean

simply an intelligent consent, but may be implied if a person is content not to

oppose irregular acts which he knows are being done.

In Nawinna Kottage Dona Lalitha Padmini and Another v N.K.D. Pradeepa Nishanthi

Kumari and Another4, where the Petitioners in that case participated in the hearing of

the appeal and failed to bring to the attention of the Provincial High Court that the

Respondents failed to file the petition of appeal within the stipulated time and raised

the time bar objection for the first time in the Supreme Court. Priyantha Jayawardena

PC, J., citing the above passage from C.D. Fields Law relating to estoppel, held that,

waiver of an objection by a party aggrieved does not afford them the right to raise

such objection at a later stage, as they are estopped by their prior conduct. In the

instant Application, except for the issues raised relating to the conduct of the second

formal inquiry, the rest of the issues raised are identical to the ones raised in CA Writ

3 3rd Edn, at page 166. 4 SC/HC/CA/LA No. 134/2016, SC Minutes of 07.09.2018

29

Application No. 373/2019. The Petitioner has not raised the issue of delay in the CA

Writ Application No. 373/2019. Therefore, the Petitioner is estopped from taking the

argument on the delay in completing the inquiry proceedings in this instant Application.

Considering all above above-stated facts and circumstances, this Court is inclined to

grant reliefs prayed for in prayers (h) and (i) in the Petition and not grant the other

reliefs prayed by the Petitioner. Therefore, this Court grants only the reliefs prayed for

in prayers (h) and (i) of the Petition.
