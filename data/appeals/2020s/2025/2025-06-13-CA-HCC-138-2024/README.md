JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Petitioner, the Attorney General of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka, seeks to challenge the order issued on 17.11.2023 by the learned High

Court Judge of Colombo. This order resulted in the acquittal of the accused-

Page 3 of 11

respondent, who had been indicted before the High Court of Colombo in case No.

HC 2793-21.

The Attorney General indicted the Accused-Respondent in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A)(b) and 54(A)(d) of the Poisons, Opium, and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984. The charges

pertained to the possession and trafficking of 14.28 grams of heroin

(diacetylmorphine) on 21.05.2021

The offence in question occurred on December 20, 2019. According to the journal

entries, the indictment was served on October 6, 2021. The trial commenced on

August 10, 2023, during which PW01, identified as Pradeep Kumara

Disanayakage Ranjan Athula Kumara Disanayaka, began giving evidence in the

examination-in-chief. However, the court adjourned the proceedings and

postponed the trial to November 17, 2023, directing the witness to appear on the

next scheduled date. Notably, the learned high court judge did not provide any

reason for the postponement.

On November 17, 2023, when the matter was taken up in court, the witness in

question was absent. The learned state counsel informed the court that Witness

Number 1 was engaged in a training session at the National Police Training

College. As a result, the counsel requested a postponement and made an

application to reissue the summons for PW01.

The Learned High Court Judge denied the request for postponement and

proceeded with the trial, ultimately acquitting the accused. Upon determining

that the explanation for PW01's absence was unsatisfactory, the Judge further

emphasized that a witness may be excused from appearing in court only in cases

involving national security or under special presidential operations.

Consequently, the trial was concluded.

For the sake of clarity, it would be prudent to reproduce the entire order

pronounced by the Learned High Court Judge.

The issue at hand is whether the Learned High Court Judge has adhered to the

provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure in acquitting the accused when the

prosecution was unprepared to proceed with the trial due to the absence of the

overnight witness.

The witness in question has provided testimony concerning the raid related to this

offense, which involves the possession of heroin, a dangerous drug. It is

acknowledged that the court issued a warning to this witness at the subsequent

hearing. However, the prosecution asserts that the witness was engaged in

training at the time.

It is relevant to examine the following legal provisions that address the discharge

of an accused person in cases where the prosecution is not prepared to proceed

with the trial in a case instituted in a Magistrate Court.

188. (1) If the summons has been issued on a complaint under section 136(1) (a)

upon the day and hour appointed for the appearance of the accused or at anytime

to which the hearing may be adjourned the complainant does not appear the

Magistrate shall notwithstanding anything herein before contained acquit the

accused unless for some reason he thinks proper to adjourn the hearing of the case

to some other hour or day, and may in addition make an order for payment by the

complainant of state costs as hereinafter provided.

Provided that if the complainant appears in reasonable time and satisfied the

magistrate that his absence was due to sickness, accident or some other cause over

which he had no control then the Magistrate shall cancel any order made under

this subsection.

(2) If the summons has been issued a complainant under section 136 (1) (b) or (C

) as the case may be and on the fixed for trial the prosecution is not ready the

court may discharge the accused unless for some reasons the court thinks proper

Page 6 of 11

to adjourn the hearing of the case to some other hour or day.

The aforementioned sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act as stated above

empower the learned Magistrate to either discharge or acquit the accused.

Conversely, the subsequent sections outline the circumstances in which an

application may be made for the learned High Court Judge to refix the matter and

reissue the summons.

263. (1) If from the absence of a witness or any other reasonable cause it becomes

necessary or advisable to postpone the commencement of or adjourn any inquiry

or trial, the court may from time to time order a postponement or adjournment

on such terms as it thinks fit for such time as it considers reasonable and may

remand the accused if in custody or may commit him to custody or take bail in his

own recognizance or with sureties for his appearance,

provided, however, that every trial in the High Court, with a jury or without a

jury, shall as far as practicable, be held day to day.

Accordingly, the Code of Criminal Procedure does not provide for the learned High

Court Judge to discharge or acquit the accused at the trial stage. I believe that the

learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by denying an adjournment. Given

the serious nature of the case before the learned High Court Judge, the main

witness had partially testified regarding the arrest and the production. Notably,

when the witness gave evidence on 10.08.2023, the learned High Court Judge

postponed the matter without providing any reasons. Furthermore, there is no

indication that the witness was absent on any prior date.

Page 7 of 11

The Code of Criminal Procedure includes a provision that enables the learned

High Court Judge to acquit the accused.

200. (1) when the case for the prosecution is closed, if the judge wholly discredits

the evidence on the part of the prosecution or is of opinion that such evidence fails

to establish the commission of the offence charged against the accused in the

indictment or of any other offence of which he might be convicted on such

indictment, he shall record a verdict of acquittal; if however the judge considers

that there are grounds for proceeding with the trail he shall call upon the accused

for his defence.

There is another section that addresses acquittal before the trial by jury.

220 (1) When the case for the prosecution is closed. If the judge considers that

there is no evidence that the accused committed the offence he shall direct the jury

to return a verdict of not guilty.

In both sections, the Judge has the authority to acquit the accused if no evidence

is presented before him or the jury. However, this decision can only be made by

the learned High Court Judge only at the conclusion of the prosecution case.

But in the case of Attorney General v. Gunawardhena, 1996 (2) SLR 149 at page

158, court held that:

Under this provision the Judge can direct the Jury to return a verdict of not guilty

only at the close of the prosecution case. A practice appears to have developed in

our Courts of Judges stopping a case even before that stage is reached. This matter

is referred to in a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Pauline de Croos

v. The Queen,.

"The procedure actually adopted by the learned Judge in this case, is to our

knowledge, not infrequently resorted to by Judges in this country when it becomes

apparent to the Court and counsel that to continue is to waste precious time and

that there is no purpose of "flogging a dead horse". We ourselves have no desire,

Page 8 of 11

at this stage of the development of the practice of stopping trials at their virtual

though not their technical end, to insist on technicality to the point of almost

sanctifying it."

There is no reason to disagree with this dictum; if it is apparent to Court as well

as to counsel that to continue is to waste time and to flog a dead horse, the case

should of course be stopped. Again, if prosecuting counsel concedes or is

constrained to admit that all the evidence on which the prosecution case is based

has been led and what remains to be led is formal evidence or other supporting

evidence which will not take the case any further, then the virtual end of the

prosecution case has been reached and a court may fairly act under Section 212(2).

But if there is such other evidence still to be led on behalf of the prosecution which

the Judge has to reckon and give weight to in considering whether there is a case

to go to the Jury, it appears to us that a Judge will be acting contrary to S.212(2)

in making a direction before he hears that evidence. It was mentioned at the

argument that it is not unknown for a Judge to listen to prosecuting Counsel's

opening address, ascertain from him that he had referred to all the evidence on

which he relies and forthwith turning to the Jury to direct them to bring a verdict

of not guilty. This procedure, if it was in fact actually adopted appears to us to

take the practice, referred to in the dictum cited above, beyond all legitimate

bounds and to be one that should not be followed by High Court Judges.

This dictum was followed by Amaratunga J: in The Attorney General v. Baranage,

2003 (1) SLR 340 . his Lordship has followed the following judgments to come to

the finding.

R. V. Galbraith, 1981 (2) All ER page 1060, Lord Lane CJ held that;

How then should the judge approach a submission of 'no case? (1) If there is no

evidence that the crime alleged has been committed by the defendant, there is no

difficulty. The judge will of course stop the case. (2) The difficulty arises where

there is some evidence but it is of a tenuous character, for example because of

inherent weakness or vagueness or because it is inconsistent with other evidence.

Page 9 of 11

(a) Where the judge comes to the conclusion that the Crown's evidence, taken at

its highest, is such that a jury properly directed could not properly convict on it, it

is his duty, on a submission being made, to stop the case. (b) Where however the

Crown's evidence is such that its strength or weakness depends on the view to be

taken of a witness's reliability, or other matters which are generally speaking

within the province of the jury and where on one possible view of the facts there is

evidence on which a jury could properly come to the conclusion that the defendant

is guilty, then the judge should allow the matter to be tried by the jury. It follows

that we think the second of the two schools of thought is to be preferred.

There will of course, as always in this branch of the law, be borderline cases. They

can safely be left to the discretion of the judge.

It is evident that the learned State Counsel requested a postponement of the trial,

citing the absence of an overnight witness and seeking a reissuance of summons

against him. However, the learned High Court Judge proceeded to acquit the

accused-respondent by the said order.

We acknowledge that prosecution is an ongoing process. Consequently, the learned

High Court Judge could not have formed the opinion that insufficient evidence

was presented to justify acquitting the accused, especially considering that

Witness Number 01 had not yet concluded his testimony.

In my considered view, the learned High Court Judge does not possess the

authority to acquit the accused at this stage of the proceedings.

The present Criminal Procedure Code undeniably grants our courts both authority

and jurisdiction. However, it lacks specific provisions regarding the High Courts

power to discharge or acquit an accused during the trial stage. A comparable

observation was made by Professor G.L. Peiris concerning the Supreme Courts

authority over bail, as outlined in the Administration of Justice Law Act No. 44 of

1973. In Criminal Procedure of Sri Lanka (p. 152), he has noted that:

Unlike the English courts which have jurisdiction under the common law to make

orders for bail in all cases, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has no comparable

Page 10 of 11

power. Its power and jurisdiction in this regard are conferred and regulated by

statute- previously by the Courts Ordinance and the Criminal Procedure Code and

today by the Administration of Justice Law. Thus, the expression "in any case

has been judicially construed as envisaging only cases referred to in statutory

provisions applicable.

The above statement was referred to by Justice Shirani Bandaranayake (as she

was then) in the case of Attorney General and Others v. Sumathipala, 2006 (2)

SLR 126.

It is clear that the learned High Court Judge does not possess the authority to acquit or discharge

an accused during the trial stage.

I acknowledge the considerations expressed in the following judgments concerning

the appeal.

Attorney General v. Gunawardhena, 1996 (2 ) SLR 149, (at 156)

An appeal is a remedy which a party who is entitled to it, may claim to have as of

right, and his object is the grant of relief to a party aggrieved by an order of a court

which is tainted by an error.

The impugned order was made on 17.11.2023 when the overnight witness was

absent and the prosecution State Counsel sought an adjournment of the trial on

that basis.

I am of the view that there was no justification for the learned High Court Judge

to acquit the accused person since this was the second date fixed for the trial,

learned counsel for the state had given a valid reason for postponement. According

to the Section mentioned above, Section 263(1) Court may adjourn the trial.

For the reason stated above, I hold that the learned High Court judge no valid

reason to acquit the accused. Therefore, the order is untenable.

Page 11 of 11

Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 17.11.2023 by the learned High Court

Judge of Colombo and order that the case shall be revert back to the case role of

the court.

The learned High Court Judge is directed to issue notice on the respondent and

fix the, matter for trial and to proceed therefrom in accordance with the law.

The registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this order to the High Court

of Colombo for necessary compliance.
