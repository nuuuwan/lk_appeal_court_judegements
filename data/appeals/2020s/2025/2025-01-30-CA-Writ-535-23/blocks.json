The Petitioner was a jailor guard attached to the Colombo remand prison. He had been appointed as a jailor guard on 02.12.1985 (P1). The parties are not at variance that the Petitioner had failed to report to work from the 13.02.2006. The Petitioner submits that he had fallen sick and it is his contention that he had sent a telegram informing his sickness to the superior over the phone. It is further contended that despite informing, the Petitioner has been sent on vacation of post. The said letter of vacation of post had been signed by the Superintendent of Prisons, Colombo remand prison. The said letter is dated 04.04.2006 (P2). The Petitioner by his prayer (b) is seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said decision.",
