  "keywords": "In a criminal case,  it is the prosecution\u2019s duty to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. This high standard of proof is a fundamental principle of the justice system,  designed to protect the accused from wrongful conviction and endure that only those who are truly guilty are punished. When the prosecution fails to present sufficient evidence to meet the standard,  it is only just and reasonable to afford the benefit of the doubt to the accused.",
