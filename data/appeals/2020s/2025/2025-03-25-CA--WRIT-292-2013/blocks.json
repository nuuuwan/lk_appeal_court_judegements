The Petitioner was informed of its liability to pay VAT by letter dated 26.07.2007 (R4) by the Department of Inland Revenue.",

In terms of Section 21(1) of the VAT Act, a registered person is liable to furnish returns of his supplies to the Commissioner-General. The above-mentioned conduct of the Petitioner itself indicates that the Petitioner has acted as a registered VAT payer, as outlined in the Act. If the Petitioner was not a registered person, there would be no reason for the Petitioner to pay VAT or submit the required returns as specified in the Act. The very same reasons suggest a reasonable conclusion that the Petitioner received the certificate of registration.",

This proactive approach could have fostered a more efficient resolution of the matter. However, it is observed that the Petitioner has raised the issue of non-registration only in 2009 by its letter of appeal P6 against the Notices of Assessment. The Petitioner has not raised the non-registration issue even in the communications marked R3, R7, R10 and P4(b). It appears that the Petitioner has not even prayed for the Petitioner to not be considered a registered VAT payer in the instant application. The Petitioner argued that there is no need to challenge the registration, as there is currently no registration in effect. However, I am of the view that,",
