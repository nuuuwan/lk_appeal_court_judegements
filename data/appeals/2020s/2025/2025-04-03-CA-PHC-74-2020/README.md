JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Registered Owner-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the Appellant) has rented i.e. granted for use at a price the tractor and

the trailer bearing registration nos UPRS 4264 and UPRW 3860

respectively to third parties as per their requirements. On 20.10.2015

the appellant has as usual rented the particular tractor and its trailer

to a third party to dispatch sand extracted from a land named Ura Oya

situated in the Monaragala District. Unknown to the appellant, the

forest officers of the forest range office at Siyamabalanduwa have seized

the tractor and its trailer for them being a vehicle used in committing

Page 5 of 10

an offence described in section 20(1)(g) of the Forest Conservation

Ordinance No.30 of 1945 as amended. Thereafter, the forest range

officer of Siyamabalanduwa has filed action in the Siyamabalanduwa

Magistrate Court against the persons who had extracted sand and

loaded the same onto the trailer of the tractor in violation of the

conditions of the permit issued for such purpose, an offence in terms of

section 20(1) (g) and section 40(1)(b) of the Forest Conservation

Ordinance. The accused have been found guilty, convicted and

sentenced at the conclusion of the trial. Subsequently, a confiscation

inquiry has been held regarding the tractor and its trailer bearing

registration nos UPRS 4264 and UPRW 3860. After the inquiry by order

dated 19.07.2018, the Learned Magistrate has ordered the confiscation

of the said tractor and its trailer.

2. Aggrieved by the order, the appellant has filed an application in revision

[HCRA9/2017] in the High Court of Monaragala. The Learned High

Court Judge by his order dated 26.05.2020, has dismissed the revision

application and affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate dated

19.07.2018. The appellant also being aggrieved by the order of the

Page 6 of 10

Learned High Court Judge of Monaragala dated 26.05.2020 has

preferred the instant appeal to this Court. The facts of this appeal were

not disputed, it is common ground that the forest range officer of

Siyamabalanduwa had instituted proceedings against the persons who

extracted sand and loaded the same onto the trailer of the tractor in

violation of the conditions of the permit issued for such purpose on

20.10.2015 and thereby committing an offence punishable under

sections 20(1)(g) and 40(1)(b) of the Forest Conservation Ordinance

No.30 of 1945 as amended.

Section 40(1)(b) of the Forest Conservation Ordinance No.30 of 1945 as

amended provides,

(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence

(a) All timber of forest produce which is not the property of the State in

respect of which such offence has been committed; and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in

committing such offence,

Page 7 of 10

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence, be

confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is a

third party, no Order of Confiscation shall be made if such owner proves

to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent

the use of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines, as the

case may be, for the commission of the offence.

3. Section 40(1)(b) of the Forest Conservation Ordinance states that upon

a conviction, all tools, vehicles, implements used for the commission of

such offence shall be confiscated. If the owner of a vehicle himself was

the accused in the preceding case, then the issue before a Court in a

confiscation inquiry will not be complicated. However, if the owner is a

third party, it would be necessary for a Court to ascertain whether the

offence has been committed by a particular accused with the

Page 8 of 10

connivance of the owner of such vehicle used for the commission of the

offence.

4. The appellant as the registered owner of the tractor and its trailer in

issue has given evidence at the confiscation inquiry and he has been

the only witness summoned to give evidence on behalf of the owner. The

appellant has stated in his evidence that he has instructed the driver

to not use the said tractor and its trailer to commit any offence. He has

also made a deliberate effort to verify the permit marked -1 to ensure

that the third person renting the tractor and its trailer had a valid

permit for sand extraction which was scheduled for dispatch.

5. The evidence provided by the appellant is implicit and credibility of this

witness has not been impeached. Therefore, the appellant has provided

indicating irrefutable evidence that he has taken necessary precautions

as the owner of the tractor and its trailer to prevent the commission of

an offence using the same.

6. In Adambarage Kelum Thushantha Alwis vs. The Attorney General

[CA (PHC) 211/2019] decided on 07.02.2023, Iddawela, J, has stated,

However, it is more appropriate to note that corroboration of

evidence is not imperative where there is irrefutable evidence at face

value, provided by the appellant to satisfy the court on a balance of

probability that necessary precautionary measures have been taken

as a reasonable owner of the vehicle to prevent the commission of

offences by using the vehicle.

7. It is clear that if an owner presents irrefutable evidence demonstrating

the precautionary measures taken to prevent his vehicle from being

used in the commission of an offence, additional corroborative evidence

supporting the owners narrative is not essential.

8. The Learned High Court Judge has not drawn his attention to the facts

discussed in this judgment, thereby, misdirected himself when he

affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate dated 19.07.2018.

Page 10 of 10

Therefore, I set aside the orders dated 19.07.2018 and 26.05.2020 of

the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge respectively.

9. I direct that the tractor and its trailer bearing registration nos

UPRS4264 and UPRW3860 be released to the appellant.

10. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment

to the Magistrate Court of Siyamabalanduwa for compliance.

Appeal allowed.
