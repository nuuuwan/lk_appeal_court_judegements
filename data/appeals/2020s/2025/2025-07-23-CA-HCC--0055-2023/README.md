Shantha and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section

300 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

As the Appellant and other Accused opted for a non-jury trial, the trial

commenced before a judge and the prosecution had led eight witnesses and

marked production P1 to 3 and closed the case. Learned High Court Judge

having satisfied that the evidence presented by the prosecution warrants a

case to answer, called for the defence and explained the rights of the accused.

The Appellant and the Accused had made dock statements on their behalf

and closed their case.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties only convicted the Appellant under Section 297 of Penal Code

for the 4th count and under Section 300 of Penal Code for the 5th count and

acquitted him from 1st ,2nd, and 3rd charges. The rest of Accused were

acquitted from all the charges.

After considering the sentencing submissions of both parties, the Learned

High Court Judge imposed 10 years rigorous imprisonment for 4th count with

a fine of Rs.50,000/- against the Appellant and in default, one year jail

sentence was imposed. For the 5th count the Appellant was sentenced to 10

years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.50,000/-. In default one year

jail sentence was imposed. Additionally, a compensation of Rs.500,000/-

imposed on the Appellant. In default, two years jail sentence was imposed.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid sentence the Appellant preferred this appeal

to this court.

The Learned President Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. At the

hearing, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

Although the Appellant in his written submission has raised ten grounds of

appeal, but has restricted to one appeal ground during the argument of this

case. The sole appeal grounds states;

The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the evidence

of sudden fight in his judgment.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to PW1 and PW2, who are husband and wife, a dispute arose

regarding cattle owned by the 2nd Accused damaged the crop of PW1. As the

2nd Accused not taken proper action to prevent the damage, he had a

confrontation with the 2nd Accused which led him to assault the 2nd Accused

twice. As a result, the 2nd Accused had come with the 4th Accused and had a

fight with PW1. During the fight one of the Accused fell in to a canal in front

of PW1.

Due to this fight a group of 15 people including the Accused named in the

indictment entered the house of PW1 and had a fight with PW1.Although

PW2 tried to settle the dispute but she could not. At that time the Appellant

had entered PW1s house armed with a gun. Seeing the gun PW1 had

grappled with the Appellant to take the gun out of the Appellant possession,

but it went off causing serious injury in PW1s hand. At the same time the

deceased who came with the Appellant and his group sustained serious gun

shot injurious on his chest. The deceased was pronounced dead on

admission. Further, the evidence revealed that the gun was brought by the

deceased to the place of incident.

Although the learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant under

Section 297 of the Penal Code, it is not clear under what exception of 294 of

CA/HCC/55/2023

6 | P a g e

the Penal Code he had placed his decision. Therefore, it necessary to identify

the exception under which the learned High Court Judge placed his decision.

Learned Presidents Counsel has submitted that the incident had happened

due to a sudden fight. He has substantiated by drawing our attention to page

188 of the brief. Hence, it is very clear that the incident pertaining to this

incident had happened due to a sudden fight.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General in keeping with the highest tradition

of the Attorney Generals Department conceded the stance taken by the

learned Presidents Counsel.

The exception 4 to Section 294 (Murder) of the Penal Code states as

follows:

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or

acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation: - It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the

provocation or commits the first assault.

Section 297 of the Penal Code states as follows:

Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be

punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to twenty years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which

the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing

such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;

or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with

the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention

to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause

death.

7 | P a g e

The learned Presidents Counsel drew our attention that the Appellant was

only 19 years when this unfortunate incident had happened. This position

was conceded by the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General. Although the

incident happened in the year 2005, this matter was concluded in the year

2023, after about 19 years.

Hence, considering all the circumstances of this case, I set aside the sentence

imposed on the Appellant on the 4th and the 5th counts and substitute with

a term of 05 years rigorous imprisonment for the 4th count and 05 years

rigorous imprisonment for the 5th count. I order the sentences to run

concurrent to each other. The fine and the compensation imposed by the

learned High Court Judge to remain same.

As the Appellant is in prison since the date of conviction by the Learned High

Court Judge, I order the sentence imposed by this Court be operative from

the date conviction, i.e. 27/01/2023.

Subject to the above variation the appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Hambantota along with the original case record.
