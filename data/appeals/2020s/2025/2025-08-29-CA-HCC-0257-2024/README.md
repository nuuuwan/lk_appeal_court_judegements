JUDGMENT

1. The sole question for determination in this appeal is whether the sentence imposed on the

accusedappellant (hereinafter the appellant) by the learned High Court Judge of

Negombo is excessive, given the facts of the case and, in particular, the circumstances under

which the alleged offence was committed.

2. The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Negombo for the murder of

Manchanayaka Arachchilage Maheshi Dilshani, an offence punishable under section

296 of the Penal Code. The trial was conducted without a jury by the learned High Court

Judge, who, at the conclusion of the trial, found the appellant guilty under section 297 of

the Penal Code and sentenced him to eighteen years rigorous imprisonment. Additionally,

the appellant was ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000, with a default sentence of three

months imprisonment. Aggrieved by this sentence, the appellant has preferred the present

appeal.

Backg r ou n d to t he ap p e al:

3. At the time of the incident, the deceased was a student of Kotadeniyawa Vidyalaya and was

having an affair with the appellant, a soldier attached to the Sri Lanka Army. Both had

attended the same school before completing their O/L examinations. On the day of

the incident, the appellant, who was on leave, came to the Kotadeniyawa bus station to

meet the deceased. While they were talking, the appellant asked her to go with him, but

she refused. In response, the appellant threatened that he would swallow some tablets

if she did not comply, yet the deceased still refused. Suddenly, the appellant pushed her

against the closed doors of a nearby boutique, stabbed her, swallowed something, and then

collapsed. The deceased was later taken to hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries

after several days.

4. The counsel for the appellant argued that the appellant had acted under grave and sudden

provocation, which was the cumulative effect of a series of events that had transpired

between the deceased and the appellant. It was therefore argued that the sentence imposed

was excessive and should be reduced. It is noteworthy that neither the appellant nor the

respondent filed written submissions in this appeal. When the

CA/HCC/0257/2024

3 | P a g e

matter was taken up for argument, the appellant primarily relied on the grounds set out in

the petition of appeal. A perusal of the High Court proceedings reveals that no

submissions in mitigation were made prior to the imposition of the sentence.

Furthermore, the learned High Court Judge did not provide any reasons for

imposing a sentence of 18 years rigorous imprisonment along with the fine.

5. Therefore, I shall consider whether any mitigating factors exist, taking into account the

facts of the case, particularly the attendant circumstances, the ages of both the victim and

the appellant, and, more importantly, the modus operandi of the crime, along with other

relevant considerations.

6.It is undisputed that the appellant stabbed the deceased, who later succumbed to her injuries

at the Gampaha Hospital. The evidence establishes that the appellant and the deceased

were engaged in conversation shortly before the incident. In his testimony, the

appellant admitted that he had purchased a knife on his way to meet the deceased, claiming

it was for self-defence as he believed certain persons were waiting to assault him, a claim I

am not inclined to accept for the reasons mentioned below.

7. Weerapppulige Mahesh Kumara Ranasinghe, a defense witness, confirmed that the

appellant and the deceased were having an affair. Since the appellant didn't have a phone

at the time, Ranasinghe helped them communicate. According to Ranasinghe, the

day before the incident, the deceased called him and asked him to tell the appellant to meet

her. Ranasinghe passed on this message.

8. This testimony shows that Ranasinghe was one of the appellants closest friends and was

aware of the affair. However, Ranasinghe did not provide any evidence that anyone was

planning to assault the appellant. If there had been a plan to assault the appellant, as he

claimed, it is highly likely he would have told Ranasinghe, especially since

Ranasinghe was the one who arranged the meeting with the deceased. Therefore, the

appellant's reasons for buying the knife are unconvincing and cannot be accepted.

9. In determining the appropriateness of the sentence in the present case, the following

authorities would be of considerable assistance.

10. As to the matter of assessing sentence in a particular instance, Basnayake A.C. J in the case

of Attorney-General v H.N. de Silva (57 NLR 121) stated as follows;

CA/HCC/0257/2024

4 | P a g e

... in assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, a

Judge should consider the matter of sentence both from the point of view of

the public and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the question

only form the angle of the offender. A Judge should, in determining the

proper sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from

the nature of the act itself and should have regard to the punishment

provided in the Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is

charged. He should also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent

and consider to what extent it will be effective. "

11. In Dhananjoy Chaterjee vs State of West Bengal [1994 SCR (1) 37, 1994 SCC (2) 220]

Indian Supreme Court authoritatively set out some important factors that are to be

considered in determining the sentence on an accused person in a crime against a

woman as follows:

In recent years, the rising crime rate-particularly violent crime against

women has made the criminal sentencing by the courts a subject of concern.

Today there are admitted disparities. Some criminals get very harsh

sentences while many receive grossly different sentence for an essentially

equivalent crime and a shockingly large number even go unpunished,

thereby encouraging the criminal and in the ultimate making justice suffer by

weakening the system's credibility. Of course, it is not possible to lay down

any cut and dry formula relating to imposition of sentence but the object of

sentencing should be to see that the crime does not go unpunished and the

victim of crime as also the society has the satisfaction that justice has been

done to it. In imposing sentences, in the absence of specific legislation,

Judges must consider variety of factors and after considering all those

factors and taking an over-all view of the situation, impose sentence

which they consider to be an appropriate one. Aggravating factors cannot be

ignored and similarly mitigating circumstances have also to be taken into

consideration.

In our opinion, the measure of punishment in a given case must depend

upon the atrocity of the crime; the conduct of the criminal and the

defenceless and unprotected state of the victim. Imposition of appropriate

punishment is the manner in which the courts respond to the society's cry for

justice against the criminals. Justice demands that courts should impose

CA/HCC/0257/2024

5 | P a g e

punishment fitting to the crime so that the courts reflect public abhorrence of the

crime. The courts must not only keep in view the rights of the criminal but also the

rights of the victim of crime and the society at large while considering imposition

of appropriate punishment.

12. In the case of Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684, (1992) 3 SCC

700, the Court established the principle that the punishment for a crime should be

proportionate to the crime committed and the offenders circumstances. This

decision highlighted the need for the sentencing Judge to consider the nature of the crime,

the motive, the method of commission, and the offenders previous conduct, as well as the

nature of the society and the public conscience. The Court emphasized that the

sentence should not be excessively harsh or unduly lenient.

13. Similarly, in State of Maharashtra v. Sukhdev Singh (1992) 3 SCC 700, the court held

that while the law prescribes a maximum sentence for a particular offence, it does not

mandate that sentence in every case. The court emphasized that the sentencing Judge

must exercise discretion in determining the appropriate sentence based on the facts and

circumstances of the case, including aggravating, and mitigating factors.

14. Overall, these cases emphasize the importance of considering the individual

circumstances of each case when determining an appropriate sentence. Sentencing Judges

must take into account the nature of the crime, the offenders circumstances, aggravating

and mitigating factors, and the principles of proportionality and fairness.

15. In Ravji v . Sta t e of Raja s t h an (1996 (2) SCC 175). It has been held that:

It is the nature and gravity of the crime but not the criminal, which are germane for

consideration of appropriate punishment in a criminal trial. The Court will be

failing in its duty if appropriate punishment is not awarded for a crime which has

been committed not only against the individual victim but also against the society to

which the criminal and victim belong. The punishment to be awarded for a crime must

not be irrelevant but it should conform to and be consistent with the atrocity and

brutality with which the crime has been perpetrated, the enormity of the crime

warranting public abhorrence and it should "respond to the society's cry for justice

against the criminal". If for extremely heinous crime of murder perpetrated in a very

brutal manner without any provocation, most deterrent punishment is not given, the

case of deterrent punishment will lose its relevance.

CA/HCC/0257/2024

6 | P a g e

16. In Mahesh v . Sta t e of M. P . (1987) 2 SCR 710), this Court while refusing to reduce the

death sentence observed thus:

"It will be a mockery of justice to permit the accused to escape the extreme

penalty of law when faced with such evidence and such cruel acts. To give

the lesser punishment for the accused would be to render the justice system

of the country suspect. The common man will lose faith in courts. In such

cases, he understands and appreciates the language of deterrence more

than the reformative jargon."

17. Therefore, undue sympathy, resulting in the imposition of an inadequate sentence, would

cause greater harm to the justice system by undermining public confidence in the

efficacy of the law, and society cannot long endure under such serious threats. It is,

therefore, the duty of every court to impose a proper sentence, having regard to the nature

of the offence, the manner in which it was executed or committed, and other relevant

considerations.

18. In Ahmed Hussein Vali Mohammed Saiyed v. State of Gujarat, (2009) 7 SCC 254: it

was held:

The object of awarding appropriate sentence should be to protect the society and to

deter the criminal from achieving the avowed object to (sic break the) law by

imposing appropriate sentence. It is expected that the courts would operate the

sentencing system so as to impose such sentence which reflects the conscience of

the society and the sentencing process has to be stern where it should be. Any

liberal attitude by imposing meagre sentences or taking too sympathetic view merely

on account of lapse of time in respect of such offences will be result wise

counterproductive in the long run and against the interest of society which needs to

be cared for and strengthened by string of deterrence inbuilt in the sentencing

system.

Justice demands that courts should impose punishment befitting the crime so that

the courts reflect public abhorrence of the crime. The court must not only keep in

view the rights of the victim of the crime but also the society at

large while considering the imposition of appropriate punishment. The court will be

failing in its duty if appropriate punishment is not awarded for a crime which

has been committed not only against the individual victim but also against the

society to which both the criminal and the victim belong."

CA/HCC/0257/2024

19. As discussed above, every court has a duty to impose a sentence that is

proportionate to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or

committed. In doing so, courts must take into account all relevant facts and

circumstances bearing on the question of sentence and ensure that the punishment

imposed is commensurate with the gravity of the offence.

20. According to the autopsy report, there are four ante mortem injuries, which are as

follows:

a. Stab injury, sutured, partially healed, 3.5cm obliquely placed on right upper

abdomen. The lower end of the injury was situated 7cm away from midline and

5cm above the umbilicus. It has penetrated through subcutaneous tissues,

peritoneum, liver, gall bladder, duodenum, and pancrease. It was directed

medically downwards and backwards. The depth of the injury was 15cm.

b. Cut injury, sutured, partially healed, 4cm, obliquely placed on right lower

chest. The lower end of the injury was situated 15cm below and 5cm away

from nipple. It has penetrated only through subcutaneous tissue and muscle

layer of the chest wall.

c. Cut injury. V shaped, suture, partially healed, 3.5cm placed on back of the

left elbow joint. It has penetrated only through subcutaneous tissue.

d. Cut injury. Sutured, partially healed, 4.3cm, obliquely placed on back of the

midline of the trunk. The lower end of the injury was situated 26cm below the

nape of the neck. It has penetrated through subcutaneous tissue, muscle layers

and made cut injury in 2nd lumber vertebrae.

21. The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO), in his testimony, clearly stated that injury No. 1 was

sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The nature of the injuries described

in the postmortem report speaks volumes about the severity and vindictiveness with which the

appellant attacked the hapless victim.

22. The lay witnesses testified that the knife remained embedded in the deceased when she was

taken to the hospital. This was corroborated by the JMO who noted from the deceaseds bed

head ticket that the stabbed knife was removed and handed over for medico-legal purposes,

underscoring the gravity of the force used by the appellant. It is also on record that the

deceased attempted to board a bus, but the appellant restrained her and stabbed her.

CA/HCC/0257/2024

8 | P a g e

23. After the deceased was stabbed in the abdomen, she bent over. The appellant then

stabbed h e r a second time in the back, a fact that was confirmed by medical

evidence.

24. This offense was not only inhuman and barbaric but also a ruthless crime committed in

broad daylight. It took the life of a young, unarmed, and helpless schoolgirl. The autopsy

report details the injuries the appellant inflicted upon the deceased.

25. It's important to stress that the deceased suffered her fatal injuries while speaking with the

appellant, with whom she was having an affair. There's no evidence that the deceased

was ever aggressive toward the appellant on that day. The appellant's horrifying cruelty

toward the teenage schoolgirl is especially shocking when considering the eyewitness

accounts of the tragic incident.

26. The only mitigating factors in this case are the appellants tender age, being 21 years at

the time of the offence, and the absence of any previous convictions. The court must

carefully balance these considerations, taking into account the victims suffering as well as

the broader message the sentence conveys to the society.

27. The Court would fail in its duty if it did not give an appropriate punishment for a crime

committed against both the individual victim and the society. It is my view, that the

punishment for a crime should be based on how severe it was, the criminal's actions, and

the victim's vulnerability. When courts impose an appropriate punishment, they are

responding to societys demand for justice. The punishment should fit the crime,

showing the publics disgust with the act. Courts must consider the rights of the victim

and society, not just the criminal, when deciding on a punishment. At the same time,

court shall not lose the sight of its duty to punish crimes appropriately, as they are

committed against society as a whole, not just the individual victim.

28. I may also observe that the practice of imposing suspended sentences on first offenders

risks setting a bad precedent and it would encourage individuals to commit serious offences

once in their lifetime under the mistaken belief that, as first offenders, they would escape

custodial imprisonment. The inevitable consequence would be a society increasingly

permeated with crime. Courts must therefore be vigilant to guard against such a

phenomenon, which is almost certain to occur if suspended terms are routinely granted to

first offenders.

CA/HCC/0257/2024

9 | P a g e

29. Therefore, in my considered view, the Court ought not to impose suspended sentences on

first offenders, save where compelling mitigating circumstances exist, such as ignorance,

negligence, or a failure to appreciate the gravity of the offence by reason of tender age, which

would justify and inspire confidence in the Court to exercise leniency. In this case, the

aggravating factors clearly outweigh the mitigating ones.

30. In the instant case, the appellant was serving in the Sri Lanka Army at the time of committing

the offence. Accordingly, having undergone military training, he was expected to conduct

himself with greater responsibility and discipline than an ordinary person.

31. Having considered the foregoing, I find no justification to extend leniency towards the

appellant, particularly in view of the brutality exhibited in the commission of the crime.

32. The appellant was indeed fortunate that the learned High Court Judge proceeded under

section 297 of the Penal Code, despite overwhelming evidence indicating a premeditated

attack.

33. Therefore, I see no mitigating factors in the present case in favor of the appellant and hence,

see no reasons to disagree with the appropriateness of the sentence imposed by the learned

High Court Judge.

34. Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal. The prison term shall run from the date of conviction,

namely 31 July 2024.
