This order pertains to whether to issue notice to the Respondents and to grant interim

reliefs.

The Petitioners instituted this application by petition dated 30.12.2024 seeking inter alia

writs in the nature of Certiorari to quash the decision marked P28 to disqualify the

Petitioners on the purported condition that the Petitioners are in default of arrears

payments pertaining to parking rentals due to the 1st Respondent and a writ of

Prohibition restraining the 1st to 3rd Respondents and/or their employees and/or servants

and/or agents and/or any one acting under them from disqualifying the Petitioners from

placing valid bids to the tender for the leasing out of operation and management of road

Page 4 of 10

side parking fee collection in the city of Colombo stage xxvi, on the purported basis that

they are in default of arrears payments pertaining to parking rentals.

The facts relevant to this case are as follows:

The Petitioners state that the 1st Respondent initially carried on the operation and

management of parking fee collection in the city of Colombo which was later decided to

be leased out. The Petitioners further state that the Petitioners have been carrying on

the said operation and management of parking fee from or about 2019.

The Petitioners aver that the 1st Respondent called for bids under the tender for the

leasing out of operation and management of Road side parking fee collection in the

selected areas in Colombo Stage XXI for Ananda Kumaraswamy Mawatha, F.R.

Senanayake Mawatha, Sri Sangarajah Mawatha/ Sumanatissa Mawatha, Stage XXV for

Jawatta Road and Jayantha Weerasekara Mawatha by newspaper advertisements.

Consequent to being the most responsive bidder, the Municipal Commissioner accepted

the bid of the 1st Petitioner for the aforesaid roads. The 1st Petitioner was also awarded

the leasing out and management of Parking fee collection in Orabipasha Mawatha and

T.B. Jaya Mawatha under Stage HQ 08.

The Petitioners further aver that the 1st Respondent called for bids under the tender for

the leasing out of operation and management of Road side parking fee collection in the

selected areas in Colombo Stage XXIV for 1st Cross Street, Stage XX for Bank of Ceylon

Mawatha and Kinsey Road, Stage XXIII for Sea Beach Road and Stage XXI for Bankshall

Street by newspaper advertisements. Consequent to being the most responsive bidder,

the Municipal Commissioner accepted the bid of the 2nd Petitioner for the aforesaid roads.

Page 5 of 10

The 2nd Petitioner was also awarded the leasing out and management of Parking fee

collection in D.R. Wijewardhana Mawatha and Prince Street under Stage HQ 08 and in

Beach Street and Prof. Nandadasa Kodagoda Mawatha under Stage HQ 09.

Further, the Petitioners state that the 1st Respondent called for bids under the tender

for the leasing out of operation and management of Road side parking fee collection in

the selected areas in Colombo Stage XXV for E.W. Perera Mawatha (in front of the new

OPD), Stage XVIII for 4th Cross Street, and Stage XX for Dharmapala Mawatha and

Lotus Road only in front of Telecom by newspaper advertisements. Consequent to being

the most responsive bidder, the Municipal Commissioner accepted the bid of the 3rd

Petitioner for the aforesaid roads. The 3rd Petitioner was also awarded the leasing out

and management of Parking fee collection in Laundrywatta Nawam Mawatha and

Vinayalankara Mawatha under Stage HQ 09 and Duke Street and Khan Clock Tower in

front of Wimaladharma under Stage HQ 08. The Petitioners further state that by

subsequent decisions taken by the 1st Respondent and/or its Municipal Commissioner,

these contracts were extended until 31st December 2024.

According to the Petitioners, they could not collect the anticipated revenue during the

years 2020, 2021, and 2022 due to the reduction of parking, amidst the Covid-19

pandemic, and economic and political crisis. The Petitioners state that they made

representations to the 1st Respondent and its Council regarding the difficulties they faced

and sought relief pertaining to the monthly rental payments payable to the 1st

Respondent. Consequent to such representations, the 3rd Respondent by letter dated

31.10.2022 informed the Petitioners that an analysis of the possibility of rental reduction

due to the economic crisis will be carried out from March 2022 to the end of September

2022. The Petitioners further state by resolution bearing No. 3366 of the Colombo

Page 6 of 10

Municipal Council marked P24, the 1st Respondent Council approved the

recommendations of the Standing Committee Finance of the 1st Respondent Council.

The Petitioners state that though the Petitioners were informed that the amounts to be

deducted from the outstanding arrears had already been calculated, they were not

informed of the exact amounts to be deducted.

The Petitioners aver that by paper notices published on 03rd October 2024 marked P27,

the 1st Respondent advertised a tender for the leasing out of operation and management

of road side parking fee collection in the city of Colombo Stage XXVI which contained

a condition that disqualifies a party with an arrears/ outstanding amount for parking fee

from participating in the tender. The Petitioners further aver that according to the

tender document marked P28, the following is contained under Eligibility of Bidders in

Section I of the said document.

2.2 The CMC will not consider the following persons/companies for the award of

the contract.

2. Who are in defaulted arrears of payments of parking rentals to the CMC

The Petitioners contend that though the Petitioners have repeatedly requested for a

computation of the amount deductible from the arrears rental for the purpose of settling

the outstanding from the 1st Respondent Council, such was not communicated to the

Petitioners. The Petitioners state that the Petitioners participated at the pre-bid meeting

held on 15th October 2024 and raised concerns regarding the impossibility created for

them to place a valid bid under the impugned tender which was answered by the officers

of the 1st Respondent including the 3rd Respondent that the Petitioners are not eligible

Page 7 of 10

to place bids. The Petitioners further state that the Petitioners could not place the bids

prior to the closing date. Further, the Petitioners state that the Petitioners extended the

validity of the performance securities placed on behalf of them pertaining to contracts

already awarded to them until 31st March 2025 upon the 3rd Respondents request.

The main grievance of the Petitioners is that the decision of the Respondents to disqualify

the Petitioners based on the impugned criteria is illegal and ultra vires.

In this context, the Petitioners have invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking

inter alia, writs of Certiorari to quash the decision marked P28 disqualifying the

Petitioners from participating and/or placing a valid bid for the tender for the leasing out

of operation and management of road side parking fee collection in the city of Colombo

Stage XXVI.

On the other hand, the Respondents by their Statement of Objections dated 10.01.2025

state that, the Petitioners were given several concessions during the economic crisis from

March 2022 to September 2022. Further, the Respondents aver that even if the

deductions are yet to be made as claimed by the Petitioners, it shall only be in respect of

4 contracts, not in respect of all the contracts. The Respondents further aver that even

after the expiration of the concession/waiving off of the totality of the monthly rental

during the concession period, the Petitioners have continuously defaulted on the monthly

rental, therefore, the Petitioners are defaulters.

In the instant application, the conduct of the Petitioners is crucial. The Petitioners have

failed to pay the rentals which are due to the 1st Respondent Council claiming that the

Respondents failed to communicate the exact outstanding amount to be settled by the

Petitioners. Nevertheless, the Petitioners have defaulted on the payments of the

Page 8 of 10

contracts that were not subject to the concessions granted due to the economic crisis and

did not even pay the rentals for the year 2024. The Petitioners conduct therefore is a

question of law which denies them the reliefs sought from this Court.

Our Courts have held that even though the Petitioners are entitled to relief, still the

Courts can refuse such, considering his conduct.

In Jayaweera v. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and Another

(1996) 2 SLR 70 at page 73, His Lordship Jayasuriya, J held that:

I hold that the Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a

writ of certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right

or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the court has a

discretion to deny

him relief having regard to his conduct; delay, laches, waiver, submission to

jurisdiction are all valid impediments which stand against the grant of relief.

Applying these principles, I hold that this court is not disposed to grant the

Petitioner discretionary relief upon this application in view of inordinate delay

and laches in filing the application in Court.

In Center for Environmental Justice and Others v. National Housing Development

Authority and Others, CA/WRIT/264/19, Decided on 23.02.2022, His Lordship

Mohammed Laffar, J held that:

In this context, I observe that the Petitioners have been negligent in not

addressing the Court in a timely manner and that they have slept over their rights,

if any, without any reasonable excuse whatsoever. Therefore, as identified above,

the Petitioners prayer for grant of Writs by prayers (c) and (d) being substantial

Page 9 of 10

relief sought in their Petition, cannot be granted due to severe laches. This Court

also observes that the rest of the relief sought by the Petitioners are consequential

to the said relief thereto and thus will not be entitled to such.

This Court notes that the Respondents have informed the 3rd Petitioner by letters dated

13.09.2024 marked R4(x), R4 (xxiii), and R4 (xxviii) that the total amount due up to

31.08.2024 is respectively Rs. 19,143,841.93, Rs. 924,143.55 and Rs. 277,120.00. Further,

the 2nd Petitioner was informed by letters dated 13.09.2024 marked R4 (xi), R4(xviii),

and R4(xix) that the total amount due up to 31.08.2024 is Rs. 11,109,269.26, Rs.

8,611,725.21 and Rs. 648,410.47 respectively. Further, the 1st Petitioner was also

informed by the Respondents by letters dated 13.09.2024 marked R4(xiv), R4 (xv), and

R4 (xxii) that the total amount due up to 31.08.2024 is Rs. 3,512,087.21, Rs. 7,667,307.83,

and Rs. 557,520.45 respectively. These amounts are in accordance with the tenders that

each Petitioner has been awarded for the respective roads.

This Court notes that these amounts due are collected from the public that were misused

by the Petitioners. We also observe that in the year 2024, there is no proof that the

Petitioners have paid the amount due to the 1st Respondent Council. This Court is

therefore mindful that if the 1st Respondent Council is not paid the due, how the Council

would function without such revenue.

We further observe that according to the petition, the 1st Respondent has taken steps to

call for a new tender and successful bidder has been selected and tenders have been

awarded to them.

We are also mindful that, the advertisement which was published on 3rd October 2024

indicates that whoever has defaulted the arrears of payments of parking rental to the 1st

Page 10 of 10

Respondent is disqualified from placing bids. But the Petitioners have waited for 4

months to challenge that said decision. Further, we note that this condition applied to

all the tenders for years and even applied to the Petitioners when they were awarded the

tenders initially in 2021 as well.

In view of this reasoning, we dismiss this application with costs of Rs. 50,000/-.
