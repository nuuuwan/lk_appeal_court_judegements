In considering Regulations 8 and 10 of Regulations and the Navy Order 0642, this Court is of the view that the Promotion Board was acting within the parameters of the said Regulation in the best interest of the Navy in recommending the Petitioner subject to the comment on the AWOL charge. . It is also pertinent to note that even the document marked as 1R15, a confidential report to the Secretary, Ministry of Defence pertaining to the ROG of the Petitioner refers to an NSC decision about not promoting absentees to two star ranks. The said decision per say has not been submitted to this Court. Further, the Court observes that though the report is submitted to the Secretary, Ministry of Defence, it does not contain a clear decision pertaining to the Petitioners request as the last paragraph of the said confidential report states that they are submitting the ROG submitted by the officer with recommendations for necessary action. Thereby allowing the decision to be taken by the relevant authority. Hence, the decision to promote the Petitioner or not to promote the Petitioner is not taken in 1R15. The said document is only a recommendation. By the said document the author in a confidential note has given reasons and cited precedents in arriving at the conclusion for not recommending the Petitioner. However, still the Commander of the Navy has submitted redress of grievance to the relevant authority for the said authority to take necessary action. In view of the above, this Court finds the decision not to promote the Petitioner to the rank of Rear admiral is not by the Navy Commander.

Even the said document does not contain any adverse decisions against the Petitioner. In the said document, paragraph 5 gives the history of the Petitioners AWOL charge and in paragraph 6 the Promotion Board has commented that they have learnt that the officers found guilty of AWOL previously have not been considered for promotions. Yet in their recommendations the Promotion Board has recommended the Petitioner but subject to the instructions or directives of the Ministry of Defence pertaining to the promotions of officers found guilty of AWOL.

Though the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the Petitioner submitted that in considering the promotions, the Promotion Board should only consider three grounds as stated in Regulation 10. This Court observes that Regulation 10 gives the Promotion Board a wider discretion in making recommendations. It is observed that pursuant to Regulation 10(a), (b) and (c) the Promotion Board is to consider the past record and justify whether there are favourable conditions for his promotion and his suitability in every respect to fill, with competence, all or any of the appointments likely to be available to him in the higher rank for which he is being considered. Further, it requires the Promotion Board to take into consideration the service among other things and whether it is clearly in the best interest of the Navy. Hence, this Court is not inclined to accept the Petitioners argument that the failure to recommend his name was not in compliance of Navy Order 0642 or the Regulations. In our view as stated above the Promotion Boards comment reflected in 1R10 falls within the parameters of Regulations 8 and 10. Thus, we do not find the recommendation ultra vires.",

    "text": "The Petitioner in his written submission argued that the document marked as P12 cannot be applied retrospectively to penalise or deny the Petitioner of his promotion. The Petitioner cited the cases of Dr. K.M.L. Rathnakumara and 13 others v. The Postgraduate institute of Medicine and 52 others, SC Appeal 16/2014 decided on 30.03.2016 which was followed by this Court in T/Captain B.L.T. Gayan v. Commander of the Sri Lankan Army, CA Writ 108/2023 decided on 10.03.2024 in support of his argument. In response it is contended the document marked P12 is dated 09.07.2021 and the Petitioners Promotion Board was appointed on subsequent to P12 hence there is no retrospective application. However, the Petitioner never challenged his non appointment at the time the 2nd Respondent was appointed which was in 2023. In any event he cannot challenge the same now as it becomes a belated challenge after sleeping over his rights.",

While agreeing with the said submission however, this Court also observes that the said decisions should be reasonable. In this instance, the Petitioner has failed to challenge and demonstrate that there was or would be an unreasonableness that maybe taken towards the Petitioner in recommending for future promotions as it is observed that the Sri Lanka Navy has been consistent with its policy on zero tolerance for absentees when it comes to promotion of senior ranks.",
