JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Kurunegala

for committing one count of grave sexual abuse on the victim Paboda Shasni

Ivon, punishable under Section 365(B) 2 (b) of the Penal Code as amended

by Acts No.29 of 1998 and No.16 of 2016.

The trial commenced on 16/10/2020. After leading the evidence of the

victim, the prosecution had amended the charge from fingering the vagina to

licking of the vagina of the victim by the Appellant.

After leading all necessary witnesses, the prosecution had closed the case on

02/11/2021. The Learned High Court Judge had called for the defence on

the same day and the Counsel for the Appellant had moved for a day to call

witnesses on his behalf. The Appellant had made a dock statement and called

four witnesses in support of his case.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties, convicted the Appellant charging under Section 365 (B) (2)(b) of

the Penal Code as amended, and sentenced the Appellant to 08 years

rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs.10,000/- subject to a

default sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment. In addition, a

CA/HCC/0155/22

3 | P a g e

compensation of Rs.50,000/- was ordered with a default sentence of 01-year

rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that

the Appellant had given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. The Appellant was connected via Zoom from prison

during the argument.

The following grounds of appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant

at the argument.

1. The date of incident has not been established by the prosecution.

2. There is no corroboration for the evidence of the key witness PW1.

3. There are material omissions and contradictions in the evidence of

PW1 which the Learned High Court Judge had failed to take into

consideration.

Background of the case albeit as follows:

PW1 Praboda born on 25.08.2009, was studying in grade five at the Monty

Gopallawa Primary School when she encountered the unpleasant incident as

she described in her evidence. She had known the Appellant since she was

in grade three. The Appellant was a frequent visitor to her home with his wife

and the victim was aware that the Appellant used to sell coconuts and

jackfruits under a mango tree near a place called King Water. The Appellant

used to stay at the victims house with his wife whenever he goes to sell

coconuts and jackfruits.

The victims house consisted with two rooms. Whenever the Appellant stayed

with his wife in her house, they used to sleep in one room and the victim

with her parents occupy the other room. The incident had happened during

the April school holidays in the year 2018. One day during the vacation,

CA/HCC/0155/22

4 | P a g e

when the Appellant and his wife were at home, the victim went to sleep and

suddenly woke up having felt that someone licking her vagina. When she

opened her eyes, she had seen the Appellant near her bed and her

undergarment had been removed half way down. When she tried to go to her

grandmother, who was the only person at home at that time, the Appellant

prevented her and had threatened that he would kill her father and mother

in the event she divulges this incident to her parents. Although the victim

managed to go to her grandmother, had not disclosed anything to her due to

fear. After committing this offence, the Appellant left victims house with his

wife. The fear engulfed on her prevented her from divulging this incident to

her parents too.

According to the victim, she had first informed this incident to her classmate

Mihirangi PW10, in presence of another classmate Janani. One day the

victim had a fight with Janani in the classroom while their English teacher

was teaching English. The reason for the fight was that Janani had

threatened the victim that she was going to leak this incident to the teacher.

Seeing this incident, the English teacher PW9 Chaturangi Konara, after

making inquiry from the victim, had taken the victim to year 01 class teacher

PW8 Wasantha Samaranayake. After returning from the school, the victim

had narrated the incident to her mother PW2 Damayanthi Hemamali.

Before lodging a police complaint, the matter was brought to the attention of

PW7 Lalitha Rajapaksha, the Grama Sevaka of the area on 02/08/2018 by

PW2 the mother of the victim.

According to PW5 Waidyaratne, the JMO who examined the victim stated

that he examined the victim on 14/08/2018 at the District Hospital, Matale.

In the history, the victim had stated that the Appellant after licking had

inserted his finger into her vagina. He had also threatened not to divulge this

incident to anybody.

CA/HCC/0155/22

5 | P a g e

In the indictment filed by the prosecution, it had only referred to the act of

fingering into the vagina of the victim by the Appellant. But when the victim

giving evidence before the High Court, she restricted her evidence to the act

of licking her vagina by the Appellant only. Hence, immediately after the

conclusion of victims evidence, the Learned State Counsel with the

permission of the Court amended the indictment from the act fingering to

licking of her vagina. As such, the indictment was read to the Appellant again

after the amendment. Although an opportunity was awarded to the Appellant

to cross examine the victim over the amendment to the indictment, the

Learned Counsel for the defence had waived that opportunity. (Page 159 of

the brief)

The basic foundation in a criminal trial is the charge. By charging, an

accused is provided information as to the nature of the allegation levelled

against him. The charge must identify the act committed by the accused, the

law alleged to have been violated by him and particulars pertaining to the

alleged offence must be specified in the charge.

It is the profound duty of a prosecutor to frame the charge/s after careful

consideration of evidence available in the case at the time of drafting the

charge. The requirements of a valid charge are set out in Sections 164 and

165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

In the first ground the Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant

contended that the date of incident has not been established by the

prosecution.

In the indictment the date of offence mentioned as between 01st April 2018

and 30th April 2018. The victim giving evidence had clearly said that the

incident had taken place during the April school vacation of the year 2018.

As per the Section 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979,

the Appellant had been given reasonable notice the time of incident. For

clarity the Section 165 of CPC is re-produced below:

CA/HCC/0155/22

6 | P a g e

165. Particulars as to time, place and person.

(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place

of the alleged offence and as to the person (if any) against whom and

as to the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed as are

reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with

which he is charged and to show that the offence is not prescribed.

(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or

dishonest misappropriation of movable property, it shall be sufficient

to specify the gross sum or, as the case may be, the gross quantity in

respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and

the dates between which the offence is alleged to have been committed

without specifying particular items or exact dates, and the charge so

framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the

meaning of section 174:

Provided that the time included between the first and last of such dates

shall not exceed one year.

(3) When the nature of the case is such that the particulars mentioned

in section 164 and the preceding subsections of this section do not

give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he is

charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner

in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that

purpose.

In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat (supra) the court held further:

In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an

occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work on the

spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect

people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters.

It is unrealistic to expect a witness to be a human tape recorder.

CA/HCC/0155/22

7 | P a g e

In R. v. Dossai 13 Cr.App.R. 158 the court held that:

A date specified in an indictment is not a material matter unless it is

an essential part of the alleged offence; the defendant may be convicted

although the jury finds that the offence was committed on a date other

than that specified in the indictment. Amendment of the indictment is

unnecessary, although it will be good practice to do so (provided that

there is no prejudice below) where it is clear on the evidence that if the

offence was committed at all, it was committed on the day other than

that specified.

As the Appellant had been given sufficient notice regarding the period under

which he had been indicted and led plausible evidence through witnesses

regarding the period, I conclude that this has not caused any prejudice or

failure of justice as the Appellant had raised a totally different issue in the

trial. Hence, this appeal ground has no merit.

In the 2nd ground the Learned Presidents Counsel argued that there is no

corroboration for the evidence of the key witness PW1.

The victim had informed the alleged act of abuse for the first time to her

classmate PW10 Mihirangi in the presence another classmate Janani.

Thereafter, this had been intimated to her class English teacher PW09

Chaturangi Konara. Thereafter, the victim was taken to PW8 Wasantha

Samaranayake. According to the victim, she had told them what kind of

abuse she suffered from the Appellant.

When PW10 Mihirangi was called to give evidence to corroborate the evidence

given by the victim, she did not disclose in her evidence as to the kind of

sexual abuse she had suffered from the Appellant. At that point the Learned

State Counsel made an application under Section 159(2) of the Evidence

Ordinance. Amidst the objection raised by the defence Counsel, the Learned

High Court Judge had allowed the said application. Even the relevant portion

given to the police was read to the witness, and she failed to answer after

CA/HCC/0155/22

8 | P a g e

listening the same. Hence, her evidence failed to corroborate the evidence

given by the victim. Although an irregular procedure was adopted by the

Learned High Court Judge led to an unfair prosecution, at this juncture I am

not going to comment regarding the State Counsels application under

Section 159(2) of the Evidence Ordnance and allowing the same by the

Learned High Court Judge, as evidence of PW10 had failed to corroborate the

evidence given by the victim.

PW08, Wasantha Samaranayake too had failed to corroborate the evidence

given by the victim regarding the act of abuse. Further, this witness when

inquired from the victim as to what happened to the victim, had said in her

evidence that the victim had told her that the Appellant had touched her

body and her vagina.

His Lordship Justice Dheeraratne in Sunil and others v. Attorney General

[1986] 1 Sri.L. R 230 held that:

Corroboration is only required or afforded if the witness requiring

corroboration is otherwise credible. If the evidence of witness

requiring corroboration is not credible his testimony should be

rejected and the accused acquitted. Seeking corroboration of a

witnesss evidence should not be used as a process of inducing

belief in such evidence where such evidence is not credible.

It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a

woman victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such

evidence could be acted on even the absence of corroboration.

In Premasiri v. Attorney General [2006] 3 Sri.L.R held that:

The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a

conviction in a case of rape but the necessity of corroboration as a

CA/HCC/0155/22

9 | P a g e

matter of prudence except where the circumstances make it unsafe

to dispense with it, must be present to the mind of the judge.

In State of Andra Pradesh v. Garigula Satya Vani Murty AIR 1997 SC

1588, it was held that:

the courts are expected to show great responsibility while tying an

accused on a charge of rape. They must deal with such cases with

utmost sensitivity.

Considering the evidence given by the victim, her evidence is not

corroborated by very important witnesses PW9, PW08 and PW10 who heard

the victims story very first. As such the victim had failed to satisfy the court

the test of consistency, spontaneity and probability. Hence, I conclude this

ground has merit.

In the final ground of appeal, the Learned President Counsel contended that

the Learned High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration the

material omissions and contradictions in the evidence of PW1 and PW9.

The victim in her evidence stressed the point that she had a fight with Janani

and not with PW10 Mihirani. But she had told the police that she had fight

with PW10. This contradiction is marked as V1.

Although the victim had told that she had a fight with Janani, but told police

that PW10 Mihirangi had threatened that she would tell this to others. This

contradiction was marked as V2.

PW9, the English teacher who had witnessed the fight happened between the

victim and Janani, but had told police that she had witnessed the fight

between the victim and PW10. This contradiction was marked as V5.

CA/HCC/0155/22

10 | P a g e

PW9 in her evidence told court that she had called Janani after seeing the

fight. But she had told police that she had called PW10 after seeing the fight.

This contradiction was marked as V6.

Although PW9 had told that she had asked from Janani what she heard from

the victim, in fact she had told police that she called PW10 to ask what the

victim had told her. This contradiction was marked as V7.

PW2, mother of the victim had failed to tell police that the complaint was

delayed due to the insistent of the victim. This was brought to the notice of

the Court as an omission.

The victim had told Court that she had told the incident to PW08. But

according to PW8, she had told Court that the victim had told her that the

Appellant had only touched her body and her vagina.

The above highlighted contradictions of PW1, PW10 and PW9 cannot be

considered as trivial contradictions. The inter se contradiction highlighted

between the victim and PW08 is strong challenge to the prosecution version.

They certainly attack the root of the matter very strongly.

In the book Sarkar on Evidence, 15th Edition at page 112 states:

Minor discrepancies are possible, even in the version of truthful

witnesses and such minor discrepancies only add to the truthfulness of

their evidence. [Sidhan v. State of Kerela [1986] Cri LJ 470,

473(Kerala)]. But discrepancies in the statements of witnesses on

material points should not be passed over, as they seriously affect the

value of their testimony (Brijlal v.Kunwar, 36A 187: 18CWN 649:

A1914PC38).The main thing to be seen in whether the inconsistencies

go to the root of the matter or pertain to insignificant aspects thereof. In

the former case, the defence may be justified in seeking advantage of the

incongruities obtaining in the evidence. In the latter, however, no such

benefit will be available to it. (Krishna Pillai Sree Kumar v. State of

Kerala A [1981] SC 1237,1239).

CA/HCC/0155/22

11 | P a g e

In The Attorney General v.Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa [2011] 2 SLR

292 the court held that:

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgment on the nature of the inconsistency

or contradiction and whether they are true material to the facts in issue.

Hence, I conclude this ground of appeal also has merit.

In a case of this nature, the testimonial trustworthiness and credibility of the

victim, mainly the probability should be assessed with utmost care and

caution by the trial judge. The learned Trial Judge must satisfy and accept

the evidence of a child witness after assessing her competence and credibility

as a witness.

In Ranjeet Kumar Ram v. State of Bihar [2015] SCC Online SC 500 the

court held that:

Evidence of the child witness and its credibility would depend upon the

circumstances of each case. Only precaution which the court has to bear

in mind while assessing the evidence of a child witness is that the

witness must be a reliable one.

In this case PW1, PW2, PW8, PW9 and PW10 are the key witnesses. Their

evidence is not clear and not matched on material points discussed above.

Their evidence is tainted with much ambiguity and uncertainty which

definitely affects the root of the case. Hence, the appeal grounds 2nd and 3rd

advanced by the Appellant have very serious impact on the prosecution case.

Taking into consideration, all these circumstances, I am of the view that the

conviction of the Appellant cannot be allowed to stand as the prosecution

had failed its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable doubt. I set aside

the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge of

CA/HCC/0155/22

12 | P a g e

Matale dated 28/07/2022 on the Appellant. Therefore, he is acquitted from

this case.

Therefore, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Matale along with the original case record.
