Judgment

The Officer-in-Charge of Police Station Kalutara South had filed information on 30.08.2011 in

the Magistrates Court of Kalutara in case bearing No. 42/11 in terms of Section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act No.44 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) against the

Party of the 1st Part and Party of the 2nd Part on the basis of a breach of peace threatened or likely

to be threatened between the Parties.

The learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge had followed the procedure

stipulated in the Act and issued notice on the Party of the 1st Part and Party of the 2nd Part.

Thereafter, the Party of the 3rd Part, Party of the 4th Part, and Party of the 5th Part intervened in

the instant case.

The learned Magistrate having inquired into the matter had held that the disputed land which

bears assessment No. 47 Gangabada Road, Kalutara was in possession of the Party of the 2nd Part-

Respondent at the time the information was filed under section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act and that Party of the 2nd Part Respondent is entitled to continue the possession of

the disputed land.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate dated 02.02.2012, the Parties of the

3rd, 4th and 5th Petitioners had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court

of the Western Province holden in Kalutara by way of revision application bearing No.

HCRA/16/2012 seeking to have the said order of the learned Magistrate revised or set aside.

However, the learned High Court Judge had affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate and

dismissed the application of the said Party of the 3rd ,4th ,5th Party-Petitioners. Being dissatisfied

with the said dismissal of the application by the learned High Court Judge, Party of the 3rd ,4th

and 5th Party-Petitioner- Petitioners(Appellants) [hereinafter the '3rd, 4th and 5th Petitioner-

Appellants] have preferred this appeal.

Page 5 of 9

It is relevant to note that after the filing of the information in the Magistrates Court, the learned

Magistrate being satisfied himself that there was a threat or likelihood of a breach of peace had

issued notice on the Parties and followed the procedure under Part VII of the Act.

Furthermore, under section 114(d) of the Evidence Ordinance court can presume judicial acts

to have been regularly performed. As such, it is presumed that the learned Magistrate has

rightfully determined there was a breach of peace or a breach of peace was imminent by Parties.

In the case Aluthhewage Harshani Chandrika and others Vs. Officer in Charge and others [CA

PHC 65/2003- C.A.M. 21.04.2020] it was emphasized by Obeysekara J. that:

The Court of Appeal has to look into the matter whether the learned High Court Judge

has properly exercised his duty to ascertain any injustice caused to a party or whether

there is a miscarriage of justice occurred against the Order of the learned Magistrate and

not that Court of Appeal is empowered to correct the errors made by the learned

Magistrate.

In the instant case, the learned Magistrate has to determine under section 68(1) of the Act who

was in possession of the disputed land on the date on which the information was filed and who

is entitled to possession of the portion of land in dispute or whether any person has been forcibly

dispossessed from the land in dispute within a period of two months immediately before the date

on which the information was filed, as such a person should be restored to possession of the

disputed land if so. The learned Magistrate has held that Party of the 2nd Party-Respondent-

Respondent was in possession of the disputed land on the date on which the information was

filed and that he is entitled to the possession of the land in dispute. It is to be noted, the learned

High Court Judge has stated in his order dated 26.07.2016 that the learned Magistrate has

considered and analyzed the evidence placed before him when he determined Part of the 2nd

Party-Respondent-Respondent had been in possession of the land in dispute.

It was the contention of the Appellants that they succeeded the possession of the land in dispute

from their predecessor namely Arthur Jayathilake who is the late husband of the 3rd Appellant

and the father of the 4th and 5th Appellants.

It is in evidence that the said Arthur Jayathilake had a timber mill in the land in dispute called

Sunethra Mills since 1965. The said Arthur Jayathilake had renounced the title and all claims

of ownership to the land in issue as per the Supreme Court order dated 22.06.1993.

Page 6 of 9

It is to be observed that the learned Magistrate, upon considering the evidence placed before

Court has stated in his order dated 02.02.2012 that Appellants have failed to reasonably explain

how they came to possession of the land in dispute. The Appellants had taken up the position

that they gave the land in dispute to one Vijitha Damayanti Liverra Tennakoon to have possession

of the land and to use the land for various purposes of cultivation from 01.01.2007 onwards.

However, the learned Magistrate had held that the said Vijitha Damayanti Liverra Tennakoon

failed to produce evidence to substantiate her possession of the land in dispute that bears

assessment No.43, Riverside Road. It is relevant to note that documents marked and produced

as K and M with the original affidavits are in relation to a land that bears assessment No.51,

Riverside Road and is not related to the land in dispute.

The learned Magistrate has analyzed and evaluated the evidence available to him and come to

the correct findings of fact and rightly held that Appellants and Party of the 1st Party-Respondents

have failed to establish they were or any of them were in possession of the land in dispute at the

time of which the information was filed or that they have been dispossessed from the land in

dispute within a period of two months immediately before the date on which the information

was filed.

In Krishnamoorthy Sivakumar vs. Pathima Johara Packer [CA (PHC) 122/18 C.A.M 27.09.2022]

De Silva, J. elucidated the purpose behind Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Law. It

essentially is to prevent a breach of peace and evidently not to embark on a protracted trial

investigating the title. Thus, if the Appellant wishes to establish his legal rights to the disputed

portion of land, it is both fitting and proper to invoke the civil jurisdiction of a competent court

rather than preferring an appeal and/or an application to the Court of Appeal. It was further

held that the Primary Courts Procedure Act No.44 of 1979 stipulates no appeal shall lie against

any determination or Order under this Act to prevent prolonged and protracted hearings.

It is interesting to note that in the case of Punchi Nona Vs. Padumasena and Others [1994] 2 SLR

117, it was held that the Primary Court exercising special jurisdiction under Section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act is not involved in an investigation into the title or the right to

possession, which is the function of a civil Court. What the Primary Court is required to do is to

take preventive action and make a provisional order pending the final adjudication of the rights

of the parties in a civil Court. It is to be observed that Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act has not granted the legal competency to investigate and ascertain the ownership or title to

the disputed rights which is a function of the District Court. The intention of the legislature in

Page 7 of 9

introducing Part VII of Primary Courts Procedure Act No.44 of 1979 is to prevent a breach of

peace and not to embark on a protracted trial investigating title when deciding the matter in

dispute.

Section 74(1) of the said Act, stipulates;

(1) An Order under this part shall not affect or prejudice any right or interest in any

land or part of a land which any person may be able to establish in a civil suit; and it

shall be the duty of a Judge of a Primary Court who commences to hold an inquiry under

this part to explain the effect of these Sections to the persons concerned in the dispute.

The learned Magistrate had stated in his Order that

..... 2

.

However, the aggrieved parties in the instant case have not invoked the civil jurisdiction of the

District Court to have their legal ownership of the land in dispute adjudicated but invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Kalutara

instead.

In this instance, it is worthy to note the opinion formulated by Justice Ranjith Silva in the case

Nandawathie and others Vs Mahindasena [2009(2) SLR 218] which held:

When an Order of a Primary Court Judge is challenged by way of revision in the High

Court, the High Court can examine only the legality of that Order and not the correction

of that Order.

It was emphasized by Ranjith Silva J. that;

I am of the opinion that this particular right of appeal in the circumstances should not

be taken as an appeal in the true sense, but in fact as an application to examine the

correctness, legality or the propriety of the Order made by the High Court Judge in the

exercise of revisionary powers. The Court of Appeal should not under the guise of an

appeal attempt to re-hear or re-evaluate the evidence led in the main case.

If a party is aggrieved by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, he/she is entitled to prefer an

appeal to the Supreme Court. However, any appeal stemming from a provisional order under

section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act will be rendered ineffectual as the real remedy

Page 8 of 9

lies in having the civil rights adjudicated in the District Court since orders made under section

66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act are temporary and preventive in nature. Hence, parties

should be directed to have their rights resolved in the correct forum for the purpose of

establishing possession which will prevent both duplicity and waste of time.

I quote Krishnamoorthy Sivakumar vs. Pathima Johara Packer [CA (PHC) 122/18 C.A.M

27.09.2022] where De Silva, J. held:

It is my view that the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 stipulates that no

appeal shall lie against any Determination or Order under this Act to prevent prolong

and protracted hearings and also to prevent frittering away precious time of courts and

parties. When examining the intention of the Legislature in including the 3-month time

frame for a matter to be concluded before the Primary Court Judge, the implication is

such that Legislature intended to discourage people from filing cases on frivolous

grounds, devoid of merit.

Thus, in an actual sense, the suitable step is to have the civil rights of the relevant parties

adjudicated in the relevant competent civil court. Therefore, when filing an appeal

against a provisional order given under the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the party

concerned must come to a degree of certainty that their claim has merit and is likely to

succeed and thereupon decide on the appropriate platform from which he can receive a

fair remedy. It is incumbent upon the learned High Court Judges to direct parties to a

competent civil Court for final adjudication of their legal rights pertaining to the land in

question. This will enable us to witness an efficient administration of justice in our Court

system.

In view of the afore-cited Judgment, we are not supposed to consider this as an appeal preferred

against the Order of the Magistrates Court. We are of the view that the task before this Court is

to ascertain whether this appeal emanates from an Order pronounced by the Provincial High

Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, the Court of Appeal is empowered to

evaluate the correctness of the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction by the Provincial High Court.

The Provincial High Courts too should be mindful when exercising revisionary jurisdiction in

respect of applications made against the Orders of the Magistrates Court and should consider

these as revision applications and not as appeals.

It is trite law that revisionary jurisdiction is an extraordinary remedy which can be exercised

when there is any injustice or a miscarriage of justice caused to the aggrieved party.

Page 9 of 9

Perusing the Order dated 26.07.2016 by the learned High Court Judge, it was held that no

exceptional circumstances exist to revise the order of the learned Magistrate dated 02.02.2012

The 3rd, 4th and 5th Petitioner-Appellants have not substantiated that there is a failure of justice

or any prejudice caused to them by the order of the learned Magistrate to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of High Court which shocks the conscience of Court. Thus, the learned High Court

Judge has been correct in holding against the said 3rd, 4th and 5th Petitioner-Appellants and in

dismissing their application for revision.

In view of the foregoing reasons, we see no reason to interfere with the said orders of the learned

High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate.

Hence, this appeal stands dismissed with cost fixed at Rs.35,000/.
