On or about 03.10.2008, the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic had received a complaint to hold an inquiry with regard to the alleged transfer of ownership of the said vehicle. The complaint was to the effect that such vehicle has been transfered using forged documents.

F.N.D. Jayasuriya J. in the said judgement has held that at p.249; This court must keep prominently in forefront that it is exercising in this instance a very limited jurisdiction quite distinct from the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. Relief by way of certiorari in relation to an award made by an arbitrator will be forthcoming to quash such an award only if the arbitrator wholly or in part assumes a jurisdiction which he does not have or exceeds that which he has or acts contrary to principles of natural justice or pronounces an award which is eminently irrational or unreasonable or is guilty of an illegality. The remedy by way of certiorari cannot be made use of to correct errors or to substitute a correct order for a wrong order and if the arbitrator's award was not set aside in whole or in part, it had to be allowed to stand unreversed.",

This court ought not to exercise its appellate powers and jurisdiction when engaged in the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction and judicial review of an award of an arbitrator. The instant Application is not an appeal and is instituted primarily seeking Writs, a discretionary remedy available to be granted by Court, to quash segments of the Order of the AAT. In the said context, this Court is mindful that it is pertinent to judicially review whether the order made by AAT is ultra vires and amenable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari i.e., whether it was lawful or unlawful. After a thorough examination of the AAT's Order, I am of the view that the Order duly assessed all relevant facts pertaining to the matter and appropriately determined the reinstatement of the Petitioner with specific conditions, following the process of mitigation being a reasonable relief. The said Order does not exhibit any unlawfulness, illegality, or ultra vires conduct. Consequently, I find no justifiable grounds to grant or issue a Writ in relation to this case. For the above reasons, I refuse to grant any relief prayed for by the Petitioner. I dismiss the Application of the Petitioner and make no Order as to the costs of this Application.
