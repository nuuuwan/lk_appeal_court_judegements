Facts of this case, as per the B reports filed in the Magistrates Court of Hambantota, are briefly as follows: 7th and 8th suspects (who were already discharged by the Learned Magistrate) had found a gas cylinder floating in the sea, and it was sold to the 4th suspect, Tharindu Dilshan. The 4th suspect sold it to the 6th suspect, Preethi Kumara, a scrap metal dealer (also discharged by the Learned Magistrate). The 6th suspect buys metal according to its weight. As the gas cylinder was unusually heavy, the 6th suspect had it opened before the 4th suspect and 10th suspect Sanju alias Kasun Chathuranga who brought the cylinder to sell it. 5th suspect, K.G. Manjula was also there at that time. When the cylinder opened, they found some polythene parcels inside it. The 5th suspect took three parcels and brought them to his home.",

    "text": "The Court considered all material placed on record by both parties. In the case of Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR 180 the court held that: The decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and circumstances. In this case, the petitioner is a 67-year-old person. Part of the left jaw has been removed by surgery as it was a cancer. The medical reports submitted to court indicate that he suffers from Multiple Myeloma disease, a kind of bone marrow cancer. The medical reports also reveal that the petitioner is suffering from constant severe pains and needs to attend regularly for cancer treatment. The petitioner, being a 67 years old person had no any previous convictions. He has no any other pending cases. In addition, the PNB had reported to the Learned Magistrate on 9.11.2022 that they were investigating whether the petitioner and his wife had any knowledge about the heroin that was hidden inside the paddy sacks which were brought to the 1st suspect's house by the 9th suspect. However, the further reports filed by the PNB thereafter do not reveal any information about the petitioners or his wifes complicity in the offence. Taking into consideration of the above material, I am of the view that those grounds can be considered as exceptional circumstances to grant bail.",
