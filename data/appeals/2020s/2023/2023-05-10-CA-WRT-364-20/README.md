DECIDED ON : 10.05.2023

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The petitioner has instituted these proceedings seeking,

a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the

decision of the 1st to 4th respondents to suspend the registration

of Samrin Tea factory as reflected in documents P-7 and P-8,

respondents, their servants, agents, officers, and those holding

through or under them from placing any restrictions on licensed

tea brokers pertaining to the purchase and/or sale and/or

auction of made tea from the petitioners Samrin tea factory.

At the hearing, the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner and

the learned Additional Solicitor General for the respondents made oral

submissions.

Facts relating to the application

The petitioner is a limited liability company that manufactures tea. The

1st respondent Tea Board carries out random inspections of cataloged

tea for sale to ensure the quality of made tea. On 1st of July 2020, the

respondents obtained a tea sample (in triplicate) from the dryer mouth

teas at the petitioners factory in the presence of the factory manager.

One sample from each triplicate was given to the factory manager and

the remaining samples were taken into the Sri Lanka Tea Board custody

and were sent to the Sri Lanka Tea Board laboratory to test for sugar

content. Upon examination, one sample was found to be contaminated

with 35 mg/g of glucose. According to the circular marked R2(a) dated

11th March 2019 which was issued further to the circular

RTM/01/2005/11/01, the maximum permissible level of glucose in

black tea in the low country should be 20 mg/g. The 4th respondent

communicated the results of the laboratory test to the petitioner

company by the letter dated 12th August 2020 and informed that the

petitioner company has violated the circular RTM/01/2005/11/01 and

Section 8(2) of the Tea Control Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Act). In the same letter, the petitioner was requested to be present

for an inquiry on 18th August 2020. As there was no representative from

the petitioner company for the inquiry on the said date (the learned

counsel said that the petitioner received the letter late), the 4th

respondent rescheduled the inquiry to be held on 25th August 2020 and

communicated the same to the petitioner by another letter. One of its

directors and the factory manager of the petitioner participated in the

inquiry held before the Assistant Tea Commissioner on 25th August

2020. Following that, letters were exchanged between the petitioner and

the Tea Board, and by the letter dated 9th September 2020 marked P-7,

the 4th respondent suspended the petitioner company from

manufacturing and/or selling tea for a period of four months based on

the laboratory test report. In addition, by the letter dated 9th September

2020 marked P-8, the 4th respondent had informed the tea brokers not

4

to accept teas for cataloging and selling from the petitioner tea company

until further notice. The petitioner instituted the instant application for

writs to quash the decisions contained in the said letters P-7, P-8

among the other relieves prayed for in the petition.

The matters challenged by the petitioner

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner advanced arguments

on the following grounds.

i. The circular on the amount of glucose that should contain in tea

has no legal effect and circulars could only be used for internal

management. Therefore, the respondents have no power to

suspend the operation of the petitioners factory based on that

circular.

ii. In terms of Section 49 of the Tea Control Act, regulations have

to be specified and gazetted, and the suspension of the

petitioners tea factory was done on a circular and not on a

gazetted regulation, which is illegal.

iii. Even if the respondents relied on report R-5 and made a

decision, they could only have suspended the particular line

where the alleged contaminated tea was manufactured.

iv. The petitioner was not duly notified when the tea samples were

tested.

v. The tea samples obtained for testing were not opened in the

presence of the petitioner, and thus the testing was unfair.

vi. The SGS test report provided by the petitioner marked P6 was

not considered at the inquiry.

5

vii. The 4th respondent acted mala fide towards the petitioner by

failing to provide a copy of the test report before or during the

inquiry held by the 4th respondent, which violated the

petitioner's right to know the evidence against them.

viii. The petitioner was not given a fair hearing as the report R5 was

not shown to the petitioner and the petitioner was not given an

opportunity to defend himself.

ix. Not testing the tea samples obtained from the petitioners factory

in an accredited laboratory raises concerns about the validity of

the test results.

x. The petitioners factory was suspended from operation based on

the order marked R-5, which lacked a proper scientific

conclusion as to whether the tea samples were contaminated

with sugar as it only indicated that the samples "may be

contaminated with sugar."

xi. The report marked R-5 shows two samples taken at the same

place and date from the same dryer mouth indicate two different

readings regarding the glucose levels, which raises suspicion

about the accuracy of the readings contained in the report.

The 4th respondent has suspended the petitioners factory from

manufacturing and selling tea based on the result of the test report

R-5. According to the said report, the glucose level of the tea sample

taken from the petitioner is 35 mg/g which exceeds the required

maximum level of 20 mg/g specified in the circular issued by the Tea

Commissioner dated 11th March 2019 marked R-2(a).

6

Whether the suspension was lawful

To determine the lawfulness of the suspension of the petitioner

company, I will first address, the arguments put forth by the learned

Presidents Counsel, specifically points (i) and (ii), which rely on Section

49 of the Tea Control Act. According to Section 49(2)(b) of the Act, the

Minister may make regulations in respect of all matters for which

regulations are authorized by this Act to be made. According to Section

49(3), No regulation made by the Minister shall have effect until it has

been approved by the Senate and the House of Representatives. Every

regulation so approved shall be published in the Gazette and shall come

into operation upon such publication. As the circular marked R-2(a) is

only a circular and not regulations gazetted, the learned Presidents

Counsel contended that suspending the petitioners factory on the said

circular is unlawful.

The learned Additional Solicitor General appeared for the respondents

contended that the suspension was done not under Section 49 of the

Act but under the powers of the Tea Commissioner for violating the

conditions of the registration [P-1(b)] of the petitioners tea factory.

It is to be noted at the outset that as the office of the Tea Controller

does not exist at present, the Tea Commissioner can exercise and

discharge the powers, functions and duties previously vested in the Tea

Controller as decided in Paudgalika Tha Kamhal Himiyange

Sangamaya also known as The Private Tea Factory Owners

Association V. Jayantha Edirisinghe, Tea Commissioner (Acting)

and Five others. - S.C. Appeal No. 47/2011, S.C. Spl. L.A. No.

13/2011, Decided on 09.03.2015. It was held in this case that Thus, it

could well be seen that the intention of the legislature was to create the

office of the Tea Commissioner prior to the abolition of the office of the

Tea Controller. It further provides that the Tea Commissioner is by

law empowered to exercise, discharge and perform the powers, functions

7

and duties vested in the Tea Controller under any other written law.

The necessary implication is that whatever the powers, functions and

duties entrusted to the Tea Controller under the Tea Control Act No. 51

of 1957 can now be validly exercised by the Tea Commissioner.

Thus, there can be no doubt that the Tea Controller has no power to

issue directions or orders after 17-3-1975 affecting the rights of the

owners of the Tea Factory, as the said office of the Tea Controller does

not exist. However, the Tea Commissioner may exercise and discharge

the powers, functions and duties already vested in the Tea Controller.

According to Section 9 of the Tea Control Act, No person shall

manufacture made tea except in a registered factory. According to the

Section 8(1) of the Act; The Controller shall decide-

(a) whether any person is entitled to be registered as a manufacturer

for the purposes of this Act, and

(b) whether any tea factory should be registered for the purposes of this

Act.

The Acting Tea Commissioner, using the authority conferred by the

relevant statute, has granted the petitioners tea factory registration

marked P-1(b) authorizing it to engage in tea manufacturing. While it is

legally mandated that regulations enacted by the Minister must be

published in the gazette to have an effect, directives issued by the

Commissioner are not subject to such publication requirements.

According to paragraph 5(iii) of the aforementioned registration, the 4th

respondent possesses the authority to cancel or suspend the

registration of the tea factory in the event of the factory contravening

the provisions of the Tea Control Act or non-adhering to the directives

of the Tea Commissioner.

In addition, according to Section 8(2) of the Act, where the Controller is

satisfied, after such inquiry as he may deem necessary:

8

(a) that the building, or equipment, or manner of operation, of

any tea factory, is not of standard conducive to the

manufacture of made tea of good quality; the Controller

may suspend or cancel where necessary the registration of

such tea factory,

Circular R-2(a) was undisputedly distributed to the petitioner and all

other registered low-country tea manufacturing factories. As such, the

circular serves as a directive issued by the Tea Commissioner. Hence,

if the petitioner violated the terms of the directive, suspending the

petitioner's license for four months by the Tea Commissioner, the 4th

respondent, is legal.

I now turn to address the aforementioned argument (iii). Learned

Additional Solicitor General has submitted that samples were obtained

from the dryer mouth for testing prior to grading of the teas. Hence, the

reason behind the inability to suspend only a specific line is evident.

Reports marked R-5 and P-6

It was an allegation made on behalf of the petitioner that the test

pertaining to report R-5 was not done in the presence of the petitioner.

It is correct that the test was not done in the presence of the petitioner.

However, when the respondents requested to retest the samples in the

presence of the petitioner by the letter P-11, the said request was

straightaway refused by the petitioner by the letter P-12. As such, the

petitioner has to face the consequences of the refusal. In addition,

although the petitioner stated that the petitioners test report marked

P-6 has not been considered by the respondents, the said test was also

done not in the presence of the respondents or their representatives.

Since the petitioner declined the opportunity to conduct a retest in the

presence of both parties, as stated in the letter P-11, the Commissioner

had no other alternative but to rely on the test results obtained from

the tea board laboratory. The legal requirement to suspend the license

9

is that the Commissioner must satisfy himself that the tea

manufacturer is not adhering to the directives given by the

Commissioner. According to the report R-5, the petitioner has not

adhered to the directive given by the Commissioner in respect of the

glucose level, and no reason has been disclosed for the Commissioner

to be dissatisfied with the said test report of the tea board laboratory.

The answer to the argument that the respondents have not done the

test in an accredited laboratory would also be the same as above. If the

respondent's laboratory was not accredited, the petitioner was given the

opportunity to retest in an accredited laboratory in the presence of both

parties, but the petitioner declined.

Whether there are two different readings in the two samples taken from

the same dryer mouth?

The argument (xi) presented by the learned Presidents Counsel was

that there could not be two different readings in testing the samples

taken from the same dryer mouth at the same time, as transpired from

documents R-4 and R-5. The learned President's Counsel specifically

referred to sample numbers 494 and 495 in R-4 and claimed that they

were taken from the petitioner's factory; however, sample 494 in R-5

showed a glucose level of 35 mg/g, while sample 495 had only 4 mg/g.

In response, the learned Additional Solicitor General contended that

sample 494 was indeed taken from the petitioner's factory (Samrin), but

sample 495 was not. Upon examination of document R-4, it is evident

that only sample 494 had been specifically attributed to the Samrin

factory, while sample 495's origin was not mentioned. The court could

not arrive at such a conclusion on the assumption of facts, which is

unsafe and unwarranted. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to suggest

that both samples were obtained from the petitioner's factory. As a

result, the argument presented by the learned President's Counsel fails

on this point.

10

Had a fair inquiry been held?

The above arguments (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) may be considered

together. In response to the arguments raised regarding fair inquiry and

non-compliance with principles of natural justice, the learned

Additional Solicitor General contended that it is not necessary to

conduct a hearing of this nature in accordance with the principles of

natural justice required for other normal hearings. In substantiating

the said contention, the learned DSG submitted the decision of SC

Appeal 47/2011, decided on 09.03.2015. The learned Additional

Solicitor General further contended that, although the tea factory could

have been suspended immediately after it was found that the maximum

permissible level of glucose was not being maintained in the

manufacturing of tea, the respondents did not do so, and a fair inquiry

was held, giving the petitioner the opportunity to prove their innocence.

In the aforesaid Supreme Court decision of Paudgalika Tha Kamhal

Himiyange Sangamaya also known as The Private Tea Factory

Owners Association V. Jayantha Edirisinghe, Tea Commissioner

(Acting) and Five others, it was held as follows:

The Act does not envisage the procedure to be followed by the Tea

Commissioner in determining the reasonable price. The following extract

from the speech of Lord Pearson in Pearlberg v. Varty [1972] 1 W.L.R.

534 at 537 is worth reproducing. A tribunal to whom judicial or quasi-

judicial functions are entrusted is held to be required to apply those

principles [i.e. the rules of natural justice] in performing those functions

unless there is a provision to the contrary. But where some person or

body is entrusted by Parliament with administrative or executive

functions there is no presumption that compliance with the principles of

natural justice is required, although, as 'Parliament is not to be presumed

to act unfairly,' the courts may be able in suitable cases (perhaps always)

to imply an obligation to act with fairness. It is therefore necessary that

the Tea Commissioner adopts a fair procedure although there may not be

a hearing of the kind normally required by natural justice.

11

I will now proceed to consider whether a fair hearing was conducted in

this matter. As highlighted in the aforementioned Supreme Court

decision, the Act does not specify any particular procedure to be

followed by the Commissioner in conducting an inquiry of this nature.

It is evident from the letter marked R-6 that the petitioner was informed

of the laboratory test results and the alleged violation of Circular

RTM/01/2005/11/01 and Section 8(2) of the Tea Control Act. The

petitioner was also invited to attend an inquiry. As there was no

representation for the petitioner on the day fixed for the inquiry, the 4th

respondent rescheduled the inquiry for 25th August 2020, and the

petitioner was duly informed of the new date. So, it is evident that the

petitioner has been afforded opportunity to attend the inquiry and

present the necessary facts to substantiate their position.

It is to be noted that considering the situation, an order of suspension

could be made even pending inquiry. It was held in De Saram V.

Panditharatne & others (1984) 2 Sri L.R. 106 that Suspension

pending inquiry is not necessarly punishment. In some instances

suspension pending inquiry may be necessary, and in some instances it

may not be necessary. The necessity of suspension pending inquiry will

depend on the facts of the particular case. In the case at hand,

disregarding the urgency of stopping the production of contaminated

tea, suspension of operations was implemented only after an inquiry.

Therefore, the issue of a fair hearing cannot be raised in this matter.

At the inquiry held on 25th August 2020, it appears that the petitioner

was represented by one of its directors and the factory manager, as

documented in R-8, which contained the proceedings of the oral hearing

before the Assistant Tea Commissioner. In response to the petitioner's

request to cancel the suspension, as conveyed in the letter marked

P-10 dated 14th September 2020, the 4th respondent asked the

petitioner to provide fresh tea samples for further testing, as stated in

the letter marked P-11 dated 15.09.2020.

12

Having considered the aforementioned circumstances, it does not

appear that the principles of natural justice were violated, and the

petitioner had been afforded a fair hearing and opportunities to be

heard. Upon perusal of the oral hearing proceedings documented in

R-8, it does not appear that the sampling method was challenged by

the petitioner. Furthermore, the petitioner disclosed the difficulty in

presenting the test report during the inquiry in the letter marked P-10,

where it was stated that the results of other tests related to different tea

companies were included in the report, and the 1st respondent was

unable to provide a copy of the report for this reason. I find no fault of

the respondents for not showing the test report at the inquiry because

the test results were conveyed to the petitioner through the letter

marked R-6 before the inquiry and disclosing the test results of other

tea factories could hinder investigations related to those factories. In

addition, the petitioner was also given the opportunity to produce

another sample for further testing. In light of the aforesaid

circumstances, it appears that a fair hearing was conducted.

It is vital to consider the response of the petitioner at this juncture. In

response to the 1st respondent's request for the petitioner to submit a

sample and appear at the respondent's office on 16.09.2020, the

petitioner unequivocally declined the suggestion as stated in the letter

marked P-12, dated 16.09.2020. Furthermore, the petitioner informed

the 4th respondent that the proposal for a retest after the suspension

was a frivolous matter. Despite this, the petitioner did not provide any

reasons for their inability to produce a sample for retesting, which

would have served to demonstrate that their tea was not contaminated.

It should be noted that if the Tea Commissioner determines that the tea

does not meet the required standards and quality, it is imperative to

cease its manufacture and sale. As stated in the statement of

objections, the sale of adulterated tea is a grave issue with systemic

implications for the entire industry. It is further asserted that if such

13

teas are sold to the global market, it will have a detrimental impact on

the quality of "Ceylon Tea" as a brand and on Sri Lanka's

competitiveness in the international market. Furthermore, statement of

objections states that any attempt to enhance the blackness of tea

through artificial means would compromise the naturalness of the

made tea. It is therefore imperative to prevent adulterated teas from

reaching the global market in order to preserve the quality and brand

value of Ceylon Tea. I find no reason to deviate from the aforesaid facts

set out in the statement of objections. Under these circumstances, it is

my opinion that the petitioner had no valid reason for refusing the retest

and for stating that they do not want any retesting after the suspension.

If the adulterated teas reach the international market, they will have a

negative impact on "Ceylon Tea," as previously stated. Hence, it is clear

that the sale of adulterated tea would have significant detrimental

consequences. Furthermore, consumption of such contaminated tea

would pose a health risk to human beings. Therefore, immediate

cessation of manufacturing and distribution is necessary when

contaminated tea is found. It would be unsafe to allow for continued

production and distribution until a comprehensive investigation has

been conducted. That is why the Commissioner is empowered under

the relevant statute to suspend the registration of the factories that

engage in such activities without waiting for a final determination to be

made through the lengthy process of inquiries and appeals. However,

the Commissioner has not arbitrarily supended the petitioners

registration. It is important to note that prior to the suspension, the

petitioner was afforded an opportunity to demonstrate their innocence

in an inquiry. The order of suspension did not preclude the petitioner

from conducting retesting to prove their innocence. Had the petitioner

availed themselves of this opportunity, they could have potentially

demonstrated their innocence and had the suspension order lifted.

Now, the petitioner cannot complain of unfair testing because the

14

petitioner declined retesting, which could have been done

transparently.

Following the petitioner's refusal to conduct retesting, the Tea

Commissioner had no other alternative but to take further necessary

steps based on the test report marked R-5. As the tea produced by the

petitioner violated the Tea Commissioner's directives concerning

glucose levels, the suspension of the petitioner's registration as detailed

in letter P-7 was correct. Additionally, the Tea Commissioner's directive

to refrain from accepting teas from the petitioner's factory, as set forth

in letter P-8, was a necessary step to safeguard public health, safety

and to prevent the detrimental impact on the quality of "Ceylon Tea".

Following is quoted in Lewis V. Heffer - [1978] EWCA Civ J0125-2

[1978] 3 All ER 354: Those words apply, no doubt, to suspensions which

are inflicted by way of punishment, as for instance when a member of

the bar is suspended from practice for six months, or when a solicitor is

suspended from practice. But they do not apply to suspensions which are

made, as a holding operation, pending enquires. Very often irregularities

are disclosed in a government department or in a business house and a

man may be suspended on full pay pending inquiries. Suspicion may rest

on him and so he is suspended until he is cleared of it. No one, so far as

I know, has ever questioned such a suspension on the ground that it

could not be done unless he is given notice of the charge and an

opportunity of defending himself, and so forh. The suspension in such a

case is merely done by way of good administration. A situation has

arisen in which something must be done at once. The work of the

department of the office is being affected by rumours and suspicions. The

others will not trust the man, in order to get back to proper work, the man

is suspended.

As determined in the aforementioned case, the suspension of the

petitioner's factory for a period of four months, pending the clearance

of tea manufacturing standards, is correct and lawful.

15

On the other hand, upon the petitioner's refusal to comply with the

request for retesting, the Tea Commissioner was left with no other

recourse than to take further action based on the test report R-5. Since

the tea manufactured by the petitioner contravenes the Tea

Commissioner's directives regarding glucose levels in tea, it was

justifiable to suspend the petitioner's registration, as communicated

through the letter marked P-7, and to inform via the letter P-8, to

refrain from accepting teas from the petitioner's factory.

The learned President's Counsel for the petitioner argues (The

aforementioned argument x) that while report R-5 suggests that

sample 494 may be contaminated with sugar, the conclusion drawn by

the respondents in R-6 is that the petitioner has contaminated the tea.

However, the suspension of registration is warranted when the

directives given by the Commissioner are violated. The circular marked

R-2(a) states that the maximum permissible level of glucose in tea

should be 20mg/g. As per the report marked R-5, the sample taken

from the petitioner's factory contains 35mg/g of glucose. Hence, the

Commissioner's determination is correct.

Based on the reasons outlined above, the applications for writs prayed

for in the prayer to the petition are dismissed with costs fixed at

Rs. 50,000/-.
