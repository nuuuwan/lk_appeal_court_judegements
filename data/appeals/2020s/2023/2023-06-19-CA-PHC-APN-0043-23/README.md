Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application by the accused-appellant-petitioner (hereinafter referred

to as the petitioner) seeking to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court

in terms of Article 138 of The Constitution.

We heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioner for notice to

the respondents mentioned in the application.

The petitioner has been charged before the Magistrate Court of Homagama for

the offence of robbery where he is alleged to have robbed the gold chain of a

female on 3rd March 2016, and thereby committing an offence punishable in

terms of section 380 of the Penal Code.

The gold chain has never been recovered. At the trial in this regard,

Vidanapathirage Sudarma Kanthi who was the victim of this robbery has given

evidence as PW-01. She has described the incident faced by her where the robber

who came into her shop in the guise of customer, snatched the gold chain she

was wearing and ran away. In her evidence, she has clearly stated that she was

able to see the robber clearly as she struggled with him and even ran after him.

Subsequently, she has been called for an identification parade where she has

identified the petitioner as the person who robbed her.

When this matter was taken up for trial before the learned Magistrate of

Homagama, the investigating officer who was the witness no. 03 named in the

plaint was deceased, and an officer of the relevant police station has given

evidence in terms of section 32 (2) of the Evidence Ordinance and produced

Page 4 of 8

relevant investigation notes to the Court. The prosecution case has been closed

after marking the identification parade as P-01. After calling for a defence, the

learned Magistrate of Homagama had pronounced his judgement on 26th

November 2019, convicting the petitioner for the charge. He has been sentenced

to 1-year rigorous imprisonment and has been ordered to pay a fine of Rs.

1500/=.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the petitioner has

preferred an appeal to the High Court of Homagama. The learned High Court

Judge of the High Court of Homagama, having considered the appeal has

dismissed the same by his judgement dated 08th February 2021. The learned

High Court Judge has considered the grounds of appeal urged by the petitioner

and has determined that he has no basis to interfere with the said conviction

and the sentence of the learned magistrate.

It is against the said judgement pronounced in appeal by the learned High Court

Judge of Homagama, the petitioner has filed this application of revision before

this Court.

Revision being a discretionary remedy granted in exceptional circumstances, it

is essential for the petitioner to urge the exceptional circumstances which entitle

him to come before this Court. In paragraph 9 of his petition, he has given the

following reasons as exceptional circumstances for the consideration of this

Court.

1. The learned High Court Judge has erred in law by failing to properly

analyze the circumstances of the case.

2. The learned High Court Judge has erred in law by not considering the

fact that the gold chain was not found in the possession of the appellant

and no investigation had been conducted to that effect.

3. The has erred in failing to consider that the prosecution had not proved

the case beyond reasonable doubt.

Page 5 of 8

4. The learned High Court Judge has erred on facts by wrongly analyzing

that the appellant was arrested on 07-03-2016.

5. The learned High Court Judge has erred in law by failing to analyze the

evidence adduced by the witnesses according to what was stated in the

identification parade marked X-3 and the evidence of witnesses as to

the identification of the accused.

The plain reading of the above grounds reflects that these are challenges to the

facts placed before the trial Court and are not circumstances that can be

considered as exceptional circumstances which warrants the invoking of the

revisionary powers of this Court.

Although the petitioner claims that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

draw his attention to the above-mentioned grounds, it is clear from the judgment

of the learned High Court Judge as well as the judgement of the learned

Magistrate, the relevant facts had drawn attention of the learned High Court

Judge, as well as the learned Magistrate.

For a party aggrieved by a judgement pronounced by a High Court in exercising

its appellate jurisdiction in terms of Article 154P of The Constitution, the remedy

available is to file an appeal before the Supreme Court with leave first had and

obtained either from the relevant High Court or the Supreme Court itself. The

petitioner has failed to exercise his right of appeal, but has filed this application

some two years after the pronouncement of the High Court judgement.

It is essential for a person who is seeking the discretionary remedy of revision

from this Court to explain his failure to file an appeal in the correct forum as

required by law and the delay in coming by way of revision before this Court.

Giving an explanation, the petitioner has stated in his petition that due to a

default of his previously retained Attorney-at-Law, an appeal against the High

Court judgement was filed in the Court of Appeal where it was dismissed for

filing the appeal in the wrong Court. It is thereafter only the petitioner has sought

the revisionary remedy from this Court by submitting this application.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner, while making submissions in support of

getting the notices issued contended that the case has been decided only on the

evidence of PW-01 and that of the police evidence. It was his submission that in

view of the failure to recover the productions, there was no basis for a conviction

based on the evidence of PW-01.

It needs to be mentioned that there exists no bar for a trial Court to admit the

evidence of a single witness if the evidence is cogent and trustworthy and can be

relied upon it for determining an action.

The relevant section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows;

134. No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required

for the proof of any act.

In the case of Mulluwa Vs. The State of Madhya Predesh 1976 AIR 989 it was

stated that,

Testimony must always be weighed and not counted.

As discussed by E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his book The Law of Evidence

Volume 1 at page 670, the Indian Supreme Court in the case of Ramratan Vs.

State of Rajasthan AIR (1962) S.C. 424 has laid down the following general

rules governing the question whether the evidence of a single witness is sufficient

as the basis of a conviction.

a. The question whether corroboration of a testimony of a single witness is

or is not necessary must depend upon the facts and circumstances of

each case.

b. The Court should not, in the absence of a statutory requirement, insist on

corroboration, except in cases where the nature of the testimony of the

single witness itself requires, as a matter of prudence, that corroboration

should be insisted upon.

Page 7 of 8

c. Where the Court is convinced that the witness is speaking the truth, and

his evidence rings to be true, as a general rule, the Court may act on the

evidence of a single witness though uncorroborated.

In this action, the evidence of PW-01 and that of the investigating officer has

been evaluated in its correct perspective and the learned trial Judge has come

to his findings accordingly. Although the petitioner has initially taken up the

position stating that he was shown to the PW-01 before the identification parade

was held, however, after PW-01 answered that position under cross-

examination, has taken up the position that the PW-01 was shown a photograph

of him and he was identified at the parade because of that.

The learned trial Judge as well as the learned High Court Judge has well

considered these positions and had found no reasons to accept the said

contentions and has determined that it had not created any doubt as to the

evidence of PW-01.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner also pointed out that the identification

parade notes had been marked through the Court interpreter without calling the

relevant witnesses and affording the petitioner to confront them in that regard.

However, it needs to be noted that in terms of section 414 (2) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, the depositions regarding an

identification parade held by a Magistrate or Justice of Peace can be marked

without calling the relevant witnesses.

It appears that the identification parade notes had been marked in terms of the

above provision of law. When this was done, at the Magistrate Court of

Homagama, the petitioner had been represented by his Attorney-at-Law. There

had been no application to call the relevant witnesses before the Court as

required in terms of the proviso of section 414. Hence, this Court finds no

irregularity in the procedure adopted by the learned Magistrate in that regard.

It was held in the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Tharmaratnam (Srikantha Law

Reports Vol. IV page 47),

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the

Court.

In Vanik Incorporation Ltd. Vs. Jayasekara (1997) 2 SLR 365, it was held,

Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has

occurred due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only

when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of

justice.

As none of the grounds urged provides a basis for this Court to issue notice on

the respondents mentioned in the petition, notice is refused. Accordingly, the

application is dismissed.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to forward copies of this Order to the High

Court of Homagama as well to the Magistrate Court of Homagama for information

purposes.
