    "text": "The Road Passenger Transport Authority of the Sabaragamuwa Province (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Sabaragamuwa Transport Authority and/or Authority) is an independent institution, established under the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, and under and by virtue of the provisions of the statute of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council namely which is pertaining to the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Road Passenger Transport service (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Statute) published in the Gazette (Extraordinary) Notification bearing No. 810/13 dated 17.03.1994. The Petitioners submit that they were appointed to their positions as Chairman and members of the Board of Directors of the Sabaragamuwa Road Passenger Transport Authority in accordance with the law and for a specific term of three years. They challenge that the power to remove the Chairman and members of the Board of Directors lies solely with the Provincial Subject Minister of Transport, and that the Governor or any other official does not have the authority to remove them. The Petitioners further assert that the decisions to remove them from their positions was made without any reasons provided and appointment of a new Chairman, are ultra vires, unlawful, and in violation of the principles of Administrative Law. It is further submitted that the said decisions violate the Petitioners' legitimate expectations to serve their full term of appointment. The Respondents contend that the decision challenged by the Petitioners emanated from His Excellency the President and therefore the said decision is not amenable to the Writ jurisdiction of this Court. The Respondents submit that since the term of the Provincial Council of Sabaragamuwa Province had expired, His Excellency the President had directed the 1st Respondent that, the chairman and the Board of Directors of each Authority that come under the mandate of any Provincial Council should resign from their respective offices. As such the Respondent had removed the Petitioners on the said direction of the president as they are duty bound to comply with such directions of His Excellency the President. It is further brought to the attention of this Court that without quashing the decision of His Excellency the President this matter becomes futile. Additionally, the Respondents also submit that the 1st Respondent had acted according to Law laid down by Article 154C and 154F has acted within his powers and is also in line with the provisions of the statute.",
