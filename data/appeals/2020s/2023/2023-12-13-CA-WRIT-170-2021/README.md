Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The 1st Petitioner claims that she submitted a building plan to the 3rd Respondent-

Minuwangoda Urban Council (Urban Council) for approval in November 2018 as she

intended to construct a building on the subject land. The building plan has not been

approved by the said Urban Council and accordingly, she seeks a mandate in the nature

of a writ of Mandamus directing anyone or more of the Respondents to expeditiously

conclude the process of approving the said building plan. In addition to the aforesaid relief,

the Petitioners are seeking for a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus directing

any one or more of the Respondents to hand over free and vacant possession of the said

subject land. According to the Amended Petition dated 21.10.2022, the subject land

claimed by the Petitioners is in the extent of 6.29 perches (Acres 0 -Roods 0 -Perches 6.29).

It is noted that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have been released from these proceedings.

By way of an order made under section 38A of the Land Acquisition Act No. 09 of 1950

published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1089/ 18 on 22.07.1999 (marked P2/ 3R3) the

Lot Nos. 03 and 23 depicted in Surveyor Generals Plan No. Gam/ Minu/98/ 24 made

on 13.02.1999 have been acquired by the State. The extent of the said Lot Nos. 03 and 23

are hectares 0.01604 and 0.01657 respectively. Whereas, the State has acquired a total of

12.89 perches (0.03261 hectares). The contention of the Petitioners is that the husband of

the 1st Petitioner was in possession of a land in extent of 21 perches from which the

aforesaid portion of land had been acquired by the State. Although the balance portion of

8.11 perches has been transferred to various parties subsequently, the 1st Petitioner has

made several representations to the relevant authorities claiming compensation in respect

of the said portion of land which is in the extent of 8.11 perches. This court is unable to

examine and arrive at any conclusion as to who would be entitled to such compensation

Page 3 of 4

and to the title regarding the said portion of land which is in the extent of 8.11 perches.

The duty cast upon this Court is to consider whether a writ of Mandamus can be issued

against the 3rd and 4th Respondents as prayed for in the Prayer of the Petition.

In this context, I need to examine the involvement of the Urban Council in the affairs

relating to the instant Application. To my mind, the Petitioners primary claim emanates

from the Deed of Assignment (P16) No. 157 attested by E.M.M.N. Ekanayake Notary

Public on 16.01.2018. One of the witnesses to the said P16 is the Secretary of the said

Urban Council. The said Secretary has placed her signature therein to endorse the said

assignment for which purpose the said deed has been executed.

In the said Deed of Assignment, the Urban Council has assigned the land morefully

described in its schedule which is an extent of 6.29 perches. The said Schedule refers to

Lot No.11 of Surveyor Generals Plan No. Mu. Pi. Gam 3072. Based on such Lot No.11

another plan No. 2923 has been made by J.M. Wijewardena Licensed Surveyor.

Significantly, the said Deed of Assignment elaborates the reasons why the block of land

morefully described in its schedule was assigned to the Assignee mentioned therein.

According to the conditions depicted in P16, the Urban Council referring to the block of

land acquired by way of the relevant orders published in the Gazette Extraordinary No.

1089/18 and No. 1165/19 under the Land Acquisition Act, declares that when acquiring

such land under the above Gazette Notifications a portion of land in the extent of 8.11

perches has been left out without being duly acquired. Thus, in order to facilitate the

assignee in P16 the Urban Council has purportedly released a block of land in extent of

8.11 perches from Lot No. 11 of the Surveyor Generals Plan No. Mu. Pi. Gam 3072.

Although it appears, prima facie, that the Surveyor General's Plan No. Mu. Pi. Gam 3072

reflects an acquisition of land under the Land Acquisition Act however, no adequate

material has been presented to the Court to establish any link between Lot No.11 of Mu.

Pi. Gam 3072 and Lot No. 03 and 23 of Surveyor Generals Plan No. Gam/ Minu/98/24.

Hence, this court is unable to arrive at any conclusion as to whether the portion of land

assigned under the said P16 is State land. Moreover, I cannot gather any provision of law

on the Urban Council's authority to assign land vested in it under section 44 of the Land

Acquisition Act. In terms of the certificates of handing over possession marked 3R5 and

3R6 it is envisaged that only the possession of the said Lot No. 03 and 23 of Surveyor

Page 4 of 4

Generals Plan No. Gam/ Minu/98/24 has been handed over to the Urban Council by

the respective Acquiring Officer.

The procedure of divesting of lands where actual possession has been taken by the State is

provided in section 39A of the Land Acquisition Act and there is no evidence in the instant

Application that the relevant Minister has made a divesting order under the said section

39A. Based on such circumstances this Court is unable to identify the purported subject

land or to declare the Lot No. 11 of Mu. Pi. Gam 3072 to be either State or private land.

I take the view that this is not a fit case to engage in an exercise of examining the title of

the Petitioners and anyhow, it should be adjudicated in a suit where parties would have

reasonable opportunity of examining their respective witnesses.

In contrast, I need to make an observation that, in my view, a reasonable prejudice has

been caused to whoever the assignee in P16 for the mere reason that the Urban Council

has got the said P16 executed without duly identifying the land described in the Schedule

to P16 and also in the presence of a clear ambiguity whether it is lawful for the Urban

Council to assign a particular land vested in the Urban Council by way of a Deed of

Assignment. Furthermore, it appears that the Urban Council has induced an expectation

within 1st Petitioner especially based on letters such as P6 (a letter dated 29.12.2017

addressed to the 1st Petitioner by the Urban Council) and A4 (a letter dated 03.01.2018

addressed to the 1st Petitioners Attorney- At- Law by the Urban Council) that land in

extent of 8.11 perches would be released to the 1st Petitioner. However, this Court is unable

to grant any of the reliefs prayed for in the prayer of the Petition since no effective

conclusion can be arrived at during the proceedings of this case in respect of the

identification of the subject land and the Petitioner's title to the subject land.

Based on such circumstances, and subject to the aforesaid observations I proceed to

dismiss the instant Application.
