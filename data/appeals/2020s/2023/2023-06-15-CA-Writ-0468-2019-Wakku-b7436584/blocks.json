It is true that in plan R 5 the portion of land to be acquired is described as a barren land. However, as I have already stated in this judgment R 5 plan is prepared leaving out the portions where there are buildings. According to plan P 1 and attached report P 2 there are two houses and a rubber store on the land. There had been a tea plantation and a mixed plantation of coconut and other trees. I am mindful that plan P 1 is made in the year 2014 and plan R 5 is made in the year 2018. Therefore, one can expect a change in the plantation on the land. The Petitioner submitted that the land could not be utilized for cultivation due to the pending Partition action.",

The Petitioner refused the demand and thereafter, the 1st Respondent maliciously took steps to acquire the Petitioners land to build the Divisional Secretariat and her quarters. However, in my view, this allegation is highly improbable and unsupported by evidence. The letter R 1, the description of the lands proposed to be acquired, was signed by the 1st Respondent on the 29th March 2017, before the date on which she has visited the Petitioner. Therefore, I am not inclined to accept the Petitioners allegation. The other ground of malice is choosing Petitioners land for the required purpose without considering other options, unfounded allegation of landslide risk at the land where the present Divisional Secretariat and Divisional Secretarys quarters are situated, making both the application and recommendation by the 1st Respondent and the 1st Respondent signed the document R 1 in the purported capacity as the head of the department13.
