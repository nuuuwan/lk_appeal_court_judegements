ORDER

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The petitioner has filed this writ application seeking to quash the

decision of the 1st and/or 2nd respondents contained in the notice dated

22.11.2022 (marked P-2) issued in terms of Section 46(3) of the Wages

Board Ordinance and to quash the certificate filed in the Magistrate

Court of Welisara in the case bearing No. 79165/23 to recover the sum

mentioned therein. In addition, the petitioner seeks interim relief of

staying the proceedings of the Magistrates Court of Welisara until this

application is determined. The petitioner states in the petition that the

decision contained in the said certificate is ultra vires, arbitrary, and

illegal, and the decision has been made in contravention of the rules of

natural justice. The 3rd respondent has filed limited objections to the

application and moved to dismiss the same.

In supporting this application, the learned Counsel for the petitioner

made oral submissions. The learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent and

the learned State Counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondent made oral

submissions and urged to dismiss the application with costs without

issuing notices to the respondents. This order has to be given to

determine whether the notices should be issued to the respondents and

whether the interim reliefs prayed for by the petitioner could be granted.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner advanced his arguments on the

following three grounds:

1. The affidavit submitted with the statement of objections is

defective and invalid.

2. A decision of the Wages Board has not been annexed to P-2,

the petitioner was never heard in respect of the matters

Page 3 of 10

contained in P-2, and the petitioner does not know how the

Wages Board arrived at the decision mentioned in P-2.

3. When awarding compensation by the Labour Tribunal, as per

the order marked P-13, the amount mentioned in P-2 was

included and thus, the Magistrate Court case cannot proceed

to recover the same amount again.

In response, the learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent asserted that

the defect purported to render the affidavit invalid is just a

typographical error, and hence the said minor defect has no bearing on

the validity of the affidavit. The learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent

contended further that the application of the petitioner was entirely

based on the ground that the petitioner company was not heard and no

proper inquiry was held but the Wages Board has arrived at the decision

by hearing all parties involved. Showing the relevant documents and

inquiry proceedings, the learned Counsel contended that a complete

and proper inquiry was held.

The learned State Counsel appearing for the 1st and 2nd respondents

advanced her arguments on the following three grounds.

1. The petitioner is guilty of laches; therefore, the application

should be dismissed.

2. The petitioners application to quash P-2 is not consistent with

his other pleadings.

3. A proper inquiry has been held in determining the amount

mentioned in P-2.

Now, I proceed to consider the issues raised by the learned Counsel for

all three parties.

Validity of the affidavit

What the learned Counsel for the petitioner pointed out was that in the

jurat of the affidavit filed along with the limited objection, it is

mentioned as she having understood but the affirmant of the

Page 4 of 10

affidavit is a male, namely, Jasenthu Liyanage Prasanga de Silva. He

contended that the affidavit has been tendered by a female and not by

the 3rd respondent; therefore, the court cannot rely on this affidavit.

In substantiating the above argument, the learned Counsel tendered

the case of Elangakoon v. Officer in Charge, Police Station,

Eppawela and Another - (2007) 1 Sri L.R. 398. In this case, the

petition and affidavit were not addressed to the Hon. President and the

other Lordships of the Court of Appeal. The pleadings contained in the

petition of appeal and affidavit were in total disarray and were

ambiguous. Considering those matters and the other reasons stated in

the judgment, the application pertaining to that case was dismissed. In

the case at hand, the only mistake is mentioning she instead of he

in the jurat. Therefore, the aforesaid Elangakoon case has no

applicability to the instant action.

This is not an error occurred in the averments of the affidavit. Section

9 of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance states:

No omission to take any oath or make any affirmation, no

substitution of any one for any other of them, and no irregularity

whatever in the form in which any one of them is administered,

shall invalidate any proceeding or render inadmissible any

evidence whatever in or in respect of which such omission,

substitution, or irregularity took place, or shall affect the obligation

of a witness to state the truth.

Therefore, I agree with the contention of the learned Counsel for the 3rd

respondent that it is a typographical error, and I hold that the said

typographical error is not a reason to invalidate the affidavit. Apart from

that, whether he or she is mentioned in the jurat, it is precisely clear

that Jasenthu Liyanage Prasanga de Silva, the 3rd respondent and no

one else has submitted the affidavit in support of their limited

objections. Hence, there is no reason to reject the said affidavit.

Whether the amount of Rs.67,613.33 mentioned in P-2 is included in

the amount awarded by the Labour Tribunal

The learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that the Labour

Tribunal inquiry was also held on the complaint made by the 3rd

respondent against the petitioner company, and the amount mentioned

in P-2 has been included in the award of Rs. 1,844,000/- granted to the

3rd respondent.

The complaint made by the 3rd respondent in terms of Section 31(B) of

the Industrial Disputes Act has been tendered with the statement of

objections marked 3R-1. In the said complaint, what was prayed for by

the 3rd respondent was reinstatement, or if not, reasonable

compensation. The 3rd respondent has not requested an order from the

Labour Tribunal for back wages or the amount due for the balance

annual leave. The amount mentioned in the schedule annexed to P-2,

is the total amount to be paid for the balance annual leave of 2018 and

the salary for the month of January 2019. It is clear that the said two

dues have not been prayed for by the 3rd respondent from the Labour

Tribunal. According to the Labour Tribunal order marked P-13 also, it

is apparent that compensation has been awarded as an alternative

remedy for reinstatement. Therefore, it is clear that the Labour Tribunal

has awarded only the compensation, and the amounts mentioned in the

annexure to P-2 is not included in the said award. Hence, the order of

the Labour Tribunal is not an obstacle to maintain the case filed in the

Magistrate Court of Welisara.

Whether the petitioner is guilty of laches

The learned State Counsel appearing for the 1st and 2nd respondents

contended that the petitioner had taken no step when the notice P-2

was issued, and only after the Magistrate Court case was instituted, the

petitioner rushed to this court and requests to quash P-2. Therefore,

the learned State Counsel submitted that the petitioner is guilty of

Page 6 of 10

laches, and this application must be dismissed on that ground as well.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner did not explain any reason for

the delay.

The notice P-2 was issued on 22nd November 2022. The petition of the

instant writ application in which it was prayed to quash P-2 was filed

on 11th August 2023. Therefore, it is apparent that the petitioner

challenged the notice P-2 more than eight months after the P-2 was

issued. There is no explanation from the petitioner regarding the

eight-month delay. As this is a delay of more than eight months for

which an explanation was not given, the petitioner is guilty of laches.

The main issue relating to the application

The petitioners application is mainly based on the ground that the

petitioner has never been heard and no proper inquiry was held. The

learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that the notice marked

P-2 has been sent by the Assistant Commissioner of Labour, but the

amount mentioned in P-2 has been decided by the Wages Board. His

contention was that the petitioner does not know who inquired about

this matter. The learned Counsel contended further that the petitioner

has no knowledge whether an inquiry was held. He submitted that a

copy of the Wages Board decision is not annexed with P-2, and up to

date, no document has been tendered by the respondent to show that

there was an inquiry in making this decision. Therefore, the contention

of the learned Counsel was that the decision refers in P-2 is ultra vires,

illegal, and P-2 has been issued violating the rules of natural justice.

The learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent submitted that the

documents marked 3R-5 to 3R-10 are the documents pertaining to the

inquiry, and the petitioner was well aware of that inquiry. Further, the

learned Counsel contended that the document 3R-12 is the written

submission filed by the petitioner for the inquiry, and the petitioner is

totally misrepresenting the facts by stating that the petitioner company

Page 7 of 10

was never been heard. In addition, the learned Counsel for the 3rd

respondent stated that the proceedings of the inquiry marked 3R-13

and 3R-14 bear testimony that a proper inquiry was held and the

petitioner participated at the said inquiry. The learned Counsel stated

further that the petitioner is abusing the process of the Court by filing

this application.

The learned State Counsel also stated that there was a proper inquiry,

the petitioner participated in the inquiry, and thus the petitioner has

no legal basis to maintain this application. Further, the learned State

Counsel pointed out that the letter P-15 is the response made by the

petitioner to the P-2, and even in the said response, the petitioner has

not mentioned that the petitioner had never been heard. The learned

State Counsel submitted that challenging P-2 is an afterthought only

after the Magistrate Court case was instituted.

In reply to the contentions made by the learned Counsel for the 3rd

respondent and the learned State Counsel, the learned Counsel for the

petitioner stated that according to the inquiry proceedings shown by

the learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent, the inquiry was held with

regard to the gratuity as well as wages, but both matters cannot be

taken together for an inquiry because two different defences have to be

taken with regard to the two matters. The learned Counsel contended

further that the petitioner participated in the inquiry held with regard

to the gratuity, and surreptitiously, matters regarding the wages have

also been decided.

Firstly, it is to be noted that this kind of inquiry is not as same as a trial

in a Criminal Court. In a criminal case, one can argue that two different

charges cannot be brought in the same indictment because the accused

has to take two different defences. This is an inquiry with regard to the

payment of gratuity and wages. No prejudice would be caused to the

petitioner company by inquiring these two matters in the same inquiry.

Page 8 of 10

However, this is not the issue in this case. When the learned Counsel

for the petitioner presented his case, he asserted that the petitioner

does not know who inquired about the matters relating to this

application and the petitioner does not know whether an inquiry was

even held. The inquiry proceedings dated 11.09.2019, 21.11.2019,

18.12.2019 and 08.01.2020 marked as 3R-13 clearly demonstrate that

on those days, the petitioner company participated in the inquiry. In

addition, the document 3R-14 demonstrates that on 28.08.2019 also,

the legal officer of the petitioner company represented the petitioner

company at the inquiry. On that day, the representative of the petitioner

company has been instructed to state facts in writing with regard to the

incentives pertaining to the 3rd respondent. In the proceedings dated

11.09.2019, it has been stated as follows: 2 :- .

In the proceedings dated 21.11.2019 it is stated as follows:

I. 2018 . ; 2019

II. 2019

III.

IV.

V. B .

Therefore, it is very clear that both parties have been informed to

furnish details not only regarding the gratuity but also regarding the

wages and earned leave of the 3rd respondent. In these circumstances,

I regret to state that I am unable to understand why the learned counsel

for the petitioner stated that the petitioner is unaware whether an

inquiry was held with regard to the payment of wages and that,

surreptitiously, the amount mentioned in P-2 has been decided.

According to the proceedings dated 08.01.2020, the petitioner

participated in the inquiry. In the proceedings, it is stated that the

details regarding the calculation of the 2019 January salary have not

Page 9 of 10

been tendered. However, the representative of the petitioner company,

Mrs. H. Bulathwatte, Attorney-at-Law, has informed at the inquiry that

the 3rd respondents 2019 January salary is Rs.46,100/-. According to

the schedule attached to the P-2, the said amount has been ordered to

be paid. According to the proceedings of the same date, the 3rd

respondents leave that were not taken has also been considered in the

presence of the aforesaid representative of the petitioner company. The

other amount mentioned in the schedule to the P-2 is the dues for the

3rd respondent for the balance annual leave in 2018. Therefore, it is

precisely clear that the petitioner company participated in the inquiry

held not only with regard to the gratuity but also with regard to the

payment of wages mentioned in notice P-2. Hence, it is apparent that

the petitioner was well aware of the inquiry and participated in the

inquiry. So, it is evident that the petitioner company was heard before

issuing the certificate P-2.

In addition, the written submission tendered by the petitioner company

to the Assistant Commissioner of Labour has been tendered by the 3rd

respondent marked 3R-12. In paragraph two of the said submission,

the petitioner states as follows:

... ,

, 2018 2019 2019

.

Accordingly, it is apparent that the petitioner was well aware about the

matters mentioned in P-2 and has submitted a written submission

dealing with the matters mentioned in P-2, such as earned leave, 2018

December, and 2019 January wages. Hence, the argument of the

learned Counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner participated at the

inquiry pertaining to gratuity and the matters mentioned in P-2 has

never been inquired cannot be accepted and it is an argument based on

wrong facts. On the aforesaid circumstances it is precisely clear that

Page 10 of 10

the petitioner was well aware of the issues that resulted in issuing P-2

because those issues were addressed in the inquiry in which the

petitioner participated. Not only he participated at the inquiry but also

the petitioner was given the opportunity to tender written submissions

on those matters, and the petitioner has submitted written submissions

to the 2nd respondent. After holding a full inquiry only, the 2nd

respondent issued notice P-2. Even after tendering a written

submission containing 33 paragraphs on those matters, the petitioner

says that the petitioner company was never heard and no proper inquiry

was held. I must say that there was no other way to hold a proper and

fair inquiry. The petitioner was informed to participate in the inquiry;

accordingly, he participated in the inquiry; the petitioner has been given

all the opportunities to tender relevant documents; the petitioner was

heard; and the petitioner was given an opportunity to tender written

submissions as well. After taking part in the inquiry and submitting

written submissions, it is strange to hear that the petitioner was never

heard and no proper inquiry was held in issuing P-2.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that before issuing P-2, a proper and

fair inquiry has been held after giving the opportunity for the petitioner

to present his case without any restriction. There was no violation of

the rules of natural justice at all. Therefore, the petitioner has no legal

basis to maintain this application. In addition, the petitioner is guilty of

laches.

Accordingly, I refuse to issue notices to the respondents. The writ

application of the petitioner is dismissed, with costs fixed at

Rs.75,000/-.

Application dismissed.
