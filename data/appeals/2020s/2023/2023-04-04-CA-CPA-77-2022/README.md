This is a revisionary application made on 18.08.2022 to expunge the proceedings

and stay the proceedings of the High Court of Colombo case No. HCB/115/2022

where the learned High Court judge of Colombo has dismissed the preliminary

objections of the 1st accused-petitioner and 4th accused-petitioner (hereinafter

referred to as the petitioners) by the order delivered on 21.02.2022.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The petitioners along with two others

have been firstly indicted on 28.09.2017 under 14 charges by the Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (hereinafter referred to as the

Commission). Upon some accused being acquitted and the original lower court

case pertaining to the 1st indictment being withdrawn by the respondent the 2nd

indictment was filed against the petitioners and 2 other accused on 29.06.2021

on the same charges by the Commission. The charges include soliciting

gratifications of 150,000,000 LKR and 125,000,000 LKR on different occasions.

The instant application is pertaining to the case filed under the 2nd indictment

and the preliminary objections filed against it. Herein the petitioners challenge

the authority and capacity of the Attorney General to represent and prosecute on

behalf of the Commission. This Court is pursuing to entertain each argument

submitted by the petitioners and respondent in buttressing their case.

1. Legislatively mandated proper forum

It is firstly submitted by the petitioners that under Section 13 and 17 of the

CIABOC Act of No. 19 of 1994 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) the Commission

is barred from seeking assistance of the Attorney General. Section 13 (1) states

that,

(1) An officer of the Commission authorized by the Commission or any other

Attorney-at-Law specially authorized by the Commission shall be entitled

to conduct the prosecution at a trial of an offence held in a High Court on

an indictment signed by the Director-General, notwithstanding anything

to the contrary in any written law.

The CIABOC is a Commission which is instituted with independence as a high

priority. Looking at its composition, it consists of three members, two of whom

shall be retired Judges of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeal and one

of whom shall be a person with wide experience relating to the investigation of

crime and law enforcement (See Section 2 (a) of the Act). The Commission as an

institution is mandated to take all decisions collectively. The fact that the

commissioners hold the position for 5 years and cannot be reappointed further

exemplifies the measures taken to ensure the independence of this body. Under

the Constitution of the country although the President appoints the members to

the Commission it cannot be done according to her/his whims and fancies and

is required to seek recommendations from the Constitutional Council.

(Constitutional Council when the matter took place, later on Parliamentary

Council and currently Constitutional Council after the 21st Amendment to the

Constitution- No person shall be appointed by President as the Chairman or a

member of any Commissions specified in the Schedule to the Article 40B except on

a recommendation of the Constitutional Council vide Article 40B of the

Constitution.)

The Commission being an independent body is allowed to decide who to be

obtained for prosecutions and the decisions of the Commission cannot be

5

CA-CPA-77-22 Page 5 of 12 04/04/2023 IJ-18-23

questioned by any entity except by the proper action at the proper forum. Such

proper action is indicated in Section 24 (1) of the Act which states that the

jurisdiction vested in the Court of Appeal by Article 140 of the Constitution shall, in

respect of applications in which relief is sought against the Commission be

exercised by the Supreme Court and not by the Court of Appeal. In multiple cases,

such as Director General of Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery

or Corruption vs Lalith Kumara LTA 06 of 2016 dated 23.02.2022, B.A. Ranjan

Somasinghe vs Director General of Commission to Investigate Allegations

of Bribery or Corruption CPA 02/2022 dated 11.01.2022 and D.M. Rohini

Ekanayake vs Director General of Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery or Corruption CA PHC APN 76/21 dated 05.04.2022 and the Director

General Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery vs Amarawansha

Abeysiri Munasinghe CA HCC 308/2019 dated 31.01.2023, this Court has

repeatedly established that an act of the Commission has to be challenged by

way of writ application to the Supreme Court as mandated in Section 24(1) of

CIABOC Act. This stance was reaffirmed in the recent Supreme Court case

decided by a Bench comprising of five Justices of the Supreme Court presided by

His Lordship Justice Malalgoda P.C. in Indiketiya Hewage Kusumdasa

Mahanama v Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption

SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020 decided on 11.01.2023 which held that Any party who

intends to challenge an indictment forwarded by the Director General of CIABOC

on the basis that the CIABOC had failed to comply with Section 11 of the CIABOC

Act, the said challenge could only be raised in an appropriate action filed before an

appropriate forum. (At Page 44) (Emphasis added)

Challenging decisions of the Commission by way of a writ application at the

Supreme Court is now solidified precedent. Thus, if the petitioner in challenging

the decision of the Commission directing the Attorney General to prosecute

should follow legislatively mandated process and file the petition in the

appropriate forum.

2. Interpretation of Section 13 of the CIABOC Act.

Section 13 of the CIABOC Act stipulates the discretionary power vested within

the Commission to determine whether to obtain the service of an officer

authorized by the commission or an attorney-at-law authorized by the

commission in order to conduct the prosecution on behalf of the Commission.

Section 13 delineates two categories of persons who could be authorized by the

Commission to conduct a prosecution on behalf of the Commission, namely: An

Officer of the Commission authorized by the Commission; An attorney-at-law

specially authorized by the Commission.

An officer of the Attorney Generals Department retained for the purpose of

prosecuting a case by the Commission would fall under the second category, i.e.,

an attorney-at-law specially authorized by the Commission. This reinforces the

above discussed concept of discretion vested with the Commission to enlist an

appropriate prosecutor to for the case at hand in furtherance of justice. In such

a situation, the said counsel is proceeding on the directions and instruction of

the Commission as opposed to that of the Attorney General. This is most clear in

the event that an indictment is withdrawn during the proceedings of a bribery

case. In such an instance, the officer of the Attorney Generals Department

appearing on behalf of the Commission cannot unilaterally initiate such a

withdrawal. Such withdrawal must be sanctioned by the Commission. Moreover,

in the event of a conflict of interest, the AG or any other party cannot appear on

behalf of the Commission related to that particular matter and when such an

event transpires, the AG or any other Officer appearing on behalf of the

Commission is required to inform of such a conflict of interest to the Commission

and abstain from participating in that matter.

As such, the Commission may decide to opt for an officer outside of the

Commission if, inter alia:

- The Commission deems its own officers as ill-equipped to handle certain

cases given their complexity and want of highly specialized expertise

- The Commission deems certain cases requires the expertise of another

field related to the matter

7

CA-CPA-77-22 Page 7 of 12 04/04/2023 IJ-18-23

- The unavailability of the officers of the Commission to entrust the matter

at hand due to their engagement in another matter.

In the aforementioned instances or any other reason, the Commission deems fit,

the Commission has the discretion to authorize any officer outside the

Commission to prosecute on behalf of the Commission. This is in no way a

derogation of the independence of the Commission but an exercise of the

Commissions discretion. Although, the above-mentioned instances are not

exhaustive, it sheds light on the practical realities, the Commission encounters

when dealing with bribery and corruption.

Therefore, it is within the discretion of the Commission to decide whether to

entrust the task to an officer of the Commission or to an outsider depending on

the requirement at the time. If this Court were to hold that the retention of an

officer of the Attorney Generals Department by the Commission for the purpose

of prosecution is illegal or otherwise irregular, it would amount to a restriction of

the Commissions independence. In any event, as discussed previously, the

instant forum of revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is ill-equipped to

pass judgment on the exercise of the Commissions discretion.

3. Application of the maxim cursus curiae est lex curiae

The learned DSG has iterated in his written submissions that it is cursus curiae

for the Attorney General to prosecute behalf of the Commission. The maxim

cursus curiae est lex curiae is defined by Brooms Legal Maxims 10th Edition at

page 82 as Every court is the guardian of its own records and master of its own

practice and where a practice has existed it is convenient, except in cases of

extreme urgency and necessity, to adhere to it, because it is the practice, even

though no reason can be assigned for it; for an inveterate practice in the law

generally stands upon principles that are founded in justice and convenience.

Prosecution by Attorney General under the sanction of the Commission is

unquestionably convenient to the Commission due to the long-standing practice

and this Court does not foresee it to be prejudicial or inconsistent with the law.

In Halsburys Laws of England 4th Edition Vol 10 at para 703, it is stated that A

8

CA-CPA-77-22 Page 8 of 12 04/04/2023 IJ-18-23

court exercising judicial functions has an inherent power to regulate its own

procedure, save in so far as its procedure has been laid down by the enacted law,

and it by cannot adopt a practice or procedure contrary to or inconsistent with rules

laid down statute or adopted by ancient usage. In the Sri Lankan case of

Boyagoda v Mendis 30 NLR 321 it was stated that where an enactment

concerning procedure has received a certain interpretation which has been

recognized by the Courts for a very long period of years, the practice based upon

such interpretation should be followed. (In SC Appeal No. 06/2012 S-C. minute

dated 2012.06.15 is also stated similar view). As the Attorney General is acting

under the directives of the Commission at all times in her/his role in prosecution

the maxim is well applicable for the instant matter and hence, this Court is

inclined to accept and buttress this view.

4. The task of prosecution

Although this Court has established that this application has to be calibrated, in

the benefit of judicial efficiency, this Court would like to express its views on some

arguments petitioners have elaborated. The petitioners submit that as per the

Hansard Report of the debate conducted on 04.10.1994 in the Parliament of Sri

Lanka when the Bill was presented, then Justice Minister Prof. G. L. Pieris had

stated that,

.

- the task of prosecution.

(Page

No. 284 Document marked Q8 in the brief)

Upon perusing the full text of the said Hansard, it is plainly clear that the

legislative intent does not resort to impose stern obstructions to the Attorney

Generals Department in being involved with CIABOC matters, but it has rather

mandated the CIABOC to take the initiative and direct. Further, in comparison

to the previous Bribery legislations which endowed more powers to the Attorney

9

CA-CPA-77-22 Page 9 of 12 04/04/2023 IJ-18-23

General who originally had the power to conduct all investigations and institute

proceedings, the present legislation has clearly transferred such powers to the

Commission and has empowered it to conduct investigations and prosecutions

to ensure its independence. However, it does not downright bar the Commission

from resorting to the Attorney Generals Department for prosecutions or

assistance. The Act has rather placed the Attorney General if assistance is sought

by her/him under the purview of the Commission and has mandated to act under

the directives of the Commission.

5. Section 24B of the Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Act, No. 3

of 2019.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioners further relies on the

Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Act, No. 3 of 2019 Section 24D which

states that the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption may

solicit, receive and consider the advice or opinion of the Attorney-General or any

officer representing the Attorney-General in giving effect to the provisions of

sections 24A, 24B, or 24C. The petitioners contention is that the amendment

has only mandated the Attorney General to advise but not to prosecute. However

this Court would like to emphasize Section 24B of the same legislation which

mentions that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act or any other written law, the

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption may, if it deems

appropriate, forward the material collected and received under section 24A to the

Attorney-General or to any other authority to take any appropriate action under

any other written law.

Therefore, it is farfetched for the petitioner to rely on implications of Section 24D

when 24B clearly depicts the role of Attorney General in taking appropriate

actions for matters forwarded by the Commission.

6. The precedent set by Land Reform Commission v. Grand Central

Limited

In the landmark judgment of Land Reform Commission v. Grand Central

Limited [1981] 2 Sri. L.R. 147 (CA), [1981] 1 Sri. L.R. 250 (SC) it was established

that the Attorney General cannot appear in his private capacity viz appearing as

a private counsel and can only appear in his official capacity as Attorney General.

At the Supreme Court, it was iterated by His Lordship Chief Justice Samarakoon

Q.C. that,

. the Attorney-General of his Country is the leader of the Bar and the highest

Legal Officer of the State. As Attorney-General he has a duty to Court, to the State

and to the subject to be wholly detached, wholly independent and to act impartially

with the sole object of establishing the truth. It is for that reason that all Courts in

this Island request the appearance of the Attorney- General as amicus curiae when

the Court requires assistance, which assistance has in the past been readily given.

That image will certainly be tarnished if he takes part in private litigation arising

out of private disputes. I cannot but agree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal

that there are constraints on the Attorney-General engaging in private practice in

the civil law as well as the criminal law. It is regrettable that the State has sought

to act counter to tradition, (prudence and propriety) in granting the Attorney-

General and his law officers the right of private practice. Justice is the loser

thereby. No man can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love

the other: or he will hold to one and despise the other. No Attorney-General can

serve both State and private litigant.

This Court believes that the instant matter can be clearly distinguished with the

circumstances of the Land Reform Commission matter. In the above case when

the then Attorney General S. Pasupathi was inquired as to in which capacity he

appeared, he stated that he appeared in his private capacity of an Attorney-at-

Law. The petitioners have mistaken the ratio of these lines of judgment which

barred the Attorney General from appearing in his personal capacity. It is

unambiguously well settled law that the Attorney General cannot appear for

private parties; however, the persistent matter discussed at above cases was

11

CA-CPA-77-22 Page 11 of 12 04/04/2023 IJ-18-23

whether the Attorney General can appear in his personal capacity for the

matters of government bodies or agencies. As quoted above the Court has

maintained the line of precedent that the Attorney General cannot appear in

personal capacity. However, it is unclear in the instant matter whether the

petitioners are contending that the Attorney General appeared in his personal

capacity as an Attorney-at-Law disregarding his official status or whether he

prosecuted in his official capacity as the Attorney General.

Nevertheless, the petitioners contend in the written submissions that under

Section 12 of the CIABOC Act it is only the Director General of the Commission

that can institute proceedings under the Act. This is well settled law and has no

necessity to be discussed in the instant application as the Commission has

properly directed to institute proceedings through the Director General as evident

from submissions made in the present matter. Instead, it is the prosecution by

the Attorney General that is at issue here.

7. Conclusion.

Given the range of powers and independence cast upon the Commission, this

Court decides that the Commission has the discretion to obtain services of the

Attorney General solely for the purpose of prosecution, when the need arises

under Section 13 (1) of the CIABOC Act. At certain instances Attorney General

may have better capacity to prosecute on certain bribery matters, and at such

instances Commission as an independent body should not be deprived of the

opportunity to resort to the Attorney General. Restricting such instances are not

provided for by the law or precedent and imposing such restrictions would

undermine the Commissions independence and autonomy. Furthermore,

offences related to bribery and corruption are not mere private disputes but ones

with greater impact on the State and the public at large. In such cases, the courts

have a vital role to play, in ensuring justice is served while also maintaining a

balance between the rights of the accused and the rights of the general public.

The judiciary must ensure that the accused's rights to a fair trial are protected,

while also ensuring that the interests of the society are not compromised. The

Attorney General, more than any other Attorney-at-Law, is mandated to act in

12

CA-CPA-77-22 Page 12 of 12 04/04/2023 IJ-18-23

public interest. Thereby there is no reason to bar the Attorney General from

prosecuting on behalf of the Commission where at all times the Attorney General

is required to act under the directions of the Commission without making any

autonomous decisions when prosecuting. The verbiage does not insinuate any

kind of hierarchical superiority between the two offices; instead, it underscores

the fact that both institutions are autonomous in their own right and thus, it is

imperative for them to uphold their independence and integrity with utmost

sincerity.

Based on the aforementioned conclusions, I find no justification for intervening

with the order made by the learned High Court Judge.

Application dismissed.
