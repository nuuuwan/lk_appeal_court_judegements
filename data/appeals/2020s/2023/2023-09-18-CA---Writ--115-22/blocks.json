The relocation of the weekly fair and the construction of the railway project are two disparate projects. Delaying the process of acquisition of the purported land for relocation of the weekly fair could not be made a direct impediment to the construction of the railway project as the required lands for it have already been acquired. Hence the wastage of funds, construction materials or other resources relating to the railway project cannot be considered as grounds for urgency in respect of the questioned acquisition as the Respondents claimed. Further, the specified time period during which the railway project is set to be concluded has also not been revealed. Therefore, I am of the view that the urgency to complete the railway project cannot be considered as urgent as required to acquire the land for the purpose of relocation of the weekly fair under proviso.",

    "text": "However, the question remains whether such a necessity alone would suffice to justify the urgent acquisition of the aforementioned land. As submitted by the Respondents, every Sunday, a weekly fair takes place in the centre of Malsiripua town on the Ragedara-Milawana Road. The fair acts as the primary trading hub for agricultural produce in the area, benefiting approximately 400 farmers and 1,500 customers. The absence of a marketing centre is a severe setback for the farmers and business community in the vicinity, impeding the trade of their agricultural commodities and jeopardizing their livelihoods. Furthermore, numerous consumers also miss out on the advantages of these agricultural products. On such grounds delaying of relocation of the weekly fair may badly affect the lives and the day-to-day affairs of the consumers, traders, farmers and other stakeholders. As the document 2R6-(i) divulges the said acquisition process has been initiated as far back as 2019. The importance of addressing this pressing social concern promptly and without delay was emphasized as it significantly impacts individuals. [document 2R6-(ii)]. Once the construction of the railway project over the existing weekly fair premises commences such impact will increase. Furthermore, the repercussions of the absence of a weekly fair are further compounded by the fact that such a fair had existed for a prolonged period of time and the residents have adopted their lives to depend on such a trade hub. In the Fernandopulle case(supra) the Supreme Court held that the delay",

Therefore, as explained above, sufficient reasons exist to come to the conclusion that there is an urgent requirement for the subject acquisition to take place. The Petitioners failed to effectively challenge the above circumstances which were based on urgency. Therefore, I am of the view that the authorities have submitted satisfactory grounds for a requirement of urgency to take immediate possession of the land. The Petitioners have failed to establish sufficiently that there was no urgency. Their main argument is the failure to consider the existence of alternative lands. Therefore, I am unable to accept the position that there are no satisfactory grounds for taking immediate possession of the land under proviso (a) to Section 38 of the Act.",

The Petitioners claim that the land which is to be acquired is not the most suitable land for the relocation of the weekly fair and alternative lands including several lands owned by the state in the vicinity have not been considered. Nevertheless, after the institution of this application, a field visit and an investigation have been conducted by the 2nd, 4th and other authorities to determine the suitability of the alternative lands including the questioned land [documents 2R7(1) and 2R7(ii)]. During that field investigation, two lands owned by the National Livestock Development Board, as mentioned in the Petitioner's Petition, were also taken into consideration. In the report [2R7(1) and 2R7(ii)], the Respondents have justified their request for acquiring the disputed land by stating that it is suitable for connecting with the remaining portion of land, which was used for the weekly fair, and avoiding the acquisition of any constructions situated in the land.",
