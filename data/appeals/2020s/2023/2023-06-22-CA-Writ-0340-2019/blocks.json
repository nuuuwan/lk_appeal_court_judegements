The Petitioners contention is that Ukkurala died without nominating a successor to his two allotments of land. According to the Petitioner, Ukkurala left his wife and nine children as his heirs. Petitioner stated that at the time of his death, Ukkurala was separated from his wife and thus, she did not succeed to the subject matter, exercising her rights under the Land Development Ordinance4.",

The 1st preference is for the sons and the 2nd is for the daughters. The brothers come below, the 7th preference in the line. However, in this instance, the Divisional Secretary has alienated the land to the 5th Respondent who is the male child of the late Gunarathnabanda, and to the two brothers of Gunarathnabanda, over the two daughters. In my view, the two daughters of the late Gunarathnabanda, Nirosha Damayanthi, and Sandeepa Jayamenike should get preference over the brothers of Gunarathnabanda. Assuming that the brothers are entitled, the Petitioner being the eldest surviving son should get preference over Lokubanda and Rambanda.

The amendments had been made on the 7th June 1983. Gunarathnabanda died on the 18th March 1983. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner argued that since the amendment has taken place after the death of Gunarthnabanda it is invalid. However, alterations in a Birth Certificate can be made to bring it in conformity with the legitimate status of a person, where by virtue of operation of the provisions of section 3 of the Legitimacy Act, No. 3 of 1970, that person is rendered legitimate14. According to Section 3 of the Legitimacy Act No. 3 of 1970, a valid marriage would render legitimate any child procreated by the parties prior to such marriage.
