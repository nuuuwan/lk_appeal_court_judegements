The relevant provision of the aforementioned Section that sets a time limit for making an assessment is almost identical to the Section 134 (5) of IR Act No. 38 of 2000. The only material difference is that the time limit in IR Act No. 38 of 2000 is three years while it is two years in IR Act No. 10 of 2006. Further, no time limit for the issuance of the Notice of Assessment is set out in the relevant Section in both statutes. If the intention of the legislature was to set up a time bar for the issuing of Notice of Assessment, the legislature could have enacted that no notice of assessment should be given after the expiry of the prescribed time limit, instead of enacting that no assessment shall be made after the expiry of the prescribed time limit.",
