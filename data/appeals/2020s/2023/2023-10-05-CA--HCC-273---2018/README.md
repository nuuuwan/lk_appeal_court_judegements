MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the judgment dated 18.10.2018

of the High Court of Embilipitiya.

The appellant along with another accused had been indicted for murder in the

High Court on the basis of common intention. But upon the conclusion of the

Page 2 of 8

trial the trial judge had found the appellant guilty for the charge in the

indictment and had acquitted the other accused. The appellant being aggrieved

by the said conviction had lodged the instant appeal.

One of the main grounds of appeal raised by the appellant was that the

identification of the dead body was not sufficient.

According to the version of the prosecution the entire case for the prosecution

is based on circumstantial evidence.

The deceased on the 14th of April 1999 had told PW1 who is related to him, that

he was going to the house of the appellant who was known by the name of

Dayananda. Thereafter he had gone missing until his body had been found in a

urea bag in a deserted place on the 23rd of the same month. When the body

had been taken out of the bag it had been identified by the shirt he had been

wearing last. PW1 also had identified the deceased from the toe of one foot of

his because that particular toe had been shorter than the others

The evidence of the niece of the deceased had revealed that when she was at

home soon after the body of the deceased had been discovered the appellant

had come to her house and when the police also came at the same time, he had

runoff. But when her mother later who is the sister of the deceased had

confronted the appellant, he had said that he had killed the deceased, which

had been told to the niece also.

But when referring to the evidence of the niece of the appellant the learned

presidents counsel appearing for the appellant stated that the niece of the

appellant had been treated adverse but the learned High Court Judge had not

considered the same. But upon perusal of the brief, we observe that there was

no order by Court to treat the witness adverse but Court had given time for the

state Counsel to consider the same. Therefore, there had been no material for

the High Court Judge to consider under section 154 of the Evidence Ordinance.

But we observe that the sister of the appellant had not told the police about the

confession made to her by the appellant. But we observe that the sister of the

appellant appears to be a very illiterate person. Therefore, her laps in not telling

the police about the confession does not create a reasonable doubt in her

credibility as a witness, because hundred percent accuracy cannot be expected

from a witness of this nature.

According to the evidence of the police officers the appellant had fled the area

soon after the incident. The appellant had been taken in to custody on 01st of

May 1999 at Udawalawe and on his statement two knives had been recovered.

According to the evidence of the police the body of the deceased had been

heavily decomposed at the time of the recovery, even the shirt on the body had

surfaced after the body had been washed.

The hand written postmortem report of Professor Chandrasiri Niriella has been

produced and given evidence on by Dr. Priyantha Perera. According to the

evidence of the doctor that when the body is heavily decomposed possibility of

identification could be difficult. But by certain individual outstanding features

pertaining to the deceased the body can be identified. The body had been

examined on the 29th of April 1999. The body had been identified by the

younger brother of the deceased. Several injuries had been identified on the

deceased, and injury number one, three, six, two have been identified to be

instrumental in causing his death. The two knives shown to the doctor had been

identified as being possible murder weapons.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case, the appellant had been called upon

to place his defense before court. He had a made a statement from the dock.

According to his dock statement he had denied the allegation and had said that

he had been aware that the body of the deceased had been found but nobody

identified the body. Subsequently police have arrested him and he had been

badly assaulted by the police and a statement also had been recorded from him.

Page 4 of 8

He further says that on the day of the New Year the deceased had come to his

place along with two other friends and had brought him a tin of biscuits and

thereafter had left. He completely denies the recovery of section 27 recoveries

based on his statements.

Upon the conclusion of the defense case the trial judge had found the appellant

guilty for the charge in the indictment.

According to the above mentioned material the deceased had been last seen on

the 14th of April 1999. He had gone missing after stating that he was going to

visit the appellant on the New Years Day. The body had been recovered from a

deserted place on 24th of April 1999. The body had been decomposed but it had

been identified by the relatives from the shirt and a special feature in his toe.

The appellant admits in his dock statement that the deceased came to see him

on the New Years Day with two friends. But he denies the allegation. The niece

and the sister of the deceased had been confessed to by the appellant that he

killed the deceased. The appellant had been arrested in Udawalawa. On his

statements two weapons had been recovered. The doctor had identified very

serious cut and stab injuries on the deceased. The two weapons recovered on

the statement of the appellant had been identified to be as possible murder

weapons. The prosecution witnesses have been subjected to lengthy cross

examination. Certain contradictions and omissions had been marked in the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses. But in the opinion of this court those

contradictions and omissions have not gone to the root of the case.

It had been held in the case of AG vs. Potta Naufer and Others (2007) 2 Sri L.

R. 186 to 187 p. that,

.. court should disregard discrepancies and contradictions which do not go

to the root of the case. The mere presence of contradictions does not have the

effect of diminishing the overall credit worthiness of witnesses.

Page 5 of 8

It has been also held in the case of Oliver Dayanand Adansonia alias Raju vs.

Republic of Sri Lanka CA 28th of 2009 decided on 13.02.2013 that,

It is an established principal that a criminal case cannot be proved with

mathematical accuracy by evidence given by human beings as witnesses.

Therefore, according to the evidence led before the trial judge the information

possessed by the prosecution witnesses regarding the deceased is that he had

left the relations house to visit the appellant. Nine days later he had been found

dead with cut and stab injuries. Weapons which could have been used to cause

the injuries on the deceased had been recovered on the statement of the

appellant. Appellant also had admitted that the deceased visited him with two

friends. The lengthy cross examination of the prosecution witnesses had not

created a reasonable doubt in the case of the prosecution. It is a well

established theory in criminal law that and allegation made against and accused

person should be proved beyond reasonable doubt. In the instant case the

prosecution had showed in circumstantial evidence that on the day the

deceased disappeared he had visited the appellant. Appellant also admits the

same. But the appellant says that the deceased was with two other friends. But

the appellant does not divulge as to who those two people were. It is a well-

established principal that an accused person has no liability to prove a case. But

if something is withing his knowledge he needs to put forward an explanation.

This has been set out under section 105 of the Evidence Ordinances which reads

as follows,

When a person is accused of any offence the burden of proving the existence

of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exemptions in the

penal code or within any special exception or proviso or contained in any other

part of the same code or in any law defining the offence is upon him and the

court shall presume an absence of such circumstances.

Illustrations (b)to section 105 is a clear example of that situation,

Page 6 of 8

An accused of murder, alleges that grave and sudden provocation he was

deprived of the power of self-control. The burden proof is on A.

In the case of The King vs James Chandrasekera 44 NLR page 97, Howard CJ

held that In regard to section 105, the expression burden of proving is used

in the sense of introducing evidence and not burden of establishing a case, for

the latter remains throughout the trial on the prosecution. The burden of proof

in section 105 is an evidentiary provision. All that the section says is that the

duty of making a general or a special exception a fact in issue is on the

accused.

Therefore, in the instant case the prosecution is alleging that the deceased

disappeared after visiting the appellant and thereafter his body was found and

the appellant is admitting that the deceased visited the appellant. But he says

that there were two other people with the deceased at the time of the visit.

Therefore, if the accused is to substantiate his denial in an acceptable way it

would have been most prudent for the appellant to place the evidence of those

two people with whom the deceased had visited him or at least have mentioned

their names. This does not by any means suggest that an accused has to prove

his innocence.

Furthermore, in the instant instance the prosecution has made an allegation

against the appellant, with uncontradicted lengthily cross examined evidence

that the deceased was last seen in the company of the appellant and later he

had been found dead and the appellant had confessed to the relatives of the

deceased that he killed the deceased. Therefore, the only irresistible inference

that can be drawn from these circumstances is that the appellant committed

the offence of murdering the deceased.

The dock statement made by the appellant does not create any doubt in the

case of the prosecution. It has been held in many of our cases that when a dock

statement is made that it has to be acted upon if the court believe the version

Page 7 of 8

even if it is not subjected to cross examination. It has been held in the case of

B.A Premaratne vs The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka court of

appeal 168 of 2009 decided on 20th of February 2014 by Justice Sisira Abrew

that,

1. Dock statement must be considered as evidence subject to the

infirmities that it is not a sworn statement.

2. If dock statement is believed it must be acted upon.

3. If dock statement creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case

defense must succeed

4. Dock statement of one accused must not be used against the others.

In the instant matter one of the main grounds of appeal is the lack of

identification of the dead body. On analyzing the evidence of the doctor it is

very clear that the Judicial Medical Officer who conducted the post mortem has

very clearly stated in the report that the relatives of the deceased identified the

dead body with the shirt and a special feature in his toe. The doctor who gave

evidence has also explained that although the body had been heavily

discomposed closed associates of the deceased can always identify the body on

special features of the deceased and of any remaining clothing. In the instant

case these two features are available in the evidence led by the prosecution.

Therefore we are unable to see any credit worthiness in this ground of appeal.

Another ground of appeal raised by the counsel of the appellant is that

adverse witness in the prosecution had not been properly dealt by the trial

judge. This position we had discussed above and have held that there was no

order made with regard to any adverse witness.

The third ground of appeal is that the recoveries made under section 27 of

the Ordinance Evidence has not been considered by the trial judge. But this

too we observe has been dealt in page 379 of the brief but has inadvertently

referred the Criminal Procedure Code in place of the Evidence Ordinance.

Page 8 of 8

Thereafter the trial judge had referred to the circumstantial evidence and has

itemized the circumstances which had arisen against the accused in the case of

the prosecution.

In a case based on circumstantial evidence the prosecution lends itself to a

reasonable inference that either the accused or another could have committed

the act, the prosecution must exclude the other effectively in order to attach

responsibility to the accused for that act. This has been discussed in the cases

of The Queen vs Kularatne (1968) 71 NLR 529, Kuruppaiah Serveys vs The King

1960 52 NLR 227 and in many others.

In the instant matter the trial judge had discussed the adverse circumstances

pertaining to the accused at page 382 and has concluded that the circumstantial

evidence led at the trial draws the irresistible inference that the appellant and

no other committed the murder of the deceased.

The counsel for the appellant raised three grounds of appeal which we have

discussed above but we see no merit in the same. As such the instant appeal

is dismissed and the conviction and the sentence of the appellant is here by

affirmed.
