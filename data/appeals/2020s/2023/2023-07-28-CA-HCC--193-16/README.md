The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted

before the High Court of Vavuniya for having committed the offence of murder of his own

daughter Mylvaganam Gowrie an offence made punishable under Section 296 of the Penal

Code.

Prosecution led the evidence of ten witnesses and evidence marked as P1 to P3.

The Accused made a dock statement. After the trial, the Learned High Court Judge

convicted the Accused for the murder, and the death sentence was imposed.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence the Accused has appealed

to this court.

The following grounds were set out in the written submission.

Page 3 of 5

1. It is respectfully submitted that although the Appellant had taken up on a

defence of a denial, evidence emanates from prosecution witness that the

Appellant was drunk at the time of the incident.

2. It is reiterated that PW1 the daughter of the Appellant was testified to the

effect that the Appellant was under the influence of liquor and after

stabbing the deceased the Appellant stabbed himself too. Further she has

stated that she did not know what happened to the Appellant. (Pages 77-

76)

3. It warrants mentioning that in the instant case, the wife of the Appellant

was abroad when the incident had taken place and the Appellant was the

person looking after the children PW1 the daughter of the Appellant too

admitted that her father was looking after them well.

4. Learned Trial Judge in his judgment has come to the conclusion that

appellant was under the influence of liquor on the day in question and he

was not in a state to understand what he was doing. (Pages 154-156)

5. Further Learned Trial judge has concluded that since the Appellant did not

take the above defence he was duty bound to explain his case. (Pages

161/162)

6. It is respectfully submitted that it was incumbent upon the Learned Trial

Judge to consider the plea of voluntary intoxication.

The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:

According to PW1 Mylvaganam Sakunthala (the daughter of the Accused and the

sister of the Deceased) states that on the fatal day of 28th March 2008, had been with her

sister under the care of their father (the Accused) due to the reason her mother had gone

abroad as per the constant quarrelling with their father.

Page 4 of 5

PW1 described the events of the fatal day where the Accused had come home

intoxicated after consuming liquor and was quarrelling with PW1s uncle and didnt let

them sleep as the Accused had said that her uncle was going to stab her and no one should

sleep. Therefore, she was awake and watching television while the sisters were sleeping,

suddenly the Accused approached her and stabbed her and the Deceased who was

sleeping, though PW1 tried to prevent it she failed.

Thereafter PW1 and the Deceased were then taken to the Vavuniya hospital where

the doctor pronounced her sister dead. She then made a complaint to the police along with

PW2.

In the cross examination she stated that there was sufficient light to identify the

Accused stabbing the Deceased when we analyse the evidence given by this witness we

are of the view her evidence is consistent.

We observe that there are no contradictions or discrepancies in her evidence

therefore there is no reason for us to disbelieve her.

We also do not see any reason for her to implicate her father in this crime.

According to PW4 Samarkoon Mudiyanselage Kapila Bandara Samarakoon Police

inspector has stated, that he visited the crime scene with the SOCO officers (PW8) and

observed the blood stains and the blood soaked knife found inside on the side of the room.

This production of evidence marked as P1 was taken over by the SOCO officers PW8.

Thereafter he states that the Accused had admitted himself to the hospital since

he had stabbed himself before PW4 engaged in arresting him. It had come to the Accused

attention that the police had been looking for him, where he then surrendered on the 3rd

of April 2008 at the police station as his allegations were pronounced and arrested him,

his statement was recorded.

The evidence specified by PW8 corroborates with PW4s witness evidence

pertaining to the properties of the knife.

PW7 Thamotharampillai Jayarathan the Judicial Medical officer, states that the

cause of death was due to excessive bleeding where 2 to 3 litres of blood was found in

the abdominal cavity. During the Autopsy, two injuries were found one being on the left

Page 5 of 5

and the other on the right side just above the navel. He also stated that the injury

sustained was inflicted by a sharp weapon.

The Accused stated in his dock statement that he did not know what happened to

him.

The learned High Court Judge has considered the Accused version and rejected

his evidence. It is pertinent to note that he had not created any doubts about the evidence

postulated by the prosecution.

We see that the Learned Trial Judge had carefully considered the evidence placed

before him and has come to the conclusion that the prosecution proved the case beyond

reasonable doubt.

We see no reason to interfere with the judgement made by the learned High Court

Judge. Therefore, this appeal is dismissed.
