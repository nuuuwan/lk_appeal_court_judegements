It is an admitted fact that the some of the private circuits have already instituted an action in the District Court bearing No. DSP 99/2018 (P 16) seeking relief regarding the agreement between the NFC and the private circuits. According to P 16 the reliefs sought inter-alia are that the agreements are valid, binding, operative, and in force. Further, a declaration that the agreements cannot be unilaterally terminated and/or unilaterally declared null and void. Hence, it appears that the private circuits have already sought relief from the District Court with respect to the same agreements, the matter in issue in the instant case. Accordingly, the private circuits, the affected parties themselves have acknowledged that the relationship between the NFC and the private circuits is contractual and resorted to the alternative remedy available.",
