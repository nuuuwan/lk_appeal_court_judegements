Judgment

This is an appeal emanating from an order of the High Court of the North-Western

Province holden at Kurunegala.

The Officer-in-charge of the Police station of Kurunegala had filed an information in

the Magistrate Court of Kurunegala in case bearing no. 63468 informing that breach

of peace is threatened or likely to be threatened due to a land dispute between the 1st

Party and the 2nd Party Respondents.

It appears that Anura Samarajeewa, Shulari Samarajeewa, Irangi Mekala Chatumini

Samarajeewa, Madurasiri Adirake were named as the 1st Party and T. D. H. Sriyani

Manel Dharmadasa Wijesinghe Arachchige Rasika Ganardhara named as 2nd Party in

the said case filed at the Magistrate court.

After following the procedure under Part VII of the Primary Court Procedure Act no.

44 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) the learned Additional Magistrate who

was acting as the Primary Court judge issued notices on the said 1st Party and the 2nd

Party Respondents.

Page 5 of 13

The learned Additional Magistrate having inquired into the dispute between the Parties

had concluded the matter in terms of section 68(3) of the Act and has held that the 1st

Party Respondent had been dispossessed from the premises in dispute within two

months immediately before the date of filing of the information. Therefore, the learned

Magistrate has ordered to place the 1st Party Respondent in possession of the premises

in dispute.

Being aggrieved by the order of the learned Additional Magistrate, the 2nd Party

Respondent-Petitioner had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of the

North Western Province holden in Kurunegala. However, the learned High Court Judge

had held in favour of the 1st Party Respondent-Respondent and dismissed the

application of the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner.

Being dissatisfied with the said order of dismissal, the 2nd Party-Respondent-Petitioner

-Appellant had preferred an appeal to this court seeking to set aside the said order of

the learned High Court Judge and the learned Additional Magistrate.

It is to be noted in the Case of Punchi Nona Vs. Padumasena and Others1, it was held

that the primary court exercising special jurisdiction under section 66 of the Act, is not

involved in an investigation into the title or the right to possession, which is the

function of a civil court. What the primary court is required to do is to take preventive

action and make a provisional order pending the final adjudication of the rights of the

parties in a civil court. It is to be observed that section 66 of the Act has not granted

legal competency to investigate and ascertain the ownership or title to the disputed

premises which is a function of the District Court.

The intention of the legislature in introducing Part VII of Primary Courts Procedure

Act No. 44 of 1979 is to prevent the breach of peace and not to embark on a protracted

trial investigating title when deciding the matter in dispute.

Section 74 of the said Act stipulates that;

(1) An order under this Part shall not affect or prejudice any right or interest in

any land or part of a land which any person may be able to establish in a civil

suit; and it shall be the duty of a Judge of a Primary Court who commences to

1 [1994] 2 SLR 117

Page 6 of 13

hold an inquiry under this Part to explain the effect of these sections to the

persons concerned in the dispute.

(2) An appeal shall not lie against any determination or order under this Part.

As stated above, according to terms of section 74(2) of the Act, there is no appeal

process against any order or determination made under Part VII of the Act.

However, the aggrieved party can move in revision to the High Court against the order

of the Primary Court. Revisionary Jurisdiction is available not as a right but at the

discretion of court to remedy a miscarriage of justice. Furthermore, order of the High

Court in a revision application can be appealed to the Court of Appeal by operation of

the law. Moreover, if a party is dissatisfied by judgement of the Court of Appeal, he is

entitled to prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court.

In this respect, court draws attention to the article titled Does Section 66 Applications

Create A Blind Hope for Litigants2 which analyses the intricacies of section 66.

Accordingly, in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the

Orders of the Primary Court as well as the High Court are Provisional Orders

made for the purpose of preserving public peace in a dispute affecting land

pending final adjudication of the rights of the parties in a competent civil Court.

Towards the end of Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, remedy for

an aggrieved party is provided. (Section 74 is given above).

Right of appeal is a statutory right which is not available as of a right and that

can be taken away by specific terms. Although Section 74 (2) prohibits appeals

from orders made in Section 66 applications, the matter may nevertheless be

canvassed by way of revision. The Court of Appeal shall have the jurisdiction of

appeal and revision by way of Article 138 of the Constitution. However, without

taking away such right, Article 154(3) (b) has given the High Court the

appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of orders given by Magistrates

Courts and Primary Courts.

Most of the Magistrates direct parties go before the District Court to have the

dispute resolved. That is the reason why the Legislature in its wisdom did not

provide a right of appeal against the order of the Magistrate.

It is imperative to note that preferring an appeal to the Court of Appeal would

not serve the purpose behind the enactment or the intention of the Legislature

in introducing Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act. Thus, it is felicitous

for the party concerned to invoke the civil jurisdiction of a competent court

rather than preferring an appeal to the Court of Appeal.

Thus, the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 further stipulates that

no appeal shall lie against any Determination or Order under this Act to

prevent prolong and protracted hearings and also to prevent frittering away

precious time of courts and parties. When examining the intention of the

Legislature in including the 3-month time frame for a matter to be concluded

before the Primary Court Judge, the implication is such that Legislature

intended to discourage people from filing cases on frivolous grounds, devoid of

merit.

Thus, in actual sense the suitable step is to have civil rights of the relevant

parties adjudicated in the relevant competent civil court. Therefore, when filing

an appeal against a provisional order given under the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, the party concerned must come to a degree of certainty that their

claim has merit and is likely to succeed and thereupon decide on the

appropriate platform from which he can receive a fair remedy. It is incumbent

upon the learned High Court Judges to direct parties to a competent civil Court

for a final adjudication of their legal rights pertaining to the land in question

instead of invoking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. This will enable us

to witness an efficient administration of justice in our Court system 3

The intention of the legislature was discussed in the case of Krishnamoorthi Sivakumar Vs.

Pathima Johara Packer where De Silva, J. held that;

The intention of the legislature in introducing Part VII of Primary Courts

Procedure Act No.44 of 1979 is to prevent a breach of the peace and not to

embark on a protracted trial investigating the title when deciding the matter in

dispute. 4

3 ibid 4 No: CA (PHC) 122/2018, CAM dated 27.09.2022

Page 8 of 13

Thus, if the Appellant in this application wishes to establish his legal rights to the

disputed portion of land, this is not the forum to adjudicate legal right of parties relating

to the land in dispute.

In the case of Nandawathi and others v Mahindasena5 it was held that,

When an Order of a Primary Court Judge is challenged by way of revision in

the High Court, the High Court can exercise only the legality of that Order and

not the correction of that Order.

It was emphasized by Ranjith Silva J. that;

I am of the opinion that this particular right of appeal in the circumstances

should not be taken as an appeal in the true sense, but in fact as an application

to examine the correctness, legality or the propriety of the Order made by the

High Court Judge in the exercise of revisionary powers. The Court of Appeal

should not under the guise of an appeal attempt to re-hear or re-evaluate the

evidence led in the main case.

In view of the afore cited Judgment, this court is not supposed to consider this as an

appeal preferred against the order of the Magistrates Court. This Court should only

consider the order pronounced by the Provincial High Court in the exercise of its

revisionary jurisdiction.

It was emphasized in the case of Dissanayake Rallage Nihal Chandrasiri Dissanyake

Vs. Rev. Mampita Hemaloka Thero and others, where De Silva, J. held that;

In this instance, it was submitted that the order of the Primary Court is a

provisional Order, and if any dispute exists over civil rights, one must resort to

a civil action. The Primary Court was of the view that as there is a breach of

peace and as the road has been classified as a public road and as a road

maintained by the Pradeshiya Sabha, the Respondents are entitled to use the

roadway and to have the right granted until the matter is finally decided by a

civil Court with competent jurisdiction.6

It was held in the case of Bank of Ceylon Vs Kaleel

The Court to exercise revisionary jurisdiction, the order challenged must have

occasioned failure of justice and manifestly erroneous which goes beyond an

5 [2009] 2 S L R 218 6 CA (PHC) 168/2012, CAM 25.10.2022

Page 9 of 13

error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to

it. In other words, the order complained of is of such nature which would have

shocked the conscience of Court. 7

In Urban Development Authority Vs. Ceylon Entertainments Ltd. Nanayakkara J. held

with Udalagama J. agreeing,

That presence of exceptional circumstances by itself would not be sufficient if

there is no express pleading to the effect in the petition whenever an application

is made invoking, the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. 8

Similarly, in Siripala Vs. Lanerolle, Sisira de Abrew J. held

Even though the Petitioner attempts to justify the recourse to revision in his

written submissions, it is well settled law that existence of such exceptional

circumstances should be amply and clearly demonstrated in the petition

itself.in the instant application, the Petitioner has neither disclosed nor

expressly pleaded exceptional circumstances that warrant intervention by way

of revision.9

It was held in the case Athurupana Vs. Premasinghe B.L.R,

Every illegality, impropriety or irregularity does not warrant the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction, but such jurisdiction will be exercised only where the

illegality, impropriety or irregularity in the proceeding has resulted in a

miscarriage of justice by the party affected being denied what is lawfully due to

the party.10

Since litigants are unaware of the intricacies of the appeals and revision applications filed

in the superior courts, they are convinced that all their disputes and legal rights would be

determined by way of an appeal or a revision application. For this reason, it is apparent

that sometimes it is a waste of time for the litigants and further litigation is a meaningless

exercise by Courts. In such a situation, a High Court Judge should be mindful to direct

parties to invoke the civil jurisdiction of a competent civil court and allow parties to

withdraw the revision application to end litigation under Section 66 of the Primary Court

Procedure Act. Since Part VII of the Act is introduced to prevent the breach of peace being

threatened or when likely to be threatened relating to a land dispute, it is incumbent upon

7 [2004] (1) SLR 284 8 CA 1319/2001, C.A.M. dated 05.04.2002 9 [2012] 1 SLR 105 10 [2004] Vol. X Part II P. 60SC

Page 10 of 13

the learned High Court Judges to direct parties to the competent civil courts to have their

legal rights in question adjudicated and possession of the rightful owners established.

In the case of Rasheed Ali v Mohomed Ali and Others,11 it was held that the powers of

revision could be used only in exceptional circumstances. A merely wrong order made by

a judge or wrong reasons given for the order by a judge alone does not amount to

exceptional circumstances.

Although there is no right of appeal against the order of a Magistrate acting in the

capacity of a Primary Court Judge exercising jurisdiction in terms of Section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act, revisionary jurisdiction is permissible in exceptional

circumstances where any injustice or a miscarriage of justice has been caused to a

party. The Court of Appeal is not empowered to correct errors made by the learned

Magistrate. However, Court of Appeal has to determine whether the learned High

Court Judge has properly exercised his duty when ascertaining whether any injustice

was caused to a party or whether any miscarriage of justice has occurred by the Order

of the learned Magistrate. By invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of a Court, the

aggrieved party can challenge the legality of an order but not the correctness of an

order.

Therefore, the learned High Court Judge was correct in refusing to intervene with the

order dated 20.06.2017 of the learned Magistrate/ Primary Court Judge.

In view of the aforesaid judicial pronouncements, it clearly manifests that existence of

exceptional circumstances is a pre-condition for the exercise of revisionary powers.

It is seen in the averments of the Petition of Appeal that the Appellant had purchased

the subject matter of the instant action by deed of transfer bearing no 3998 on

26.02.2014 from the 5th Respondent in this Appeal.

Apparently, the 1st Respondent namely Anura Samarajeewa and the 5th Respondent

namely Sriyanie Manel Dharmadasa are husband and wife.

According to the Police complaint made by the said 5th Respondent wife alleging that

the 1st Respondent had beaten her, and the Police had filed case bearing No B527/14

on 11.03.2014. Consequently, the 1st Respondent was remanded until 14.03.2014 and

he was bailed out on 14.03.2014.

11 [1981] 1 SLR 262

Page 11 of 13

The 5th Respondent had made an application bearing No. 62446/14 to the Magistrates

Court of Kurunegala against the 1st Respondent in terms of the provisions of Domestic

Violence Act No 34 of 2005. The learned Magistrate had issued an interim protection

order in the said case, restraining 1st Respondent from entering the house of the 5th

Respondent by order dated 12.02.2014.

It was informed by the fiscal that the said notice of the protection order could not be

served on the 1st Respondent, later it was found that he was in remand custody

consequent to an order made in case bearing no B 527/14.

Pursuant to the above, Appellant has contended that since the restraining order was

issued on the 1st Respondent, he did not have possession in respect of the disputed

property. However, as the disputed premises is 1st Respondents matrimonial home, he

has constructive possession of the said premises.

It appears that the Officer in Charge of the Police station at Kurunegala had filed an

information on 31.03.2014, under Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act No.

44 of 1979, based on the Complaint made to the Police by the 1st Respondent.

However, having concluded the inquiry the learned Magistrate who was acting as the

Primary Court Judge held in terms of Section 68 (3) of the Primary Court Act, granting

possession of the disputed premises to the 1st Respondent.

In terms of Section 68 (3) of the said Act, it is to be noted that the Court has to look into

whether any person who had been in possession of the disputed land or any part has

been forcibly dispossessed within a period of two months immediately before the date

on which the information was filed under Section 66 of the Act.

It is to be observed that the Appellant purchased the disputed property on 26.02.2014

and had taken possession of the disputed property on the same day. It is relevant to note

that on the date on which the aforesaid deed was executed, the 1st Respondent was in

remand custody.

In light of the facts and circumstances of the instant case, it is relevant to note that the

proper remedy available to the aggrieved party is to adjudicate their legal rights by

exercising the competent civil jurisdiction of the relevant court.

It was also revealed in evidence that the 1st Respondent had instituted an action bearing

no 8050/L against his wife the 5th Respondent seeking a declaration that the Defendant

Page 12 of 13

wife is holding the property in dispute as a trust in favour of the Plaintiff husband, the

1st Respondent.

Furthermore, on the day an enjoining order was issued in the said case, the Defendant

wife the 5th Respondent had transferred the property in dispute to the Appellant in this

is appeal by deed of transfer bearing no 3998 dated 26.02.2014.

Thereafter, the 1st Respondent had instituted another action bearing case no 8536/SPL

in the District Court of Kurunegala praying for a declaration to declare the Deed of

transfer bearing no 3998 dated 26.02.2014 be declared null and void.

In the case of Devi Property Development [Pvt] Limited vs Lanka Medical [Pvt] Ltd12

Nanayakkara J. held: revision is an extra ordinary jurisdiction vested in court to be

exercised under exceptional circumstances if no other remedies are available.

(Emphasis is mine).

In this situation, therefore, the appropriate remedy for the Appellant is to invoke the

civil jurisdiction of the District Court to adjudicate their legal rights of ownership to

the disputed premises instead of preferring an appeal to this court.

The learned High Court Judge has observed that the learned Magistrate has analyzed

and evaluated the evidence placed before him and has come to correct findings of fact

and law. It was rightfully concluded that the 1st Respondent had been in possession of

the disputed premises and that the 1st Respondent was dispossessed from the same and

therefore, declared that the 1st Respondent was within a period of two months

immediately before the date of filing of the information. Thus, he is entitled to the

possession of the said premises under Section 68(3) of the Act and has ordered the 2nd

Party Respondent T.D.H. Sriyani Manel Dharmadasa and Wijesinghe Arachchige Rasika

Gangadara, to restore the 1st Respondent in possession of the disputed premises.

The learned High Court Judge has affirmed the Magistrate courts decision and held

that there is no miscarriage of justice, or any injustice caused to the Appellant by the

said order made by the learned Magistrate. Thus, it clearly manifests that no

exceptional circumstances exist for the Appellant to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction

of the High Court of Kurunegala.

12 C.A. No. 513/2001, CAM 20/06/2001

Page 13 of 13

As such, in view of the aforementioned reasons we see no reason to interfere with the

order of the learned High Court Judge dated 29.06.2015 and the order of the learned

Magistrate dated 18.07.2014.

Hence this appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs 35,000.
