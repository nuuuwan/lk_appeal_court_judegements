Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioners referring to the Auditor Generals Report of which the page Nos. 23 & 24

are marked as P2(a), assert that the 1st Respondent-Bank of Ceylon (Bank) has made a

contentious payment aggregating to Rs.32,039,733.00 to the former General Manager of

the Bank who is the 23rd Respondent as premature retirement benefits during the year

2020. The Petitioners impugn the decision of the Board of Directors (Board) of the Bank

dated 04.03.2020 to pay such an amount of money to the 23rd Respondent. The Petitioners

plead that the impugned decision reflected in P2(a) is illegal, unlawful, arbitrary & ultra

vires and the 2nd, 4th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, 25th Respondents are jointly or severely liable to pay

and indemnify sum of Rs.32,039,733.00 being the loss caused to the Bank by the said

impugned decision.

The Petitioners further plead that the 2nd, 4th, 21st, 22nd and 25th Respondents are no longer

fit and proper persons to be Directors of any Commercial Bank including the 1st

Respondent Bank.

The Respondents raising several objections move that the Application of the Petitioners

be dismissed in limine. What needs consideration at this stage is whether the facts and

circumstances of this case warrants this Court to issue formal notice on the Respondents.

Further, the Court will have the task of weighing the requirement of granting a public law

remedy in this Application against the objections of the Respondents on the

maintainability of this Application.

The main objection of the 1st to 10th Respondents is that the matters referred to this Court

are arising out of a contract and such assertions of the Respondents are based on the fact

that the payment of retirement benefits to the 23rd Respondent is purely a matter within

private law which pertains to matters arising from a contract of employment. The

approach taken by this Court in several previous cases is that this Court has the

discretionary power to exercise its writ jurisdiction even on a question arising out of a

contract of employment, if the respective order is in breach of statutory

restrictions/provisions and also if such public body has taken a decision assuming a

jurisdiction which he does not have or exceeding his jurisdiction by violating a statutory

requirement which eventually comes under any of the established grounds of judicial

review. Similarly, I am mindful that judicial review is available when the alternative

remedy is not adequate and efficacious.

The 21st, 22nd, 24th and 25th Respondents assert that the Petitioner is guilty of suppression

and misinterpretation of material facts and lacks uberrima fidei essential to invoke

prerogative writs. Another primary objection of those Respondents is that the Petitioners

have not acted in good faith and not come to Court with clean hands. The 23rd Respondent

also raises objections on (i) laches, (ii) not having necessary parties before Court, (iii)

suppression & misrepresentation and (iv) clean hands.

The vital questions in the instant Application are whether the Board of the Bank is

empowered to decide on premature retirement benefits in favour of the 23rd Respondent

and whether the Cabinet of Ministers has taken a decision to retire the 23rd Respondent

prematurely. Another reasonable question arising out of the pleadings is whether an

employee who retires prematurely will be entitled to any entertainment allowances,

payment of any bonus, component of contribution made to Pension Trust Fund etc.

The Respondents have, inter alia, cited the Cabinet Memorandum, marked 1R3, as the

source of authority for the Board to have taken the decision of granting premature benefits

to the 23rd Respondent. The contention of the Petitioner is that the Board could not decide

on premature retirement benefits based on such Cabinet Memorandum. Hence, there is a

necessity to carefully examine the said 1R3. The contents of the Auditor Generals letter

dated 03.08.2022 addressed to the Attorney General (annexed to the motion dated

14.10.2022) needs to be properly evaluated. Particularly, the Court draws the attention to

the following paragraph of the said letter;

, 23

P2(e) 2019

156(6)

.

Page 9 of 9

The Section 7 of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance deals with the capital of the Bank and

Section 651 provides that the provisions of the Part II of the Finance Act No. 38 of 1971

shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to the financial control and accounts of the Bank of Ceylon.

In light of the above, it is necessary for this Court to draw attention to the component of

the shareholding of the State and also the financial obligations of the Bank under statutory

provisions for the purpose of fuller and proper adjudication of the instant Application.

Thus, I take the view that the facts revolving around the said objections should be clearly

made available to this Court by way of complete sets of affidavits and not by limited

Statement of Objections in order to examine the Respondents said objections.

On an overall conspectus of the submissions made by all parties and based on the

complexity of issues that require the resolution of this Court at a merits stage, I take the

view that this Court should fully consider the facts and circumstances of this case on

affidavits at a final hearing. Further, this Court takes the view that the preliminary issues

of rejection have to be looked into only at the merit stage in view of the circumstances of

this case. In that event, the Court will be able to consider whether there would be any

merits on the objections raised by the Respondents, after considering all the facts and

circumstances together with the complete submissions of the learned Counsel.

Hence, we decide to issue formal notice of this Application on the Respondents.
