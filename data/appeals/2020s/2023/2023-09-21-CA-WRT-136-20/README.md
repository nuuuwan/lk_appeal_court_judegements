Briefly, the facts relating to the application are as follows:

The petitioner in this application has been serving in the Sri Lanka

Foreign Service at the time of retirement. He was serving in various

capacities in foreign service. The petitioner was posted in Tehran, Iran

as Minister, Embassy of Sri Lanka in Iran with effect from 01.12.2009.

Also, he has been awarded the diplomatic rank of Minister with effect

from the said date. As per the letter marked P4-e, while the petitioner

was serving at the Embassy of Sri Lanka, Iran, he was promoted to

Grade-I in the foreign service with effect from 17.05.2013.

Subsequently, as per the letter marked P6-a, the petitioners promotion

to Grade-I was amended and backdated to take effect from 28.03.2012.

Furthermore, the petitioner stated that he was given the Head of

Mission status by the letter P4-f. The petitioner has been appointed as

the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Islamic Republic of Iran with effect

from 15.07.2015 by the said letter P4-f. As per the letter marked P5-b,

the petitioner has been informed that his ambassador rank has been

approved with effect from 01.03.2014 and he is entitled to draw the

Overseas Service Allowance and other allowances applicable to the rank

of ambassador.

The grievance of the petitioner is that although he was promoted to

Grade-I in the Foreign Service with effect from 28.03.2012 (as per letter

P6-a), he gets his allowances from 01.03.2014 because the said letter

P5-b states that his ambassador rank has been approved with effect

from 01.03.2014.

In 2017.09.27, the petitioner has requested from the Secretary of the

Public Service Commission (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

PSC), through Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by the letter

marked P8-b, to approve the payment of overseas allowances applicable

to the rank of ambassador for the period from 28.03.2012 to

01.03.2014. The Public Service Commission, informed the Ministry of

Foreign Affairs by the letter marked P8-C to take appropriate action

Page 5 of 12

with regard to the petitioners appeal. However, the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs has rejected the petitioners request.

Again, the petitioner has forwarded his grievance to the Public Service

Commission but was unsuccessful. The petitioners appeal was rejected

by the Public Service Commission by its decision dated 13.09.2018,

marked P-12, mainly on the ground that the allowances could be paid

only from the date that he was appointed to the rank of ambassador.

Aggrieved by the said decision of the PSC, the petitioner made an appeal

to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the AAT). However, the said appeal has also been dismissed by

the Administrative Appeals Tribunal order dated 10.02.2020 marked P-

19. On the said circumstances, the petitioner has come to this court

seeking the aforesaid reliefs.

At the hearing of the application, the learned Presidents Counsel for

the petitioner contended that the decision of the PSC is unreasonable,

irrational, and ultra vires because the petitioner is entitled to the

overseas allowances of the diplomatic rank ambassador with effect from

28.03.2012, the date that he was promoted to Grade-I. Substantiating

the said argument, the learned Presidents Counsel submitted in detail

how the petitioner became entitled to the said overseas allowances.

Further the learned Presidents Counsel contended that the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal also failed to consider the defects and

non-considerations shown in the appeal and as a result the appeal was

dismissed wrongfully. The learned Presidents Counsel submitted

further that the petitioner was entitled for the Overseas Service

Allowances applicable to the rank of Ambassador from 28.03.2012 but

the entire problem arose because the letter P5-b mentioned the

arbitrary date of 01.03.2014.

Before dealing with the main issue pertaining to the application, I wish

to deal with the jurisdictional objection taken by the learned Additional

Page 6 of 12

Solicitor General that this Court has no jurisdiction to quash the

decision of the Public Service Commission marked P-12 according to

Article 61A of the Constitution. Both parties were allowed to file further

written submissions after hearing especially to address the above issue.

It has been held in all decided cases tendered on behalf of both parties

that the writ jurisdiction of this court does not lie to review a decision

made by the Public Service Commission, but an order of Administrative

Appeals Tribunal can be challenged by way of a writ application.

Article 61A of the Constitution reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions of Article 59 and of Article 126, no court or

tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce

upon or in any manner call in question any order or decision made by the

Commission, a Committee, or any public officer, in pursuance of any

power or duty conferred or imposed on such Commission, or delegated to

a Committee or public officer, under this Chapter or under any other law.

Chapter IX of the Constitution deals with the Public Service.

Therefore, the Commission mentioned in Article 61A, which comes

under the said chapter refers to the Public Service Commission.

Hence, it is apparent from Article 61A of the Constitution that this

Court has no jurisdiction to review a decision made by the Public

Service Commission by way of an application for writ.

The following judicial authorities clearly demonstrate that a writ does

not lie against a decision of the Public Service Commission. In the case

of Ratnasiri and Others V Ellawala and Others- (2004) 2 Sri LR

180, the effect of Article 61A of the Constitution has been discussed in

the following way:

Article 61A of the Constitution, which was introduced by the

Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution certified by the Speaker

on 3rd October, 2001, seeks to oust the jurisdiction of courts to review

Page 7 of 12

determinations of the Public Service Commission, a committee thereof

or any public officer, in the following terms: -

Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Article

126, no court or tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire

into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call in question any order or

decision made by the Commission, a committee, or any public officer,

in pursuance of any power or duty conferred or imposed on such

Commission, or delegated to a Committee or public officer, under this

Chapter or any other law. It was held in the said case that Article 61 A

seeks to oust the jurisdiction of courts to review determination of the

P.S.C. except where there has been a violation or imminent violation of

a fundamental right.

Also, in K.V. Gamini Dayarathna v. P.B. Wickremarathna, Senior

D.I.G (Administration) and Five Others - CA (Writ) Application No:

347/2018 decided on 30th April 2021, it was held that while any

public officer aggrieved by a decision of the Public Service Commission

or a committee or public officer to whom the powers of the Public

Service Commission have been delegated, could challenge such

decision, either by way of a fundamental rights application in terms of

Article 126 of the Constitution, or by preferring an appeal to the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal in terms of Article 59, Article 61A has

shut out the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to review decisions

of the Public Service Commission.

However, no article of the constitution shut out the writ jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal to review decisions of the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal. It was held in Wickramasinghe Arachchilage Waruna

Sameera, v. Justice N.E. Dissanayake, Chairman, Administrative

Appeals Tribunal, and 50 others - Case No: CA/WRIT/73/2016

decided on 20.02.2019 that Article 61A of the Constitution provides

immunity from legal proceedings of the decisions of the Public Service

Commission and not those of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As

Page 8 of 12

held by the Supreme Court in Ratnayake v. Administrative Appeals

Tribunal [2013] 1 Sri LR 331, Article 61A of the Constitution has no

application to the decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and

there is no corresponding provision in the Constitution which ousts the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal conferred by Article 140 of the

Constitution in regard to the decisions of the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal.

Therefore, it is evident from the aforesaid judicial authority that an

order of Administrative Appeals Tribunal can be challenged by way of a

writ application although decision of the PSC could not be challenged.

Hence, apart from the prayer (c) to the petition, this application can be

maintained for the other reliefs prayed for in the petition.

It was contended by the learned Presidents Counsel that although by

the letter P-16, Public Service Commission was informed by the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs to pay the due allowances from 28.03.2012

to 01.03.2014, the PSC disregarded the said recommendation and

decided that the petitioner is not entitled for further allowances. The

learned Presidents Counsel also contended that even the AAT has not

taken into consideration the said recommendation made in letter P-16.

In the said letter marked P-16, it is mentioned that the petitioner

became entitled to the overseas service allowance from the date he was

promoted to Grade-I, i.e., 2012.03.28, but during the period from

2012.03.28 to 2014.03.01, the petitioner was paid the allowances

entitled to a Grade-II Officer, and thus this should be rectified.

The reply of the learned Additional Solicitor General was that the AAT

has considered the said recommendation but accepted the letter dated

07.07.2018 (P11-a) written by the Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs

to the Public Service Commission recommending that the Overseas

Service Allowance could not be paid to the petitioner. It is correct that

the AAT has relied upon P11-a and dismissed the petitioners appeal.

Page 9 of 12

The learned Additional Solicitor General contended that the petitioner

is not entitled to the allowance for the period from 28.03.2012 to

01.03.2014 because at that time, the petitioner was not the Head of

Mission, but as stated in the order of the AAT, the petitioner was serving

as Deputy Head of Mission in Iran. Even according to paragraph 5(h) of

the petition, the petitioner was placed as the Deputy Head of Mission at

the Embassy in Iran. He was appointed as the Ambassador of Sri Lanka

to Iran in 2015.07.15.

The learned Presidents Counsel contended that AAT has not stated any

reason in its order why the recommendation contained in P-16 was

rejected and his contention was that there was no reason to reject the

same. In the order of the AAT, the grievance of the petitioner has been

correctly identified as having a legitimate expectation that he would be

awarded the diplomatic rank of Ambassador from the date of his

promotion to Grade 1 of the Sri Lanka foreign service. What is stated

in paragraph 10 of the petition filed by the petitioner is also the same.

However, it is apparent from the comparison schedule set out in the

statement of objections of the 5th respondent with regard to the

determination of diplomatic ranks and payment of allowances in 1994,

2001, and 2016, that on some occasions, Ambassador rank was given

even to officers of Grade II. On the other hand, there were instances

where officers were promoted to Grade I, but Ambassador rank was not

given. The contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General

appeared for the 4th and 5th respondents was that Ambassador rank

was never automatically conferred upon promotion to Grade 1.

Therefore, there is no basis to substantiate the petitioners claim on

legitimate expectation.

In the letter P-16, it is stated that although the petitioner served as a

Grade 1 officer from 28.03.2012 to 01.03.2014, he was paid allowances

entitled to a Grade II officer during that period, and this should be

Page 10 of 12

rectified. The issue here is whether the petitioner is entitled to the

allowances applicable to the rank of Ambassador from the date that he

obtained Grade I promotion. The observation in paragraph 10 of

P11-a, the letter of recommendation written by the Secretary, Ministry

of Foreign Affairs, is that there is no procedure to award the rank of

Ambassador or to pay overseas service allowance just because he is

promoted to Grade I of the foreign service. In the petition or even at the

hearing of the application, no such procedure or a clause in a Gazette

notification was shown to demonstrate that the petitioner becomes

entitled to the overseas service allowance with his promotion to

Grade I. In Schedule A of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1996/28

dated 2016.12.06, it is mentioned that On promotion to Grade I, the

Officer in Grade I, holding the ranks of Deputy Chief of Mission, Deputy

High Commissioner, Consul General, or Minister shall be given the rank

of Ambassador. However, in the instant application, the petitioner

seeks to backdate the rank of Ambassador from 28.03.2012 and to pay

the allowances entitled to the rank of Ambassador from 28.03.2012 to

01.03.2014. For the said period, the relevant gazette notification is

Gazette Extraordinary No. 1168/17 dated 2001.01.24 marked P3-b. In

clause 8.3 of the said gazette marked P3-b, as pointed out by the

learned Additional Solicitor General, it is mentioned that On the

recommendation of the Head of Mission, an officer of the SLFS may be

granted the next higher rank by the secretary. The only additional

monetary benefit that such an officer will be entitled to is the

Representational Allowance applicable to the higher post in lieu of the

allowance applicable to the officers substantive rank. In this gazette

notification, nowhere, it is stated that an officer in Grade I shall be

awarded the rank of Ambassador. Even the learned Presidents Counsel

for the petitioner did not show in the gazette marked P3-b, a clause

where the rank of Ambassador is automatically conferred with the

Grade I promotion. Therefore, there is no basis to pay the allowances

applicable to the rank of Ambassador from 28.03.2012 acting on the

recommendations contained in P-16.

Page 11 of 12

In the case at hand, when the letter P4-e was received by the petitioner

stating that he had been promoted to Grade I with effect from

17.05.2015, he requested by letter dated 04.11.2013 marked P5-a, that

he be awarded the rank of Ambassador with effect from 17 May 2013.

After considering his request, the Ambassador rank was approved with

effect from 01.03.2014 by the letter P5-b but not with effect from

17.05.2013. In the same letter, it was mentioned that the petitioner is

entitled to the overseas service allowance and other allowances

applicable to the rank of Ambassador. Although the petitioners

complaint was that the date 01.03.2014 has been fixed arbitrarily, I

regret that I am unable to agree with that argument because the

decision to award the rank of Ambassador is made by the relevant

authority, and the relevant authority is not bound to inform the

petitioner of the basis for fixing the effective date. Furthermore, the

relevant authority is not legally or statutorily obligated to award the

rank of Ambassador from the date of promoting the officer to Grade I.

The petitioner is entitled for the above allowances when the Rank of

Ambassador is awarded and there was no dispute that he was paid the

said allowances from 01.03.2014. What is stated in the PSC decision

P-12 is that although his Grade I promotion was backdated to

28.03.2012, the date of awarding the rank of Ambassador was not back

dated and thus the petitioner is not entitled to the aforesaid allowances

from the date that he was promoted to Grade I.

When the petitioner was awarded the rank of Ambassador with effect

from 01.03.2014, he accepted the same and continued his service.

Although the petitioner stated in his petition that he had legitimate

expectations, that he would be awarded the diplomatic rank of

Ambassador, with his promotion to Grade 1, due allowances for the

rank of Ambassador could only be paid to him when he becomes

entitled to the said allowances.

Page 12 of 12

As the petitioner is not entitled to the allowances applicable to the rank

of Ambassador until he is awarded the rank of Ambassador for the

reasons stated above, the AAT is correct in not relying on the

recommendations made in P-16, although the reason for not relying on

P-16 is not specifically stated in the order of the AAT.

For the reasons stated above, I hold that the order of the AAT to dismiss

the appeal against the decision of the PSC relying on the

recommendations made in the letter dated 07.07.2018 marked P11-a,

written by the Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs is correct.

Since the application for writ of certiorari prayed for by the petitioner to

quash the order of the AAT could not be issued in this application before

us, there is no need to consider the ultimate effect of quashing the order

of the AAT without quashing the decision of the PSC. Furthermore,

since the order of the AAT should stand as it is, not only the writ of

certiorari against the order of the AAT but also the other writs sought

in the prayers (d), (e), (f), and (g) of the petition cannot be granted.

For the foregoing reasons, the application for writs prayed for in the

petition is dismissed.

Application dismissed.
