Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted before the High

Court of Colombo for the possession and trafficking of 4.30g of Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) under

Section 54A(d) and 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, as amended by

Act No. 13 of 1984.

The prosecution led evidence from eleven witnesses and marked its productions from P1 to P9.

After the conclusion of the Prosecutions case, two witnesses led evidence on behalf of the defence

including the Accused himself. The High Court Judge found the Accused guilty on both counts,

convicted, and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment and the sentence this appeal was preferred by the Accused.

The following are the grounds of appeal led by the Learned Counsel for the Accused

1. Conviction is wholly unsafe given the uncorroborated and unsatisfactory nature of the evidence

of the main police witness PW1, led by the prosecution.

2. Whether the Learned Trial Judge failed to consider the rules governing the test of probability

to the prosecution version.

3. Whether the prosecution failed to establish the chain as to the passage of production from the

custody of the accused to the Government Analyst.

Page 3 of 8

4. Whether the learned trial judge has considered only the prosecution evidence and failed

seriously to evaluate the evidence given by the defence.

The facts of the case are briefly summarised as follows;

According to PW1, I.P. Devadasan, on the 7th of September 2012, he led a team of

police officers and departed from the police station at 7:30 a.m. Their itinerary included visits

to areas such as High-Level Rd., Kirulapone Mw., Borella, and Polhengoda as part of their

regular routine. At Polhengoda, at approximately 2:40 p.m., they encountered Corporal

Kumarasiri (PW15), an Army Officer, and Wijesinghe from the Army intelligence unit, who

provided information regarding Sanath (the Accused), who was allegedly involved in the

transportation of heroin from the address No. 44 Kithulwatta Borella to Kirulapone.

Upon receiving this information, PW1 requested a Jeep from the officer in charge of the

Kirulupone police station. They waited for approximately two hours before commencing their

journey to the specified residence. Upon arrival at the destination, PW1 observed the Accused

leaving his residence. Upon recognizing PW1, the Accused promptly returned to his premises.

PW1 then pursued the Accused into his house, as he was aware that the Accused resided in

Kirulapone and had prior acquaintance with both the Accused and his wife (DW1), who was

employed at the police station, prior to this raid.

The Accused was then subjected to a search by PW01, with the assistance of PW2 and PW5.

During the search, PW01 discovered that the Accused was holding a pink tulip bag. Upon examining

the bag, they uncovered 29 pink shopping bags, each containing 40 packets of a "brown substance"

individually wrapped in paper, amounting to a total of 1160 pieces. Based on his expertise, PW01

recognized this substance as heroin (diacetylmorphine).

Having made this discovery, PW01 took possession of the evidence and placed the Accused

under arrest. Subsequently, the Army officers left the scene. Following the arrest, they proceeded to a

pawn shop to weigh the material, which amounted to 5 grams and 180 milligrams. At the shop, they

Page 4 of 8

dispatched the vehicle. After weighing the substance, they traveled on foot to the police station, where

they handed it over under PR. 193/2012 to the reserve officer (PW8), P.C. 33012 Dharmarathne.

During cross-examination by the defense, PW1 stated that they had left the police station at 7:30

a.m. and received the information at 2:40 p.m. from the intelligence officers. Subsequently, he informed

the Officer in charge about this. PW1 noted that they were already acquainted with the army officers

before this incident, as they had previously participated in raids. He further explained that, although he

was unaware of the Accused's involvement in heroin trafficking, he had prior knowledge of the

Accused.

PW1 also mentioned that the Accused's wife, DW1, worked at the police station, and he had seen

her at the Accused's residence during the arrest. When questioned by the defense about whether DW1

was arrested by PW1, he clarified that while he was aware that she had been taken into custody, he did

not carry out the arrest. They arrived at the scene at 4:35 p.m.

.

He further explained that since they had arrested the Accused with heroin in his possession,

there was no need to search his premises. Out of the 29 packets, PW1 opened a few and inspected them

while they were placed on the bonnet of the jeep in front of the Accused and other officers. PW01

mentioned that they spent 15 to 20 minutes near the house and then arrived at the pawn shop at 5:20

p.m., where PW2, PW4, PW5, and PW6 assisted him in opening and weighing the 1160 packets, which

took them 1 hours. Thereafter, they reached the police station at 7:15 p.m.

PW1 affirms that while the Accused was not involved in DW1's arrest, the Accused's wife

(DW1) was arrested prior to the Accused's arrest. He acknowledged that he had not recorded pertinent

details of this incident in the pocket notebook as he failed to carry it on the said date.

PW2, P.C. 35454 Dayawansa, corroborated PW1's account, noting that they left the police station

at 7:30 a.m. on 07.09.2012 with the team led by PW1. Subsequently, they encountered two Army

officers who informed the police officers about the Accused, his address, and his name. Upon PW1's

request, they obtained a jeep from the officer in charge and traveled to the specified address. Upon

arrival, PW1 disembarked from the jeep and apprehended the Accused as he attempted to re-enter his

house.

Page 5 of 8

During cross-examination, it was stated that they received the information at 2:40 p.m. from the

Army Officers in the intelligence unit, whom they had encountered near the Polhengoda Junction. PW1

briefed the team of officers about this matter based on the information received. They left at 4:15 p.m.,

and 25 minutes later, PW1 arrested the Accused as he exited his house.

According to PW15, Army intelligence officer Kumarasiri, accompanied by his fellow army

officer Wijesinghe, informed PW1 after meeting him on 07.09.2012 at approximately around 11:00 to

11:30 a.m. that the Accused was in possession of heroin and was en route from Kithulwatta to

Kirulapone.

The Accused, under oath, recounted that on the day in question, he was arrested by 7 to 8 police

officers after returning from court. They tied his hands with a towel and placed him in a jeep where

seven other individuals were already present. They detained him for 1 hours. Furthermore, he

mentioned that PW5 slapped his father when he inquired about the arrest.

While in the police jail cell, he saw his wife at the Police station but did not speak to her. DW1

was remanded, and he later learned that his wife was informed that the Accused was apprehended for

drug possession and that he could secure his release by confessing. When he inquired about his arrest,

he was asked to place his fingerprints on a parcel.

During cross-examination, he stated that when he was arrested inside the house, he was not

informed of the reason for his arrest. The Accused further described that they tied his hands with a

towel, confiscated his two phones and money, and placed him in the Police jeep. He was subsequently

informed that heroin had been recovered from him.

At the police station, he encountered his wife. It was only after appearing in court that he learned

he was arrested on allegations related to heroin. He denied the allegations of possession and smuggling

of heroin in court. He also mentioned that he was in police custody for seven days.

DW1 Renuka, the Accuseds wife, testified that on 07.09.2012, she was arrested by PW1, who

was accompanied by Army and Police officers. They visited her house in Kirulapone, inspected the

premises, and inquired about her husband's whereabouts. She informed them that he was at court, and

she was initially taken to the Police station and later to the Kithulwatta address to locate him.

Upon their return to the police station, she was subsequently presented before the court and

informed that she was remanded due to the discovery of an unknown I.D. card at her residence in

Kirulapona, which had been brought by her mother. She was encouraged to accept this case in exchange

for her release. After her return from court, she learned that she was arrested for possession of heroin.

In her cross-examination, DW01 mentioned that she was arrested between 9:30 and 10:30 a.m.

after her house was investigated and later taken to the police station by PW1. They then took her to the

specified address at around 1:30 to 2:00 p.m. and asked her to identify the Accuseds house. She was

subsequently transported back to the police station by jeep. She further stated that she was asked to

accept the case related to an unknown identity card and was fined Rs. 3500.

The primary issue for consideration in this appeal is whether PW1's witness testimony is

improbable. If so, the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the test of probability regarding the

prosecutions version.

Probability, in the context of legal matters, is defined as follows:

According to Murrays English Dictionary, probability means "the appearance of truth or

likelihood of being realized, which any statement or event bears in the light of present evidence."

Sarkar and Monohara, in their book "SARKAR ON EVIDENCE" (Fifteenth Edition) on page 71,

state, "...probability is meant the likelihood of anything being true, deduced from its conformity to our

knowledge, observation, and experience. When a supposed fact is so repugnant to the laws of nature

that no amount of evidence could induce us to believe it, such supposed fact is said to be impossible or

physically impossible."

According to E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, in "The Law of Evidence Volume II Book 02" on Page

1053, "The test of improbability has been described as essential inconsistency. There may be facts

which may show it to be impossible or so highly improbable as to justify the inference that it never

occurred."

In Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai vs State of Gujarat 1983 AIR HC 753; A.P. Sen

and M.P. Thakkar J observed that,

Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and shake the basic version

of the witnesses therefore cannot be annexed with undue importance. More so when the

all-important probabilities-factor echoes in favour of the version narrated by the

witnesses.

In Wickremasuriya v Dedoleena and Others [1996] 2 S.L.R. 95, on page 98, His Lordship

Jayasuriya J. observed that;

A Judge, in applying the test of Probability and Improbability, relies heavily on his knowledge

of men and matters and the patterns of conduct observed by human beings both ingenious as well as

those who are less talented and fortunate."

Page 7 of 8

Based on the provided facts and the principles of probability, we can assess the following points:

a) The delay in informing the police: It is reasonable to question why PW15 did not

immediately inform the police when he received information about the Accused's

possession of heroin and plans to transport it. The delay in informing the police raises

questions about the urgency of the situation and whether there was a legitimate reason for

the delay.

b) Discrepancy in timing: There is a significant discrepancy in the timing of events as

recounted by various witnesses. PW15 stated that they met the police officers around 11:00

to 11:30 a.m., while PW1 and PW2 mentioned meeting the Army officers at around 2:00

to 2:40 p.m. The Accused claimed to have been arrested at approximately 12:30 to 1:00

p.m. This inconsistency in timing should have been carefully considered by the court.

c) Delay in action: The fact that PW15 and the police officers waited for 2 hours after

receiving information before traveling to the specified location raises questions about the

urgency of the situation. In a typical scenario, swift action would be expected upon

receiving information about a crime in progress.

d) Departure of Army officers: The departure of the Army officers without recording their

statements as vital witnesses is a significant concern. Their presence at the time of the arrest

and their potential knowledge of the events should have been documented. Additionally,

the absence of pocketbooks raises questions about proper documentation and record-

keeping by the police officers.

e) Carrying drugs in hand: It is improbable that a drug dealer would openly carry drugs in

their hands during the daytime, as it would expose them to a high risk of being apprehended.

This raises doubts about the manner in which the Accused was allegedly caught with drugs.

f) Contradictory accounts: The conflicting accounts regarding the location of the Accused's

arrest, whether inside his house or outside, raise concerns about the accuracy of the

testimonies provided by both the prosecution and the Accused.

Page 8 of 8

Upon applying the Test of Probability and Test of Improbability to the aforementioned facts, it

becomes evident that the evidence presented through the Prosecution's narratives cannot be deemed

credible.

It is worth noting that DW1, the Accuseds wife, testified that she was arrested between 9:00 to

10:00 a.m. and subsequently taken to the Accuseds house, after which she was returned to the police

station. Considering the evidence presented by the prosecution, it becomes apparent that PW1's

testimony lacks veracity. In light of these circumstances, we find that the defense's narrative appears

more plausible than that of the prosecution. Therefore, on these grounds and for the reasons detailed

above, we overturn the conviction and sentence.

This appeal is allowed.
