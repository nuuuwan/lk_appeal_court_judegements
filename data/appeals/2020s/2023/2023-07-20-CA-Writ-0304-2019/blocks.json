Section 59 provides that a Court may order rectification of the register where it is satisfied that any registration has been obtained by fraud. Once such an order is made, the Registrar of Title has to rectify the register and the other records maintained under the RT Act5. Thus, it is clear that the RT Act has allowed Court intervention even after the registration of the title. It is important to observe that although in Sections 21, 22, and also in Section 29, the Court having jurisdiction is specified as the District Court having jurisdiction over the area in which such a land is situated, in Section 59, the Legislature has not specified the Court. Therefore, at first glance, it appears that a party seeking a remedy under section 59 is free to bring an action in the District Court or invoke writ jurisdiction of this Court. Yet, a committed fraud must be established for a Court to order rectification of the register under Section 59. In a writ application, this Court will not decide on disputed facts as such6. Therefore, in my view, the remedy under Section 59 is quite independent of an application for a prerogative writ.",

Further, Section 22 of the Act provides that any claimant aggrieved by the declaration made by the Commissioner should prefer an appeal to the District Court within the prescribed period. However, no such period is prescribed either in the Act or in the Regulations. It is common knowledge that even a person seeking a declaration that a fraudulent deed is void has to institute an action within three years from the date on which the fraud was revealed. To my understanding, it is undesirable that a time period is not prescribed under Section 59. Yet, the fact remains that no time limit is prescribed for the institution of proceedings in Courts seeking rectifications of the register.

Peoples Bank and others33, the issue before the Supreme Court was whether Article 140 is subject to the other laws which were kept alive by Article 168 (1). Article 140, unlike Article 146, has a phrase that the powers and authority of the Court of Appeal are subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the phrase subject to the provisions of the Constitution is necessarily there to avoid conflicts between Article 140 and other Constitutional provisions such as Articles 80 (3), 120, 124, 125, and 126 (3). Consequently, it was held that the aforementioned phrase refers only to contrary provisions in the Constitution itself, and does not extend to provisions of other written laws. The Supreme Court observed that the language used in Article 140 of the Constitution is broad enough to confer unfettered jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal to review, even on grounds excluded by the ouster clauses.",

Iman, Chairman, Administrative Appeals Tribunal and others38, Samayawardhena J., sitting in Court of Appeal (as His Lordship then was) having considered Section 8 (2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act No. 4 of 2002 which reads a decision made by the tribunal shall be final and conclusive and shall not be called in question in any suit or proceedings in a Court of law; the Court observed that This is a statutory ouster clause, and not a constitutional ouster clause. Ouster clauses contained in statutes, as a general rule, do not oust the writ jurisdiction conferred on Courts - in Sri Lanka, on the Court of Appeal by Article 140 of the Constitution. There is a presumption in favour of judicial review and courts have throughout history shown their great reluctance to accept ouster clauses at face value. The tendency of Courts has been to give ouster clauses a restrictive interpretation as much as possible so as to preserve their jurisdiction to review administrative decisions. The leading English case of Anisminic Ltd v. Foreign Compensation Commission (1969) AC 147 provides a striking illustration of this tendency. It is generally understood that the ouster/preclusive/finality clauses are there to prevent appeals and not to prevent judicial review. Those clauses do not and cannot prohibit the Court of Appeal from exercising its writ jurisdiction to look into the jurisdictional issues of the decisions of the administrative bodies or tribunals39 ()",

That provision is a bar to any appeal. But the courts refuse to allow it to hamper the operation of judicial review. As will be seen in this and the following sections, there is a firm judicial policy against allowing the rule of law to be undermined by weakening the powers of the court. Statutory restrictions on judicial remedies are given the narrowest possible construction, sometimes even against the plain meaning of the words. This is a sound policy since otherwise administrative authorities and tribunals would be given uncontrollable power and could violate the law at will.

At the argument, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that an ordinary person cannot be expected to read all the Gazette notifications published by the government and also to identify lands with reference to a cadastral plan. I am in favour of the above submission. I observe that in the Gazette notification published under Section 12 of the RT Act, the land is described according to the cadastral plan. The only information an ordinary person could understand is, that it is regarding the lands situated within the village of Bandiripppuwa.",

Accordingly, the Minister of Lands has made Regulations published in the Extra Ordinary Gazette Notification No. 1050/10 dated 21st October 1998 (P 19). These regulations were subject to the amendments made to them by Extra Ordinary Gazette Notifications No. 1886/58 dated 31st October 2014 and No. 2308/27 dated 1st December 2022. In terms of Regulation No. 4 published in the Gazette notification P 19, the Commissioner shall also cause to publish a notice in Form No. 2 of the first schedule in Sinhala, Tamil, and English daily newspapers circulated in Sri Lanka, making reference to the number and date of the Gazette notification published under Section 12 of the Act. In addition, the Commissioner of Title Settlement, as soon as the notice under Section 12 of the Act is published in the Gazette, shall make an order to the Divisional Secretary of the area to display a similar notice at places that will ensure the widest publicity. The Divisional Secretary shall comply with such order and report to the Commissioner of Title Settlement within two weeks. Furthermore, Regulation 4(c) provides that the Commissioner may give further publicity, if he so desires, through radio, television, or any other means.",

In addition, the Petitioner has sought to quash the Title Investigation Report (P 11) and the report submitted by the 4th Respondent (P 12). P 11 is the document on which the 3rd Respondent sought approval from the 4th Respondent to register a first-class title and the 4th Respondent has approved the same. Therefore, P 11 is the document that led to the registration of the first-class title in the name of the 1st Respondent. However, P 12, although it is not addressed to anyone, appears to be an internal report submitted by the 4th Respondent.",

Further, I am of the view the conduct of the Respondents is unreasonable and shocks the conscience of the Court. Accordingly, on the grounds of failure to adhere to the Rules of natural justice, impropriety of procedure, and unreasonableness I issue a writ of certiorari prayed for in paragraph (B) of the prayer of the Petition quashing the document marked P 11 and also writs of certiorari prayed for in paragraph (C) of the prayer of the Petition quashing the certificates of title marked P 13 and P 14.",
