counts.

(1) For being members of an unlawful assembly on 14th March 2001 with

the common object of causing harm to one Rajgopal Wijeratnam and

thereby committing an offence punishable in terms of section 140 of

Page 4 of 17

After trial without a jury, the appellants were found guilty as charged by the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo by the judgment dated 31-10-2016.

Accordingly, they were sentenced to a term of six months rigorous

imprisonment and to a fine of Rs. 5000/- on count one preferred against them.

In default of paying the fine, they were sentenced for six months simple

imprisonment.

On count two, all of them were sentenced to death.

No order was made on the third count for which they were convicted,

apparently on the basis that it was an alternative count to the second count.

At the hearing of this appeal, it was informed to the Court that the 5th accused

appellant had passed away while in prison.

The Grounds of Appeal

The learned Counsel for the 1st accused appellant formulated the following

grounds of appeal for consideration at the hearing of the appeal.

(1) The evidence led at the trial does not support the contention that PW-

02 Roshani was an eyewitness to the incident of murder, and the

conviction reached on such a basis was bad in law.

(2) The inherent weaknesses of the evidence of PW-01 Veronica with

regard to the culpability of the 1st accused at the time of the incident

crates a reasonable doubt.

(3) The learned High Court Judge has erred by certifying with regard to

the demeanor and deportment of the prosecution witness PW-02,

when the learned High Court Judge was not the Judge before whom

the evidence was taken.

Page 5 of 17

(4) The provisions of section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance operate

against the prosecution because of the failure to lead the evidence of

PW-06, who was an important and a vital witness for the prosecution.

(5) The appellants were denied of a fair trial by the refusal of the learned

High Court Judge, the application made by the defence for an order to

call PW-06 as a witness for the prosecution.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd to 4th accused appellants

formulated the following grounds of appeal.

(6) The learned High Court Judge was misdirected by concluding that the

evidence of PW-01 and PW-02 can be believed.

(7) The learned High Court Judge, prior to considering the defence

evidence has accepted the evidence of PW-01 and PW-02 and thereby

compartmentalized the evidence.

(8) The learned High Court Judge misdirected herself by mixing up the

liability based on common object with that of vicarious liability.

(9) The learned High Court Judge misdirected herself in law by

construing the evidence of the 2nd and the 4th accused appellants as

taking up an alibi.

(10) The learned High Court Judge was misdirected as to the question of

proof beyond reasonable doubt.

(11) The learned High Court Judge failed to call PW-06 to give evidence in

Court in the interests of justice, and thereby acted in violation of

section 199(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

The Facts in Brief

This is an incident that had taken place on the 14th of March 2001, where the

deceased was brutally murdered in the broad daylight in Maradana area.

PW-01, the wife of the deceased and PW-02 the daughter of him, were the

persons who have given evidence at the trial Court as eyewitnesses to the

incident.

There had been a previous incident of murder where one Anton Croos, who is

the brother of Nesamuller, the immediate neighbour of the deceased was

suspected. He was in remand custody at the time this incident happened, and

according to the witnesses, the appellants had a grudge with the deceased for

visiting the mentioned Croos in remand prison. Around 11.30 in the morning of

the day of the incident, while at the kitchen of her house, the PW-01 had heard

someone shouting outside of the house and when inquired, she has seen the

1st and the 2nd accused appellants shouting at the direction of the house of the

earlier mentioned Nesamullar, threatening that there will be a blood revenge

before the evening. Seeing the PW-01, the 1st accused appellant has threatened

saying that this is a warning to your husband as well.

While returning with her daughter from school in the afternoon, the witness

has seen the four accused appellants and the now deceased fifth accused near

their house.

Around 4.45 in the evening, while attending to her daily chores in the house,

she has been alerted by her daughter that the earlier mentioned persons are

coming again. She has seen the 4th accused appellant with a sward in his hand

and others with knives. They have started attacking the house of Nesamullar. It

had been her evidence that when the house of Nesamullar was attacked by the

appellants, all the members of Nesamullars household were at their home.

Page 7 of 17

While this was taking place, she has seen her husband (the deceased) coming

towards the house and although she had attempted to alert the husband of the

imminent danger, it has failed. The appellants, after seeing the deceased, had

chased after him. PW-01 and her daughter PW-02 also had run behind the

pursuers of her husband. She has then seen all five of them attacking and

stabbing the deceased and getting into a three-wheeler and fleeing the scene of

the crime. The deceased had succumbed to his injuries at the hospital.

During the cross examination of the witness, a contradiction has been marked

to establish that what she has stated at the postmortem inquiry was that after

the incident, she sent a message to her children and got them down to the

place where her husband had fallen. (The contradiction marked 1V1), which

indicates that her children were not with her when this incident of stabbing

took place. On behalf of the appellants, several discrepancies and omissions of

her evidence in relation to her previous statements and evidence has been

highlighted as well. It had been the position of the defence that she was not an

eyewitness to the incident as claimed by her, and uttering falsehood, which she

has denied.

The daughter of the deceased (PW-02) was the only other eyewitness called by

the prosecution to substantiate the evidence of PW-01. She has given evidence

on the basis that when this incident happened, she too went behind her

mother and saw the appellants attacking her father, which appears to

corroborate the version of events as stated by her mother.

However, during the cross examination of the witness the defence has brought

to the notice of the Court several omissions in relation to her statement to the

police, and had marked the following relevant contradictions.

02V-2(2): - " "

02V-2(3): - " 1/2

Page 8 of 17

"

02V-2(4):- " "

The position taken up by the defence had been that she never saw the incident

and was uttering falsehood in that regard. Although the witness has denied, it

has been suggested to her showing photographs taken together with the 2nd

accused appellant that they had a love affair even after the alleged involvement

of the murder of her father, because he was not involved in it.

The prosecution has decided not to call the earlier mentioned Nesamullar who

was listed as prosecution witness number 06 in the indictment to give evidence

on its behalf. The application made by the defence to the Court urging that the

said witness be called on behalf of the prosecution in the interests of justice

had been rejected, as the prosecution has informed the Court that it is not

relying on her evidence to prove the case, and on the basis that the defence can

call her if they so wish.

When called for a defence at the conclusion of the prosecution case, the 1st and

the 2nd accused appellants have given evidence under oath, while the 3rd, 4th

and the 5th have made dock statements. The 2nd and the 5th accused appellants

have called witnesses on their behalf as well.

The 1st accused appellant, in his evidence has stated that the earlier mentioned

Nesamullar was his fathers elder sister Susei Marys daughter, and earlier

mentioned Anton Croos and another called Peter were members of that

household. It was his position that he had an issue with the members of their

household for not handing over of his drivers license delivered to that house,

and there was an altercation over that in the morning, and also in the

afternoon with Nesamullar and Peter. He has claimed that after that incident

was also over, the earlier mentioned Peter came and attempted to attack him

with a knife and the deceased got hold of him from behind while he was near a

Page 9 of 17

three-wheeler. He has claimed that in the melee, both he and the deceased fell

to the ground and the knife which was in the hand of the mentioned Peter fell

too. It was his position that since the deceased attempted to attack him with a

club found nearby, he got hold of the knife and stabbed the deceased and later

fled the area.

It appears that the position of the 1st accused appellant had been that this was

a result of a sudden fight and only he was involved in it, and none of the other

accused appellants.

The 2nd accused appellant was a three-wheeler driver during the time relevant

to this incident. In his evidence, he has claimed that on the day of the incident,

he went on a hire with one Joseph to Wellawatta area and returned only at

about 4.45 in the evening and was never involved in the murder of the

deceased. He has stated that he even had a love affair with the daughter of the

deceased (PW-02) in 2003 or 2004, because he was not involved in the murder.

The Joseph mentioned by the 2nd accused in his evidence has also given

evidence on behalf of him and had stated that in fact he engaged services of the

2nd accused appellant around 4.00-4.15 p.m. on the day of the incident to go to

Wellawatta.

The other accused appellants making dock statements had denied any

involvement in the incident. The 4th accused appellant has claimed that he was

not living in that area during the time relevant to this incident.

The 5th accused appellant has called Krishnadas Rameshkumar, who was the

8th witness listed in the indictment to give evidence on behalf of him. He was

the person who has identified the body of the deceased at the postmortem and

a close relative of the deceased. It had been his evidence that when the

daughter and the son of the deceased came and informed him that their farther

had been murdered, they only informed that some persons have murdered

Page 10 of 17

their father, and did not name any of the persons involved. However, he had

admitted that he never questioned them in that regard either, because he

rushed to the scene of the incident.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

The grounds of appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the 1st accused

appellant and the learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of the 2nd to 4th

accused appellants will be considered together as they are somewhat

interconnected.

The main contention taken up in this appeal was that the evidence of PW-01

and PW-02 was highly unreliable and the learned High Court Judge was wrong

to have convicted the appellants based on their evidence.

It had been the evidence of the PW-01 that when she saw her husband being

chased after by the appellants, she along with her daughter went after them

and saw the appellants attacking the deceased with sharp cutting weapons.

Her daughter, the PW-02 has given evidence similar to her mother claiming

that she followed her mother and saw the appellants attacking her deceased

father.

It has been pointed out in the trial Court on behalf of the appellants that PW-

01 has never stated that her daughter was with her when this incident

happened in the statement she made to the police after the incident.

In her evidence at the inquest, what she has stated had been to indicate that

her children were asked to come to the scene of the crime afterwards.

The relevant contradiction marked 1V-01 from her evidence at the inquest

reads as follows;

Page 11 of 17

"

. "

This contradiction in her evidence becomes relevant in considering what the

daughter (PW-02), has stated in her evidence before the trial Court, and what

she has stated in her statement to the police.

Although she has claimed that she saw the incident in her evidence before the

trial Court, the earlier mentioned contradictions marked as 02V-2(2), 02V2(3)

and 02V2(4) clearly establishes that PW-02 was not an eye witness to the

incident, but had gone there after it happened. The PW-02 was a 12-year-old

minor at the time of the incident. I find no reason for her to tell the police when

she was making her statement that she and her brother waited at home

through fear, and came towards the place of the incident after they were

informed by a neighbour that their mother was calling for them, if she was an

eyewitness to the incident.

Besides that, although the PW-02 has denied that she had a love afire with the

2nd accused appellant some years after the murder of her father, it appears

that the PW-02 has had some kind of a relationship with him, because of the

admitted photograph produced in the Court, where it appears that it has been

taken in a studio setting with the 2nd accused appellant and the PW-02

standing together.

I find that the two witnesses, being the mother and the daughter have decided

to give evidence claiming that both of them saw as to what happened, without

realizing the consequences of it, whereas they have not.

I am in no position to agree with the learned High Court Judges consideration

of the said witnesses evidence as cogent and trustworthy. Under the

circumstances, I am of the view that relying solely on their evidence to convict

Page 12 of 17

the appellants was not safe in the absence of any independent corroboration of

the facts that led to this incident.

I find that the evidence of PW-06, if called, would have given a clear insight as

to the events that unfolded on that day and the incident of stabbing of the

deceased.

The evidence clearly suggests that all the previous incidents had been in

relation to the members of PW-06 Nesmullars household. Although the PW-01

has claimed that the appellants had a grudge against her husband because he

visited Croos in remand prison, who was a murder suspect, there is no

evidence to suggest that it was the reason for the incidents that took place on

the day of the incident.

According to the evidence, the appellants focus had been the household

members of PW-06 on that day. When the house of PW-06 was attacked, she

had been at home. She was the next-door neighbour of the deceased. In my

view she would have been the best independent witness that should have been

called by the prosecution in order to clarify doubts in relation to the evidence of

PW-01 and PW-02 as alleged eyewitnesses to the incident of stabbing of the

deceased. Had she given evidence, the fact that whether all the five accused

were participants of the crime would have been clearly established

independently to the evidence of PW-01, and the fact that whether PW-01 and

PW-02 went after the assailants as they claimed in Court.

I am of the view that without sufficient corroboration of the evidence of PW-01

and 02, there was no basis for the learned High Court Judge to conclude that

the prosecution has proven the charges against the appellants beyond

reasonable doubt given the considered infirmities in the evidence of the alleged

eyewitnesses.

Page 13 of 17

In this matter, when the prosecution closed the case without calling PW-06, the

learned Counsel for the defence has made an application to Court to call that

witness as a witness for the prosecution in the interests of justice.

However, I find that the prosecuting State Counsel has vehemently objected to

the said application insisting that the prosecution has led sufficient evidence to

prove the charges against the appellants and if the appellants wanted, it was

opened for them to call the said witnesses as a defence witness. The

prosecution has relied on the decided cases of our superior courts which says

that it was up to the prosecution to decide on the number of witnesses they

rely on to prove a case against an accused person.

I find that although that may be so, in the instant appeal under consideration,

the prosecution should have known the infirmities in the evidence of PW-01

and 02. Under the circumstances, rather than being adamant in not calling

PW-06 as a prosecution witness, the prosecution should have called PW-06 in

the interests of justice, and in order to uncover the truth. It is the duty of a

prosecuting State Counsel as an officer of the court, to assist the Court in

dispensing justice rather than attempting to secure a conviction at any cost.

I am of the view that as argued correctly by the learned Counsel that the

presumption as envisaged in Section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance shall

become applicable in the instant case.

Section 114 (f) reads as follows;

114 (f). The evidence which could be and is not produced would if

produced, be unfavourable to the persons who withholds it.

Page 14 of 17

For the reasons mentioned above, I find that this is not a case where the

conviction based on unlawful assembly and murder can be allowed to stand.

I am of the view that even a conviction in terms of section 32 of the Penal Code

cannot be allowed to stand under the circumstances. Hence, this Court has no

option but to acquit the first accused appellant and the second to fourth

accused appellants of the charges of unlawful assembly, murder and

committing the murder with a common intention.

Therefore, the appellants are acquitted of the charges preferred against them.

However, although the first accused appellant is now stand being acquitted of

the charge of murder punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code, he

has admitted by giving evidence in Court that it was he who stabbed the

deceased which caused his ultimate death.

It has been his evidence that all the incidents that took place on that day

revolved around him and the members of the household of PW-06. He has

admitted that he went to the house of PW-06 on that day and there was an

altercation. It has been his evidence that, after the altercation and when he

was near a three-wheeler stand, another member of the PW-06s household

named Peter came and attacked him, and the deceased also took part in the

said altercation. According to his evidence, it was he who stabbed the deceased

using a knife brought by the earlier mentioned Peter, and fled the crime scene,

he has claimed that no one else was involved in the incident.

It appears that his position had been that the incident happened as a result of

a sudden fight in terms of exception four of section 294 of the Penal Code. The

said exception four reads as follows;

Page 15 of 17

Exception 4. Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed

without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon

a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue

advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation- It is immaterial in such cases which party

offers the provocation or commits the first assault.

When taking the evidence as a whole, I am of the view that the evidence of the

1st accused appellant that this was a result of a sudden quarrel in the heat of

passion is the only inference that can be drawn when it comes to the incident

where the deceased was stabbed to death, in view of the unreliability of other

evidence to the contrary.

Therefore, although the 1st accused appellant is acquitted of the charge of

murder, I convict him for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to

murder in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code.

Given the facts, the circumstances, and the number of stab injuries found in

the body of the deceased, I find that this is an offence that falls under the

second limb of section 297 where the act has been done with the knowledge

that it is likely to cause death. Therefore, I sentence the 1st accused appellant

for a term of 15 years rigorous imprisonment for the charge he is now convicted

and order him to pay a fine of Rs. 50000/-. In default of paying the fine, he

shall serve a period of 18 months simple imprisonment.

Considering the fact that the 1st accused appellant has been in incarceration,

since his conviction and the sentence on 31-10-2016, I order that the sentence

imposed upon the first accused appellant on his conviction for culpable

homicide not amounting to murder shall deem to have commenced from his

date of original conviction, namely, 31-10-2016.

Page 16 of 17

Although it was not necessary for the determination of the appeal, I would like

to comment on the submission made by the learned Presidents Counsel in

relation to the way the learned High Court Judge has considered the defence

taken up by the 2nd and the 4th accused.

It has been determined that they have taken up an alibi and that they have

failed to prove the same. This Court has reiterated again and again that an

alibi is not a defence in its strict sense but a question of fact. When an accused

person takes up an alibi, it is settled law that he has no burden of proof of the

alibi taken.

I am in agreement with the learned Presidents Counsel on his submission that

the position of the 2nd and the 4th accused appellants was not an alibi and the

learned High Court Judge was misdirected when it was determined so.

The position of the 2nd accused appellant had been that he went on a hire with

another person to Wellawatte and returned during the time relevant to the

incident and he was not involved in the murder. The position of the 4th accused

appellant had been that he did not live in the area and was living elsewhere

when this incident happened and he too was not involved in the crime.

In order to consider a position taken up by an accused person that he was not

involved in a crime and he was elsewhere as taking up an alibi, the position

taken should be a position that there was no possibility with certainty for him

to be present and to commit the crime. The time of the crime also needs to be a

time that can be definitely fixed. For an example, if there is evidence to show

that the crime was committed at a certain time, on a certain day of a certain

month and a year at a certain place, and if the accused person takes up the

position that he was in a different country at the alleged time and the day, and

it was not humanely possible for him to be present at the scene of the crime as

alleged, such a stand only can be taken up as an alibi.

Page 17 of 17

In the instant action, the stands taken up by the two accused appellants does

not fall into the category of taking up an alibi under any circumstance. The

learned High Court Judge was clearly misdirected as to the law in that regard

when it was determined that the accused had taken up an alibi and it was up

to them to prove the same.

The appeals of the 2nd to 4th accused appellants are allowed.

The appeal of the 1st accused appellant is partly allowed to extent as stated in

the judgment.
