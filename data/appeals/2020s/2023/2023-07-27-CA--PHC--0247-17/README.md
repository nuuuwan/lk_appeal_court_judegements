RESPONDENT

Before : Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

: P. Kumararatnam, J.

Counsel : A. Mohammed Farook for the complainant-petitioner-

Appellant.

: Shihar Hassan for the accused-respondent-

: Azard Navavi, D.S.G. for the respondent-respondent

Argued on : 05-06-2023

Decided on : 27-07-2023

Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The complainant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant)

instituted proceedings against the accused-respondent-respondents (hereinafter

referred to as the respondents) by filing a private plaint in terms of section 136(1)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 before the Magistrate Court

of Sammanthurai.

The 1st, 2nd and the 3rd count preferred had been against all the respondents.

In the 1st count it had been alleged that on 24-02-2013, the respondents

assaulted the appellant and also caused damage by throwing stones at his house

Page 4 of 7

and thereby committed offences punishable in terms of sections 314 and 373 of

the Penal Code.

In the 2nd count it had been alleged that the appellant lost several personal

belongings of him as mentioned in the charge, valued at Rs. 100000/-, as a

result of the assault incident, and thereby the respondents committed an offence

punishable in terms of section 410 of the Penal Code.

In the 3rd count it had been alleged that the that the appellant lost several

personal belongings of him as mentioned in the charge, valued at Rs. 100000/-

as a result of the assault incident, and thereby the respondents committed an

offence punishable in terms of section 410 of the Penal Code

It appears that the 3rd count was a repetition of the 2nd count.

The 4th count preferred was only against the 1st accused respondent, where it

had been alleged that he at the same incident and at the same transaction

caused damages to a value of Rs. 25000/- by attacking a motorcycle and thereby

he committed an offence punishable in terms of section 410 of the Penal Code.

At the trial, it had been revealed that the appellant had filed the private plaint

based on two complaints he made to the Sammanthurai police station on 24-02-

2013. It has been established that the police have referred the two complaints to

the Mediation Board of Sammanthurai, as the dispute was a matter that shall

be referred to the Mediation Board before filing any action before the Magistrate

Court.

The Mediation Board of Sammanthurai has issued the certificate of settlement

dated 31-03-2013, in terms of section 11 of the Mediation Boards Act No- 72 of

1988.

The learned Magistrate, after considering the factual matters brought to his

notice, and after considering the relevant law in that regard, has dismissed the

private plaint filed by the appellant by his order dated 09-05-2016 as there was

Page 5 of 7

no basis for the appellant to maintain his action against the respondents on a

matter that has already been settled before the Mediation Board.

The appellant has preferred an application in revision in terms of Article 154P of

the Constitution before the Provincial High Court of the Eastern Province holden

at Kalmunai on the basis of being aggrieved by the said order of the learned

Magistrate of Sammanthurai.

After hearing the parties, the learned High Court Judge of Kalmunai, by his well-

reasoned out judgment dated 16th October 2017, has dismissed the revision

application for want of any merit.

It is against the said judgment the appellant has preferred this appeal.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following ground of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

(1) The learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge erred in law

by failing to consider that the matter has not been settled before the

Mediation Board.

It was the position of the learned Counsel for the appellant that although the

matter was initially settled before the Mediation Board, the appellant informed

the Board that the settlement was withdrawn by him, and that fact has not been

duly considered by the Court.

The learned Counsel for the respondent brought to the notice the judgment of

the learned High Court Judge, where it has been held that the appellant had

suppressed material facts to the trial Court and had produced additional

documents in violation of the Rule No 3(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules of 1990, before the High Court.

It was also pointed out the requirements of section 14A of the Act if the matter

was not settled as claimed by the appellant.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

It is clear from the proceedings before the learned Magistrate of Sammanthurai,

that the Court has been informed that the matter mentioned in the private plaint

filed by the appellant was a matter that had been settled between the parties by

the Mediation Board before the appellant filed the action in the Magistrate Court.

The learned Magistrate, after being satisfied that the certificate of settlement

issued by the Mediation relates to the same dispute, has decided to terminate

the proceedings before him in terms of section 11 of the Mediation Boards Act,

as a private plaint cannot be entertained on a matter that had been duly settled

in accordance with the law.

When this matter was considered before the learned High Court Judge of

Kalmunai, the appellant has produced documents marked P-02, P-03, P-04

which were documents not produced begore the Magistrate Court. These were

not documents that confirms the appellants claim that the matter was not

settled.

The relevant section 14A of the Mediation Board Act as amended by Mediation

Board (Amendment) Act no 15 of 1997 reads as follows;

14A. Where a settlement of any dispute or offence or the resolution

of any differences that have arisen between the disputants after a

settlement, has not been possible under the provisions of the Act, the

Chairmen or the Chief Mediator, as the case may be, shall issue a

certificate on non- settlement in the prescribed form signed by the

Chairmen or the Chef Mediator, as the case may be, stating that it

has not been possible to settle such dispute or offence by mediation

and stating therein the reason for non-settlement.

It is the view of this Court that for the appellant to claim that the matter was not

settled, he needs to produce a certificate of non-settlement as required by section

14A of the Act, which was not the case.

Page 7 of 7

As viewed correctly by the learned High Court Judge, he has suppressed vital

material facts to the original Court and has come out with new material before

the High Court which has no value in order to challenge the determination of the

learned Magistrate.

It is, therefore, abundantly clear that the appellant had no basis to challenge the

order when he filed the application in revision before the Provincial High Court.

The learned High Court Judge has well considered the factual and legal

provisions in that regard, and had correctly dismissed the application.

Accordingly, I find no reasons to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate

of Samanthurai as well as the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of the

Provincial High Court of Eastern Province holden at Kalmunai.

It is the view of this Court that the appellant has filed this appeal before this

Court, not for anything else, but to cause the maximum possible harassment to

the respondent, knowing very well the strength of his appeal.

The appeal is dismissed as it is devoid of any merit.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High

Court of Kalmunai and to the Magistrate Court of Sammanthurai for

information.
