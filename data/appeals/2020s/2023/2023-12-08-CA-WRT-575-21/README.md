WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The facts relating to this application are as follows: In January 2018, the

Cabinet of Ministers had taken a policy decision to implement a

restructuring program and decided to lease out lands belonging to state

institutions to small and medium-scale investors. The 1st respondent,

Janatha Estate Development Board (hereinafter referred to as JEDB) had

called for applications from private companies to develop a land belonging

to the 1st respondent by the advertisement published in the Daily News

newspaper dated 24.05.2019, marked P-5. The petitioner stated that

Mount Jean Estate Watawala is an estate that belonged to the 1st

respondent and was under the restructuring program. The petitioner has

submitted a project proposal in respect of Mount Jean Estate. Thereafter,

Page 3 of 9

the interview board of JEDB conveyed its preliminary acceptance of the

proposal forwarded by the petitioner by the letter dated 2019.07.31,

marked P-7. By the same letter, the petitioner was informed to express the

agreement to comply with the conditions attached to the letter P-7. It is

stated further in the letter P-7 that upon the agreement to comply with the

conditions, the JEDB can enter into a contract with the petitioner after a

feasibility review of the project report. Accordingly, the petitioner confirmed

the agreement to the said conditions.

The petitioner states that after submitting confirmation for their

conditions, the 2nd respondent directed the superintendent of the Mount

Jean Estate by the letter P-9 to show the land that could be given for the

special project. Thereafter, the Managing Director of the petitioner showed

the said land to be surveyed, prepared a map for 8 blocks, and submitted

it to the 2nd respondent.

However, the petitioner states that the 1st to 3rd respondents have taken

no steps so far to enter into an agreement with the petitioner, and the 1st

to 3rd respondents are going to enter into contracts with some other

persons in respect of the surveyed 8 blocks of land of the Mount Jean

Estate. The contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner was that

the 1st to 3rd respondents were bound to enter into a contract with the

petitioner. Also, the learned Counsel contended that the petitioner had

been denied its legitimate expectations due to the failure of the 1st to 3rd

respondents to enter into a contract. This is the reason why the petitioner

company has come before this court seeking a Writ of Mandamus against

the respondents to enter into a contract with the petitioner company

regarding the 08 blocks of land described in the prayer (b) of the petition.

The position taken up in the statement of objections of the 1st and 2nd

respondents was that the 2nd respondent communicated only the

preliminary approval for the project proposal; the subsequent review by

the interview board on the feasibility of the project was to be considered

Page 4 of 9

after the petitioner communicated its consent to the conditions set out by

the 1st respondent in the document marked P-8(a) and the preliminary

acceptance of the project proposal is no guarantee for the final acceptance.

The 1st and 2nd respondents state further that the petitioner company

could not have a legitimate expectation because the discretion to grant

final acceptance rests on the interview board of the 1st respondent on

consideration of a multitude of factors.

The learned Counsel for all the parties consented to dispose this matter by

way of written submissions and written submissions were tendered on

behalf of the petitioner and the 1st & 2nd respondents. The learned Counsel

for the petitioner presented the petitioners case on the ground of legitimate

expectation. The learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondents advanced

his arguments on the following four grounds:

i. The petitioner has no locus standi to seek a Writ of Mandamus.

ii. A contract cannot be enforced by way of a Writ of Mandamus.

iii. The documents P-7 and P-8 cannot be interpreted as a contract.

iv. There cannot be a legitimate expectation that the tender would

be awarded to the petitioner.

Now, I proceed to consider the aforesaid four grounds and the ground of

legitimate expectation on which the petitioners application is based.

The petitioner has no locus standi to seek a Writ of Mandamus.

It is pointed out in the written submissions of the 1st and 2nd respondents

that according to the caption of the petition, the petitioner has been

described as Sulochana Constructions (Pvt) Ltd. However, the project

proposal marked P-6 had been tendered by a company, namely S.C. (Pvt)

Ltd. Further, it was stated that according to the document marked P-8(b),

the accepted proposals had been communicated by Sulochana

Constructions (Pvt) Ltd. Therefore, the contention of the learned Counsel

for the 1st and 2nd respondents was that on the face of it, the tenderer and

Page 5 of 9

the petitioner are two different entities and thus the petitioner has no locus

standi to seek a Writ of Mandamus because the said ambiguity has not

been resolved by annexing the certificate of incorporation of the petitioner

company.

P-6 is the project report tendered by a company called S.C. (Pvt) Ltd.

However, the petitioner who seeks a Writ of Mandamus is a company called

Sulochana Constructions (Pvt) Ltd. It cannot be taken for granted that

the project report has been tendered by the petitioner company because

the beginning letters of the name Sulochana Constructions are S and

C. As stated by the learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondents, there

is no proof that both names are used for the same company. Hence, there

is a substance in the said argument advanced by the learned Counsel for

the 1st and 2nd respondents regarding the locus standi of the petitioner to

seek a Writ of Mandamus.

A contract cannot be enforced by way of a Writ of Mandamus.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd respondents was

that an invitation to express interest was called from business enterprises

for projects that are commercial in nature and thus a commercial

agreement/ contract cannot be enforced by a Writ of Mandamus. Line of

Judicial Authorities have been cited in substantiating the said argument.

The learned Counsel raised this argument because, in the advertisement

marked P-5, it is mentioned that to generate agricultural projects

commercially to contribute the national economy. Although the project

is of a commercial nature, selection of candidates is done by a public body;

JEDB as described in the said advertisement. In addition, the selection of

candidates is an administrative function. Hence, both the source of power

and the nature of power sought to be reviewed are administrative in

nature. Therefore, I hold that this matter is amenable to writ jurisdiction.

Page 6 of 9

The documents P-7 and P-8 cannot be interpreted as a contract.

There cannot be a legitimate expectation that the tender would be awarded

to the petitioner.

The aforesaid two grounds of argument could be considered together. The

petitioner has come to this Court on the ground of legitimate expectation.

What is stated in the written submission tendered by the learned Counsel

for the 1st and 2nd respondents was that P-7 is only a preliminary

acceptance. It is emphasized in the written submission that upon

expressing the petitioner's agreement to comply with the conditions, the

interview board of the Janatha Estate Development Board conducts a

feasibility review, and the final contract is entered with the petitioner

company only if the petitioner's proposal is accepted by the JEDB.

The letter P-7 sent by the Chairman of Janatha Estate Development Board

to the petitioner company is important in this respect. The said letter reads

as follows;

2019.05.24

,

.

. 07

.

It is clearly stated in that letter that only the preliminary approval for the

proposal had been granted by the Janatha Estate Development Board. It

is also clearly stated that the Janatha Estate Development Board would

enter into a contract with the petitioner company subsequent to a review

by the Board on the feasibility of the project report. In the letter P-7, it is

also stated that if the petitioner agrees to comply with the conditions set

out in the annexure to the P-7, the feasibility of the petitioners project

Page 7 of 9

report would be reviewed by the JEDB. The petitioner does not dispute the

fact that after reviewing the feasibility of the report, the JEDB has not

informed the petitioner that they are satisfied with the project report

submitted by the petitioner company. If it was so informed, that would

have created a legitimate expectation that the 1st respondent would enter

into a contract with the petitioner. But here, only a preliminary approval

has been given by the JEDB. The petitioner stated in the written

submission that the respondents had not informed the petitioner about its

shortcomings or failures. It is not revealed from any document or in any

other way that there was such an obligation on the part of the 1st

respondent.

In addition, it is stated in the letter P-9 that in consequence to the paper

advertisement published on 24.05.2019, project proposals are being

accepted. The said letter P-9 was sent on 16.09.2019 subsequent to the

letter P-7. The said letter P-9 has also been tendered by the petitioner with

the petition. Therefore, it is apparent that the petitioner knew about P-9.

It is evident from P-9, that even by 16.09.2019, the JEDB was accepting

project proposals. Thus, there was no reason for the petitioner to have a

legitimate expectation that the 1st respondent would enter into a contract

with the petitioner company because the petitioner should have realized

that, even though preliminary approval was given for its project proposal,

project proposals were still being accepted.

H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth in Administrative Law, 11th edition,

at page 452, 453 discussing the question of legitimate expectation, states

that It is not enough that an expectation should exist; it must in addition

be legitimate. But how is it to be determined whether a particular

expectation is worthy of protection? This is a difficult area since an

expectation reasonably entertained by a person may not be found to be

legitimate because of some countervailing consideration of policy or law.

Citing the cases of ex p MFK Underwriting Agencies Ltd, ex p Matrix-

Securities Ltd and R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and

Commonwealth Affairs- [2009] UKHL 61 Wade and Forsyth further

states that A crucial requirement is that the assurance must itself be

clear, unequivocal and unambiguous. Many claimants fail at this hurdle

after a close analysis of the assurance. The test is how on a fair reading of

the promise it would have been reasonably understood by those to whom

it was made. (R (Association of British Civilian Internees: Far East

Region) v. Secretary of State for Defence- [2003] EWCA Civ 473, [2003]

QB 1397.)

A clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous assurance that the 1st respondent

would necessarily enter into a contract with the petitioner company

regarding the eight blocks of land of the Mount Jean Estate of Watawala

cannot be reasonably ascertained on a fair reading of P-7 and P-9 because

P-7 clearly states that preliminary approval has been granted and JED

would enter into a contract with the petitioner after reviewing the feasibility

of the report. That is a clear indication that the JEDB was going to enter

into a contract with the petitioner, only if the JEDB is satisfied with the

feasibility of the report. If the intention of the JEDB, at the time of sending

P-7 was to enter into a contract with the petitioner, there was no reason to

mention in P-7 the words preliminary approval. Also, there was no reason

to mention that after reviewing the feasibility of the report, they would

enter into a contract. These circumstances do not reflect a possibility for

the petitioner to have a legitimate expectation.

For the reasons stated above, a Writ of Mandamus cannot be issued

against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents compelling them to enter into a

contract with the petitioner as prayed for in the petition.
