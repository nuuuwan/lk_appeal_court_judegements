Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted

before the High Court of Batticaloa for having committed the offenses of;

Count 1 Committing the offence of rape of a minor, a young girl below the age of 16

years named Suntharamoorthy Suthamalar punishable under Section 364(2) of the Penal

Code as amended by Act No. 22 of 1995.

Count 2 Committing the offence of murder by causing the death of the abovementioned

minor punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

Count 3 Committing the offence of Robbery of a sum of money, a gold bangle, and a gold

chain belonging to and in the custody of Thandavarajah Amaravathy punishable under

Section 380 of the Penal Code.

Prosecution led the evidence of eight witnesses and production marked as P1 to

P8. The Accused made a dock statement. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High

Court Judge by his judgment dated 18th of February 2008 found the Accused guilty and

imposed the following sentences;

Page 3 of 7

Count 1 10 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of 5000LKR

Count 2 Death Sentence

Count 3 10 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of 5000LKR

Being aggrieved by the said conviction the Accused has appealed to this court.

The Following are the Grounds of Appeal set out in the written submission

1. The approved/accepted English translation brief does not appear to indicate due

compliance of Section 195(e) of the Criminal Procedure Code relating to Jury

Option which would vitiate the entire preceding before the High Court.

When we peruse the original record, the journal entry dated 08.03.2007 which

was written in English, indicates that the option for a jury trial was offered to

the Accused. The Accused chose to have the trial heard by a judge without a

jury. For the aforementioned reasons, I am of the view that there is neither

substance nor merit in this argument, and therefore, I reject this ground of

appeal.

2. The learned Trial Judge erred in fact and law by permitting the admission of

the Deposition Evidence of Krishnapulle as it did not satisfy the laid down legal

criteria under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows;

Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any person

authorized by law to take it, is relevant, for the purpose of proving, in a subsequent

judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial proceeding, the truth of the

facts which it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found, or is incapable of giving

evidence, or is kept out of the way by the adverse party, or if his presence cannot be

obtained without an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the

case, the court considers unreasonable:

During the trial, the Police informed the court that the spouse of PW1 had lodged

a complaint, asserting that her husband (PW1) was apprehended by the Army. To

substantiate the claim that PW1 was untraceable, the Prosecution presented evidence

from his wife, Dayamadi, and Police Officer Jinna. Subsequent to the presentation of this

evidence, the Prosecution moved an application before the court to permit the deposition

Page 4 of 7

of PW1 to be marked as evidence, in accordance with Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance

of Sri Lanka. Upon due consideration, the Learned High Court Judge allowed the

deposition to be marked as such.

We are mindful of the observation made in the case of Annavi Muthiriyan v

Emperor 1915, 16 Cr. L.J 294, Spencer, J held that;

It was held that where a witness cannot be found a mere statement by the prosecutor

that the witness cannot be found is insufficient.

We found that the prosecution has led the evidence of the wife and the police officer

and provided an opportunity for the defense to cross-examine the witnesses. After such

inquiry, the Learned High Court Judge has satisfied that the said witness could not be

found and therefore he allowed the application.

We hold that the Learned High Court Judge has correctly allowed the application

made under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance, by applying his judicial mind.

Therefore, for the aforementioned reasons, I reject this ground of appeal.

Now we have to consider whether there was sufficient evidence led before the

Learned Trial Judge to come to the conclusion that the Accused had murdered the

Deceased;

PW1, Arumugam Krishnapillai, who was an eye witness, stated in his non-

summary proceedings that both he and the Accused had left to see a musical program. On

the way, the Accused asked to stop at the Deceased's house, located in front of the

Mavadivedum Army camp. When they stopped at the house at 3:30 pm, PW1 saw the

Accused approach the Deceased, who was standing outside her house eating a mango,

with a knife in her other hand. Upon seeing the Accused, the Deceased ran into her house,

and the Accused followed, closing the door behind him. PW1 peeped through a block grill

after entering the premises and observed the Accused pinning the Deceased to a wall,

cutting her neck with a knife, and raping her by lifting the gown she was wearing. The

Accused, who spotted PW1, threatened his life if he were to tell anyone.

The Defense had prayed for the rejection of PW1's evidence, applying Section 33

of the Evidence Ordinance, "Evidence in a former judicial proceeding when relevant." The

Page 5 of 7

Learned Trial Judge effectively rejected this notion, as the Accused was granted

permission to cross-examine this witness but opted not to. Therefore, the Learned Trial

Judge deemed PW1's non-summary as admissible in the High Court trial.

According to PW2, Pastor Santhirasegaram Chrisbus, on the fatal day of 29th

September 2002, he was traveling from Batticaloa to Morakoddanchenai on his

motorcycle when he was stopped by an individual who declared that a person had been

murdered inside a house and asked for help. PW2 proceeded to the house, where he found

the Deceased lying in a pool of blood, and a drunk individual carrying an oil lamp.

Enraged, PW2 held the Accused by his shoulder and walked out of the house. An old lady,

the Deceaseds grandmother (PW3), subsequently came running in distress and shouted

at the Accused, You have killed my child. PW2 then called and informed the Eravur

Police.

In his cross-examination, PW2 stated that the approximate time of the events was

between 5:30 to 6:30 pm.

PW3, Thandavarajah Amarawathy, the grandmother to the Deceased, testified

about finding her granddaughter's lifeless body and noticing that a gold chain and money

valued at 11,500 LKR were missing. In her cross-examination, she provided details about

the clothing worn by her granddaughter and the Accused and clarified her observations

during the tragic event.

When considering the testimonial creditworthiness of these witnesses' evidence,

they have remained consistent and truthful throughout the evidence specified in both the

examination-in-chief and the cross-examination.

According to PW7 Dr. Sugumar the Judicial Medical Officer in his postmortem

report, there was a 15-inch-long cut wound under the Deceaseds chin which slit opened

her throat cutting off the blood vessels in her trachea, resulting in the complete blockage

of blood circulation and breathing, categorically succumbing to instantaneous death,

which was deemed as the cause of death. Further, he stated that there was an injury

recorded found in the deceaseds genital region as the Hymen was discovered to be torn

denoting that the Deceased was subjected to intercourse prior to her death, to solidify this

there were drops of semen found within the Deceaseds genital area inside the injury

Page 6 of 7

which appeared frozen thus confirming that she was raped. PW7 had also examined the

Accused and noticed several injuries all over his body in his expert opinion which

described as defensive wounds caused by the Deceased during the Incident.

In his expert opinion, it is evident that the blockage of the Deceased's

breathing and the severing of blood vessels resulted in the Deceaseds death.

In the course of the cross-examination, it is significant to note that not a

single question was put forward by the Defense concerning the rape. The Defense

focused solely on the injuries observed on the Accused's body.

This evidence is in agreement with the testimony of PW1 regarding how

the Accused had cut the Deceased's neck, and the rape was not contested by the

Defense.

According to PW5, Siripala Udawaka, Chief Inspector of Police, he arrived

at the crime scene based on the information received from PW2. Upon reaching

the location, he observed the injuries inflicted upon the Deceased, recovered the

knife, and noticed the blood stains spread across the floor.

Considering the evidence from the Accused, who gave a dock statement

claiming that he had only arrived at the crime scene to observe what was

transpiring, it contrasts with the evidence provided by the Prosecution's

witnesses. They testified that he was inside the house and had blood stains on his

clothing. This position was not challenged by the Defense. Therefore, we hold that

the Learned High Court Judge correctly rejected this evidence.

Upon considering the totality of the evidence, we hold that the

Prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused committed

the offenses of murder and rape against Suntharamoorthy Suthamalar.

We find insufficient evidence to establish that the Accused committed

robbery; therefore, we acquit the Accused on the third count.

We hereby affirm the convictions and sentences for both the first and

second counts. Consequently, this appeal is dismissed.
