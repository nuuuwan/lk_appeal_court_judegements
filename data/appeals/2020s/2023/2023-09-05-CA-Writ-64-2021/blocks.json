On or about 22 October 2020, the Petitioner had come to know that the construction of a new filling station has begun at No.330, Sedawatta, Ambetale Road and No. 339-340, Orugodawatta, Ambetale Road, which together constitute one premises owned by the 10th Respondent. Said premises is said to be located 459 meters away from the Petitioners filling station. The Petitioner further states that he verily believes that the 10th Respondent has been given or is imminent to be given a dealership by the 1st Respondent to operate a filling station at the said premises. It is claimed that unless the 10th Respondent has been informed that the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent has decided to grant written approval to the 10th Respondent to operate such a filling station, the 10th Respondent would not have begun the construction of the said filling station.",

Therefore, I hold that the Petitioner is entitled to the relief claimed in the prayer (b) of the prayer of the petition. Further I take the view that any agreement entered into between parties consequent to such decision cannot be considered as binding in law. In view of the way the prayers (c) and (d) of the prayer of the petition are formulated, I am not inclined to issue writs of Prohibition as prayed for. Therefore, my above findings should not be an impediment for the 10th Respondent to submit a lawful application for consideration by the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent. I order no cost.",
