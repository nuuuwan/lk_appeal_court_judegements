The learned Counsel for the Intervenient Petitioner Mr. Suren Fernando made submissions

in support of the Petition dated 24.03.2023. The learned Deputy Solicitor General and the

learned Presidents Counsel Dr. Romesh de Silva and the learned Presidents Counsel Mr.

Sanjeewa Jayawardena made submissions opposing the said Application made by the

Intervenient Petitioner of the said Petition dated 24.03.2023. The Petitioner-Respondent, the

Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka is absent and unrepresented.

My brother and I have no doubt that Mr. J. W. M. Janaka P. K. Ratnayake (Intervenient-

Petitioner) was in Court on the date the application bearing No. CA/Writ/37/2023 was

supported and my brother and I very well recall that we posed certain questions to the said

Mr. Ratnayake and those questions were answered through his Counsel in open Court.

By way of the Petition dated 24.03.2023, the said Mr. Ratnayake who is the Intervenient-

Petitioner seeks permission to intervene in the main Application bearing No.

CA/Writ/56/2023 and also seeks for an order from this Court to get certain findings of the

order dated 10.02.2023 of this Court as described in paragraph (c) of the prayer of the said

Petition, expunged.

The learned Counsel for the Intervenient-Petitioner strenuously submits that the Court of

Appeal has the inherent powers to correct errors of its own orders or judgments. The learned

Counsel for the Intervenient-Petitioner contends that the findings of this Court in the said

order dated 10.02.2023 includes certain remarks on the proxy purportedly filed on behalf of

the Petitioner-Respondent or on behalf of the said Mr. Ratnayake. He asserts that making

any remark against the said Mr. Ratnayake without giving him an opportunity to respond

would amount to a violation of natural justice. The learned Counsel for the Intervenient-

Petitioner relies on the Judgments in Sivapathaligam vs. Sivasubramaniam (1990) 1 Sri. L.R.

378; Jeyaraj Fernandopulle vs. Premachandra De Silva and others (1996) 1 Sri. L.R. 70;

Ganeshanantham vs. Vivienne Goonewardene and three others (1984) 1 Sri. L.R. 319 and

Gunasena vs. Bandaratilleke (2000) 1 Sri. L.R. 292.

This Court clearly observes that no appeal has been lodged against the said order dated

10.02.2023 and also no leave to appeal application has been made under the Supreme Court

Rules.

Having considered the submissions made by all the Counsel and the circumstances of this

case, this Court is of the view that there are no sufficient grounds to review or revise or vary

the order made by this Court on 10.02.2023 and also to exercise our inherent powers in this

regard. We are guided by the general rule adopted by our Courts that 'once an order is passed

and entered or otherwise perfected in accordance with the practice of the Court which passed

the order is functus officio and cannot set aside or alter the order however, wrong it may

appear to be - that can only be done in appeal'. We draw our attention to the judicial

precedent enunciated in Navaroach vs. Shrikanthan and others (1997) 1 Sri. L.R. 286 and

Sirimavo Bandaranaike vs. Times of Ceylon Limited (1995) 1 Sri. L.R. 22.

It is important to draw the attention to the contents of paragraph 8 of the Petition dated

24.03.2023. This Court is of the view that the Intervenient-Petitioner has submitted his

Application based on the grounds mentioned in the said paragraph 8 of the Petition. It

appears that he has filed the said Petition on the alleged grounds that the findings made by

this Court are prejudicial to the rights and interests of the Intervenient-Petitioner personally

as, inter alia, demonstrated by the document 'IP3'.

We are of the view that there is no correction to be made or any variation to be made to the

order dated 10.02.2023 as there is no error made by this Court through oversight,

inadvertence or want of care. Hence. having regard to the definition of the per incuriam, the

order dated 10.02.2023, the facts and the circumstances of the instant case do not warrant the

exercise of inherent powers of this Court. At this stage, we draw our attention to the

judgement in Kariawasam vs. Priyadharshani (2004) 1 Sri. L.R 189 which analyzes the per

incuriam rule and also the judgement in Mahagamage Chandrasena alias Chandrasiri of

Bamunugedera-Kurunegala vs. Abdul Hasan Mohomed Iqbal and others, SC HC CA LA No.

128/2014 decided on 17.02.2017.

Moreover, we find no legal basis to allow the Application of the Intervenient-Petitioner of

Petition to intervene into the main application bearing Case No. CA/Writ/56/2023 which is

now duly concluded. We cannot contribute to any application which leads to the abuse of

process of Court.

Based on such circumstances, we proceed to dismiss the Application made by the

Intervenient-Petitioner in the Petition dated 24.03.2023.
