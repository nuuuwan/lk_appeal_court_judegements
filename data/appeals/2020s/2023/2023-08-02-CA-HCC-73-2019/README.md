Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted in

the High Court of Anuradhapura under Section 296 of the Penal Code for committing the

murder of one Yapa Mudiyanselage Podi Menike Yapa (hereinafter referred to as the

deceased) between the 28th of February and the 19th of April 2005.

Prosecution led evidence of fifteen witnesses PW1 to PW15 and closed its case

wherein marked productions from P1 to P18. At the conclusion of the trial, The Learned

High Court Judge convicted the Accused guilty, and the death sentence was imposed.

We must be mindful that this case is based on circumstantial evidence. Therefore,

we are guided by the well-established principles of law on circumstantial evidence.

The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:

According to PW1, Neelaka Hemantha Kumara, the accused is the younger

brother of PW1s mother and lived 150 meters away from PW1s residence. At the time,

PW1 was an army deserter hiding at night in the forest for fear of army capture. PW1

visited the accuseds house for a drink, during which the accused confessed to killing a

Page 3 of 6

woman but did not disclose where he had buried her. Later the accused showed PW1

where he had buried the body. However, the accused did not mention who the woman was,

and PW1 had no knowledge of her identity. Interestingly, before the accused showed him

the burial site, PW1 had already ventured into the forest with a 3-foot stick and poked

the ground.

Later, PW1's grandmother informed him that the accused was looking for him.

The accused subsequently took PW1, between 9:30 pm and 10:00 pm, to the burial site.

There, the accused shone a light and stabbed a knife into the ground, marking the spot

where he had buried the body. He then told PW1 not to disclose this to anyone. However,

PW1 later informed the Grama Niladari (PW14) about the confession made by the

Accused, who advised him to report it to the police and meet them at the temple. Four or

five days later, PW1 met with the police officers, who told him that since four days had

passed, they could not take action on the matter and instructed him to return home. On

The accused reportedly went to PW1's house looking for him, during which he

assaulted PW1's father and threatened him with a knife while inquiring about PW1's

location. Thereafter PW1 had gone to the police station and lodged a complaint against

the Accused regarding the murder on the 19th of April at which point the Accused was

remanded under police custody, Later PW1 accompanied police officers to show them the

burial site without the Accused. The body was exhumed in the presence of the Judicial

Medical Officer and the Magistrate. PW1 identified the corpse as a female based on the

dress she was wearing, although the body was in a state of decay and her face was covered

with an object.

PW1 mentioned that no evidence was collected at that time, but a statement was

recorded by the Magistrate. Furthermore, PW1 disclosed that he had visited the location

Page 4 of 6

three times - once before the accused led him there and once after the accused showed

him the spot however the third time was not stated by him.

In his cross-examination, he revealed that he had visited the site covertly without

the accused's knowledge. He informed the Grama Niladari and the police out of fear for

his own life. He also acknowledged having memory deficiencies and stated that he

suffered from mental impairment. It is to be noted that PW1 started to give evidence in

contradiction to what he had said earlier.

Before we analyse his evidence with regard to his trustworthiness it is pertinent

to refer to the evidence led by PW14 who stated that he was informed about a murder by

PW1 but he had not mentioned about a confession made to PW1 by the Accused. The

Learned High Court Judge has heavily relied on the circumstantial confession made to

this witness,

From assessing the following excerpt from his judgement.

The Learned High Court Judge has simply accepted the said confession on the

basis that it was given voluntarily to this witness by the Accused, he has failed to analyse

whether such a confession was actually made by the Accused to PW1.

We find it noteworthy that PW1 visited the burial site prior to the alleged

confession from the accused. This raises questions about why he did so and how he was

able to identify the location of the body before the accused supposedly revealed it.

Furthermore, he admitted to habitually spending nights in the forest, which is also where

the accused showed him the burial site.

Another troubling piece of evidence is that PW1 reported the situation to the

police only after the accused assaulted his father. Given the entirety of his testimony and

his acknowledged difficulties with memory recall, we are inclined to view his evidence as

unreliable.

Thus, serious doubt remains as to whether a confession was indeed made by the

accused to PW1.

In the case of King v. Abeywickrema 44 NLR 254 his Lordship Soertsz S.P.J. held

that:

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the Jury must be satisfied

that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with any

reasonable hypothesis of his innocence.

In the case of B.R.R.A. Jagath Pramawansha v. The Attorney General CA Appeal

No. 173/2005, decided on 19.03.2009, his Lordship Sisira de Abrew J. analysed a few of

the leading authorities on this point thus:

Page 6 of 6

"Having regard to the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I hold

that in a case of circumstantial evidence, if an inference of guilt is to be drawn, such an

inference must be the one and only irresistible and inescapably conclusion that the

accused committed the offence. When the evidence adduced at the trial is considered, the

one and only irresistible and inescapable conclusion that can be arrived at is that the

accused committed the murder..."

Therefore we reject PW1s evidence.

Two other elements of the evidence that warrant consideration are the necklace

reportedly worn by the deceased, which was recovered later, and the phone calls made to

the number '0777771986'. Firstly, the necklace (presented as Exhibit P3) was not

definitively identified by PW2 (the daughter-in-law of the deceased). Secondly, the nature

of the phone calls made to PW5, requesting to speak to the deceased, remains an open

question. This ambiguity creates doubt as to whether these phone calls can be directly

linked to the guilt in this case.

The prosecution has failed to establish the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable

doubt, the production discovered only embraces the knowledge of the Accused to these

items being recovered from the places which they were detected however there is no

evidence connecting him with the murder of Podi Menike Yapa.

We are of the firm opinion that the circumstantial evidence used against the

Accused does not indicate his guilt. Therefore, we overturn the findings, conviction, and

sentence imposed on the Accused, thereby acquitting him. Consequently, this Appeal is

granted.
