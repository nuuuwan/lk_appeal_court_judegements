Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner submitted an application to Anula Vidyalaya, Nugegoda for admission to

Grade 1, under the category 'children of residence in close proximity to the school'. The

Notice dated 16.06.2022, marked 'P2' (the relevant Circular No. 28/2022, marked 'R1'),

sets out the instructions relating to the admission of children to Grade 1 in government

schools for the year 2023. The Petitioner's application was rejected by the letter of rejection

dated 13.10.2022, marked 'P15'. The Petitioner is primarily seeking for a mandate in the

nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the said letter of rejection.

The Petitioner's contention is that she resides with her parents at the address given above

and the said property is in the name of the Petitioner's grandmother. The Petitioner claims

that the Title Deed for the said premises, the birth certificate of the Petitioner, Grama

Page 3 of 7

Niladari certificate, extracts of the Electoral Register and other relevant documents have

been submitted along with the said application.

The reasons given in the letter of rejection 'P15' in Sinhala language;

1) ' .'

2) ' .'

The immediate and appropriate English translation that can be assigned for the above first

reason (6th reason listed in 'P15') is that the 'title of the residence appears to be not

confirmed according to the Circular'. The second reason can be translated to give the effect

that 'the relationship between the Deed owner and the applicant appears to be not

revealed'. I have assumed such translations upon perusal of the list of reasons reflected in

'P15'. The interview board is required to insert a tick against the decided reason among

several others in the list. On a careful perusal of the terminology used in 'P15', it implies

that there are two sets of draft reasons therein; firstly, to declare a fault of the Petitioner

for not tendering/establishing a fact or document and secondly to declare a speculation

which needs to be established probably with further evidence etc. To my mind, both the

above reasons selected by the interview board in 'P15' are speculations.

The typed words in the 6th reason in 'P15' implies that the documents relating to the title

to the premises have not been tendered. The interview board has deleted certain words in

the said 6th reason and converted it to a speculation by which it is stated that the title to

the residence appears to be not confirmed. No inference has been made by both the

aforesaid reasons that the Petitioner has failed to provide/tender the relevant documents

or establish the relevant relationship. This situation would have been different if the

interview board expressly declared that there is no relationship between the deed owner

and the applicant. Had the interview board not deleted those words in the 6th reason, it

would have been a decision in final nature.

I am aware that there would be adverse repercussions when the school authorities or the

interview board deviate from the relevant Circular 'R1' or 'P2' by giving an assumption

other than the literal meaning of a sentence or a word therein. The strict compliance of the

Circular is meant to uphold equality and transparency.

However, when the interview board rejects an application on a reason which leaves room

for further clarifications on a certain point of view, it cannot be considered as a final

Page 4 of 7

verdict. The Clause 9.1.5 of Circular 'R1' provides applicants an opportunity to submit a

reapplication to the Principal when his/her application has been rejected while there are

necessary qualifications. Anyhow, such applicants are not permitted to annex to the

reapplication anything other than the documents forwarded with previous application. It

seems that the said provisions do not restrain any discretion of the Principal or the

interview board to summon or inspect voluntarily any material to clarify a particular issue

upon which the interview board has not arrived at a final conclusion.

The main grievance of the Petitioner is that the document which discloses the relationship

between the Petitioner and her grandmother has not been considered when evaluating the

reapplication.

At this stage, I must examine the role and the duty of the Principal and the interview board

and also of an appeal board which evaluate reapplications/appeals of the parents whose

applications have been rejected. It is no doubt that in terms of 'R1', a party can appeal, as

of right, subject to the conditions of its Clause 10. Anyhow, the present issue is only in

reference to the reapplication submitted by the Petitioner. As per the circumstances of this

case, I take the view that the decisions contained in the letter of rejection 'P15' can be

submitted for reconsideration under the said Clause 9.1.5, as of right.

A decision is 'final' if it would determine the entire proceedings whichever way the court

decided the issues before it. Further, a decision is treated as final where it is made at the

conclusion of part of a hearing or trial which has been split into parts and would, if made

at the conclusion of that hearing or trial, be a final decision because it determines the

entirety of that part of the claim. (vide- Access to Justice Act 1999 (Destination of Appeals)

Order 2000, art.1(2)(c) & art.1(3) in England). Hence, a reasonable question arises whether

the two reasons adduced by the interview board in 'P15' can be considered as final. In such

a backdrop, it appears that both such reasons are not in the nature of a final order but mere

decisions which need additional material to arrive at a final conclusion.

The criteria adopted in Section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code of Sri Lanka is very much

useful to understand the role of an appellate body. The Section 773;

'Upon hearing the appeal, it shall be competent to the Court of Appeal to affirm,

reverse, correct or modify any judgment, decree, or order, according to law, or to

pass such judgment, decree or order therein between and as regards the parties, or

Page 5 of 7

to give such direction to the Court below, or to order a new trial or a further hearing

upon such terms as the Court of Appeal shall think fit, or, if need be, to receive and

admit new evidence additional to, or supplementary of, the evidence already taken

in the Court of first instance, touching the matters at issue in any original cause,

suit or action, as justice may require or to order a new or further trial on the ground

of discovery of fresh evidence subsequent to the trial'.

If the role of an appellate body is only to uphold the original decision, then providing a

mechanism for reapplication or appeal is futile. The appellate body needs to evaluate the

original decision, according to law. Similarly, the interview board of the instant

Application or the Appeal Board (Appeal and Objection Investigation Board) should

adopt a reasonable and lawful criteria to evaluate the decisions of rejecting the applications

for admissions. Calling for further evidence or documents in order to reach a final decision

can be done within such criteria and in line with several provisions of the Circular 'R1' (or

'P2').

It has been held in Beatrice Dep vs. Lalani Meemaduwa (1997) 3 Sri. L.R. 379;

"In Lada v. Marshall1 at 748, Denning, L.J. said, "In order to justify the reception of fresh

evidence or a new trial, three conditions must be fulfilled: first, it must be shown that the

evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial: second,

the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on

the result of the case, although it need not be decisive: third, the evidence must be such as is

presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need

not be incontrovertible". These conditions were taken into account and applied in Ratwatte

v. Bandara2."

Based on such circumstances, I must concentrate only on the reliefs prayed for in

paragraph (f), among several other paragraphs, of the prayer of the Petition. This is

because the Petitioner's main concern as submitted at the hearing stage is that the Principal

and the members of the interview board have not duly evaluated the reapplication of the

Petitioner. It is important to note the Petitioner's argument that the restriction of

submitting new documents with the reapplication as imposed in the said Clause 9.1.5 is

1 1954, 3 All ER 745 at 748. 2 70 NLR 231.

Page 6 of 7

clearly to prevent additional marks being claimed with the introduction of new documents.

I am inclined to accept this argument of the Petitioner based on the expected role of an

appellate body and also due to the non-conclusive nature of the decision of the interview

board reflected in 'P15'.

Hence, I see no probable ground to adopt, in the instant Application, the submissions

made by the Respondents that the documents to establish the nexus between the Petitioner

and the grandmother is a mandatory prerequisite and such material comes within the

mandatory documents described in Clause 7.2.1.1 of 'R1'. Anyhow, I agree with the

argument of the learned Deputy Solicitor General who appears for the Respondents that

the failure to prove the title to ownership constitutes an absolute bar to consider the

applications for admission.

In my opinion, the interview board should have evaluated the reapplication of the

Petitioner by inquiring whether documents to establish the nexus between the Petitioner

and the grandmother could not have been submitted with reasonable diligence. The

reasons given in 'P15' for rejection are in the form of suppositions and thereby the

reapplication of the Petitioner needs to be processed by summoning additional material in

order to arrive at a final conclusion. Considering a document to clarify a certain position

at the reapplication stage, without reckoning extra marks for the same, cannot imply any

violation of the conditions in Clause 7.2.1.1 of 'R1'. Such process should be necessary to

assess the proof of residence.

Additionally, the Petitioner points out an instance where the interview board has

accommodated certain applicants to tender the Grama Niladari Certificate and Title

Deeds at a later stage. The Petitioner referring to the document marked 'R4' contends that

certain applicants who have not submitted the Grama Niladari Certificate or other such

necessary documents for the proof of residence have been given an opportunity to clarify

their position particularly at the interview. The Grama Niladari Certificate is one of the

primary documents required for proof of residence as provided for under Clause 3.6 of 'P2'

(Clause 4.7 of 'R1'). Due to this, the Petitioner asserts that the interview board has

accorded flexibility in favour of the other applicants.

For the reasons given above, I proceed to issue a writ of Mandamus directing and

compelling the interview board, which considered the reapplication dated 19.10.2022

Page 7 of 7

(marked 'P17'), to give proper and due consideration to the reapplication of the Petitioner

and to allocate appropriate marks, if satisfied with the proof of residence, after perusing

additional material to establish the nexus between the applicant and her grandmother.

Based on the above approach taken by me in this judgement, I take the view that this Court

should not consider the other reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner at this stage. I need to

emphasize that I have arrived at the above conclusions based on the special circumstances

of the nature of the reapplication submitted by the Petitioner and on the specific reasons

given by the interview board as reflected in 'P15' and 'P20' which are, to my mind,

exclusive to the Petitioner of the instant Application. Thus, the Respondents' assertions

on the requirement of necessary parties need not be examined at this stage.

The Respondents relying on the judgment of Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka vs.

Messrs. Jafferiee & Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd (2005) 1 Sri. L.R. 89, submits that the Court should

not grant a mandamus to enforce a right not of a legal but purely equitable nature. I take

the view that I have arrived at the above conclusion not on Petitioner's rights of equitable

nature but clearly on the basis that the Petitioner's legal rights have been violated as the

interview board has failed to duly exercise their appellate jurisdiction. Similarly, there is

no requirement for me to assay the Respondents' arguments on the legitimate expectation

of the Petitioner as I have not focused my above findings on that aspect.

Application is partly allowed.
