BACKGROUND OF THE CASE

3. The Accused-Petitioner had made this application to this court to

transfer the High Court Case No. HCV/2923/2019 from the High Court

4

of Vavuniya to any other court, on the grounds that the High Court

Judge specially appointed to hear and determine this case is not

impartial and is biased.

4. The following grounds have been set out in the petition dated 17th July

2023 to support the contention of the Accused-Petitioner to state that

the High Court judge of Vavuniya is biased.

i. The High Court Judge of Vavuniya hearing this case had

allowed the State Counsel to bring Prosecution Witness No.3 to

the chambers without any representation of the Accused-

Petitioner.

ii. Without giving a proper hearing to the Accused-Petitioner, the

High Court Judge presiding over the High Court Case No.

HCV/2923/2019 directed the SSP of the area to investigate

matters pertinent to Prosecution Witness No.3 under the

Witness Protection Act No. 04 of 20151.

iii. The said High Court Judge had cancelled the bail of the

Accused-Petitioner, acting under the Witness Protection Act and

failed to consider the health condition of the Accused-Petitioner.

iv. The said High Court Judge had refused to grant the trial dates

requested by the Accused-Petitioners Counsel and made

controversial comments referred to in paragraph 78 of the

petition dated 17th July 2023.

1Hereinafter referred to as Witness Protection Act.

5

5. On the said grounds, the case was supported by Attorney-at-Law

Thishya Weragoda to grant the reliefs prayed for in the prayer of the

petition.

6. The Deputy Solicitor General Janaka Bandara (hereinafter referred to

as DSG) appeared for the Attorney General and vehemently objected for

the said application totransfer the High Court Case No.

HCV/2923/2019 from the High Court of Vavuniya and submitted that

the High Court Judge M.M.M. Mihal is specially appointed by His

Lordship the Chief Justice to hear and determine the High Court Case

No. HCV/2923/2019. The DSG reiterated that at no stage had the

High Court Judge acted biased against the Accused-Petitioner and/or

acted not impartial.

7. On the said grounds, the DSG had moved to dismiss the Accused-

Petitioners petition in limine.

DISPUTED FACTS

8. In considering the facts related in the petition and on perusal of the

documents and the arguments put forward by the Accused-Petitioner

and the Deputy Solicitor General, the following points need to be

considered to arrive at my conclusion whether the interim orders

and/or notice can be issued to the Respondents.

I. Has the High Court Judge M.M.M. Mihal been appointed by the Chief

Justice to hear and determine the High Court Case No.

HCV/2923/2019 at the Vavuniya High Court?

6

II. Is the said High Court Judge M.M.M. Mihal not impartial and biased

towards Accused-Petitioner?

III. If not, can the Accused-Petitioner maintain this application?

I. Has the High Court Judge M.M.M. Mihal been appointed by the

Chief Justice to hear and determine the High Court Case No.

HCV/2923/2019 at the Vavuniya High Court?

9. On perusal of P4 proceedings dated 21st February 2022, the High Court

Case No. HCV/2923/2019 had been called before the High Court Judge

of Vavuniya M. Ilancheliyan. The indictment had not been served on

the Accused-Petitioner as the State Counsel had raised an objection to

hear the case before High Court Judge Ilancheliyan as the said High

Court Judge was interviewed by the Accused-Petitioner on a TV

program.

10. On that, the said High Court Judge had referred the matter to His

Lordship the Chief Justice to appoint another High Court Judge to hear

and determine the High Court Case No. HCV/2923/2019.

11. Subsequently, High Court Judge M.M.M. Mihal had been appointed by

the Chief Justice to hear and determine the High Court Case No.

HCV/2923/2019. The proceedings had commenced before High Court

Judge M.M.M. Mihal from 8th November 2022. The indictment had

been served and Witness No.1 had been called to give evidence on the

same day.

7

12. On the said circumstance, it is obvious that High Court Judge M.M.M.

Mihal had been specially appointed by His Lordship the Chief Justice to

hear and determine the High Court Case No. HCV/2923/2019.

II. Is the said High Court Judge M.M.M. Mihal not impartial and

biased towards Accused-Petitioner?

13. The Counsel for the Accused-Petitioner argued that the High Court

Judge M.M.M. Mihal is not impartial and is biased against the Accused-

Petitioner when conducting the proceedings. To support that he

brought to the notice of the Court the following facts.

i. The High Court Judge M.M.M. Mihal had entertained the Prosecution

Witness No.3.

ii. Without giving a proper hearing to the Accused-Petitioner, the High

Court Judge presiding over the High Court Case No. HCV/2923/2019

directed the SSP of the area to investigate matters pertinent to

Prosecution Witness No.3 under the Witness Protection Act No.4 of

2015.

iii. The said High Court Judge had cancelled the bail of the Accused-

Petitioner acting under the Witness Protection Act and failed to

consider the health condition of the Accused-Petitioner.

iv. The said High Court Judge had refused to grant the trial dates

requested by the Accused-Petitioners Counsel and made controversial

comments referred to in paragraph 78 of the petition dated 17th July

2023.

8

14. On the aforesaid grounds, the Accused-Petitioners Counsel raised the

argument that the High Court Judge M.M.M. Mihal is biased against

the Accused-Petitioner.

15. Thus, he refused to entertain the Bail Application under the Witness

Protection Act even after considering the Accused-Petitioners health

condition at that time.

16. Furthermore, the said High Court Judge refused to grant the requested

dates by the Counsel for the Accused-Petitioner for the trial.

17. The Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the 1st Respondent

vehemently denied the aforesaid facts and argued other than the

submissions made by the Counsel for the Accused-Petitioner from the

Bar table, there are no documents or proof that the Learned High Court

Judge is biased against the 1st Accused-Petitioner or any other accused.

18. In considering the aforesaid submissions and the documents pertinent

to this action, the High Court Judge M.M.M. Mihal had been appointed

for Case No. HCV/2923/2019 by the Chief Justice to hear and

determine this case expeditiously.

19. It is to be noted that the incident pertinent to High Court Case No.

HCV/2923/2019 had occurred in the year 2011. The present High

Court Judge had commenced the proceeding on 8th November 2022

after 11 years of the incident.

20. On perusal of the proceedings marked and produced as P7 to P17, the

High Court Judge M.M.M. Mihal had taken steps to expeditiously

conclude this case.

9

21. When the evidence was given by the witnesses as per the proceedings

dated 8th November 2022 page 31, Witness No.1, the wife of the

deceased person of the accident pertinent to this action, had specified

that she was taken to the 1st Accused-Petitioners house.

22. Subsequently, Prosecution Witness No.3 had complained to the High

Court Judge in open court, that he was threatened to give evidence in

favour of the Accused-Petitioner.

23. Furthermore, as per the proceeding dated 22nd February 2023, the

State Counsel had made an application to make the Prosecution

Witness No.2 an adverse witness as per the evidence given by him.

24. These facts are part and parcel of the proceedings of Case No.

HCV/2923/2019. The High Court Judge M.M.M. Mihal had made an

order on 23rd February 2023 page 76 of the same days proceedings.

On that, he had specifically given reasons for the grounds on which he

is ordering to investigate the matters pertinent to the interference of the

Prosecution Witnesses.

25. Following the said proceedings, any person will be able to follow the

orders given by the High Court Judge, considering the situation

prevailing before him. On that, I do not see any bias or that the High

Court Judge is not impartial towards the Accused-Petitioner.

26. On the other hand, the Learned High Court Judge as per the

proceedings had taken measures to conclude this case expeditiously.

27. Therefore, granting short dates to conclude this matter is not a ground

for the Accused-Petitioner to raise that the High Court Judge is biased.

10

28. As the said High Court Judge had been specially appointed by the Chief

Justice to hear and determine this action, he had to conclude the case

expeditiously.

29. Both parties have admitted in open court that presently the Accused-

Petitioner is granted bail. Therefore, I do not have to consider the facts

related to the Accused-Petitioners bail condition that was cancelled

during the investigation carried out by the SSP Vavuniya under the

Witness Protection Act.

30. In view of the aforesaid facts and documents, I do not see any merit of

the application made by the Accused-Petitioner, that the High Court

Judge M.M.M. Mihal is not impartial and/or biased pertinent to the

Case No. HCV/2923/2019 in the High Court of Vavuniya.

III. If not, can the Accused-Petitioner maintain this application?

31. Beside these facts the Counsel for the Accused-Petitioner cited the case

Abdul Hasheeb V Mendis Perera and Others2.

In this case it is established that in a transfer application; the tests for

disqualifying bias are (i) the test of real likelihood of bias and (ii) the test

of reasonable suspicion of bias. Although the facts pertinent to that case

are totally different, the test applied in that case will not be applicable in

the instant action as the Accused-Petitioner has not proved or that there

is no iota of evidence that the High Court Judge MMM Mihal is biased or

not impartial.

2 [1991] 1 SLR 243.

11

32. In the case of Sivasubramaniam V Sivasubramaniam3 Justice

Athukorale had specified that;

A party to an action who seeks a transfer of a pending action must

adduce sufficient grounds to satisfy the Court that it is expedient to

make order for its transfer... A transfer would not be ordered on a light

ground.

33. In view of that, in the instant application, the Accused-Petitioner has

failed to show sufficient material that the High Court Judge is biased to

transfer this case to another court.

CONCLUSION

34. In the above circumstances, it is the view of this court that the

Accused-Petitioner at this stage had not proven any material to issue

the interim order prayed for in the prayer (b) and/or to issue notice to

the Respondents. On that we dismiss the petition dated 17th July 2023

subject to payment of tax cost to the 1st Respondent.
