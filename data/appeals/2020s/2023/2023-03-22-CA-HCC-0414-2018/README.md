JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred as the Appellant)

was indicted by the Attorney General under Sections 54(A) (b) and 54(A) (d)

of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act

No. 13 of 1984 for the Trafficking and Possession of 2.51 grams of Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine) on 12th May 2014 in the High Court of Colombo.

Following the trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo had imposed a sentence of life

imprisonment for both counts on 30th of November 2019.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

had given consent for this matter to be argued in his absence due to the

restrictions of the Covid 19 pandemic. During the argument he has been

connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The Appellant has raised following appeal grounds in this case.

1. Learned trial Judge erred to apply the correct legal principles when

rejecting the defence evidence given on oath which creates a

reasonable doubt.

2. The learned Trial Judge erroneously determined the place of arrest and

convicted the Appellant although the prosecution had failed to prove

the place of arrest beyond reasonable doubt.

3 | P a g e

Facts of the case.

The Appellant was a labourer who manually handles loads in the Pettah

Market. His permanent address is No.95/17, Avissawella Road,

Wellampitiya.

PW1/IP Ranasinghe who was attached to Colombo Crime Division (CCD) had

received information from a reliable informant that a person named Ravindra

Raj from Majeed Place, Orugodawatta will be engaging in trafficking drugs in

the Orugodawatta area on 11/05/2014. The informant asked the witness to

be present under the Orugodawatta overhead bridge for the raid. The

informant had told the witness that Ravindra Raj was wearing a green

coloured shirt and a red coloured pair of short and further informed that he

would give a call once the said person departs from his house. He had

received this information at 10:33 hours and had reported the same to his

superior officer and arranged the raid. Having selected nine other officers,

they had left the CCD around 10:40 hours after completing all formalities.

The team had reached the place as per the information at about 11.00 hours.

At that time, another police officer also had joined them. At about 11.05

hours the informant had called the witness and asked them to come to the

Majeed Road quickly. When they were proceeding to Majeed Road, close to

the temple on the Majeed Road, they had noticed a person as described by

the informant walking briskly. The vehicle in which the team went for the

raid stopped close to the person and surrounded him quickly. When he was

checked a small cellophane bag was recovered from the right-side of his

shorts pocket. When the police team checked the parcel, they found some

substance which reacted for Heroin (Diacetylmorphine). Hence, he was

arrested along with the parcel. According to this witness, the Appellants

address is No.100/153, Majeed Place, Avissawella Road, Orugodawatta.

Thereafter, the team had gone to the Appellants house which was situated

at the end of Majeed Place. Although the team had checked his house,

nothing found in his house. At that time, the Appellants wife, a small child

4 | P a g e

and another male were in the Appellants house. Thereafter, the team had

gone to Dadigama Jewellers situated on Baseline Road to weigh the

substance. The weight of the substance was observed to be 20.50 grams and

the production was sealed in front of the Appellant. Thereafter, the team had

come to the CCD at about 12.50 hours. After sealing, the production was

handed over to PW11/PC 47316 Jansz of the CCD under production

No.107/2014.

PW2, PS 10757 Fonseka who was a member of the raiding team, was called

to corroborate the evidence given by PW1.

After closing the case for the prosecution, as the evidence led by the

prosecution warranted the presence of a case to be answered by the

Appellant, the learned High Court Judge called for the defence. The Appellant

gave evidence under oaths and called his wife in support of his case.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

In Girija Prasad (dead) by LRs. V. State of M.P., AIR [2007] SCW 5589

(2007) 7 SCC 625, it was observed:

It is well-settled that credibility of witness has to be tested on the

touchstone of truthfulness and trustworthiness. It is quite possible that

in a given case, a Court of Law may not base conviction solely on the

evidence of Complainant or a Police Official but it is not the law that

police witnesses should not be relied upon and their evidence cannot be

accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars by other

5 | P a g e

independent evidence. The presumption that every person acts honestly

applies as much in favour of a Police Official as any other person. No

infirmity attaches to the testimony of Police Officials merely because

they belong to Police Force. There is no rule of law which lays down that

no conviction can be recorded on the testimony of Police Officials even if

such evidence is otherwise reliable and trustworthy. The rule of

prudence may require more careful scrutiny of their evidence. But, if the

Court is convinced that what was stated by a witness has a ring of

truth, conviction can be based on such evidence.

In Vadivelu Thevar v. State of Madras AIR 1957 SC 614 it was observed on

Page 619, as under: -

Hence, in our opinion, it is a sound and well- established rule of law

that the court is concerned with the quality and not with the quantity of

the evidence necessary for, proving or disproving a fact.

I have decided to consider the both appeal grounds together in this case.

In an appeal it is the profound duty of the Appellate Court to consider all the

evidence presented by both parties in the trial. If the evidence presented by

the prosecution is cogent and passes all the tests, the court has no difficulty

whatsoever to act on the same and affirm the conviction of the Appellant.

But, if the prosecution fails to adduce cogent and consistent evidence, then

the court has no option but to award the benefit of the doubt to the Appellant.

In Lal Mandi v. State of West Bengal (1995) 3 SCC 603, the Court opined

that:

In an appeal against conviction, the Appellate Court has the duty to

itself appreciate the evidence on the record and if two views are possible

6 | P a g e

on the appraisal of the evidence, the benefit of reasonable doubt has to

be given to an accused.

The Learned Counsel strenuously argued that the inadmissible

confessionary items of evidence had been allowed to creep into the

proceedings thereby prejudicing the mind of the Trial Judge.

In terms Section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance, confessions made to a police

officer is irrelevant and inadmissible. Hence, if an accused has made a

confessionary statement in the course of the police investigations and where

such statement is recorded under Section 110 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, there is an absolute restriction to use such confession as

evidence at the trial.

Section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance states:

25(1) No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a

person accused of any offence.

In R v. Martin Singho 66 NLR 391 the court held that:

Any evidence, which, if accepted, would lead to the inference that the

accused made a confession to a police officer is inadmissible.

Further, in Queen v. Sumanatissa Thero (1962) 61 CLW 97 it was held

that:

It is illegal to use statements made by an accused in the course of an

investigation for any purposes other than those provided in section

122(3) [corresponding section to the current section 110(3)] and such a

statement would only become relevant for the purpose of impeaching a

credit of the witness.

In this case, a confessionary statement of the Appellant was led in the trial

by the prosecution. The Appellant had admitted that a person called Dileepa

7 | P a g e

is the supplier of Heroin to him. The relevant portions of the evidence of PW1

are re-produced below:

The Learned High Court Judge, before he could analyse the entire evidence

presented by both parties, relying on the evidence given by the prosecution

witnesses concluded at page 29 of the judgment that the arrest and recovery

of Heroin from the Appellant could be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.

The relevant portion is re-produced below:

(Page 217 of the brief.)

This approach of the Learned High Court Judge clearly demonstrates that

he had been greatly influenced by the confessionary statement which had

creeped into the court proceedings. The prosecution should not have led

evidence which contained confessionary statement of the Appellant. This

leads to a denial of a fair trial.

In this case a serious mistake done by the Learned High Court Judge has

caused great prejudice to the Appellant. Further, the Appellant for his

defence had given evidence under oath and called his wife as a defence

witness. But instead of analysing the evidence of the defence, the Learned

High Court Judge had analysed the law pertaining to the acceptance or

rejection of the dock statement of an accused in the judgment. The relevant

portion of the judgment is re-produced below:

In evaluating a dock statement, the Trial Judge must consider the following

principles:

1) If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon.

2) If the dock statement created a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case the

defence must succeed

Dock Statement of one accused person should not be used against the other persons.

This is a very serious mistake done by the Learned High Court Judge. This

shows that the Learned High Court Judge neither considered the evidence

properly nor appreciated the difference between the dock statement and the

10 | P a g e

evidence given from witness box under oath by an accused. As this is serious

matter it certainly vitiates the conviction of the Appellant.

In criminal cases the burden always rests upon the shoulder of the

prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The Appellant is not

required to prove his innocence but if he decides to plead a general or special

exception of the Penal Code, then the Appellant has a duty of establishing

that the case of the Appellant comes within such exceptions. This burden is

imposed under Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance.

In H.M. Mahinda Herath v. The Attorney General CA/21/2003 in

Appellate Court Judgments (Unreported) 2005 at page 35-39 the court held

that:

Where it was held that in a criminal case burden is always on the

prosecution to prove the charge levelled against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt. The trial judge must always bear in mind that the

accused is presumed to be innocent until the charge against the accused

is proved beyond reasonable grounds.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at page 225 of the brief stated

as follows:

meKs,a, iska fhdod we;s igyka ish,a,u wi;H igyka njg fhdackd lr we;s kuq;a"

ta nj Tmamq lsrSug ;a;sh fjkqfjka lsis idlaIslrefjla leojd fkdue;'

Referring to the above-mentioned portion of the judgment, the Learned

Counsel for the Appellant claims that the learned High Court Judge has

placed an additional burden on the Appellant to prove his innocence, which

is contrary to the standard of proof in criminal cases. He further submits

that this is a clear misdirection which certainly vitiates the conviction of the

Appellant.

The wording of the above cited portion of the judgment very clearly

demonstrates, that the learned High Court Judge had reversed the burden

11 | P a g e

of proof on the Appellant which is not in accordance with the basic rules of

criminal prosecution.

As stated above, PW1 had arrested the Appellant at Majeed Road on the date

of the incident. Thereafter he had been taken to his home for further

investigation. The indictment is presented considering this sequence of

events by the prosecution.

The Learned High Court Judge highlighting the evidence given by the

Appellant convicted him on the basis that the subject matter was recovered

from the three-wheeler. This completely destroys the prosecutions version.

This is another serious lapse that had occurred in this case. The relevant

portion is re-produced below:

(Pages 225-226 of the brief.)

In Adversarial Judicial System criminal cases are contested between two

opposing sides, which ensures that evidence and legal arguments will be

fairly presented to the court by both sides. The Judge, however, remains

neutral, presiding as an impartial mediator or referee between the

prosecution representing the people and the defence representing the

defendant. A Judges profound duty is to judge whether the evidence is

credible and the witnesses are telling the truth or not. If the evidence

presented by the defence create a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case,

the judge should not hesitate to award the benefit to the defence, as the

judges decisions can dramatically affect peoples lives.

Considering the grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellant, the learned

Trial Judge should not have rejected the defence evidence in this case as I

consider the defence evidence is more than sufficient to create a reasonable

doubt in the prosecution case. As the evidence presented by the Appellant

12 | P a g e

creates a reasonable doubt over the prosecution case, I set aside the

conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge of

Colombo dated 30/11/2018 on the Appellant. Therefore, The Appellant is

acquitted from both charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Colombo along with the original case record.
