This is an appeal preferred by the applicant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the appellant) seeking to challenge the order dated 13-07-2021

pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the

Eastern Province Holden in Ampara in Case No. HC/AMP/REV/513/2020.

By the impugned order, the learned High Court Judge affirmed the order dated

23-01-2020 made by the learned Magistrate of Dehiaththakandiya in

Magistrates Court of Dehiaththakandiya Case No. 21175, where the vehicle

owned by the appellant was confiscated.

The facts relevant to the order made by the learned Magistrate can be

summarized in the following manner.

Three accused persons were charged before the learned Magistrate of

Dehiaththakandiya by the Range Forest Officer of Mahaoya for transporting 5

logs of Kumbuk timber valued at Rs. 59372/= in the vehicle number bearing EP

DAB-1081, which is a TATA Super Ace Model lorry, and thereby committing an

offence in terms of the Forest Ordinance as amended.

When the accused were charged before the Magistrates Court, they have pleaded

guilty to the charge and had been sentenced. Thereafter, the learned Magistrate

of Dehiaththakandiya has called upon the registered owner of the vehicle who is

the appellant in this matter to show cause as to why the said vehicle should not

be forfeited to the State in terms of section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance as

amended by Forest (Amendment) Act No 65 of 2009.

At the inquiry held in that regard, the appellant has given evidence and has

admitted that the driver of the vehicle was his own son. He has stated that he is

a retired teacher and he purchased this lorry in the year 2015 and was well

aware that the vehicle cannot be used for illegal purposes.

Page 5 of 13

It had been his evidence that he engaged his own son who is living with him in

his house as the driver of the vehicle and he gave clear instructions to him not

to use the vehicle for any illegal purposes and trusted him in that regard.

According to him, the vehicle was used for hiring purposes and the son used to

take the vehicle to the town and engage in hiring the vehicle. He has stated that

on some days, the son would take his vehicle to Colombo and bring fruits and

King Coconut to be sold in the market and on such days, he used to come home

on the following day. He has claimed that he was in the habit of communicating

with his son over the phone while the vehicle was away and inquire about the

work the son is doing.

On 15-02-2018, his son has not returned home for the day, and his attempts to

contact him over the phone has failed. On the following day, he has gone to the

place where his son parks his vehicle for hiring purposes, and upon inquiry, he

has been informed by another driver that he saw his vehicle at the Padiyathalawa

police station. When he went there, he has been informed by the police that his

son and two other persons were taken to the Magistrates Court of

Dehiaththakandiya. It had been his position that since he was not in good health,

he could not go to the Court on that day. His son has returned from the Court

in the night, and when inquired from his son why he did such a thing despite

his instructions, he has not answered.

Subsequently, the vehicle had been returned to the appellant on a bond and he

has maintained the position at the inquiry that he has given due instructions to

his son not to engage in illegal activities and he was unaware of the actions by

his son on that day. On that basis, he has pleaded with the Court to release the

vehicle.

Under cross-examination, he has stated that his son had no previous convictions

and had maintained the position that he used to give regular instructions to his

son not to engage in illegal activities.

Page 6 of 13

It needs to be noted that other than that, the evidence of the appellant had not

been challenged by the prosecution on material points.

After the conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Magistrate by her order dated 23-

01-2020 had determined that the appellant in his evidence has failed to

adequately explain how this offence was committed by his son and two others

and had determined that although he was the registered owner of the vehicle, he

had no knowledge of the offence.

For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the relevant portion of the order which

is at page 4 (page 125 of the appeal brief) of the said order.

.

.

.

.

The learned Magistrate has considered that a registered owner cannot always

travel in a vehicle in practical terms, but the appellant has failed to establish

before the Court the steps he took to prevent the vehicle being used for an offence

of this nature. It has also been concluded that the appellant has only given

instructions to his son to use the vehicle carefully and nothing else. Accordingly,

it has been determined that the registered owner has failed to satisfy the Court

that he has taken all precautions to prevent the offence being committed and

therefore the vehicle should stand confiscated to the State.

When this matter was considered before the learned High Court Judge of the

Provincial High Court of the Eastern Province Holden in Ampara, it is clear from

the order pronounced on 13-07-2021, that the learned High Court Judge has

considered the appellants stand in relation to the incident and the objections

raised by the respondents to consider whether there are reasons to interfere into

Page 7 of 13

the order pronounced by the learned Magistrate of Dehiaththakandiya under

exceptional circumstances.

The learned High Court Judge has considered the relevant provisions in the

Forest Ordinance, which attracts a confiscation of a vehicle that transports

prohibited timber without a permit.

The learned High Court Judge has also considered the judgement pronounced

on 12-06-2020 by this Court in the Case No. CA/PHC/API/112/2018 and had

determined that before confiscating a vehicle for an office of this nature, the

knowledge in that regard should be with the registered owner and if a registered

owner kept quite knowing very well about an offence being committed, such an

act can be interpreted as the registered owner having the knowledge in that

regard.

It has been correctly determined that in an inquiry of this nature, the facts and

the circumstances unique to each matter should be considered. It has been

determined that the driver of the vehicle had been the appellants own son and

he and the driver lived in the same house where the vehicle was kept parked for

the night.

The paragraph 12 of the order of the learned High Court Judge reads as follows;

12.

.

.

.

.

Although I am unable to see the relevancy of the above comment in relation to

the inquiry held in this matter, it appears that the learned High Court Judge has

Page 8 of 13

recognized that the appellant is a retired teacher who is suffering from ailments

and he has a right to engage his vehicle for the purposes of earning a living.

In paragraph 14 and 15 the learned High Court Judge has commented in the

following manner.

14.

.

.

15.

.

.

The learned High Court Judge has determined that there is no basis to conclude

that the learned Magistrate of Dehiaththakandiya was wrong in her

determination to confiscate the vehicle and had determined that the appellant

has failed to establish exceptional circumstances for the Court to set aside the

order of the learned Magistrate. The revision application has been dismissed on

the said basis.

At the hearing of this appeal, it was the contention of the learned Counsel for

the appellant that the learned Magistrate has correctly held that the appellant

had no knowledge of the offence committed by his son. It was his position that

it was a misdirection to have held that the appellant failed to establish that he

took all the precautions to prevent the offence. He submitted that what

precautions a registered owner could have taken should be fact sensitive, where

there cannot be a strict yardstick in that regard.

Commenting on the order made by the learned High Court Judge, it was the

position of the learned Counsel that the learned High Court Judge too had

Page 9 of 13

determined that the appellant had no knowledge of the offence and had

determined that confiscation of a vehicle should be decided on facts applicable

to each case. However, he pointed out that at paragraph 15 of the order, the

learned High Court Judge, may be due to a mistake of facts, has commented

that the offence committed was the transporting of sand. It was further stressed

that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected when it was determined that

he has no basis to interfere with the order made by the learned Magistrate in

confiscating the vehicle.

It was the view of the learned State Counsel who represented the respondent-

respondent that the evidence by the registered owner was clear that he has only

given general instructions to his son informing him that he should not commit

illegal acts.

The learned State Counsel justified the reasoning given by the learned Magistrate

as well as the learned High Court Judge on the basis that the registered owner

has failed to establish before the Court that he has taken all precautions to

prevent the offence being committed in terms of the Forest Ordinance and moved

for the dismissal of the appeal.

It is clear from the facts adduced before this Court that the son of the appellant

was the driver of the vehicle when the detection was made. At the time of the

detection, two other persons had accompanied him and the Range Forest Officer

who conducted the raid has detected 5 logs of Kumbuk timber inside the lorry

for which the accused have pleaded guilty before the Magistrates Court of

Dehiaththakandiya.

As considered before, the learned Magistrate of Dehiaththakandiya has decided

to hold an inquiry as provided for in the proviso of section 40 (1) of the Forest

Ordinance as amended by Forest (Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009 which reads

thus;

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicle,

implements, and machines used in the commission of such offence,

Page 10 of 13

is a third party, no order of confiscation shall be made if such owner

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicle, implements,

cattle and machines as the case may be, for the commission of the

offence.

It is settled law that the mode of proof in an inquiry of this nature is on the

balance of probability. It is also settled law that there is no strict requirement of

how many witnesses should be called to establish a fact before a Court of law.

Even if only a single witness has given evidence, as in the case under appeal, if

it can be determined that such evidence is cogent and trustworthy, a Court can

act upon even on a single witnesses testimony.

When it comes to the matters relevant to this appeal, if it can be determined that

the registered owner was unaware of the offence being committed and he has

taken due precautions to prevent an offence being committed, that fact needs to

be considered in favour of the registered owner of the vehicle who is the appellant

in this instance.

There can be no argument that the words used in the proviso of section 40 (1) of

the Forest Ordinance as amended is if such owner proves to the satisfaction of

the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of ..

It is clear from the earlier decisions of our Superior Courts, like in the case of

Mary Matilda Silva Vs. Inspector of Police Habarana (CA PHC 86/97 decided

on 08-07-2010) the view expressed was that the relevant section should be given

a strict interpretation and any claimant of a vehicle should prove that all

precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle being used in the crime was taken

by him.

However, it needs to be noted that what is meant by all precautions stated in the

section had not been given an interpretation in the statute itself.

Page 11 of 13

I find that our Superior Courts had lately moved away from the strict

interpretation rule in this regard and had thought it fit to interpret the relevant

words in relation to the facts applicable to each case considering the said facts

independently in relation to each case under consideration before the Court.

In the case of Sadi Banda Vs. Officer-in-Charge of Norten Bridge Police

Station (2014) 1 SLR 33, Malani Gunaratne, J. clearly deviated from the strict

interpretation of the above words with clear reasoning and observed as follows.

I have to admit that nowhere in the said inquiry proceedings there is

evidence that the appellant had taken all precautions to prevent the

commission of the offence. However, at the inquiry the appellant had given

evidence and stated he purchased the lorry on 26-02-2000 and gave it to

his son to transport tea leaves. Further stated that he had no knowledge

about the transporting of timber. The learned Magistrate in his order has

accepted the fact that the appellant did not have any knowledge about the

transporting of timber without a permit.

Nevertheless, the learned Magistrate had confiscated the lorry. I am of the

view before making the order of confiscation the learned Magistrate should

have taken into consideration, value of the timber transported, no

allegations prior to this incident that the lorry had been used for any illegal

purpose, that the appellant and all the accused are habitual offenders in

this nature and no previous convictions, and the acceptance of the fact that

the appellant did not have any knowledge about the transporting of timber

without a permit. On these facts, the Court is of the view that the confiscation

of the lorry is not justifiable.

In the instant matter, the learned Magistrate as well as the learned High Court

Judge has correctly determined that given the facts and the circumstances of

the appellant, who is the registered owner of the vehicle had no knowledge of the

offence being committed on that particular day.

Page 12 of 13

It is my considered view that fact needs to be considered together with the other

evidence by the appellant at the inquiry to come to a finding whether the

appellant has taken due precautions in relation to this vehicle to prevent an

offence being committed.

I am of the view that such possible precautions had to be considered in relation

to the other facts relevant to each individual case and not on a common basis of

taking all possible precautions.

In the matter under consideration, the vehicle involved in this crime is a TATA

Super Ace Model lorry commonly known as a Demo Batta lorry, which is not a

vehicle that has the capacity to transport timber on a regular basis, as it is a

vehicle not made for carrying heavy loads. According to the evidence of the

appellant, the vehicle had been used primarily for hiring purposes and to

transport fruits and other material like King Coconut and on the days where the

vehicle goes out of the town, it used to return on the following day.

The appellant is a retired teacher and a sickly person who has trusted his son

who was living with him at his house to follow his instructions. In his evidence,

he had admitted that he knew that the vehicle should not be used for any illegal

activities and it was his position that he instructed his son in that regard. It is

also clear that the appellant has purchased this lorry with the intention of

earning some additional money other than his pension.

It is hard to believe under the circumstances that the appellant being the

registered owner would encourage his son to engage in illegal activities or had

impliedly encouraged his son to do illegal activities or was lethargic in that regard

as observed by the learned High Court Judge when his application filed in

revision challenging the order of the learned Magistrate of Dehiaththakandiya

was dismissed.

I am of the view that there were ample reasons for the learned High Court Judge

to allow the application in revision preffered by the appellant under exceptional

circumstances as the confiscation of the lorry for the offence committed by the

Page 13 of 13

accused charged before the Magistrates Court of Dehiaththakandiya cannot be

justified.

Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 23-01-2020 by the learned Magistrate of

Dehiaththakandiya and the order dated 13-07-2021 by the learned High Court

Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Eastern Province Holden in Ampara as

both the orders cannot be allowed to stand.

I order the release of the vehicle number EP DAB-1081 to the appellant who is

the registered owner of the vehicle.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the

Magistrates Court of Dehiaththakandiya for necessary implementation of this

judgement and to the High Court of Ampara for information.

The appeal is allowed.
