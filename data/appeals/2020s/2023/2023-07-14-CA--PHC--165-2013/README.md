Judgement

This is an appeal emanating from the Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden

in Kandy.

The officer-in-charge of the Miscellaneous Complaints Branch of the Police Station of

Gampola initiated proceedings on 16.01.2014 in the Magistrates Court of Gampola by filing

an information under section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Court Procedure Act. No 44 of 1979.

According to the said information the 1st Respondent had lodged a complaint on 01.01.2014

that the 2nd Respondent had been constructing a building obstructing the access road to a

shop owned by the 1st Respondent at no 04/1, Station Road, Gampola. As the Parties had not

arrived at a settlement, there was a likelihood of breach of peace being threatened between

them, which led the Police to initiate proceedings in the Magistrate court of Gampola.

Consequently, the 3rd Respondent intervened in the said case no 30/01/2014.

After filing of Affidavits, counter affidavits and the documents the learned Magistrate who

was acting as a Primary Court Judge allowed Parties to file Written Submissions.

On 17.07.2014 the learned Magistrate delivered the order in favour of the 1st Respondent

determining that the 1st Respondent is entitled to use a 7 feet wide road and accordingly

ordered that all obstructions except for the concrete columns in the impugned strip of land

to be removed.

The 2nd and 3rd Respondents being aggrieved by the said order invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden at Kandy, seeking to

revise or set aside the said order of the learned Magistrate.

The learned High Court Judge having inquired the matter and held against the 2nd and 3rd

Respondent-Petitioners on the premise that the 2nd and 3rd Respondent-Petitioners had not

substantiated that there is any miscarriage of justice or any error of law or fact warranting

the revision of the said order by the learned Magistrate.

The 2nd Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant being aggrieved by the said order of the learned

High Court Judge had preferred this appeal seeking relief prayed in the prayer to the Petition

of Appeal.

According to the material placed before the Magistrate Court, it appears that the dispute is

in respect of the access roadway to the 1st Respondent-Respondent-Appellant [hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the 1st Respondent] shop premises depicted in plan bearing no

12996 prepared by K.M.H. Navaratne Licensed Surveyor.

The position of the 1st Respondent is that the width of the said access-road was 7 feet.

Contrary to this, Appellant and the 3rd Respondent-Respondent-Respondent contended that

it was only 4 feet wide.

It was brought to the notice of Court that the 1st Respondent had instituted action in the

District Court of Gampola against the Appellant and two others regarding the same issue.

The learned District Judge who was functioning as the Primary Court judge as well as the

Magistrate, had issued an interim injunction on 04.06.2014 against the Appellant and one

Sampath Jagoda restraining them from effecting any construction whatsoever that would

5 of 7

obstruct the access-road in dispute. On the same day the learned District Judge made an

order adding the 3rd Respondent-Respondent-Respondent as a party to the said District Court

action.

As such, the learned Magistrate had come to the conclusion that although concreted segment

of the road is 4 feet wide, before the construction commenced the Respondent had been using

a 7 feet wide road way.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, the Appellant had filed a revision

application in the Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy.

The learned High Court Judge has refused the revision application of the Appellant on the

ground that the order of the Primary Court Judge does not disclose any grounds of failure of

justice or any error of law or fact warranting the revision of the same.

Subsequently the Appellant has preferred this appeal to the Court of Appeal against the order

of the learned Provincial High Court Judge dated 05.01.2017.

The Appellant contended that the indenture of lease being no 4058 [1R1] and plan bearing

12998 [1R2] do not indicate that Respondent is entitled to a common right to use a 7 feet

wide access road to the shop premises. It is to be observed that, the said 1R1 and 1R2 do not

indicate the width of the roadway as 4 feet wide.

It is imperative to note that the Appellant does not deny the access road to the Respondents

shop premises. Nevertheless, denies the width of the road. Therefore, the only question to be

determined by this Court is whether the Respondent has been using a 4 feet wide roadway

or a 7 feet wide road way.

In this instance court draws the attention to the case of Nandawathie and Another Vs

Mahindasena [2009] S.L.R. 218 cited by the learned counsel for the Respondent where it

was held that,

(1) When an order of a Primary Court Judge is challenged by way of revision in the

High Court the High Court can examine only the legality of that order and not the

corrections of that order.

(2) On appeal to the Court of Appeal the Court of Appeal should not under the guise

of the appeal attempt to re-hear or re-evaluate the evidence led and decide on the

facts which are entirely and exclusively falling within the domain of the jurisdiction

of the Primary Court.

6 of 7

(3) Orders given by the Primary Court should be executed or implemented

expeditiously as possible without undue delay unless there is a stay order currently in

operation there should be no automatic stay of proceedings for whatever reason

otherwise that would negate and frustrate the very purpose for which that provisions

were enacted.

Ranjith Silva J in the above case has held that,

"I am of the opinion that this particular right of appeal in the circumstances should

not be taken as an appeal in the true sense but in fact an application to examine the

correctness, legality or the propriety of the order made by the High Court Judge in

the exercise of revisionary powers. The Court of Appeal should not under the guise of

an appeal attempt to rehear or re-evaluate the evidence led in the main case."

As such, it is not the duty of this court to re-hear and re-evaluate the evidence in the instant

case. The duty of the Court of Appeal is to consider whether the learned Provincial High

Court Judge had failed to identify the existence or lack thereof of exceptional circumstances

which would allow him to exercise revisionary jurisdiction. This should be done within the

ambit of the material placed before the learned Magistrate court by considering whether

there is an error in the application of the law.

It is observable in light of the evidence placed before the learned Magistrate, there was no

building at the construction site prior to Appellant commencing construction work and when

he started construction only the access road got obstructed.

According to the 1st Respondent, he has been using a 10 feet wide access road. Therefore, it

is reasonable to presume that the Respondent had been using a 7 feet wide road way to access

his shop premises as done by the learned Magistrate court after a careful evaluation of the

facts.

It should also be noted that under section 69 of the Primary Court Procedure Act [reproduced

below], duty of the Primary Court is to determine whether a person is entitled to a right which

is the subject of the dispute. In the instant case, there is no dispute as to the existence of the

right to the access roadway of the Respondent. Moreover, It is not the duty of the learned

Primary Court judge to conduct a protracted inquiry into the subject matter of the dispute in

detail. It is sufficient for a primary court judge to consider the evidence placed before him

and reach a conclusion on the facts before him.

7 of 7

Section 69: (1) Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or any part of a

land, other than the right to possession of such land or part thereof, the Judge of the

Primary Court shall determine as to who is entitled to the right which is the subject

of the dispute and make an order under subsection (2).

As such, the learned Magistrate has analysed and evaluated the evidence placed before him

and has come to the correct findings of fact and law and decided that the Respondent is

entitled to use a 7 feet wide roadway.

Hence, the learned High Court Judge held that since there is no miscarriage of justice or any

injustice caused to the Appellant, there is no reason to revise or set aside the impugned order

of the learned Magistrate.

Therefore, we see no reason for us to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate dated

17.07.2014 and the order dated 05.01.2017 by the learned High Court Judge. Hence this

appeal stands dismissed.

The Appeal is dismissed without costs.
