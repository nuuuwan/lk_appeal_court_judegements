RESPONDENTS

Mayadunne Corea J

The facts of the case briefly are as follows. The Petitioner who is the trustee of Rajamaha Viharaya

Alawwa submits to this Court that the said Rajmaha Viharaya has been offered a Gamwara by

Before: S.U.B. Karaliyadda J. Mayadunne Corea J Counsel: Gamini Hettiarachchi for the Petitioner.

Supported on: 15.09.2023 Decided on: 29.11.2023

King Kirithi Sri Rajasinghe to the extent of 832 acres of land. Accordingly, the Petitioner submits

that the said land belongs to the temple. However, it is alleged that various parties have illegally

occupied the said land and the Petitioner submits that after several discussions held with the

President, Minister, the Department of Buddhist Affair, the Department of Land Settlement, the

Attorney General, and the Divisional Secretariate, it is alleged that the parties had agreed to survey

the said land and confirm the boundaries and the title.

To demonstrate the title to the land, the Petitioner has tendered a copy of the Sannasa and the

title Plan Number 95204 and the final village plan 455 marked as (P10, P11). The Petitioner further

submits that when an attempt was made to survey the land to settle the lands of the temple, the

villagers of the area protested and the survey had to be stopped. It was also submitted that several

illegal squatters are now possessing the temple land. The Petitioner has filed a case bearing number

7913/L in the District Courts of Kurunegala. It was brought to the attention of this Court, that the

said District Court case was concluded in favour of the Petitioner.

Thereafter, the Petitioner has requested the Department of Land Settlement to do the survey and

settle the temple land. However, it is submitted that the 6th Respondent had informed him that the

Surveys Department had communicated and informed the said Respondent to get the survey of the

temple land done by a private surveyor (P19). The said letter states as follows;

////2/1/32 2023.04.03

.

42/1/6/ALW/2023 2023.04.28

. (

.)

The Petitioner having obtained the relief from the District Court, alleges that the 3rd to 5th

Respondents' refusal to survey the said land is an illegal omission of their statutory duties. Hence

this Writ Application for a Writ of Mandamus.

At this stage, this Court will consider the judgment that was submitted to this Court by the

Petitioner.

The judgment of the District Court.

As per the said judgment that was highlighted by the Petitioner, the Court has come to the

conclusion that the title to the land is vested with the temple. It also says that as per P17, the Land

Settlement Department has settled the land containing 832 Acres in favour of the temple. The said

judgment also states that the Superintendent of Surveys has identified the property as per Plan

Number 9204 and has demarcated the boundaries. As per the submission of the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner, the Land Settlement Department has settled the land in favour of the Petitioner

and also the District Court has come to the conclusion pertaining to the boundaries of the said land.

The Petitioner has reproduced the part of the judgment in para 19 of the petition. The relevant part

of the said judgment states as follows;

The statutory duty of the Respondents.

The Petitioner submits that the 3rd,4th, and 5th Respondents have failed to perform the statutory

duty cast on them to survey the temple land. In view of the said submission, in order to obtain the

relief he seeks, it is incumbent for him to demonstrate that there is a statutory duty cast on the

3rd,4th, and 5th Respondents towards him which the said Respondents have failed to perform.

This Court specifically asked from the learned Counsel for the Petitioner to demonstrate to the

Court the provision he relies on which a statutory duty is cast on the Survey General to survey a

land that has been settled in favour of the temple. The learned Counsel failed to draw our attention

to such a provision.

It is also pertinent to note that the Petitioner has failed to submit to this Court as to whether the

said land falls within the area where the Title Registration Act is enforced and whether a cadastral

survey should have been conducted. Accordingly, as the Petitioner has failed to submit to this

Court the statutory duty that the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Respondents have failed to perform, the Petitioner

has failed to establish the alleged statutory duty which he seeks to enforce through this Application.

Is there a refusal to survey the land?

The learned Counsel submitted to this Court that by P18, the Survey General had refused to carry

out the survey request of the Divisional Secretary. Paragraph 26 of the Petition too identifies the

letter as P18. Document P18 is a letter sent by the Divisional Secretary to the Senior

Superintendent of Surveys Kurunegala who has requested to get a survey done pertaining to survey

request number 2023/09. The said letter does not carry any refusal. The Survey General has replied

to P18 by P20 whereby he has informed the Divisional Secretary that the survey of this particular

land must be carried out by a registered licensed surveyor. The said letter explains why the Survey

General has stated so. The letter reads as follows,

7

( ) 2023.04.24

. (emphasized by me)

Subsequently, the Divisional Secretary has communicated the contents of this letter to the

Petitioner by P19.

This Court also finds that by letter marked P20, the Senior Superintendent of Surveys refers to

another letter by the Provincial Survey General dated 24.04.2023. It appears the contents of P20

is a mere communication of the decision of the Provincial Survey General to the Superintendent

of Surveys Kurnegala which he in turn has communicated to the Divisional Secretary who was

responsible for communicating the same to the Petitioner. However, the said letter of the Provincial

Survey General is not before this Court.

This Court is privy only to P20 which the Petitioner relies on to say that the Survey Department

has failed to carry out its duty. On a plain reading of P20, we are unable to agree with the

submissions of the learned Counsel as there is no refusal depicted in the said letter. It is trite law

that in the absence of refusal, a Writ of Mandamus will not lie.

In Ratnayake and Others v C.D Perera and others (1982) 2 SLR 451 at 456, it was held, that

The general rule of mandamus is that its function is to compel a public authority to do its duty.

The essence of mandamus is that it is a command issued by the Superior Court for the

performance of public legal duty. Where officials have a public duty to perform and have

refused to perform, mandamus will lie to secure the performance of the public duty, in the

performance of which the applicant has a sufficient legal interest.

In S.I. Syndicate V Union of India AIR 1975 Sc 460, the Supreme Court has adopted the

following statement of law in this regard; As a general rule the order will not be granted unless

the party complained of has known what it was he was required to do so that he had the means of

considering whether or not he should comply and it must be shown by evidence that there was a

8

distinct demand of that which the party seeking the mandamus desires to enforce and that that

demand was met by a refusal (emphasized by me)

It was also held in Rasammah & another vs A.P.B. Manmperi 65 NLR V 77 at page 331

Walpita, J quoting S.A.de Smith held, The general rule is that the applicant before moving

for the order, must have addressed a distinct and specific demand or request to the

Respondent that he perform the duty imposed upon him, and the Respondent must have

unequivocally manifested his refusal to comply.

We also observe that the Petitioner has requested a Writ of Mandamus to direct the 3rd to the 5th

Respondents to do a survey of the land belonging to the Rajamaha Viharaya. This Court also

observes that in P20, the Senior Superintendent of Surveys of the Districts Surveys office

Kurunegala, has informed the Divisional Sectary to obtain the services of a registered licensed

Surveyor to survey the land. However, if the said survey has not been conducted, the Petitioner

has failed to plead any relief against the person who was told to get the survey conducted. We

find that there is no relief prayed against the Divisional Secretary.

Alternate remedy

It is also observed that as per the District Court case, the Petitioner has been granted title to the

said land (P15). However, the Petitioner has failed to annex the plaint that corresponds to the

judgment. In the absence of the plaint, this Court is unable to ascertain the parties to the said

District Court case nor the reliefs that have been prayed.

Furthermore, the Petitioner has failed to submit to this Court whether he has taken any steps

pursuant to the said District Court case to secure his rights as per the judgement. If the Petitioner

has failed to obtain possession of the land as per the judgment, it is up to the Petitioner to take the

necessary steps to execute the judgment and secure his boundaries and title. We observe that when

there is an alternative remedy available to the Petitioner, instead of pursuing the said remedy, he

9

has decided to invoke the Writ jurisdiction of this Court. It is trite law that the Writ Court is

reluctant to act where there is an alternative remedy.

The nature of the Writ of Mandamus was clearly articulated in the case of Thajudeen Vs. Sri

Lanka Tea Board and Another (1981) 2 Sri LR 471. In Thajudeen, Justice Ranasinghe, quoting

de. Smiths Judicial Review of Administrative Action (4th ed) 540, 561 stated that, Mandamus

is "pre-eminently a discretionary remedy;" and Mandamus has always been awarded as an

extraordinary, residuary and suppletory remedy to be granted only when there is no other

means of obtaining justice. Even though all other requirements for securing the remedy have

been satisfied by the applicant, the court will decline to exercise its discretion in his favour if

a specific alternative remedy equally convenient beneficial and effectual is available.

In J. A. L. Cooray on Constitutional and Administrative Law of Sri Lanka at pages 426 and

427 it states . Court will not grant these writs where an alternative equally convenient

remedy is available.

The Court of Appeal in Tennakoon Vs. Director-General of Customs 2004 (1) SLR 53 held that

the petitioner has an alternate remedy, as the Customs Ordinance itself provides for such a

course of action under section 154. In the circumstances, the petitioner is not entitled to

invoke writ jurisdiction.

Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere in the case of Wickremasinghe Francis Kulasooriya V. Officer in

Charge, Police Station Kirindiwela CA (Writ) Application No. 338/2011, decided on

22.10.2018, where it was held; "The question that arises for consideration in this application

is what should a Court exercising Writ jurisdiction do, when confronted with an argument

that an alternative remedy is available to the Petitioner and that such alternative remedy

should be resorted to? This Court is of the view that a rigid principle cannot be laid down

and that the appropriate decision would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.

10

That said, where the statute provides a specific alternative remedy, a person dissatisfied with

a decision of a statutory body should pursue that statutory remedy instead of invoking a

discretionary remedy of this Court. That remedy should be equally effective and should be

able to prevent an injustice that a Petitioner is seeking to avert. Furthermore, if the Writ

jurisdiction is invoked where an equally effective remedy is available, an explanation should

be offered as to why that equally effective remedy has not been resorted to.

This Court having considered the submissions of the learned Counsel, observes that as per the

District Court judgment annexed to the Petition and the submissions made, the land the Petitioner

is attempting to get surveyed is a land settled under the Land Settlement Ordinance in favour of

the Temple. The title to the said land too has been conferred by a Sannasa which was accepted

by the judgment of the District Court. The District Court has been satisfied with the boundaries

referring to a plan and has referred the same in the judgment. The Petitioner has failed to

demonstrate to this Court nor to explain why he can't get his property secured when he is possessed

with a Judgement from the District Court. The Petitioner has failed to explain why he cant rely

on the plan he has submitted to the District Court to obtain judgment in his favour and seeks a new

plan to be drawn by the Surveyor General after a survey.

Hence, it is our view that it is up to the Petitioner to get the temple land secured by taking the

necessary steps under the Civil Procedure Code.

Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, we are not inclined to issue notices on the Respondents.

We dismiss this Application without cost.
