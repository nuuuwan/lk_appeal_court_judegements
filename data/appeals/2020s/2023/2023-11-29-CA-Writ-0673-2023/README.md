C.A. WRIT No. 673-23

9

Facts of the case

6) The Petitioner had instituted this action to get the aforesaid interim orders

and the Writ of Certiorari, Writ of Prohibition, and the Writ of Mandamus

against the Respondents.

7) The crux of this case is that the Petitioner entered into a Power Purchase

Agreementwith the 1st Respondent by the documents marked and

produced as P28(a) to P28(c).

8) Prior to entering into the said agreement, steps have been taken by the

Petitioner which is related in paragraphs 4 to 31 of the petition.

9) After signing the agreement the Land Usage Committee of Trincomalee had

decided to approve a 12 acre land for the Petitioner to initiate the proposed

power plants.

10) Due to various reasons the Petitioner was unable to utilize the land

allocated for the power project. Further, during the COVID-19 period the

construction work had been delayed due to the challenges faced by the

Petitioner Company. However, the Petitioner had taken all the necessary

steps to adhere to the terms and conditions of the Power Purchase

Agreement.

11) When entering the Power Purchase Agreement,the Petitioner had entered

into a performance bond with the 1stRespondent and due to the delay

caused by various reasons the Petitioner had made a request to extend the

performance security issued by the National Development Bank.

12) However, the 1st Respondent had sent a notice of default by letter dated

25th August 2022, in the event of the Petitioner failed to comply with the

requirements provided in Article 3.2(b) of the relevantPower Purchase

Agreementby not completing and commencing the operations of the

proposed power plants.

13) The Petitioner was informed that within the 30-day period of the said

letters, action would be taken to terminate the power purchase agreement.

The said letter was marked and produced as P50.

C.A. WRIT No. 673-23

10

14) The Petitioner had made a request by letter marked and produced as P51

to extend the given deadline and for the adjustment of the tariff regarding

the project. As it was fruitless, the Petitioner had requested the 1st

Respondent to mutually terminate the current Power Purchase Agreement

and sign a fresh Power Purchase Agreement.

15) However, this matter had been discussed repeatedly as seen in the letters

marked and produced as P52 to P57.

16) Subsequently, the Petitioner became aware that the 4th Respondent had

presented a cabinet memorandum to terminate the Power Purchase

Agreementwith the Petitioner and to forfeit the bond. The said

memorandum is marked and produced as P58(a).

17) Thereafter, the 1st Respondent had served notice of termination by the

documents marked and produced as P59(a), P59(b), and P59(c).

18) The Petitioner had sought to invoke the Writ Jurisdiction of this court to

quash the documents marked and produced as P58(c), P59(a), (b) and (c)

as the said decisions are arbitrary, unreasonable, capricious, irrational,

illogical and violate the legitimate expectation of the Petitioner.

19) On the said grounds, the Petitioner had requested to invoke the Writ

Jurisdiction and to grant the reliefs prayed for.

The application for notice and interim relief

20) The Presidents Counsel FaiszerMusthapha supported the application

pertinent to the reliefs sought by the Petitioner and sought permission

from the court to issue notice and to grant interim reliefs prayed for in the

prayer of the petition dated 31st October 2023.

21) The State Counsel NavodiDe Zoysawho appeared for the Respondents,

except for the 33rd and 34thRespondents,vehemently objected for the

issuing of interim relief and notice on the following grounds,

a. The Petitioner has mandatory alternative remedy.

b. This Petitioners action is based on purely a contract.

C.A. WRIT No. 673-23

11

c. Necessary parties are not before this court

d. Guilty of lashes.

e. Application is futile.

Disputed facts

22) Considering the arguments raised by the Counsels for the Petitioner and

the Respondents to arrive at the conclusion, I have to consider the

following disputed facts,

I. Has the Petitioner entered into a Power Purchase Agreementwith the 1st

Respondent?

II. If so, is the Petitioner bound by the terms and conditions of the Power

Purchase Agreements marked and produced as P59(a), P59(b), and

P59(c)?

III. Can the Petitioner seek relief against the document P58 (c) which is the

decisions or the directives of the Cabinet Ministers?

IV. Does the Article 8 of the Power Purchase Agreementcontain a dispute

resolution and an arbitration clause?

V. If so, can the Petitioner maintain this action to obtain reliefs under Writ

Jurisdiction?

I. Has the Petitioner entered into a Power Purchase Agreementwith the 1st Respondent?

23) Both parties have admitted that they have entered into a Power Purchase

Agreement 28(a), 28(b), and 28(c) in the instant action and 13(a), 13(b) in

case number WRT-0674-23.

24) The terms and conditions of the said Power Purchase Agreementis

specifically stated in the said agreement and both parties have agreed to

abide by the conditions referred to in the said agreement.

25) Therefore, in the instant action the Petitioner and the Respondents are

bound to act in accordance with the Power Purchase Agreement.

C.A. WRIT No. 673-23

12

26) In the said circumstances, it is obvious that both parties have executed

the said Power Purchase Agreementsubject to adhere to the terms and

conditions referred to in the said agreement.

II. If so, is the Petitioner bound by the terms and conditions of the Power Purchase Agreements marked and produced as P59(a), P59(b), and P59(c)?

27) As I have stated above the articles referred to in the Power Purchase

Agreementspecifically state the conditions between the parties and how to

implement the power purchase. Further, Articles 3.1 and 3.2 of the said

Power Purchase Agreement specify on what context the agreement can be

terminated.

28) Further, it is to be noted that in Article 6 there is a clause of force

majeure, therefore, if any default or any event referred to in Article 6 had

taken place not within the reasonable control and not due to the failure,

negligence or persistence of the party whose performance adversely

affected or becomes impractical is able to invoke force majeure.

29) Articles 8 (a), (b), and (c) refers to dispute resolution and arbitration which

I will discuss later.

30) In Articles 10 (b) to (e) specify the validity of the agreement entered

between the Petitioner and the Respondent, the context in which it is

violated, the affected party can invoke their rights to get reliefs as agreed

upon by the said agreement.

31) In light of the aforesaid facts, both parties are bound to act in accordance

to the agreed conditions referred to in P28 (a), P28(b), P28(c) and in Writ

673-23, P13(a) and P13(b).

32) When the case was argued none of the parties disagreed with the terms

entered in the aforesaid Power Purchase Agreement. Thus, both parties are

bound to act in accordance with the agreed terms in the aforesaid Power

Purchase Agreement.

C.A. WRIT No. 673-23

13

III. Can the Petitioner seek relief against the document P58 (c) which is the decisions or the directives of the Cabinet Ministers?

33) P58(a) is a cabinet memorandum presented by the 4th Respondent. P58(b)

is the note of the cabinet, and P58(c) is the cabinet decision dated 28th

August 2023. These cabinet decisions had been made in respect of the

Power Purchase Agreementconsidering the difficulties faced due to the

delay of the performance of the developers obtained by the power purchase

projects from the 1st Respondent.

34) The Presidents Counsel FaiszerMusthapha vehemently argued that the

said cabinet decisions had violated the rights of the Petitioner; therefore,

the Writ Jurisdiction arises out of the decision taken by the cabinet.

35) On observing the said documents, the cabinet has taken a certain decision

in respect of the power purchase projects.However, there is no material to

prove that the said cabinet decision hasany binding on the terms and

conditions of the Power Purchase Agreemententered between the Petitioner

and the 1st Respondent.

36) It is obvious, that the cabinet decisions taken by the minister had no effect

to the terms and conditions agreed between the Petitioner and the 1st

Respondent. It is only a decision taken by the cabinet and when

implementing it, the duty is cast upon the 1st Respondent to implement

these decisions in accordance with the terms and conditions already

agreed between the Petitioner and the 1st Respondent.

37) In the said circumstances, I am of the view that the cabinet decisions

taken by P58(c) has no effect for this court to consider a violation of a

legitimate expectation or a violation of terms and conditions agreed

between the parties and/or violating the natural justice or the legitimate

expectation of the Petitioner as the Petitioner is bound by the terms and

conditions agreed upon in the Power Purchase Agreement.

C.A. WRIT No. 673-23

14

IV. Does the Article 8 of the Power Purchase Agreementcontain a

dispute resolution and an arbitration clause?

38) The Power Purchase Agreements in the instant action marked and

produced as P28(a), P28(b) and P28(c), in case No. Writ0674/23the said

agreement is marked as P13(a) and P13(b).

39) In the said agreements Article No.8 refers to as follows;

a) The parties agree that if there is any dispute or difference between

them arising out of the Agreement or in the interpretation of any of

the provisions thereof they shall endeavor to meet in an effort to

resolve such dispute by discussion, within 30 days (Conciliation

Period) of such dispute arising, failing such resolution then the

parties in dispute shall refer at their costs the dispute to a mutually

agreed expert with experience in the field of Power generation or

related field or call upon the Government of Sri Lanka to appoint an

expert in the field of Power generation or related field to resolve the

matter within 60 days from the conciliation period, where the

difference or dispute involves a claim in money this Article shall

apply where the claim is less that Sri Lankan Rupees

1,000,000.00. Where such dispute is not resolved as aforesaid in

the end of ninety (90) days after the conciliation period

notwithstanding the fact that the claim is less than Rs.

1,000,000.00 then the provisions of 8(b) shall apply.

b) Any dispute that is not resolved under 8(a) above may be submitted

by either party to arbitration for final settlement under the

Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995.

C.A. WRIT No. 673-23

15

c) The performance of the contract may continue during arbitration

proceedings as far as possible.

40) When referring to the aforesaid Article 8(a), it specifies that when there is a

dispute or difference between the parties interpreting any of the provisions

of the Power Purchase Agreement, parties can resolve the dispute or

difference by agreeing to appoint an expert to resolve the dispute.

41) However, in the event where the parties were unable to reach any

settlement, either party is entitled for arbitration as provided in Article

8(b).

42) Now, I will draw my attention to Section 4 and 5 of the Arbitration Act, No.

11 of 19951. The said Sections read as follows;

Any dispute which the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration

under an arbitration agreement may be determined by arbitration

unless the matter in respect of which the arbitration agreement is

entered into is contrary to public policy or, is not capable of

determination by arbitration.2

Where a party to an arbitration agreement institutes legal

proceedings in a court against another party to such agreement in

respect of a matter agreed to be submitted for arbitration under such

agreement, the Court shall have no jurisdiction to hear and

determine such matter if the other party objects to the court

exercising jurisdiction in respect of such matter.3

43) It is specified, when the parties agreed to resolve the dispute by the

arbitration process, court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine that

action. As a statutory law,the Arbitration Act stipulates a remedy in

1 Hereinafter referred to as Arbitration Act. 2 Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995, Section 4. 3 Ibid, Section 5.

C.A. WRIT No. 673-23

16

Section 5, such statutory remedy cannot be superseded by remedies

available under other branches of law, including the Writ Jurisdiction.

44) In the instant action the State Counsel for the Respondenthas brought

this matter to the notice of the court with an objective to proceed with this

case seeking relief under the Writ Jurisdiction.

45) In considering the relevant Sections of the Arbitration Act and Article 8 of

the Power Purchase Agreement, I agree with the objection raised by the

State Counsel for the Respondents that when there is an arbitration

clause in an agreement and that objection is raised by a party, the court

shall have no jurisdiction to hear and determine the dispute arisen

between the parties in respect of the agreement.

46) Thus, my considered view is in the Power Purchase Agreementboth parties

have agreed and entered Article 8 in the Power Purchase Agreementto

resolve their disputes by way of dispute resolution and arbitration.

V. If so, can the Petitioner maintain this action to obtain reliefs

under Writ Jurisdiction?

47) The Presidents Counsel FaiszerMusthapha argued the dispute related to

this action had not arisen due to the Power Purchase Agreement. His

contention was due to the cabinet decision which is referred in P58(c) had

violated the legitimate expectation of the Petitioner to continue with the

Power Purchase Agreement.

48) The State Counsel vehemently objected for the said argument and brought

to the notice of the court the notice of default issued to the Petitioner by

the letter marked as P50. The said letter is dated 25th August 2022. In

that the 1st Respondent had specified that within a 30-day period action

will be taken to terminate the Power Purchase Agreement.

49) On perusal of P59(a) document the 1st Respondent had given notice of

termination for the Power Purchase Agreement.

C.A. WRIT No. 673-23

17

50) In the light of the said documents, it is obvious in the instant action that

the 1st Respondent had taken steps to terminate the Power Purchase

Agreement. Therefore, if there are disagreements between the parties that

should be addressed in accordance with article 8 of the Power Purchase

Agreement.

51) The Cabinet Memorandum and the decision which is marked and

produced as 58(c) has no bearing or binding between the Petitioner and

the Respondents, as the Petitioner and the 1st Respondent legally had

entered into the Agreement of Power Purchase accepting the terms and

conditions specified in the said Power Purchase Agreement.

52) Thus, the Petitioner and the 1stRespondent are bound by the Power

Purchase Agreement.

On that, I refer C.G. Weeramantrys The Law of Contracts. In the said

book the definition given for the contract is as follows;

Any definition of contract must necessarily stress the promise

which gives it birth and the attribute of enforceability or legal

recognition whence it derives its vital force. These two elements will

be found to dominate all definitions of the concepts, and without

them no definition is possible.4

An appreciation is required of the inadequacy of any one definition

to cover all operative facts that are necessary or sufficient to create a

contract.5

It is a promise or set of promises which the law will enforce.6

4C.G. Weeramantry, The Law of Contracts (The Y.M.B.A. Press, Colombo, 1967) 82. 5Ibid 83. 6Ibid; the word enforce in this definition does not bear the meaning of enforceability as in specific performance, where actual performance is enforced of the obligation undertaken, but rather the meaning of actionalibity at law.

C.A. WRIT No. 673-23

18

With due regard to these considerations and with due sense of the

difficulties involved, we may therefore attempt a definition of

contract as follows:A contract is a promise, or promise mutually

exchanged, setting up, against the promisor or promisors, duties of

performance which the law will recognize or enforce at the instance

or for the benefit of the promise or promises, or of a third party

intended to be benefited.7

On that, in consideration of the decision Samaraweera v. Minister of

Public Administration8 it was decided that, rules applicable to

commercial contracts have no statutory force; no mandamus.

Even though a statutory body is a party to a commercial contract,

the other party cannot seek mandamus against the statutory body to

enforce its performance even if Rules made by such statutory body

apply to and are part of such commercial contract, if the "Rules" do

not have statutory force as they were not created under a specific

conferment of power by statute for the purpose.

Further it is specified in Galle Flour Milling (Pvt) Limited vs. Board of

Investment of Sri Lanka and another9 as it is a case where a Writ of

Certiorari was sought for quashing the termination of an agreement

between the Petitioner and the Board of Investment. The Respondents

raised a preliminary objection that the Petitioner was seeking relief based

on a breach of a contractual right and therefore the Petitioner cannot

maintain the said application.10

7C.G. Weeramantry, The Law of Contracts (The Y.M.B.A. Press, Colombo, 1967) 83. 8 [2003] 3 SLR 64. 9 [2002] BLR 10. 10 Ibid.

C.A. WRIT No. 673-23

19

An analysis of the relationship that existed between the parties

reveals that as it was purely a contractual one of commercial nature,

neither certiorari nor mandamus will lie to remedy the dispute over

the rights of the parties. The purported breach of such rights (and)

the grievances between the parties arise entirely from a breach of

contract even if one of the parties was a statutory or public

authority.

Tillekewardena J.11 then had considered, whether the Respondent

being a statutory authority would lend to the commercial

arrangement between the parties, a statutory flavour, thus enabling

the petitioner in that case to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court.

Then it was expressed that, even though the power to enter into a

contract arises from the statute, the terms and conditions between

the parties were entirely contractual and that the decision that was

sought to be quashed was purely contractual.

"Therefore, the exercise of powers by parties in terms of the

agreement exclusively arises through the contract and though one of

the parties is a public authority rights of the parties are not

amenable to writ jurisdiction.

53) As per the aforesaid decisions and considering the Provisions of the Power

Purchase Agreementand the Arbitration Act, it is abundantly clear that

this application is based on a contract entered by the parties by the Power

Purchase Agreement.

11 Galle Flour Milling (Pvt) Limited vs. Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and another [2002] BLR 10.

C.A. WRIT No. 673-23

20

54) Therefore, as the aforesaid decisions and as per the Provisions of the

Arbitration Act there is no Writ Jurisdiction that can be invoked in the

instant action.

CONCLUSION

55) For the reasons set out above we do not see any merit to invoke the Writ

Jurisdiction for the reliefs sort by the Petitioner by the petition dated 31st

October 2023.

56) On that, we dismiss the petition and award tax cost to be payable to the

Respondents by the Petitioner.
