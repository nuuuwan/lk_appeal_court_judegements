Counsel:

M. Jayasinghe, DSG. with A. Gajadeera, SC for the 1st to 36th and 40th to 42nd

Respondents.

Written submissions tendered on:

20.12.2022 by the Petitioner

20.12.2022 by the Respondents

Argued on: 19.10.2022

Decided on: 22.06.2023

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

By this Writ Application, the Petitioner seeks to issue as substantive reliefs the Writs of

Certiorari to quash the Orders dated 31.07.2018 and 20.08.2019 of the University

Service Appeal Board (the USAB) and a Writ of Mandamus to direct the Respondents

to appoint him in the position of Full Professor in the Department of Botany with effect

from 29.12.2015 in the University of Jaffna (the University). The position of the

Petitioner is that he possesses the necessary qualifications to be promoted to the Post

of Full Professor according to the University Grants Commission Circular No.916 dated

30.09.2009 and Established Circular Letter No. 04/2010 dated 19.03.2010. When the

Application of the Petitioner was referred to the Selection Panel as necessary, he has

8

been deliberately under marked by the Panel chaired by the 6th Respondent for some

unknown reason. As a result, he has been promoted to the Post of Associate Professor

but not to the Post of Full Professor. In terms of the marking scheme marked as P8A,

the maximum marks needed for a Full Professor under the three categories mentioned

in P8A are 20, 50 and 10 respectively, and the applicant should score total marks of

105. The Selection Panel has given 15, 106.65 and 19.25 marks respectively under three

Categories and a total mark of 140 to the Petitioner. He claims that the Selection Panel

has under marked Items 1.5 and 1.6 in Category 1 and as a result, he has not been

appointed as a Full Professor. Under Item 1.5, it has been considered by the Selection

Panel the applicant's participation in Continuing Professional Development

Programmers/Extension Courses/ Short Courses and under Item 1.6, the applicant's

contribution to institutional development. He has been given no marks out of 10 under

1.5 and only 2 marks under 1.6 out of 20. As such he has been selected for the Post of

Associate Professor but not for the Post of Full Professor. Being aggrieved by the

decision of the University not to promote him to the Post of Full Professor the Petitioner

appealed to the USAB seeking relief to direct the Respondents to promote him to the

Post of Full Professor. The USAB in its Order dated 31.07.2018 marked as P4 directed

the Council of the University to look into the marks given to the Petitioner under Items

1.5 and 1.6 in Category 1 through an independent panel along with observations of the

37th Respondent to this Writ Applications. The USAB arrived at the above-stated

decision on the premise that the members of the USAB are not competent to pronounce

upon an academic evaluation upon which an appointment is made, where the evaluation

has been made by experts in the relevant field and it is a matter for the authorities of

the Higher Educational Institution concerned. The USAB dismissed the appeal subject

to the above-stated variation but kept the matter open for the Petitioner to reactivate the

9

appeal if the findings of the independent panel are adverse to him. Consequent to the

Order of the USAB the University appointed a panel to evaluate the marks given to the

Petitioner under items 1.5 and 1.6 and being aggrieved by the evaluation done by that

panel, the Petitioner re-invoked the jurisdiction of the USAB by reactivating his appeal

to the USAB. By the Order dated 20.08.2019 marked as P12, the USAB held that it

could not grant relief mentioned hereinbefore sought by the Petitioner from the USAB

and dismissed the appeal. The main reason for the dismissal of the appeal is that the

USAB has no expertise to decide on the expertise of the members of the independent

panel appointed to reconsider the Petitioner's marks. Even though, in the Petition to his

Writ Application, the Petitioner seeks to quash the Orders dated 31.07.2018 marked as

P5 and 20.08.2019 marked as P12, on 19.10.2022 when the matter was taken up for

argument the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner stated to Court that he is

seeking a Writ of Certiorari only to quash the Order dated 20.08.2019 and a Writ of

Mandamus directing the Respondents to appoint the Petitioner in the position of Full

Professor. He stated that he is not seeking a Writ to quash the Order dated 31.07.2018.

Accordingly, both parties filed written submissions

At the outset, it has to be noted that in the submissions on behalf of the Petitioner

nowhere has stated or demonstrated that the decision mentioned in P12 is illegal,

arbitrary unreasonable or perverse and the Court also could not see any illegality,

arbitrariness, unreasonableness or perverseness in that decision. According to the

celebrated dictum of Lord Brightman, in Writ matters Court is not concerned with the

decision of the statutory body but the decision-making process. The Petitioner does not

claim that the decision-making process of the USAB is tainted by any procedural error.

Under such circumstances, this Court would not interfere with the Order dated

20.08.2019 of the USAB.

10

The USAB by Order dated 20.08.2019 dismissed the Appeal of the Petitioner on the

basis that it has no expertise to decide on the expertise of the members of the

independent panel appointed to reconsider the marks of the Petitioner. The Petitioner

has been given no marks out of 10 under Item 1.5 and 2 marks out of 20 under 1.6. The

position of the Petitioner is that he is entitled to 9 and 17 marks respectively for those

items. The Petitioner claims that the independent panel has not considered under item

1.5 his role as a resource person for 14 years. He further claims that the marks allocated

to him under 1.6 are unfair and unjust. In sub-paragraph VII of paragraph 18 in the

written submissions the Petitioner has admitted that all 5 members in the independent

panel appointed in consequent to the directions of the USAB are highly qualified but

none of the research area the 5 panel members falls in the area of specialization of the

Petitioner. As correctly held by the USAB neither this Court nor the USAB has the

expertise to decide on the expertise of the first interview panel or the independent panel

subsequently appointed. As mentioned hereinbefore since there is no material before

Court that the decision of the USAB contained in P12 is illegal or arbitrary or

unreasonable or perverse or trained by procedural error, this Court would not seek to

substitute its view.

In the case of Dr. C.J.A. Jayawardena Vs University of Colombo and 28 Others1, his

Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere investigated whether academic issues are outside

the jurisdiction of this Court. In delivering the judgement his Lordship observed that;

The issue that this Court must decide in this application is whether the decision of the

1st Respondent not to appoint the Petitioner to the post of Associate

Professor/Professor is illegal. irrational or unreasonable.

1 CA (Writ) Application No. 137/2018; CA Minutes of 22nd of June 2020.

11

In considering the above issue, this Court would first like to lay down the parameters

within which Courts have previously acted when faced with decisions by academic

institutions, especially since this is a matter on which a great deal of emphasis has been

placed by the learned Senior State Counsel in resisting this application.

In Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth,2 it has been pointed out that Courts will

be reluctant to enter into "issues of academic or pastoral judgment which the University

was equipped to consider in breadth and in-depth but on which any judgment of the

Courts would be jejune and inappropriate. That undoubtedly included such questions

as what mark or class a student ought to be awarded or whether an aegrotat was

justified.

In Abeysundara Mudiyanselage Sarath Weera Bandara vs University of Colombo and

others3, having considered several English cases in this regard, this Court held as

follows:

The consistent judicial opinion therefore, is that in matters which lie within the

jurisdiction of the educational institutions and their authorities the Court has to be slow

and circumspect before interfering with any decision taken by them in connection

therewith. Unless a decision is demonstrably illegal, arbitrary and unconscionable,

their province and authority should not be encroached upon. This is mainly because of

want of judicially manageable standards and the necessary expertise to assess,

scrutinize and judge the merits and/or demerits of such decisions. Dealing with the

scope of interference in matters relating to orders passed by the authorities of

educational institutions, the Courts should normally be very slow to pass orders in

2 H.W.R. Wade, C.F, Forsyth, Administrative Law (11th Edition, Oxford University Press 2014) page 537. 3 CA (Writ) Application No. 844/2010; CA Minutes of 8th June 2018.

12

regard thereto and such matters should normally be left to the decision of the

educational authorities.

Observing the aforementioned authority Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere further held as

follows: This Court is therefore of the view that while due recognition will be given to

the view of the decision maker, whether the decision relates to academic matters or

otherwise, this Court can, and will, in the exercise of the jurisdiction vested in it by

Article 140 of the Constitution. examine whether the impugned decision of the 1

Respondent is tainted with illegality. irrationality or procedural impropriety. This Court

would however exercise extreme caution if asked to consider, for example as in this

case, whether a decision of a selection board or panel to award less marks than what a

petitioner claims is rightfully due, is irrational or unreasonable.

The Petitioner in the instant Application alleges that the University has violated the 1st

Order dated 31.07.2018 marked as P4 in appointing the members to the independent

panel. Nevertheless, when perusing the Order dated 20.08.2019 of the USAB marked

as P12, this Court could see that the Counsel appeared for the Petitioner before the

USAB admitted that he had no objections to the members appointed to the independent

panel. On the other hand, if the University violated the Order of the USAB marked as

P4, the Petitioner could have easily brought it to the notice of the USAB without waiting

until the decision of the independent panel was made as the USAB has given permission

in the 1st Order marked as P4 to the Petitioner to reactivate his Appeal to the USAB.

Therefore, I am of the view that there is no merit in the allegation of the Petitioner about

the violation of the Order marked as P4 by the University in appointing the members to

the independent panel.

13

The Petitioner alleges that the members of the independent panel had been appointed

without obtaining the prior approval of the USAB or Senate or University Council or

Petitioner. In P4, the USAB has not imposed such a requirement. The Petitioner also

alleged that as directed by the USAB by the Order marked as P4, the observations of

the 17th Respondent were not considered by the independent panel. In the Order

marked as P12, the USAB has observed that the copies of the previous proceedings

before the USAB had been made available to the independent panel. It has held that in

the absence of any material that the observations were suppressed from the panel or that

the panel did not consider the observations the USAB is unable to hold the evaluation

has been done without considering the observations of the 17th Respondent. Under such

circumstances, the view of this Court is that the said allegation of the Petitioner has no

merits.

The Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus directing the Respondents to appoint him to

the post of Full Professor in Botany. It is settled law that for a Mandamus to issue, the

Petitioner must have a legal right and the Respondents must have a corresponding

public duty.

In Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka Vs. Messers Jafferjee and Jafferjee (Pvt)

Ltd4, the Supreme Court referred to the conditions that should be fulfilled prior to

issuance of a writ of mandamus.

There is rich and profuse case law on mandamus, on the conditions to be satisfied by

the applicant. Some of the conditions precedent to the issue of mandamus appear to be:

4 (2005) 1 SLR page 89.

14

a) The applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the parties

against whom the mandamus is sought The foundation of mandamus is the

existence of a legal right.

b) The right to be enforced must be a public right and the duty sought to be enforced

must be of a public nature.

Referring to the above case, in Kaluarachchi Vs Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and

Others5 Fernando J, stated that, the foundation of mandamus is the existence of a legal

right. A court should not grant a Writ of Mandamus to enforce a right which is not legal

and not based upon a public duty.

Furthermore, in the case of Ratnayake And Others Vs. C.D. Perera and Others6

Sharvananda, J. held as follows;

The general rule of Mandamus is that its function is to compel a public authority to

do its duty. The essence of Mandamus is that it is a command issued by the superior

Court for the performance of public legal duty. Where officials have a public duty to

perform and have refused to perform. Mandamus will lie to secure the performance of

the public duty, in the performance of which the applicant has sufficient legal

interest

In the instant Application, selection to the post of Full Professor has been done by a

panel of experts through their expertise considering the marks obtained by the

applicants. In such a situation no applicant has a legal right to be appointed to the post

nor the panel has a public legal duty towards the Petitioner or the other applicants to

appoint him/them to the post. Under the above-stated circumstances, I hold that the

5 SC Appeal No. 43/2013; SC Minutes of 19th June 2019. 6 (1982) 2 Sri LR 451.

15

Petitioner is not entitled to the reliefs sought in the Petition to this Writ Application.

Therefore, the Application is dismissed without costs.

Application dismissed
