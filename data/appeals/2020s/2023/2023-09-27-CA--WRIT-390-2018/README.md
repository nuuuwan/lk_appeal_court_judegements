The petitioner through this application seeks relief by way of Writ of Certiorari

to quash the Quit Notice issued by the 1st respondent, Writ of Prohibition

against the 1st respondent from proceeding in terms of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 from taking actions to eject the

petitioner from the land and Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st respondent

not to interfere with the lawful possession of the petitioner.

The facts of the case are as follows. The petitioner has been in possession of

the land since 10.05.1985, which is certified by the Grama Niladari of

476/N/Henfold, Lindula (P1). The petitioner stated he has been paying taxes

for the land since 1989 (P2). The 1st respondent in accordance with the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act issued a Quit Notice (P3) dated 31.10.2018

demanding the petitioner to handover the possession of the land to the

superintendent/agents of Henfold Estate on or before 20.12.2018.

CA-WRT-390-2018 27/09/2023 IJ-29-23 Page 3 of 10

The petitioner further claims that the said land does not belong to Henfold

Estate which is certified by the 3rd respondent who is the superintendent of

Henfold Estate through his letter dated 10.01.1988 (P4). Thereby the petitioner

stated the said land is vested/owned by the Land Reform Commission (LRC)

and the Director of District Land Reform Commission has issued a letter dated

26.03.2014 (P5) stating that upon the payment of Rs. 33,898.50/- for the

possession of the abovementioned land from 1987 to 2013, the Deed will be

issued. Thereby on 08.04.2014 the petitioner paid a sum of Rs. 33,900/- to

obtain the Deed (P6).

The petitioner states that Land Reform Commission has requested the Nuwara

Eliya Election Commissioner and the Divisional Secretary, Divisional

Secretariat through letters dated 26.11.2018 (P7 & P8) to verify the eligibility

of the petitioner in order to grant a long-term lease to the land occupied by

the petitioner.

Petitioner states that he replies to a letter dated 17.08.2017 (P9) informing the

1st respondent by his letter dated 01.09.2017 (P10) that the land in dispute

does not belong to Henfold Estate and thus the 1st respondent is not entitled

to take any actions in terms of the circular/letter (P11) dated 10.12.2003

signed by the Competent Authority, Plantation Management Monitoring

Division, Ministry of Plantation Industry.

The petitioner claims that despite the land in question belonging to the Land

Reform Commission and the said directives (P11) by the Hon. Minister of

Plantations Industry, the 1st respondent sent Quit Notice to the petitioner. The

petitioner further states that since the land belongs to Land Reform

Commission, the Ministry of Plantation Industry has no authority to evict the

petitioner and/or take any action under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act. Thereby, the petitioner claims that the Quit Notice issued by

the 1st respondent is ultra vires and violated the principles of Natural Justice.

The petitioner also claims that he spent over Rs. 1,500,000/- to develop the

land (P12 A G) over the last 33 years. And thereby claims that unless interim

relief is granted grave and irreparable loss/harm would be caused to the

petitioner by the actions of the 1st respondent.

CA-WRT-390-2018 27/09/2023 IJ-29-23 Page 4 of 10

Thereby through this application the petitioner seeks to invoke this Court to

issue notice to respondents, issue Writ of Certiorari to quash the Quit Notice

issued by the 1st respondent dated 31.10.2018, Writ of Prohibition against the

1st respondent from proceeding in terms of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 from taking actions to eject the petitioner from

the land (Which is 1A.0R.26P in extent situated between Henfold Division Field

and Agra Oya and behind the Henfold Group Maternity Ward) and Writ of

Mandamus directing the 1st respondent not to interfere with the lawful

possession of the petitioner.

The main contention of the Presidents Counsel appearing for the petitioner

was that the Quit Notice (P3) issued by the 1st respondent was not issued by

a competent authority under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act as

amended.

Section 18 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act interprets

Competent Authority. As per Section 18 of the act:

competent authority used in relation to any land means the Government

Agent, an Additional Government Agent or an Assistant Government Agent of

the district in which the land is situated and, includes:

(K) any other public officer authorized by the Government Agent in respect of

any matter or provision of this Act; and

(I) an officer generally or specially authorized by a corporate body, where such

land is vested in or owned by or under the control of, such corporate body.

When examining the Quit Notice (P3) issued, it is evident that it is signed by

the 1st respondent who claims to be a competent authority of the Plantation

Management Monitoring Division Ministry of Plantation. And thus, it cannot

be contended that the Quit Notice is unlawful/illegal or ultra vires.

Further during the submissions made by the Presidents Counsel, it was also

specified that the land in concern was originally owned by the Land Reform

Commission (LRC) and later through the nationalization of plantations in the

country the management of estates were vested within the Sri Lanka State

Plantation Corporation (SLSPC) and within the Janatha Estates Development

5

CA-WRT-390-2018 27/09/2023 IJ-29-23 Page 5 of 10

Board (JEDB). The corpus in dispute was vested within the JEDB and thus it

could be said the 1st respondent who claims to be an authoritative of the

Plantation Management Monitoring Division Ministry of Plantation can be

considered as a competent authority, thereby the Quit Notice is valid as per

the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

The counsel for the respondent in his submissions contends that the question

whether the land in dispute is within the control of Land Reform Commission

or Plantation Management Company is a matter of fact. The counsel reiterates

that in this instant case the land in concern is vested with the JEDB, and the

JEDB gave the said land on lease to Watawala Plantation. As per 1R1 lease

agreement it is admitted that the land is under the control of Plantation

Management Company. Thereby counsel for the respondent claims that there

is a question of disputed facts and he contends that a writ does not lie in such

instance.

Inter alia the petitioner claimed through the payment receipts (P2) that the

petitioner has been in possession of the said land and has paid taxes to the

local authority, which was not a disputed fact.

Further the contention of the petitioner was that he was in the said land in

anticipation of the grant by the Land Reform Commission. P5, P6, P7 and P8

are all documents corresponding to the Land Reform Commission. The

petitioner claims to be in possession of the land in dispute since 1985 and

developed it. The petitioner also claims that he paid money (P6) as required by

the Land Reform Commission to obtain a conveyance in 2014. And thus,

emphasizes on his legitimate expectations to be in possession of the said land.

Accordingly, it could be said that the petitioners legitimate expectations

should be vested with the Land Reform Commission and not against the 1st

respondents. However, the counsel for the respondent during his submissions

emphasized on the fact that the petitioner relies on the documents of the Land

Reform Commission but has not made the Land Reform Commission a party

to the case.

The case of Dominic v Minister of Lands and others (2010) 2 SLR page 398

held: where an order would affect adversely a party who is not before Court,

that party must be deemed to be a necessary party and consequently the failure

6

CA-WRT-390-2018 27/09/2023 IJ-29-23 Page 6 of 10

to make the necessary party a respondent must be regarded fatal to the

application.

A necessary party is one without whom no order can be effectively made. A

proper party is one in whose absence an effective order can be made but whose

presence in necessary to complete and final decisions on the question involved

in the proceedings.

In the instant application it is evident that the petitioner is seeking relief on

the basis of the documents issued by the Land Reform Commission which are

disputed and contested, and thus this court too observes that the petitioner

has failed to name the Land Reform Commission as a party to the case.

Both counsels during the submissions, directed the attention to Land Reform

Act Section 42H. The Section reads as follows:

(1) Any estate land vested in the Commission under this Part of this Law may be

used for any of the following purposes:

(a) alienation by way of sale, exchange, rent purchase or lease to persons

for agricultural development or animal husbandry, or for a co-operative

or collective farm or enterprise;

(aa) alienation, by way of sale or lease with the approval of the Minister for

non-agricultural purposes;

(b) alienation by way of sale in individual allotments to persons for the

construction of residential houses;

(c) alienation to any corporation established or to be established under the

State Agricultural Corporations Act or to the Sri Lanka State Plantations

Corporation established under the Sri Lanka State Plantations

Corporation Act;

(d) for a farm or plantation managed by the Commission directly or by its

agents;

(e) for village expansion or any other public purpose

Thereby in terms of Section 42(H)(1) of the Land Reform Act, the Land Reform

Commission is vested with the power to alienate the said land through sale,

lease or any other transfer to individuals, estates, companies, corporate and

7

CA-WRT-390-2018 27/09/2023 IJ-29-23 Page 7 of 10

even governmental bodies. Further the land can be used for construction of

houses, apartments, buildings or any other development.

Thereby the counsel for the respondents emphasized on the fact that the said

corpus was alienated by Land Reform Commission to Sri Lanka State

Plantation Corporation (SLSPC) and Janatha Estates Development Board

(JEDB) was an act within the lawful purview of the Land Reform Act. Later in

1994, the land occupied by the Henfold Estate was leased out by the JEDB to

a 3rd party: Watawala Plantation Limited. Through the document marked 1R1

the lease agreement between JEDB and Watawala Plantation Limited, JEDB

the lessor agreed to lease Henfold Estate to the lessee Watawala Plantation

Limited for a period of 99 years.

Nevertheless, when inquisitively examining the lease agreement (1R1) this

court observed that the total extent of the said Henfold Estate containing

approximately 1333 Acres had been leased by the JEDB to the 1st respondent

company for a term of 99 years with the agreement of rent of Rs. 500/- of

lawful money, per calendar year.

The counsel for the respondents further stated that the petitioner was an

employee of the estate and upon ending his employment the petitioner failed

to the return the land/quarters to the respective authority. However, in

response the Presidents Counsel stated that the petitioner admits that he was

an employee yet contested the later and said that he returned the quarters he

was given during the employment when he left the service and claimed that

the corpus in dispute in the instant application is a different portion of land.

In support of this argument the petitioner further stated that in the upcountry,

areas within the estates does not have separate names and stated that in the

instant application the designated name Henfold Estate refers to the entire

Grama Sevaka Division of the Lindula area and not a specific portion of land.

According to the facts that were brought forward by the Counsel there is no

dispute over the fact that the petitioner is in possession of the said land,

however, it is evident that the petitioner is in anticipation that he will obtain

rights over the land sooner or later (P5). Yet, on the other hand it can be

observed through Section 42(H) of the Land Reform Act that the commission

has the power to alienate the land and according to 1R1 the lease agreement,

8

CA-WRT-390-2018 27/09/2023 IJ-29-23 Page 8 of 10

the larger land Henfold Estate which extends to 1333 Acres has been given

on lease to Watawala Plantation for a term of 99 years in the year 1994.

Upon consideration of the facts and submissions made by the Counsel for the

respondents it can be said that in accordance with the State Lands (Recovery

of Possession) Act amended time to time, the said Quit Notice (P3) was issued

by the competent authority, as they believe the land in dispute is within the

purview of the respondents.

The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 (as amended)

outlines the procedure to be followed when ejecting an unauthorized occupant

from a state-owned land. According to Section 3 of the act, where a competent

authority is of the view that any state-owned land is occupied/possessed by

an unauthorized occupant the law vests the power with the competent

authority to issue a Quit Notice to the party in unauthorized occupation to

vacate the said land. As per Section 4 of the act, the Quit Notice issued makes

it obligatory for the occupants and his dependents (if any) occupying the said

land to vacate the land on or before the date specified.

Section 5 of the act sets out the subsequent occurrences if the party fails to

comply with the Quit Notice. At such an instance the competent authority who

issued the notice may make an application to the Magistrates Court praying

for the recovery of possession of the land and for an order of ejectment of such

person in occupation. Thereafter as per Section 6 of the act, the law vests the

power to the Magistrate to issue notice to the relevant party named in the

application to show cause as to why he should not be ejected from the said

land. Nevertheless, as per Section 7 if upon the date specified in the summons

the said party fails to show cause against the order of ejectment the court shall

forthwith issue an order directing the party and his dependents to be ejected

from the land. In contrast, Section 8 of the act specifies if the party appears

to court on the date specified to show cause the court may proceed to hear

and determine the matter on a later date. Section 9 of the act states that

during the inquiry the party may establish that he is in possession of the land

upon a valid permit or any other written authority. And subsequent to the

inquiry, if the Magistrates Court is not satisfied with the submissions of the

9

CA-WRT-390-2018 27/09/2023 IJ-29-23 Page 9 of 10

party the court, through Section 10 of the act direct the person and his

dependents to eject the land.

In the instant application the matter is still at the juncture of Section 3, where

the competent authority issued the Quit Notice to the petitioner of this case.

However, it could be observed that upon an application made by the

competent authority to the Magistrates Court, the Magistrates Court may

issue notice to the said party to show cause for the objection of being ejected

from the said land. Even at such a stage the petitioner is able to prove that he

is occupying the said land with lawful authorization.

During the submissions made by the Presidents Counsel, for the petitioner

drew the attention to the case of Mohamed v Land Reform Commission and

another (1996) 2 SLR and claimed that the facts of the abovementioned case

being similar to the instant application. However, when examining the case of

Mohamed v Land Reform Commission (supra) it is clear that the petitioner of

the case and the Land Reform Commission has been in a lawful lease and

there is evident documentation to prove the contentions. Nevertheless, in

contrast, in the instant application the petitioner has no sufficient evidence to

prove he is occupying the land with lawful authorization. And furthermore, if

the petitioner has any claim against the Land Reform Commission, the

commission should have been named as a party to this application, which the

petitioner has not done in this case.

Thereby upon the consideration of the above submissions this Court does not

see any reasonable grounds to grant relief.

Application dismissed without costs.
