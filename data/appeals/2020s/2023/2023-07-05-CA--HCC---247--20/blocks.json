The dock statement made by the appellant has been considered by the trial judge and he had concluded that he is unable to accept it because it does not create a doubt in the prosecution case. Therefore, he has said that in view of the doctors opinion on the injury on the deceased and the incidents which led to the commission of the said injury he has concluded that the appellant has committed the offence in the indictment. The offence of murder had been defined under section 294 of the Penal Code under four limbs and under the said section under limb 3 of 294 clearly describes the act committed by the appellant especially in view of the evidence of the doctor who had classified the injury on the deceased to be 100 percent sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The medical evidence is substantiated by the evidence of the lay witnesses and the evidence of the investigative officers. As such we see no merit in the ground of appeal raised by the appellant and we see no reason to interfere with the findings of the trial judge. As such the conviction and the sentence of the trial judge is affirmed and the instant appeal is hereby dismissed.",
