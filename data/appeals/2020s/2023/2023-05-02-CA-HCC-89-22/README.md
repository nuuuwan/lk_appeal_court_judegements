B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused), aggrieved by the

conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge of Colombo, preferred

this appeal.

The Accused was indicted before the High Court of Colombo for having in her

possession 5.80 grams of Diacetylmorphine, commonly known as Heroin, and trafficking

the said quantity of Heroin on 15th November 2013, which are offences punishable under

the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance No. 13 of 1984, as amended.

The prosecution led evidence of 6 witnesses including the government analyst and

closed the case for the prosecution. The Accused made a dock statement. The Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo after giving reasons found the Accused guilty on both

counts, convicted and sentenced her to life imprisonment.

Page 3 of 11

Being aggrieved by said judgment this appeal was preferred by the Accused.

The following grounds of appeal were urged by the learned Counsel for the

Accused.

1. The evidence of the prosecution fails the test of probability.

2. The evidence of the prosecution fails the test of credibility.

3. The prosecution has failed to prove the chain of custody of production.

4. The dock statement of the Accused has been rejected on unreasonable grounds.

Facts in brief as per evidence led by the prosecution is as follows.

According to the evidence of PW1, the OIC of the Vice Division of the Western

Province of Colombo Crimes Division (commonly known as CCD), he along with seven

other officers namely PS 10751 Fonseka (PW2), PS 33931 Bandara (PW3), PS 529 Botheju

(PW4), PC 61072 Bandara (PW5), PC 61178 Chathuranga (PW6), PC Driver 76147

Nissanka and WPC 8041 Anusha (PW7), left the CCD in a white van belonging to CCD at

1410 on 15th November 2013. The officers were clad in civil attire, except for PW1 who

was in his uniform. They travelled to Satthmma Watta in the Dematagoda area which

according to PW1 is notorious for drug peddlers, traffickers and addicts. This patrol was

not based on particular information received but was a part of their daily duty, which he

describes as deynika rajakariya.

In his evidence, PW1 demonstrated the route they took to arrive at Masjeed Place.

They stopped the van near a temple and on PW1s instructions the driver stayed behind

to guard it. PW1 and the six other officers, then travelled by foot before taking a left onto

a Mudukku Road to enter Satthamma Watta.

According to PW1, he had noticed a woman in a yellow dress walking towards the

police officers. She had been about 15m away from the officers when she was spotted.

Suddenly, after seeing the officers the woman turned and walked towards the housing

complex on her right side.

As stated by PW1 (on page 80 of the brief proceedings dated 24/05/2019):

.

This conduct alerted PW1. He along with fellow officers reached her. PW1 then

directed WPC 8041 Anusha (PW7) to search the woman as he observed something in her

right-side pocket. PW7 searched the pocket and found a pink cellophane bag that

contained a brown powder. Upon inspection by PW1, this was suspected to be heroin.

The Accused was arrested at 1450 and the cellophane bag was put inside an

envelope and retained by PW1. PW1 kept the envelope in his possession until they

reached the station. On their way back, they stopped at Dedigama Pawn Center to weigh

the heroin. This was done by PW1 in the presence of PW2, PW7, and the Accused. When

weighed with the cellophane bag, it was recorded as 20g and 100mg. The cellophane bag

was then put back in the envelope and sealed. They then arrived at CCD, and PW1 made

an entry at 16.35. Thereafter, the Accused and the production were handed over to the

reserve police officer, and the production was entered into the PR book and sent to the

government analyst. PW1 in his evidence identifies this reserve police officer as, PS 27675

Amila Kumara.

As stated by PW1, (on page 92 of the brief proceedings dated 24/05/2019)

- ?

- 27675

.

The evidence of PW7, the other main witness of the prosecution, is consistent with

the version of PW1.

As listed in the indictment, the reserve police officer who received the production

from PW1 is PS 27675 Ramya Kumara (PW8). However, in his evidence, PW8 identified

his name appears as PS 28675 Ramya Kumara. Further, PW8 identified P1B to be his

signature.

When the Accused gave a dock statement, she took the position that she was not

arrested at 1450 on 15th November 2013 in the manner stated by the officers but instead,

the arrest occurred in the morning of 15th June 2013. She had gone to purchase buns for

her nephew before sending him to the nursery when PW1 asked her to come and

thereafter took her to Ajjis house. She claims that she was unaware of what was taken

from the house upon searching. She had refused her involvement, cried, and opposed

being taken. Nonetheless, she along with the infant child that was with her, was taken to

the police.

The Accused in her dock statement (on page 223 of the Brief proceedings dated

29/09/2020) observed:

, . ,

. .

.

The first ground of appeal is that the learned High Court Judge failed to consider

the test of probability. According to the prosecutions version, this raid was not conducted

following specific information, but it was done as a part of the daily routine by PW1s

team. When questioned on the reason for choosing this particular area for the search,

PW1 responded by saying, Satthamma Watta is an area known for drug related activities.

Assessing this, we must be mindful of the fact that police officers involved are from

CCD, a specialized unit responsible for investigating and combatting organized crime,

including drug trafficking. It is perfectly within the reasonable capacity of such officers to

make a calculated decision as to where a random search is to be conducted. As a crime

prevention unit, it is also within its reasonable capacity to show up arbitrarily and inspect

such areas. Further, according to PW1s evidence, he has been at CCD and has conducted

several raids in said area for about two years.

As stated by PW1 (on page 109 of the Brief proceedings dated 28/05/2019):

- , ,

.

. .

Page 6 of 11

When considering the manner the Accused was caught by the officers, PW1 claims

that she abruptly turned away upon seeing the officers and that conjured up his suspicion.

As stated by PW1 (on page 119 of the Brief proceedings dated 28/052019):

-

.

Is this narration probable? We must take note of the fact that she was not

randomly stopped in the street and searched, but rather it was her suspicious conduct

observed by PW1 which led to the search. In relation to this particular point, we may

observe the events in Siddick v. The Republic of Sri Lanka [2005] 1 SLR 383, in which the

main witness (who was a customs officer) had searched the Accused on suspicion roused

by the fact that the accused was wearing ill-matching shoes. To reiterate the words of his

Lordship Imam J., Nazeer in his evidence stated that what roused his suspicion was that

the Accused at the time of detection was attired in a dark blue suit and wore ill-matching

pair of brown shoes. by virtue of his job was entrusted to question and check suspicious

looking persons, by virtue of which he arrested the Appellant.

Further, on the matter of probability, the defense raises the question of whether it

was likely for the officers to not search the house of the Accused. According to PW1, such

an exercise would have been pointless as the news of the Accused being arrested would

have quickly spread. As stated by PW1 (on page 128 of Brief proceedings dated

28/05/2019):

- . . .

.

.

.

At this point, we must also be mindful of the fact that they were only patrolling in

the Satthamma Watta as a part of their daily duty. It is because of this, the prosecutions

version of the fact that the Accused was spotted walking towards the police seems

probable. Further, given that it is a notorious area for drug activity, it is reasonably

Page 7 of 11

assumed that entering the housing complex unprepared at that point would have posed a

threat to the officers. Therefore, this Court believes the prosecutions version.

On the other hand, the Accuseds version was that she was arrested with her infant

while she had gone to buy buns for her nephew. Her testimony is limited and there is no

evidence in regard to where the witness was when she was arrested. This version does not

incriminate nor create doubt in the prosecutions version as incriminating information

simply does not exist.

The second ground raised by the defense was the presence of a contradiction

between the evidence PW1 and PW7. The position of the Accused was that PW1 stated

that the Accused, on seeing the police, has turned right while PW7 stated that the Accused

turned back. The issue before us is whether this contradiction is a minor contradiction or

whether it goes to the root of the matter.

In this light, it is worth referring to the dictum in State of Uttar Pradesh v. M. K.

Anthony 1984 (2) SCJ 236:

Minor discrepancies on trivial matter not touching the core of the case, hyper

technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the

evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed by the

investigating officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit

the rejection of evidence as a whole. If the court, before whom the witness gives

evidence had the opportunity to form an opinion about the general tenor of

evidence given by the witness, the appellate court which had not this benefit will

have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the trial court and

unless there are reasons weighty and formidable it would not be proper to reject

the evidence on the grounds of minor variations or infirmities in the matter of

trivial details. Even honest and truthful witness may differ in some details

unrelated to the main incident because power of observation, retention and

reproduction differ with individuals.

The above dictum was cited by his Lordship Ranjith Silva J. in Nanediri Devage

Wilman CA 122/2005, decided on 12/11/2007. We hold that this particular contradiction

does not go to the root of the matter.

Page 8 of 11

Another issue raised by the learned Counsel for the Accused was that the

prosecution failed to establish the chain of production. This Court is mindful of the

observation made by his Lordship J.A.N. De Silva J. (as he was then) in Perera v. AG

[1998] 1 SLR 378,

It is a recognized principle that in a case of this nature, the prosecution must

prove that the productions had been forwarded to the Analyst from proper custody,

without allowing room for any suspicion that there had been no opportunity for

tampering or interfering with the production till they reach the Analyst. Therefore,

it is correct to state that the most important journey is the inwards journey because

the final Analyst report will be depend on that. The outward journey does not

attract the same importance.

According to PW1, he handed over the production to the reserve officer namely, PS

27675 Amila Kumara (PW8). But when the prosecution called PW8 to give evidence on

13th January 2020, a person called Rajamuni Wasantha Ramya Kumara PS 28675

appeared and gave evidence. According to him, on the day in question which is 15th

November 2013, he was the reserve officer at the CCD and he received the production

from PW1 namely, IP Chandana at 2000. He handed over the production along with the

Accused. The production record was marked as P1. He identified his signature as well as

PW1s signature. When he was cross-examined, he identified his signature in P1. We are

of the view that the learned trial judge has correctly concluded that there is no reasonable

doubt created with regard to the inward journey.

In the instant case, the prosecution has proved that it was, in fact, PW8 who

received the production from PW1, through the confirmation of the signature by both PW8

and PW1.

As stated by PW1 (on page 94 of the Brief proceedings dated 24/05/2019):

- ?

- , .

As stated by PW8 (on page 178 of the Brief proceedings dated 13/01/2020):

- ?

- .

, .

. 1 . 1B .

Considering all these factors, we must ask ourselves whether the mentioning of

the wrong name by PW1 has created reasonable doubt in the case of the prosecution. The

defense has failed to not only articulate the way injustice was caused but to raise it

entirely in the cross-examinations of PW1 and PW8. Since the authenticity of the

signature is confirmed by both parties and there is no further doubt created by the

defense, we are of the view that the particular discrepancy is not substantial enough to

interrupt the chain of production. The prosecution has established the inward journey of

the production to the satisfaction of the Court and the learned High Court Judge has

carefully analyzed this issue. Therefore, we reject this ground.

The final ground urged by the learned Counsel was that the learned High Court

Judge rejected the dock statement without any reason. Before we analyze the dock

statement in the instant case, we have to consider the impact of a dock statement.

In Weddikkarage Thusharika Priyadarshani v. AG CA/HCC/0080/2020 decided on

05.09.2022, his Lordship Abayakoon J. in his judgement explained his view thus:

In the case of Queen Vs. Kularatne (1968) 71 NLR 529, it was held that while

jurors must be informed that such a statement must be looked upon as evidence

subjected however, to the infirmities that the accuseds statement is not made

under oath and not subjected to cross-examination.

Held further,

1. If the dock statement is believed, it must be acted upon to.

2. If it raised a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case of the

prosecution, the defence must succeed. and;

3. It must not be used against another accused.

It was held in the case of Don Samantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha Vs. The

Attorney General, C.A. 303/2006, decided on 11-07-2012 that,

Page 10 of 11

Whether the witness of the defence or the dock statement is sufficient to

create a doubt cannot be decided in vacuum or in isolation, because it needs

to be considered in the totality of evidence, that is in the light of the

evidence for the prosecution as well as the defence.

With the above dictum in mind, this Court will consider the dock statement made

by the Accused. On page 223 of the Brief, the following is uttered by the Accused:

2013.06.15 . .

. . .

. . .

.

, . .

. .

. . .

.

Now we will focus on how the learned High Court Judge has addressed his mind

to the dock statement made by the Accused. The relevant excerpt of the judgment (on page

241 of the brief) is as follows:

2013.06.15

. 2013.11.15 .

.

.

We are of the view that the learned High Court Judge has rightly considered the

dock statement by the Accused and her defense and has come to the conclusion that the

dock statement has not created any reasonable doubt in the evidence of the prosecution.

It should be mindful that in the dock statement, the Accused has referred to an incident

dated 15th June 2013, when in fact the raid had taken place on 15th November 2013. The

learned High Court Judge dismissed the dock statement for reasons that the Accused had

referred to the wrong date in her dock statement. This Court further observes that when

Page 11 of 11

perusing the dock statement by the Accused she had an infant with her when the police

arrested her. But theres no explanation given by her as to what happened to the infant

when she was arrested. No question was put to the police witnesses regarding the infant.

On this ground, when we evaluate the dock statement and the evidence of the

prosecution, we find that it has not created a reasonable doubt as to the prosecutions case

with regard to the manner of the arrest. Therefore, we are of the view that the defence

has failed to raise a reasonable doubt about the case of the prosecution.

For the above-said reasons, this Court is of the view that the grounds of appeal

raised by the Accused are without merit. We see no reason to interfere with the judgement

dated 24th May 2022. The conviction and the sentence are affirmed, and the appeal is

accordingly dismissed.
