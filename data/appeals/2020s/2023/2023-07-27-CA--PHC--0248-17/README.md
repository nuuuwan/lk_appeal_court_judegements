Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The complainant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant)

instituted proceedings against the accused-respondent-respondents (hereinafter

referred to as the respondents) by filing a private plaint in terms of section 136(1)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 before the Magistrate Court

of Sammanthurai.

The charge against the respondents have been that on 24-02-2013, the

respondents assaulted the appellant and also caused damage to a three-wheeler

and to his house and thereby committed offences punishable in terms of sections

314 and 410 of the Penal Code.

Despite the obvious defects in the charge, where the appellant has mentioned

two penal offences in one charge, the learned Magistrate of Sammanthurai has

decided to issue summons to the respondents. As the respondents have pleaded

not guilty to the charge, the matter has been taken up for the trial.

At the trial, it had been revealed that the appellant had filed the private plaint

based on two complaints he made to the Sammanthurai police station on 24-02-

2013. It has been established that the police have referred the two complaints to

the Mediation Board of Sammanthurai, as the dispute was a matter that shall

be referred to the Mediation Board before filing any action before the Magistrate

Court.

The Mediation Board of Sammanthurai has issued the certificate of settlement

dated 31-03-2013, in terms of section 11 of the Mediation Boards Act No- 72 of

1988.

The learned Magistrate, after considering the factual matters brought to his

notice, and after considering the relevant law in that regard, has dismissed the

private plaint filed by the appellant by his order dated 09-05-2016, as there was

no basis for the appellant to maintain his action against the respondents on a

matter that has already been settled before the Mediation Board.

The appellant has filed an application in revision in terms of Article 154P of the

Constitution before the Provincial High Court of the Eastern Province holden at

Kalmunai on the basis of being aggrieved by the said order of the learned

Magistrate of Sammanthurai.

After hearing the parties, the learned High Court Judge of Kalmunai by his well-

reasoned out judgment dated 16th October 2017, has dismissed the revision

application for want of any merit.

It is against the said judgment the appellant has filed this appeal.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following ground of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

Page 5 of 7

(1) The learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge erred in law

by failing to consider that the matter has not been settled before the

Mediation Board.

It was the position of the learned Counsel for the appellant that although the

matter was initially settled before the Mediation Board, the appellant informed

the Board that the settlement was withdrawn by him, and that fact has not been

duly considered by the Court.

The learned Counsel for the respondent brought to the notice the judgment of

the learned High Court Judge, where it has been held that the appellant had

suppressed material facts before the trial Court and had produced additional

documents in violation of the Rule No 3(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules of 1990, at the hearing before the High Court.

It was also pointed out the requirements of section 14A of the Act, if the matter

was not settled as claimed by the appellant.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

It is clear from the proceedings before the learned Magistrate of Sammanthurai

that the Court has been informed the fact that the matter mentioned in the

private plaint filed by the appellant was a matter that had been settled between

the parties by the Mediation Board, before the appellant filed the private plaint

in the Magistrate Court.

The learned Magistrate, after being satisfied that the certificate of settlement

issued by the Mediation Board relates to the same dispute, has decided to

terminate the proceedings before him in terms of section 11 of the Mediation

Boards Act, as a private plaint cannot be entertained on a matter that had been

duly settled in accordance with the law.

When this matter was considered before the learned High Court Judge of

Kalmunai, the appellant has produced documents marked P-02, P-03, P-04

which were documents not produced before the Magistrate Court. These were

Page 6 of 7

not documents that confirms the appellants claim that the matter was not

settled.

The relevant section 14A of the Mediation Board Act as amended by Mediation

Board (Amendment) Act no 15 of 1997 reads as follows;

14A. Where a settlement of any dispute or offence or the resolution

of any differences that have arisen between the disputants after a

settlement, has not been possible under the provisions of the Act, the

Chairmen or the Chief Mediator, as the case may be, shall issue a

certificate on non- settlement in the prescribed form signed by the

Chairmen or the Chef Mediator, as the case may be, stating that it

has not been possible to settle such dispute or offence by mediation

and stating therein the reason for non-settlement.

It is the view of this Court that for the appellant to claim that the matter was not

settled, he needs to produce a certificate of non-settlement as required by section

14A of the Act, which was not the case.

As viewed correctly by the learned High Court Judge, he has suppressed vital

material facts to the original Court and has come out with new material before

the High Court which have no value in order to challenge the decision of the

learned Magistrate.

It is, therefore, abundantly clear that the appellant had no basis to challenge the

order when he filed the application in revision before the Provincial High Court.

The learned High Court Judge has well considered the factual and legal

provisions in that regard, and had correctly dismissed the application.

Accordingly, I find no reasons to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate

of Samanthurai as well as the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of the

Provincial High Court of Eastern Province holden at Kalmunai.

It is the view of this Court that the appellant has filed this appeal before this

Court, not for anything else, but to cause the maximum possible harassment to

the respondent, knowing very well the strength of his appeal.

The appeal is dismissed as it is devoid of any merit.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High

Court of Kalmunai and to the Magistrate Court of Sammanthurai for

information.
