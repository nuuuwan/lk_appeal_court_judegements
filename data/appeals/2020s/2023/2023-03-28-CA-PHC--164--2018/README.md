MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant revision application has been filed to set aside the order dated

5.6.2018 of the learned High Court Judge Colombo.

In the instant matter the accused appellant petitioner (hereinafter referred to

as the petitioner) has been charged in the Magistrate Court under the

provisions of the Debt recovery act for handing over 3 cheques to the

complainant when his bank account has had no money in the account.

The contention of the petitioner is that he and the petitioner had been

engaged in business for a long time as such he was in the habit of handing over

blank cheques placing only his signature as security. Hence his position is that

merely placing the signature on a blank cheque is not an offence.

The learned High Court Judge had stated that the three cheques which had

been handed over to the complainant by the petitioner is an admission that

the cheques were handed over to the complainant which amounts to an

offence with which the petitioner had been charged with.

According to the evidence led at the trial the petitioner had admitted that he

had handed over the cheques but he had paid all the monies due to the

complainant and the cheques were issued as a form of security.

Hence the petitioner had stated that the amount in the cheques were put by

the complaint and that he never expected the complainant to do so.

But the learned High Court Judge had observed that if the cheques were given

as security and had the petitioner paid the full amount to the petitioner the

most prudent thing the petitioner should have done was to get the cheques

back from the complainant.

Hence upon considering the submissions of both parties it is the considered

view of this Court that the section upon which the petitioner had been charged

with reads as follows,

If a person who draws a cheque knowing that there are no funds or not

sufficient funds in the bank to honor such chequeis guilty of an

offence.

Hence in the instant matter the petitioner and the complainant had admitted

the fact that the alleged cheques issued by the petitioner were issued at the

time when the petitioners bank had no money, and there is no dispute that

they were issued by the petitioner. But the position of the petitioner is that

he had issued the cheques as a form of security and the petitioner had

settled all the monies due to the complainant. The petitioner had led

evidence before the Magistrate that the petitioner had paid all monies due

to the complainant. But the learned Magistrate and the High Court Judge had

failed to consider the same and had held that issuing cheques at the time

Page 5 of 5

when the bank account had no funds constitutes an offence under the

instant act.

But according to many a cases so far decided it has been held that merely

because a cheque bounces it does not constitute a criminal offence if it is

proven the purpose of issuance and the intention of the person who had

issued it. This we observe had been placed before Court in evidence which

the learned judges had overlooked.

Hence we are unable to agree with the findings of the learned High Court

Judge and the Magistrate and as such the instant application for revision is

allowed and the orders of the Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge

are hereby set aside.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

Neil Iddawala J.

I agree.
