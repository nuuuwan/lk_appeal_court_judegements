Other than this he has not stated that he possesses experience at the management level. According to P18 he was the Assistant Director of NILET from 2013, for four years. Accordingly, it appears that the 5th Respondent does not have twelve years of experience from the date of obtaining his bachelors degree. However, according to P18, 5th Respondent served as an Assistant Land Officer at the Urban Development Authority from 1st July 2005 to 2nd February 2013 (P 7 and R5), until he joined NILET. The 5th Respondent submitted that the said post is a third management level post. Accordingly, it was submitted that the Petitioner possesses the required twelve years of experience. The Petitioner submitted document P 8 in support of his contention that the above post is at the management level. However, P 8 is issued on the 25th April 2016 and it is only a little over a year to the date of closing of the applications called under P 3. Therefore, anyway, the Petitioner cannot rely on P 8 to claim that his previous post of Assistant Land Officer fulfils the condition of the required twelve years of experience. Therefore, the observation made by the Secretary to the Ministry of National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Languages in a letter marked P 18, under Clouse 2 (iv), to the effect that the Petitioner has over twelve years of experience in the management level in terms of Circular No. 2/2016 is erroneous. Most importantly, the 5th Respondent completes twelve years of service starting on 1st July 2005 only on the 1st July 2017. The closing date for applications for the position of Director of NILET was 23rd June 2017, less than twelve years from 1st July 2005.",

Thereafter, the Secretary to the Ministry of National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Languages informed the decision of the Ombudsman to the Chairman of the NILET by the latter marked P 21 and requested to discuss the matter at the next management committee meeting. However, according to the document marked P 22, the management committee has decided to change the required qualifications of having a second-class degree into an ordinary pass.

Thereafter an examination was held by the bank and the 1st to 3rd Petitioners who pass the examination were promoted to grade 3-I in the year 2000.

In the fundamental rights application made to the Supreme Court by the Petitioners, the Supreme Court held that the change of procedure of appointment and the scheme in a circular is prejudicial to the Petitioners and was arbitrary and unjustified, though in principle the bank may alter the scheme of recruitment. The Supreme Court was of the view that this amounts to a violation of fundamental rights of the Petitioners under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.",

I have analysed this fact above in this judgment and already held that the 5th Respondents degree falls within the degrees specified in P 3. Be that as it may, the Petitioners interpretation of the degree possessed by the 5th Respondent cannot be considered baseless when the category of the degree is considered. On the face of it, it is a degree of Bachelor of Science (Estate Management and Valuation). This Court arrived at the conclusion that it comes under the category of management, based on the supporting documents tendered by the 5th Respondent which would not have been available to the Petitioner. Therefore, I am not inclined to accept that the above is a misrepresentation of facts. Further, the 5th Respondent submitted that the Petitioner suppressed the fact that the 1st Respondent had called for applications for the post of Director on subsequent occasions and the 5th Respondent verily believes that on all three occasions, the Petitioner applied for the post and was not selected. The Petitioner admitted that she applied for the post on subsequent occasions, but stated that she was not called for the interviews.4 In my view, the subsequent calling for applications for the same post is irrelevant to the case at hand and the 5th Respondents statement that the Petitioner had not been selected on",
