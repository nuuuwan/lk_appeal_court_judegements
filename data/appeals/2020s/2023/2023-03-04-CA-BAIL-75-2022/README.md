The instant application has been filed to obtain under the provisions of the

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses act.

It has been alleged that the instant suspect and the other suspects had

threatened a member of parliament who is a victim of a case pending in the

Magistrates Court on 24.8.2022 and had been produced under the

The Counsel appearing for the respondents objected to the application.

The investigations are not yet over.

The law pertaining to this matter is that a suspect produced and remanded

under this act can be granted bail only upon exceptional circumstances by

the Court of Appeal, and the term exceptional has not been defined in the

act but our legal literature has held that exceptionality has to be determined

by the facts of each case.

Upon considering the submissions of both parties it is the considered view

of this Court that the suspect pertaining to this matter should be enlarged

on bail and as such the instant application for bail is allowed and we direct

the learned Magistrate to enlarge the suspect on suitable conditions of bail.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

Neil Iddawala J.

I agree.
