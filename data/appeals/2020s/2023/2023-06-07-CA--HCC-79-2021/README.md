Chathurangi Mahawaduge, SC for Respondent.

Argued on: 11.05.2023

Decided on: 07.06.2023

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the judgment dated 29.4.2021of the

High Court of Matara.

The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) has been indicted

for a charge of grave sexual abuse under the Penal Code.

The appellant had pleaded not guilty and upon the conclusion of the trial the

appellant had been found guilty for the charge and had been sentenced to 12

years rigorous imprisonment with a fine and a default sentence.

The grounds of appeal raised by the Counsel for the appellant were as follows,

1) The victim had not signed the statement to the police , 2) The time of the offence not being clearly established by the prosecution, 3) The evidence of the lay witnesses and the police observations being

contrary to each other, 4) The case history given by the victim to the doctor being contrary to the

observations of the doctor,

Page 3 of 5

5) As such the story of the prosecution being highly improbable.

The version of the prosecution is that the appellant had been living with the

mother of the victim and the mother of the victim has had four other children by

another man. On the day of the incident the victim had been in the house of the

appellants sister and the appellant had brought her home and had sexually

abused her. On the very same day the victim had told the mother and the incident

had been reported to the police. The doctor who examined her had given

evidence and the history given by the victim to the doctor is that of sexual abuse

but the doctor had detected a redness in the vaginal area and he had said that it

could be due to a bacterial infection.

The appellant had given evidence on oath and he had said that he had been

married earlier and he had met the victims mother at the bus halt at Matara and

the children had been begging and he had brought them home and they had

started a family but there had been constant disputes and one fine day the

victims mother had entered hospital with two of the children, and later he had

been arrested by the police. He has totally denied the charge.

The Counsel for the appellant stated that the statement of the victim had not

been signed and he said that as such it amounts to not having made a statement

because it carriers no and not even the thumb impression of the victim. As such

the Counsel for the appellant averred that it almost amounts to the victim not

having made a statement to police which means that the evidence adduced in

Court is narrated for the first time after the incident.

The Counsel appearing for the respondents conceded that the statement has not

been dully signed by the victim and she averred that it could be accepted because

she was a minor. But this Court sees no merit in the said submission because

Page 4 of 5

section 110(10) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code has very clearly stated

that every statement made by a witness should be dully signed and any alteration

made during recording also should be dully initialed by the witness, therefore, the

section nowhere states that a minor need not sign a statement made to the police.

If the statement had not been signed it amounts to the fact that the evidence led

in Court is of less value because it amounts to being narrated in Court for the first

time which challenges the truthfulness of the evidence. Therefore, we are unable

to agree with the Counsel for the respondents.

The next point raised by the Counsel for the appellant is that the time of the

incident had not been established by the prosecution, which the counsel for the

respondents also conceded although the victim had said at different times in her

evidence that the incident took place in the afternoon. But she was not very

certain about it but if her narration of the incident is being told first time in Court

every other thing, she had said creates a doubt in the case for the prosecution

which should be held for the benefit of the appellant.

The next point raised by the Counsel for the appellant is the fact that in the

evidence of the victim she says that she was brought home by the appellant from

his sisters house which is also situated nearby. But the evidence of the mother is

that the appellant had brought both children home from Kadirs house which

throws a serious doubt because if so, how come the appellant had an opportunity

to sexually abuse the victim because she had not been alone with the appellant.

Secondly it throws a serious doubt in the credibility of the evidence of the victim

and is contradicting the mothers evidence which reduces the credibility of the

prosecution version and raises a serious doubt with regard to the probability of

the story of the prosecution.

The Counsel for the prosecution strenuously argued that in spite of all these

infirmities that the story for the prosecution is worthy of acceptance but we are

unable to agree with her because we believe that in a criminal case the burden is

on the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and not the

accused .

The Counsel for the appellant further averred that the history recorded by the

doctor is contrary to the findings of his, and we too observe that it is so and we

find that the trial judge had narrated evidence of the prosecution but had not

analyzed the same because had he done so he was bound to have noticed the

infirmities mentioned above.

As such we find the story of the prosecution to be highly improbable and that they

had not exercised their duty in proving their case beyond a reasonable doubt.

As such we set aside the conviction and the sentence of the trial judge and we

allow the instant appeal.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
