The Petitioner primarily seeks a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the

decision of the 1st Respondent - Registrar General of Marriages for Sri Lanka (Registrar)

reflected in his letter dated 19.03.2021, marked A12. By way of the said letter the Registrar

has informed the Petitioner that when a marriage is registered as per the laws of Sri Lanka he

is unable to recognize, under the prevailing laws of this country, a dissolution of such

marriage obtained in a foreign country. Further, he has opined in the said A12 that the

Petitioner ought to obtain a decree from a competent court in Sri Lanka filing a divorce action.

Additionally, the Petitioner seeks mandates in the nature of a writ of Mandamus directing the

Page 3 of 10

Registrar and other Respondents to give legal effect to the decree of divorce dissolving the

marriage between the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent issued by a Family Court in England.

Based on the contents of the motion dated 17.03.2023 filed on behalf of the Petitioner, this

Court is convinced that sufficient evidence has been tendered to Court in proof of serving

notices of this Application on the 3rd Respondent who was absent and unrepresented

throughout these proceedings. The other Respondents and the Petitioner agreed on

18.09.2023 that the instant Application may be dealt with and determined solely on the basis

of written submissions.

In focus of the factual matrix, the Petitioner who is a dual citizen of Sri Lanka and the United

Kingdom ('UK'), married the 3rd Respondent on 09.12.2010 in Colombo, Sri Lanka, evinced

by the certificate of marriage marked A3. Thereafter, the 3rd Respondent also migrated to

the UK where both the said parties established their matrimonial home. However, due to the

subsequent breakdown of their marriage, the Petitioner has instituted an action for divorce,

bearing No.1955/D/15 (Vide - A5) in the District Court of Kaduwela. Nevertheless, in

response, the legal representatives of the 3rd Respondent informed the District Court of

Kaduwela that the 3rd Respondent had, by that time, filed for divorce in the Family Court at

Kingston-Upon-Thames in England, bearing case No. BV15D22438. Due to this reason, on

19.02.2016 the Petitioner withdrew the said divorce case in the Kaduwela District Court (Vide

- A7). The Petitioner states that subsequently, by a decree issued on 02.05.2018 by the said

Court in England the marriage between the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent was dissolved.

The documents marked A8(a) and A8(b) are annexed as supporting evidence for the decree

certifying their dissolution of marriage.

Following the dissolution of the first marriage, the Petitioner entered into another marriage

on 20.08.2019 at a Marriage Registration Office in Bangkok, Thailand and seemingly the

relevant documents are marked as A10(a) and A10(b).

Consequently, by way of a letter dated 08.02.2021 marked A11, the Petitioner has requested

from the Registrar that legal effect be given in Sri Lanka to the decree of dissolution of

marriage obtained in England and to record such dissolution by

disregarding/invalidating/removing the entry of the marriage with the 3rd Respondent from

Page 4 of 10

the relevant register. However, by the aforesaid impugned letter marked A12, the Registrar

(through the 2nd Respondent) informed the Petitioner that the divorce obtained in England

could not be recognized in Sri Lanka, as per the advice received from the Attorney Generals

Department and that the Petitioner should obtain a Divorce, especially from a competent

court in Sri Lanka.

I must now consider the law applicable in Sri Lanka with respect to the dissolution of

marriage. Section 19 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance No.19 of 1907 ('Ordinance')

reads:

(1) No marriage shall be dissolved during the lifetime of the parties except by judgment

of divorce a vinculo matrimonii pronounced in some competent court.

(2) Such judgment shall be founded either on the ground of adultery subsequent to

marriage, or of malicious desertion, or of incurable impotency at the time of such

marriage.

(3) Every court in Sri Lanka having matrimonial jurisdiction is hereby declared

competent to dissolve a marriage on any such ground.

In terms of the above provisions, a marriage registered under Sri Lankan law can be dissolved

by any court in Sri Lanka having matrimonial jurisdiction. The grounds for such dissolution

are mentioned in the above section 19(2) apart from the relevant provisions in the Civil

Procedure Code (CPC). The Chapter XLII of the CPC declares the procedure in

matrimonial actions. It is clear that the said section 19 applies to general marriages registered

under the above Ordinance, thus, the provisions in section 19(1) also deal with such

marriages. However, in terms of the said section 19(1), a marriage registered under Sri Lankan

law can be dissolved by some competent court. The question that arises, in this case, is

whether a competent court in a foreign country also comes within the purview of such a term:

some competent court.

It is important to note that, by virtue of the said section 19(1) and the provisions of section

596 of the CPC, refers to a divorce of a vinculo matrimonii, a Latin term which is usually

identified as the chain or bond of matrimony. The Legislature in its wisdom has avoided

Page 5 of 10

using the words divorce of a marriage or divorce from the spouse but has used the phrase

divorce of a vinculo matrimonii in the respective provisions of Law. This, in my view, has an

impact to a certain extent on the question that needs to be resolved in this case.

The Petitioner argues that no limitation is drawn in the said section 19(1) upon the term

some competent court limiting such court only to a court of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the

Petitioner contends that some competent court abroad, i.e. one which is vested with powers

of dissolution of marriage, may exercise such powers to dissolve a marriage that is entered in

Sri Lanka. Further, it is submitted that in the absence of an express provision in Section 19(1)

that ousts the jurisdiction of foreign courts in respect of dissolving a marriage, it is a necessary

implication that Sri Lanka can recognize decisions in divorce actions instituted in competent

courts in other countries.

Asokan Nee Kandasamy v. Asokan (1994) 1 SLR 413 is a case where the Plaintiff-Petitioner

instituted an action for divorce against her husband in the District Court of Colombo on the

ground of malicious desertion (constructive) and also claimed the custody of the two children

born as a result of the marriage. The marriage in question took place in India, and the parties

lived in Madras until the Petitioner had to quit the matrimonial home owing to the

matrimonial fault of the husband. She came to her parental home in Colombo in the year

1990 with her two children. Thereafter she instituted the action above and summons were

served on the Defendant through a solicitor residing in Madras and the Ministry of Justice

via Sri Lanka Consular in Madras. The defendant did not appear at all to defend the action.

The District Judge dismissed the action, inter-alia, on the basis that section 597 of the CPC is

not applicable since the marriage was contracted in Madras and as such the court has no

jurisdiction in respect of a marriage contracted outside Sri Lanka.

I wish to borrow the below articulations formulated by the distinguished Judge Ananda Grero

in the above case, in resolving the issues of the case in hand:

Section 19 of the Marriage (General) Ordinance read with Section 24 of Judicature Act, and

also with Section 3 of the Judicature (Amendment) Act No. 71 of 1981 reveals that divorce

jurisdiction is exercisable by the District Court irrespective of where the marriage was contracted.

Page 6 of 10

Section 597 of the Civil Procedure Code does not prohibit a court from entertaining a plaint where

malicious desertion took place outside Sri Lanka. This section read with section 19 of the

Marriages (General) Ordinance does not preclude a competent District Court to entertain a plaint

where it appears from the plaint that the party resides within its local jurisdiction and alleges a

ground for divorce as contemplated in Section 19 of the Marriages (General) Ordinance.

The learned Additional District Judge was of the opinion that a wife's domicile is, that of the

husband, and it is a court of the husband's domicile that has jurisdiction to grant a divorce. She

was attracted by the decision of Le Mesurier v. Le Mesurier1

As rightly submitted by the learned Counsel for the plaintiff-petitioner in his written submissions,

the matrimonial law has undergone several changes since the decision of the aforesaid case. As

contended by the learned Counsel for the plaintiff-petitioner, the Supreme Court in the above

stated case held that the District Court of Matara had no jurisdiction notwithstanding Chapter

42 of the Civil Procedure Code, because the law, Registration (Marriages, Birth & Deaths)

Ordinance No. 6 of 1847 gave divorce jurisdiction to the District Court only to a marriage

contracted locally. But it is not so as the law stands today. In the result, the decision of the Le

Mesurier case has no application to the marriage contracted by the plaintiff-petitioner in the

present case.

The decision in the above Asokan Nee Kandasamy case provokes the question as to whether a

marriage entered in Sri Lanka can be dissolved in some competent court outside Sri Lanka,

as it determines that divorce jurisdiction is exercisable by the Sri Lankan courts irrespective

of the place where the marriage was contracted. Now I must advert to the below vital critiques

on divorce laws of Sri Lanka, made by Shirani Ponnambalam in Law and the Marriage

Relationship in Sri Lanka 2nd Revised Edition, Lake House Investments Ltd, pp. 304 to 311.

The inevitable outcome of a mixed divorce law would be to give people wanting to rid themselves

of marriage a last resort when they find that they cannot succeed on any other ground.

Matrimonial misconduct and the breakdown theory are therefore mutually inconsistent grounds

and the Sri Lankan legislature should either substitute the breakdown theory for the theory

1 1NLR 160

Page 7 of 10

founded on matrimonial guilt or improve the application of the fault based grounds for divorce

entrenched in the Marriage Registration Ordinance. (at page 305)

It is interesting to note that the Sri Lankan divorce laws as set out in the Civil Procedure Code,

are an innovation which do not resemble either the South African or the English law position.

Both the recently enacted Divorce Act of South Africa and the Matrimonial Causes Act of

England require proof of an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage as a prerequisite for the

award of a decree of divorce. Consequently, the court is the ultimate arbitrator on the state of the

marriage relationship and inevitably this helps to ensure that only a union which is utterly and

hopelessly broken down receives judicial sanction. In other words, the courts, in effect, confer de

jure recognition on a de facto state of affairs and this is clearly justifiable on the premise that both

from the point of view of the parties concerned, and society at large, it is far more equitable to

come to terms with the reality of a situation, thereby providing every encouragement to the

unfortunate parties to rehabilitate and adjust to a new way of life, rather than to perpetuate the

unhappy existence of an empty shell of marriage. (at page 306 & 307)

The above point of view of Shirani Ponnambalam, in my view, focuses on the fact that the

principle of irretrievable breakdown of marriage should be given prominence over fault based

grounds for divorce.

Why does a divorce of vinculo matrimonii need legal sanction? One aspect of the answer to this

question may be that such sanction is required to resolve consequential issues such as

distribution of property, child custody, alimony, child access and child support. In addition

to that, such sanction is, to my mind, paramount for the better manifestation of vinculo

matrimonii and to tighten the relationship between the husband and wife, enhancing the family

concept. The protection of children and their rights also can be linked to this social concept.

Although the instant Application deals with the provisions relating to divorce in the said

Ordinance, enacted in 1907 during the British period, several other laws have also been

established in Sri Lanka to deal with marriage and divorce. This includes the Kandyan

Marriage and Divorce Act which was enacted post-independence in 1952 and the Muslim

Marriage and Divorce Act which was enacted in 1951. I cannot see any restrictions being

imposed by law against the choice of any person who is subjected either to Kandyan law or

Page 8 of 10

to Muslim law, to select the relevant law that he/she should get their marriage registered. On

the other hand, it is observed that parties to a marriage under the Kandyan Marriage and

Divorce Act, are expected to apply to the District Registrar for a dissolution of marriage and

not to a court of law.

In this case, the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent have chosen to tie the nuptial knot under

the said Ordinance in Sri Lanka. However, both parties have migrated to the UK and are

blessed with a child. As a result of the breakdown of the vinculo matrimonii both parties have

opted to proceed with the legal proceedings in England to get their matrimonial bond

dissolved. If there is a stringent law that prevents parties who opted to get their marriage

registered in Sri Lanka, from seeking a divorce vinculo matrimonii in another country based on

genuine reasons, they may ordinarily face severe hardship including physical, mental and

financial agony. The obligation to provide for the necessary care, support and maintenance

including medical expenses of a dependent child or the spouse living in another country also

needs to be taken into consideration in this regard. Thereby, at large the rights of the members

of a family, including children will be affected to an extent unknown to others if a narrow

interpretation is given to the provisions of the said section 19(1). I believe that the

inconvenience explained above will eventually go against the intention of the legislature

embodied in the said section 19(1) as our laws generally do not intend to affect the rights of

any person in society when making laws.

In light of the above and with a close examination of related laws and the legal jurisprudence

I hold that there cannot be any restrictions for a marriage entered into in Sri Lanka under the

said Ordinance to be dissolved in a competent court in a foreign country, if such court opines

that such dissolution could be permitted under their laws. Thus, I am inclined to accept the

proposition of the Petitioner that the legislature has not intended to limit the words some

competent court of the said section 19(1) only to a court in Sri Lanka.

Anyhow, the competence of such foreign court regarding the term some competent court

should be assessed, with additional guidelines. One of such is to ascertain whether the law of

such a country has bestowed the jurisdiction to the respective court to dissolve marriages

entered into in a foreign territory. Secondly, it is quintessential that both parties who entered

into the contract of marriage in Sri Lanka have been residing in the respective country, for a

Page 9 of 10

reasonable period of time when applying for a divorce. Thirdly, I take the view that both the

husband and wife should actively participate in such divorce proceedings in a foreign court

while being subjected to the procedure adopted in such court concerning matrimonial actions.

I have taken the initiative to provide the above three guidelines in order to avoid either of the

parties being deprived of any right that they derived from the registration of their marriage

under the said Ordinance in Sri Lanka. For the reasons set out above, a valid decree of

dissolution of marriage entered into in a foreign country can be given effect, when necessary,

within Sri Lanka, subject to other laws of this country and the above guidelines formulated

by me. I am convinced that the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent have fulfilled all of the

above necessary criteria when obtaining their decree of divorce in England.

Hence, the final issue that remains is whether the Petitioner is entitled to a mandate in the

nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision reflected in the impugned document

marked 'A12'. Based on my findings above, I cannot agree with the opinion of the Registrar

that the Petitioner ought to obtain a divorce decree after instituting a divorce action in a court

in Sri Lanka at a time where the vinculo matrimonii between the Petitioner and the 3rd

Respondent have been dissolved by a competent court in England. Thus, in no way can it be

assumed that it is lawful for the Petitioner to institute another divorce case in Sri Lanka as

erroneously recommended by the Registrar since the Petitioner has already entered into his

second contract of marriage in Thailand. Therefore, I hold that the document marked 'A12'

should be quashed.

Having considered the main question of law, what remains to be examined is whether a duty

has been cast upon the Registrar in terms of the said Ordinance in Sri Lanka to place on record

in the relevant register about any divorce of a vinculo matrimonii declared by a local or foreign

court of law by invalidating/removing the entry of such marriage initially registered in Sri

Lanka. Although I am unaware of any extraneous arrangements made between the Registrar

and the Registrars of District Courts, in reference to divorce decrees, I need to stress that there

doesn't appear to be any express provision in the said Ordinance that bound the Registrar to

execute such a duty whenever a District Court of Sri Lanka issues a divorce decree. Therefore,

I am unable to grant any of the mandates in the nature of writs of Mandamus as prayed for

in the prayer of the Petition. Nevertheless, my determination should not be an impediment

Page 10 of 10

for any relevant party to get a declaration, if they wish, under section 217 of the CPC from a

District Court in Sri Lanka confirming or establishing the dissolution of marriage which has

taken place in a foreign country. Likewise, there cannot be any restriction for a District Court

in this country to accept a valid document, during any appropriate proceedings, establishing

a dissolution of a marriage (entered into in Sri Lanka) by a competent court in another

country, however, it must be subject to the guidelines spelled out above by me and the

provisions of the law relating to evidence.

In these circumstances, I proceed to issue a writ of Certiorari against the 1st and 2nd

Respondents quashing the decisions reflected in 'A12'. However, I am not inclined to grant

any other reliefs prayed for in the prayer of the Petition.
