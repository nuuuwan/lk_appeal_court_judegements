Iddawala J

The instant revision application is filed on 13.12.2019 against a judgment of the

High Court of Colombo. At the argument stage on the 15.03.2022, the Presidents

Counsel for the absolute owner-claimant-petitioner-3rd respondent (hereinafter

the absolute owner), raised a preliminary objection on the basis that the

complainant-claimant-3rd respondent-petitioner (hereinafter the petitioner) has

violated Rule 3(4) and Rule 4 of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules

1990 (hereinafter, Court of Appeal Rules) by not filing counter-affidavit and

written submissions on time. It is the learned Presidents Counsels assertion that

as such, as the petitioner has shown to be negligent, this Court should dismiss

this application in limine. (Initially, the absolute owner mentioned this

preliminary objection on 15.03. 2022 and sought to file a motion setting out the

said objections with notice to all parties. Accordingly, a motion dated 17 .05 2022

was filed).

Subsequently, matter came up for arguments on 22.11.2022. The Presidents

Counsel appearing for the absolute owner reiterated the said objections based on

the motion dated 17.05.2022. This Court reserved its order and directed both

parties to file written submissions on the said objection.

This matter must be traced back to the year 2020 in order to make a

determination on the question at hand. As per the Journal Entries, this Court

has ordered both parties to file written submissions by the 26th August 2020 and

the matter has been fixed for inquiry on the 25th of November 2020. The absolute

owner Mercantile Investments and Finance PLC has duly filed written

submissions on the given date. The petitioner has filed his counter-affidavit on

2nd March 2022 and written submissions on 11th March 2022, after a significant

lapse.

Given the above context wherein the petitioner failed to submit the written

submissions and the respective counter affidavits on the date fixed by the court,

in short, this Court is concerned with the following two questions:

6

CA-PHC-APN-CPA-159-19 Page 6 of 11 07/02/2023 IJ-06-23

(1) whether the Petitioner is in violation of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules 1990

(2) whether a violation warrants a dismissal of the case in limine?

In answering the first question as to whether the Petitioner is in violation of the

Court of Appeal Rules, a closer look should be taken at them. The relevant Rules

3(4) and 4 are as follows:

Rule 3(4)

Where upon such application being supported, the Court orders the issue of notice

(a) the Court shall fix the date for the tendering by the petitioner of the requisite

notices, together with such number of copies of his application as there are

respondents, and stamped addressed envelopes for dispatch of such notices by

registered post to the respondents, it being the duty of the petitioner to ensure the

accuracy of such notices, copies and addresses; if no date is fixed by the Court,

the petitioner shall tender such notices, copies, and envelopes within two weeks;

(b) the Court shall fix the dates for the filing of statements of objections by the

respondents, for the filing of counter affidavits by the petitioner, and for the hearing

of the application; if any of such dates is not fixed by the Court, the following

provisions shall apply: -

(i) a statement of objections shall be filed by each respondent within four weeks of

the date of service of notice;

(ii). Counter affidavit if any, shall be filed by the petitioner within four weeks of of

the date of receipt of the statements of objections; and

(iii) the date of hearing shall be fixed by the Registrar;

Rule 4

Part III Written submissions in the Court of Appeal

7

CA-PHC-APN-CPA-159-19 Page 7 of 11 07/02/2023 IJ-06-23

4(2) No party to an appeal shall be entitled to be heard unless he has previously

lodged three copies of his written submissions, complying with the provisions of

this rule

4(5) The submissions of the respondent shall contain as concisely as possible

(a) Statement in reply to the appellants or petitioners statement of facts,

confirming whether, and if not to what extent, the respondent agrees with

such statement of facts; and a statement of other relevant facts, referring to

the evidence, both oral and documentary, (and whenever possible the pages

of the brief or record at which such evidence appears), indicating which of

such facts, according to the respondent, have been established or are

otherwise no longer in dispute, and which facts are disputed;

4(6) Where a party fails to lodge submissions, or lodges submissions which are not

in substantial compliance with the foregoing provisions, the Court may restrict the

duration of the oral submissions of such party at the hearing of the appeal or

application to 45 minutes.

4(7) The appellant shall within six weeks of the filing of the petition of appeal, and

the petitioner within six weeks of the filing of the respondents statement of

objections, (as the case may be) lodge his submissions at the Registry, and shall

forthwith give notice thereof to each respondent by serving on him a copy of such

submissions.

4(8) The respondent shall within six weeks of the receipt of notice of the lodging of

the appellants or petitioners submissions, lodge his submissions at the Registry,

and shall forthwith give notice thereof to the appellant and to every other

respondent, by serving on each of them a copy of such submissions. Where the

appellant or petitioner has failed to lodge his submissions as required by sub-rule

(7), the respondent shall lodge his submissions within twelve weeks of the filing of

the petition of appeal, or the respondents statement of objections (as the case may

be), giving notice in like manner.

4(9) Every party shall tender to the Registrar, not less than one week before the

date first fixed for the hearing of an appeal or application, a complete list of the

8

CA-PHC-APN-CPA-159-19 Page 8 of 11 07/02/2023 IJ-06-23

authorities which he proposes to refer to or rely on at the hearing of an appeal or

application, a complete list of the authorities which he proposes to refer to or rely

on at the hearing so as to ensure that there is full disclosure and to preclude

surprise

4(10) A party shall not be obliged to file submissions in conformity with the

provisions of the preceding sub-rules, if

a) the duration of the oral submissions on behalf of such party at the hearing

of the appeal or application will be confined to a period of 45 minutes;

In addition to the above, Rule 3(1) is also of use in this matter.

Rule 3(1)

3(1)(a) Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the

powers vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the Constitution

shall be by way of petition, together with an affidavit in support of the

averments therein, and shall be accompanied by the originals of documents

material to such application (or duly certified-copies thereof) in the form of

exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender any such document, he shall

state the reason for such document later. Where a petitioner fails to comply

with the provisions of this rule the Court may, ex mero motu or at the instance

of any party, dismiss such application. (Emphasis added)

Accordingly, if one examines Rule 3(4) in light of Rule 3(1), it is clear that while

Rule 3(1) envisages that the petitioner not submitting the petition, affidavit, and

any original documents cited in them are grounds for dismissal of application

preliminarily, Rule 3(4) does not envisage a dismissal of the application for

violation of it.

Furthermore, Rule 4(6) is indicative of the Courts discretion of restricting oral

submissions to 45 minutes, in a situation where a party fails to lodge

submissions or submits not in compliance with Rule 4. The Rule does not

envisage the application being dismissed on such ground of absence of

submissions.

CA-PHC-APN-CPA-159-19 Page 9 of 11 07/02/2023 IJ-06-23

However, the compliance to CA Rules is of imperative importance for the

sustenance of the application. There is a plethora of authorities decided by

superior courts on the matter of adherence to CA rules. In R. A. Ranasinghe v

A. G. CA/PHC/185/2011 CA Minute dated 05.08.2015, the matter of non-

compliance of the rules was discussed with a line of authorities to hold that .

Non-compliance with the Rules is fatal to the application. Parties who invoke the

jurisdiction of the Court cannot ignore the Rules and then ask to be heard. It is to

the best interest of the administration of Justice that Judges shall not ignore or

deviate from the procedural law and decide matters on equity and justice Dr.

Amarasinghe J. as pointed out in the case of Fernando vs. Sybil Fernando and

Others (1997) 3 SLR 12 - there is the substantive law and the procedural law.

Procedural law is not secondary. The two branches are complementary. Halsbury

points out it is by procedure that the law which puts life into substantive law, gives

it remedy and effectiveness and brings it into being - Hence, in the interests of the

administration of justice, there must be order, and therefore there must be

compliance with the Rules of the Court of Appeal.

It is clear by the above authority that in order to duly conduct the administration

of justice, the compliance to CA rules is of paramount importance. Hence as the

rationale behind such mandatory compliance is the interest of justice, the parties

to an application shall first and foremost respect such procedural law to maintain

order and justice duly.

Furthermore, in the case of Koralage vs. Marikkar Mohamed and others (1988)

2 SLR 299, it was held, compliance of the Rules is a mandatory requirement and

non-compliance is a material defect in the application and cannot maintain the

application, therefore accordingly in the instant application as the petitioner has

not adhered to the CA Rules 3 (4) (b), and 4 there appears a material defect in

the application, however read with Rule 4 (6), the question remains whether a

delay in submitting the counter affidavits and the submissions warrants a

preliminary dismissal.

In furtherance, the authority laid out by the case Ranaweera v Mahaweli

Authority of Sri Lanka and Another (2004) 2 SLR 346, can be quoted which

10

CA-PHC-APN-CPA-159-19 Page 10 of 11 07/02/2023 IJ-06-23

has analogous facts to the instant application. Here, His Lordship Marsoof J

(PC/A) observed that The objective of this Rule appears to be to give an

opportunity to a party in default to take steps to comply with the rules of Court. In

my view of the petitioner should have objected to the alleged "Objections" filed by

the respondents by way of motion and had the matter referred for an Order of

Court. Instead, the petitioner has chosen to file counter affidavit wherein he taken

up the question of non-compliance with Rules in the said counter affidavit. In terms

of Rule 3 (4)(b)(i) counter affidavits have to be filed by the petitioner within 4 weeks

of the date of receipt of the Statement of Objection, unless a different date is fixed

by Court which was what happened in this case. By filing counter affidavits, the

petitioner has waived the right to take objection to the non-compliance of the rules

by the respondents.

In the instant application the Court fixed a date for the filing of the objections of

the parties on or before 23.07.2020 and to file the respective written submissions

on or before 26.08.2020. However, without adherence to such fixed dates, the

petitioner filed his counter affidavits on the 02.03.2022 and filed the written

submissions on 11.03.2022 by way of motion.

Nonetheless, as per Rule 4 and the Rule 4 (6) of CA rules, there is a requirement

of submitting the written submissions duly before this court and in the instance

of failure to do so, warrants the discretion of this court in restricting the oral

submissions of the party to 45 minutes and does not warrant a dismissal of the

application on account of such absence of the submissions.

Therefore, there arises a question as to whether the petitioners failure to submit

the written submissions and the respective counter-affidavits on the date fixed

by the court, warrants a dismissal of the application as opposed to not submitting

the submissions and the affidavits altogether. The answer is in the negative.

While the Petition and affidavit with material documents are vital to the progress

of the case, and without them the matter can be dismissed as per the Rule 3(1),

counter-affidavit is a document that is supplementary or optional rather than

mandatory document for the progress of the case.

11

CA-PHC-APN-CPA-159-19 Page 11 of 11 07/02/2023 IJ-06-23

Furthermore, it is apparent that Rules 3(4) and 4 do not specify a dismissal of

the action for delays in submitting written submissions/counter-affidavit. But as

per Rule 4(6), violation of it by not submitting written submissions in compliance

with, it will entitle the petitioners oral submissions at the hearing being restricted

to 45 minutes.

Hence, it is determined by this Court that the Preliminary objection, to dismiss

the petitioners application in limine, raised by the learned Presidents Counsel

appearing for the respondent absolute owner is over-ruled; and the matter is fixed

for argument without accepting the delayed submissions (counter-affidavit filed

on 2nd March 2022 and written submissions filed on 11th March 2022) as part of

the petitioners pleadings.
