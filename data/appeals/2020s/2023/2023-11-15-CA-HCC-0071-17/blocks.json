The prosecutrix named Susantha Kumari Basnayaka (witness No. 3) also admitted this. As per the evidence led in the trial, the commission of an offence was within the Polpithigama police area. Also the Yangalmodara mentioned in the first charge is situated beyond the 3 police areas from Melsiripura. Therefore, the 1st charge is levelled against the 5th accused-appellant is totally contrary to section 165 of the Criminal Procedure Code. According to the provisions of section 165 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the place of the commitment of the offence must be included for the charge invariably.
