MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the judgment dated 25.10.2018

of the High Court of Colombo.

The accused appellant had been found guilty for offences under section 296

and 315 of the Penal Code.

When the matter was taken up for argument the Counsel appearing for the

appellant wanted this Court to consider the sentence of the appellant but the

learned Counsel for respondents objected to the application.

The version of the prosecution is that on the day of the incident the deceased

had been stabbed by the appellant twice and the appellant had stabbed the

injured Anuradha as well. This had been testified to by the injured Anuradha

and the PW1. The learned trial judge had considered the evidence of the

prosecution eye witness and the injured and had concluded that the

discrepancies marked does not go to the root of the prosecution case.

The deceased is supposed to have sustained 9 injuries out of which two had

been stab injuries and one of the said stab injuries which had been near the

chest had cut a main blood vessel and the same had been the cause of death.

The injured Anuradha had also received one injury which also had been

observed by the doctor and which he had said could have been caused by the

knife recovered on the statement of the appellant.

The police upon receiving the information had commenced the investigations

and had recovered a knife subsequent to the statement of the appellant. The

doctor had said that the injuries on the deceased could have been caused by

the knife recovered subsequent to the statement of the appellant.

According to the police and the prosecution witnesses there had been ample

light at the scene of crime.

The appellant had made a statement from the dock and the trial judge had

disregarded the said statement stating that it does not create a reasonable

doubt in the case for the prosecution.

The defense witness also had been disbelieved for the same reason.

Therefore, in totality the trial judge had concluded that the conduct of the

appellant had been very intentional and he had made no mistake in stabbing

the deceased and the injured person, and the appellant had been convicted for

murder on the basis of section 294 (3) of the Penal code and section 315 of the

same.

Upon analyzing the reasoning of the trial judge and the evidence led before him

we find that there is clear evidence of the appellant stabbing the deceased and

the injured for no reason and when the injured had tried to stop the stabbing,

he too had been stabbed which is very clear of the intention of the appellant

and this is further substantiated by the nature of the injuries on the deceased

and the place of the injuries of the deceased.

As observed by the trial judge the dock statement put forward by the defense

in fact contradicts the position of the defense with regard to the line of cross

examination of the prosecution witnesses. At this point this Court draws its

attention to the case of Queen vs Kularatne 71 NLR 529 where it has specified

as to how a dock statement should be considered. It has held that

1) If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon,

2) If it raises a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case of the

prosecution the defense must succeed and,

3) It must not be used against another accused.

In the instant matter the trial judge had concluded that the dock

statement does not create a reasonable doubt in the case for the

prosecution hence he has disregarded the same.

Furthermore, this Court observes that it had not been put to the prosecution

witnesses that it was the deceased who struck the appellant and not vice versa.

The evidence of the defense witness also does not say that she saw any incident

but has heard but as concluded by the trial judge she had appeared to be a

partisan witness to the defense. Therefore, in our view the trial judge had very

rightly concluded that the defense had not created a reasonable doubt in the

prosecution case.

It has been held in the case of Sunil Jayaratne vs Attorney General 2011 2 Sri

LR 92 that unless there is a grave miscarriage of justice it would not be

appropriate to interfere with the judgment of the trial judge who enters

judgment after careful consideration of the first hand evidence put before

him to which the judges of the appellate courts would not have the ability to

witness.

As such we see no merit in the submissions of the counsel for the accused

Appellant hence the conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial judge is

hereby affirmed, and the appeal is dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
