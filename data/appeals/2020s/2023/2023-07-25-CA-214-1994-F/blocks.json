The original Plaintiff had instituted this action in the District Court of Kurunegala seeking for a declaration to the effect that the deed No. 2643 (P4) is null and void or in the alternative to cancel the aforesaid deed, for a judgement to the effect that the Plaintiff was entitled and is obliged to sell the land in dispute to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants and for a declaration that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants are the owners of the land in suit. The Plaintiffs case was that the Plaintiff was intoxicated at the time of the execution of the deed marked P4 which was in favour of the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff had signed the deed under duress. It was also the case of Plaintiff that the Plaintiff had sold the property to the Petitioners and the Petitioners are the owners of the land in suit. The 1st Defendant by his answer had only sought for a dismissal of the Plaintiffs case. The 2nd and 3rd Defendants (the Petitioners) in their answer had prayed for a declaration to the effect that they are the owners of the land. They had also prayed for the ejectment of the 1st Defendant from the land and to put them in possession. The Petitioners state that the Plaintiff admitted the fact that he executed the deed No. 36 (marked P5) in favour of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants (the Petitioners) and that deed was never challenged at the trial. Neither the 1st Defendant nor any other party had sought to invalidate that deed which is in favour of the Petitioners. The validity of the deed No. 36 (P5) was never an issue before the District Court and neither party had raised any issue disputing the validity of that deed. The dispute was whether the deed marked P4 was duly executed. This court had upheld the findings of the learned District Judge on the issue of intoxication and undue influence and granted the reliefs prayed for in paragraphs a, b and c of the prayer to the plaint. Further, this court has held that the transfers effected by the deeds marked P4 and P5 are null and void as they had been executed without the prior permission of the government agent. The",

    "text": "had not been obtained before the execution of that deed. In coming to that decision the court had ignored the fact, no doubt by mistake that the Plaintiff or the 1st Defendant had never prayed for such a relief. Instead the Plaintiff had prayed for a declaration to the effect that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants are the owners of the corpus in dispute, a relief which had not been granted by the District Court. Now the substituted Plaintiffs are attempting to eject the 2nd and 3rd Defendants from the corpus on the basis of that finding of this court for which the original Plaintiff never prayed for in his plaint. This court had come to the aforesaid conclusion without paying due attention to the amendments introduced to the Land Development Ordinance. If the court was mindful of the amendments brought in to the section 42 of the Land Development Ordinance by the amending Act No. 16 of 1969 and the introduction of the new section 159B(c) by Land Development Amendment Act No. 27 of 1981 the court would not have arrived at that conclusion. By inadvertence or oversight the court has come to the aforesaid conclusion in ignorance of the existence of the aforesaid statutory provisions of the Land Development Ordinance. Therefore, this is a case which clearly comes within the definition of per incuriam.",
