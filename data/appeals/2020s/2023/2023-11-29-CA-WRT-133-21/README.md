Respondents

Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

S. U. B. KARALLIYADDE, J. Counsel: Shantha Jayawardena with Ms. Hiranya Damunupola and Ms. Azra Basheer for the Petitioners. Ms. Nayomi Kahawita S. C. for the Respondents. Argued on: 18.05.2023 Written Submissions on: 28.08.2023 (by the Petitioners) Decided on: 29.11.2023 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioners in this Application are seeking Orders in the nature of Writs

of Mandamus pursuing several directions for inter alia, increasing vacancies

for admission of students to government schools for Grade 6 for the year 2021,

determination of cut-off marks of the 2020 Grade 5 scholarship examination

for admission to Grade 6 of government schools for 2021 based on calculation

of vacancies, additional intakes for Grade 6 and also Orders seeking

publication and adoption of certain criteria.

Page 7 of 10

This Application concerns the admission of students including the Petitioners,

to Grade 6 classes based on their performance at the Grade 5 scholarship

examination. It is submitted that the scholarship exam was introduced in

1948 with the objectives of providing an equal opportunity for every child to

pursue their education and goals based on his or her performance and merit,

and to admit talented students to better schools of higher grade with improved

systems and infrastructure and also to provide bursaries to bright, but

economically disadvantaged, students. The exam measures the ability and

learning potential across 14 specified areas, and tests knowledge on the first

language, mathematics, and environment. The exam is taken by students in

all types of schools across different socioeconomic groups.

It is submitted by the Petitioners that in terms of Advanced Level subject

streams and grades, government schools are classified as 1AB Super (Schools

which have all A/L streams including Technology), 1AB (Schools which have

all A/L streams except Technology), 1C (Schools which have no

Science/Maths Streams), Type 2 (Schools which have Grades 1 - 11 only) and

Type 3 (Schools which have Grades 1 - 5 only).

The 1st to 10th Petitioners were admitted to grade 1 in the year 2016 and sat

for the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination conducted by the Department of

Examinations on 12.10.2020 with the intention of entering/being admitted to

better schools, whereas 9 of them were already in Type 1AB schools and other

was in a Type 3 school. Based on their results (marked P1), they submitted

applications to their preferred schools through the Ministry of Education

(marked P2) and were selected to other schools (marked P2) despite their

primary/prime preferences due to higher cut-off marks for admission in those

schools (marked P3).

The Petitioners submit that the determination of cut-off marks for a particular

school depends on the number of slots available at a particular school for

admission students to Grade 6 and overall performance of the students at the

scholarship examination. The primary contention of the Petitioners is that

Page 8 of 10

students have been admitted in excess of the permitted figures for each

grade/class and that has led to reducing the number of slots for admission

for Grade 6 which in turn reduces the number of students that are able to be

admitted in a particular school through the Grade 5 scholarship examination,

leading to an increase in the cut-off marks.

It is submitted by the Respondents that scholarship holders are admitted at

Grade 6 based on vacancies in classrooms and all students that have applied

to a particular school and scored marks equal or higher than the cut-off mark

would be admitted to the school even if it exceeds the number of vacancies in

specific classrooms.

The Petitioners submit that on 14.10.2015 the Cabinet of Ministers decided

that from the year 2016 onwards, the number of students admitted to Grade

1 should be reduced by 01 student per year, with the limit for the 2016

admissions being 40 students until the number reaches 35, by the year 2020.

The said cabinet decision was incorporated into the circulars governing

admission to Grade 1 of government schools and has been communicated to

principals and relevant officers. (marked P7). According to Circular

No.2008/37 (marked P9) dated 19.09.2009 issued by the Secretary to the

Ministry of Education, the upper limit for the number of students in a class

from Grade 6 to 11 is 45. They also submit that by a subsequent circular

dated 19.02.2015 (marked P10), issued by the Secretary of the Ministry of

Education addressed to all principals of schools, admissions to government

schools were only permitted at Grades 1,6 and 12. The Circular further states

that the Secretary's discretion under Circular No. 2008/37 can only be

exercised in extremely exceptional circumstances. Therefore, the Petitioners

position is that the maximum number of students per class of the year of

Grade 1 admission for the academic year 2016 was 40 and thereafter there

should not be any admission until grade 6. In some schools there are one or

more additional classrooms from Grade 6 and upwards to accommodate

students who qualify to be admitted to school on grade 5 scholarship results.

In this context, the Petitioners submit that they had a legitimate expectation

Page 9 of 10

that by 2021 there would be 5 vacancies in each class that existed from Grade

1, in addition to the 45 slots of each additional classroom of Grade 6 dedicated

for taking in students who succeed in the Grade 5 scholarship examination.

However, the Petitioners have failed to sufficiently establish that there has

been ultra vires or illegal, improper conduct with regard to admissions

impacting the year 2021, particularly admissions of Grade 6. And also,

whether the Petitioner would have been able to be admitted to such schools,

if so. While it is established by the Annual Audit Report of the National Audit

Office (marked P11) that an excessive number of students than the permitted

number, have been admitted to certain schools in 2019, such finding

regarding 2019 cannot be directly imputed or considered for the year 2021.

It is also contended by the Petitioners that while they have obtained high

marks, the cut-off marks for the year 2020 is higher than previous years. This

Court is of the view that the cut-off marks of a particular year cannot be

compared with cut-off marks of the previous years to form any conclusive

opinion, as the difficulty of the examination and capability of students vary

from year to year amongst various other factors. Therefore, the position that

cut-off marks of a particular year is higher or lower than another holds no

material ground for reasoning unless all and several other relevant factors in

that regard can be taken into consideration in addition to details on available

slots.

For the above reasons, I dismiss the Application of the Petitioners and make

no order as to the costs of this Application.

Application dismissed, No Costs.
