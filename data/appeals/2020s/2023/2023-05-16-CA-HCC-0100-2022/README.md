Background of the Case

According to PW1, the deceased had returned from abroad few days prior to

her death. PW1, the deceased and her son, the Appellant, and sister of the

Appellant and her two children were living in the house where the incident

had taken place. The Appellants sister had got married to one of the brothers

of the deceased.

On the day of the incident, between 11pm-12 midnight hearing the cries of

the deceased wfmda ud urKfjda the witness had come out from his room and

switched on the passage light and had seen the Appellant coming towards

him brandishing a sword. The witness had escaped from the scene through

the rear door of the house fearing that the Appellant might harm him and

has hidden himself in a thicket close to the house. After sometime, PW1 had

seen the Appellant leaving the house through the main door with his sister

and her two children. After that he had gone into the house and found the

deceased lying on the bed in her room with bleeding injuries. When he looked

for PW3 (the son of the deceased) in his room he was not in at that time.

Thereafter, he had gone to PW4, Saliyas house and informed the incident to

him. Later he had discovered that PW3 also had sustained injuries and was

rushed to the hospital.

Upon receiving information from PW1, PW4 who is another son of the

deceased, had gone to the house and seen the deceased lying on the bed with

bleeding injuries. She had murmured l%sia" ls%ia at that time. Immediately the

deceased was taken to the Balapitiya Hospital. But the deceased had

succumbed her injuries on admission to the Balapitiya Hospital. PW4 had

come to know that his brother (PW3) too had been injured on that day.

Prompt complaint was made to the Ahungalle Police Station by witnesses

PW1 and PW4.

According to PW3, Buddhika Mendis, his father had passed away when he

was very young. The Appellant had lived in their house with his sister who

4 | P a g e

had married one of the brothers of his mother. His mother had gone abroad

and returned few days prior to her untimely death. PW3 had occupied a

separate room. On the day of the incident, between 10.00-11.00pm, the

Appellant had woke him up and asked whether he had any enemies. The

witness had noticed that the Appellant was under the influence of liquor and

possessed a sword which was belonging to his brother. The Appellant called

the witness to go in the direction of the rail track to check whether anybody

had come there. According to PW3, at that time his deceased mother was

sleeping in the house. When he stopped to answer a call of nature, suddenly

the Appellant had dealt a blow on his head. As he ran towards the railway

track the Appellant had dealt another blow which he had covered by his

hand. As he ran fast the Appellant could not reach him. PW3 had gone to a

friends house but fell unconscious thereafter. As he had been hospitalized

for about 12 days, he could not attend his mothers funeral.

PW7, IP/Silva had conducted the investigations upon receiving the 1st

complaint from PW4. He had visited the crime scenes and commenced

further investigations to arrest the Appellant.

PW12, the JMO who held the post-mortem of the deceased stated that the

death was caused due to severe brain damage due to homicidal cut injuries

over the head. He has further opined that five cut injuries without defending

injuries, or any other injuries, indicates that the victim was assaulted while

she was asleep.

PW13, the JMO who checked PW3 had noted five cut injuries on his body.

According to him injuries No.1,3 and 4 were grievous in nature and all

injuries were inflicted by a sharp cutting instrument.

5 | P a g e

The Learned Counsel has raised following grounds of appeal on behalf

of the Appellant:

1. The conviction is contrary to the weight of the evidence adduced in the

case.

2. The Learned Trial judge has reached a wrong conclusion that the

evidence of PW1 is credible when there are material omissions and

discrepancies quite apparent upon his evidence.

3. The Learned Trial Judge has reached a wrong conclusion that the

evidence of PW3 is credible when there are material omissions and

discrepancies quite apartment upon his evidence.

4. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to appreciate that there that there

are no strong direct and circumstantial evidence to link the accused-

appellant to the charge of murder.

5. The Learned Trial Judge has disregarded the absence of corroborative

evidence to establish both charges.

6. The Learned Trial Judge has wrongly come to a finding that the

prosecution has establish their case beyond reasonable doubt.

7. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to properly and lawfully evaluate

omissions and contradictions highlighted and marked on behalf of the

accused-appellant.

As the appeal grounds advanced by the Counsel for the Appellant are

interconnected, all appeal grounds will be considered together hereafter.

This case rests on both direct and circumstantial evidence. The happening

of deceaseds death rests on strong circumstances evidence. According to

PW1, he had clearly seen the Appellant coming out of the room of deceased

with a sword. He had witnessed this with the aid of the lights of the house

which he switched on when he came out of his room upon hearing the cries

of the deceased. Also, he had seen the Appellant leaving the house with his

sister Ayoma and her two children immediately after he saw the Appellant

with a sword. Further, he had seen the deceased with bleeding injuries on

6 | P a g e

her bed after the Appellant came out of her room. He had identified the sword

during the trial.

PW3 who was severely injured stated that the Appellant woke him up calling

him through the window of his room which was situated outside the main

house. He was then taken by the Appellant near the railway track and then

cut by the sword that he was carrying. He had identified the sword which

was used to cut him at the time of the incident.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge had very correctly analyzed,

accepted, and concluded that the evidence given by the witnesses PW1and

PW3 is convincing and trustworthy.

In Kumara De Silva and 2 others v. Attorney General [2010] 2 SLR 169

the court held that:

Credibility is a question of fact, not of law The acceptance or

rejection of evidence of witnesses is therefore a question of fact

for the trial judge..

Further, the Counsel argued that the Learned High Court Judge had

disregarded the absence of corroborative evidence to establish both charges.

The Learned ASG very correctly submitted that the evidence of PW1 had been

corroborated by the evidence of PW4. In fact, there is ample corroboration as

to the weapon used for the crime from the evidence of PW1 and PW3. Both

these witnesses had identified the murder weapon without any difficulty.

According to PW12, the JMO who held the post-mortem expressed his

opinion that the injuries inflicted on the deceased could be caused by the

weapon produced in the trial. PW13, the JMO who had examined PW3 also

expressed his opinion that that the injuries found on PW3 could have been

caused with the sword which had been marked as P1. Further, PW3s

evidence had been corroborated by PW7 the investigating officer with regard

to the place where PW3 was cut by the Appellant.

7 | P a g e

As the prosecution had led strong corroborative evidence during the trial, it

is incorrect to argue that the prosecution had failed to lead corroborative

evidence.

The Counsel for the Appellant further contended that the Learned High Court

Judge had reached a wrong conclusion with regard to the evidence of PW1

and PW3 stating that it is credible when there are material omissions and

discrepancies in their evidence.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily

affect the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well

established that the Court must exercise its judgement on the

nature of the inconsistency or contradiction and whether they are

material to the facts in issue. Discrepancies which do not go to the

root of the matter and assail the basic version of the witness

cannot be given too much importance.

Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling

discrepancies and omissions. When contradictions are marked,

the Judge should direct his attention to whether they are material

or not and the witness should be given an opportunity of

explaining the matter.

The Learned High Court Judge had properly analyzed and evaluated the

evidence given by PW1 and PW3. He had also analyzed and evaluated each

and all omissions and contradictions of these witnesses in his judgment.

After considering the omissions and contradictions extensively, the Learned

High Court Judge had very correctly held that the omissions and the

8 | P a g e

contradictions highlighted are not vital and material and do not go to the

root of the case. It is especially important to note that the witnesses had

given evidence before the High Court after about 13 years of the incident.

Finally, the Counsel for the Appellant contended that the Learned Trial

Judge has failed to appreciate that there are no strong direct and

circumstantial evidence to link the accused-appellant to the charge of

murder.

In Podisingho v. The King 53 NLR 49 the Court held that:

In the circumstantial evidence, it is the duty of the trial judge to tell the

jury that such evidence must be totally inconsistent with the innocence

of the accused and be consistent with his guilt.

In this case the evidence led had well established that the Appellant had

committed the offences for which he had been indicted. The Learned High

Court Judge had very correctly held that the Appellant was the person who

committed the murder of the deceased and caused the injuries to PW3.

Further, the Learned High Court Judge very correctly had given his reasons

as to why he accepts the evidence of PW01, PW03 and others as unbiased

witnesses. PW1 and PW3 had given evidence based on what they had seen

on the date of the incident. If PW3 is an interested witness he could have

easily said that he too had seen the Appellant inflicting injuries to his

mother.

With reference to above cited judicial decisions, it is abundantly clear that

the trial court had scrutinized and considered the evidence presented by the

prosecution very carefully and accepted the same as truthful and impressive

to come to a correct finding.

9 | P a g e

In this case the learned High Court Judge had not only considered the

evidence of PW1 and PW3, but also considered other corroborating evidence

in his judgment and come to a correct decision.

Considering the appeal grounds advanced by the Appellant in this case, I

conclude those are totally devoid of merit.

Hence, I am of the view that there are no reasons to interfere with the

judgment of the learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya. For the reasons

stated above, I affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed on the

Appellant.

Therefore, the Appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High

Court of Balapitiya along with the original case record.
