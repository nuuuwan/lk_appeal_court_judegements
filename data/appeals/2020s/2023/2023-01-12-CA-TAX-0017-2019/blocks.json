Authoridade Tributaria e Aduaneira10 and argued that the payment of a predetermine amount such as in the instant case constitute a consideration for a supply of services under the VAT Act. It was further submitted that the term supply of services has been construed widely in other jurisdictions. The facts of the aforementioned case are that Vodafone offered its customers special promotions, provided that customers continue to obtain Vodafone's services for a predetermined period. Failure of the customers to comply with the above condition obliged them to pay Vodafone the predetermined amount. The Court held that the payment of a predetermined amount constitutes the consideration for the services provided by Vodafone to its customers.",

The Appellant submitted that TRC refunds only two third of the TDC paid by the Appellant when it meets an eligibility criterion. Accordingly, it was argued that the payment is not received for a service provided but, is a subsidy given by the TRC11. It is well known that the government provides subsidies for growing tea, rubber and coconut, and so on, to persons including those registered for VAT. The purpose of these subsidies is to encourage people to cultivate these crops, which in turn will increase production and not for any service supplied to the government under the VAT Act. It was also submitted that the payment was a mere refund of a tax already paid by the Appellant12. In fact, the disbursement is made out of the monies lying in the TDC fund in the name of the Appellant. The TDC fund consists of the International Telecommunication Operators Levy charged and levied from International Telecommunication Operators. The Appellants predecessor being an International Telecommunication Operator as well as a Domestic Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) Operator13, is entitled to claim two-thirds of the TDC funds for the developments made to their Telecommunications Network in unserved and underserved areas. A claim has to be made within three years from the relevant year. It is important to note that the TRC does not fully reimburse construction costs of the towers and base stations. Neither is it two-thirds of the total cost. It is only two-thirds of the cost elements set out in the guidelines published by the TRC are disbursed14. Further, the reimbursement is made on a claim made by the Domestic PSTN Operator for the development of their telecommunication network in unserved and",

The principal ground on which the TAC concluded that the appellant is providing a service to the TRC is that the towers and base stations are built in specified areas in accordance with the guidelines issued by the TRC17. The TAC further observed that the amount paid by the TRC to the Appellant is not a voluntary payment made to each and every Domestic PSTN Operator and the payment would be received only upon fulfilment of the requirements of the TRC. Thus, the TAC determined that there is a contractual obligation to be fulfilled by the Appellant to receive the disbursement18.
