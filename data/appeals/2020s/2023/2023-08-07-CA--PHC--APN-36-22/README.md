This is an application by the vehicle-claimant-petitioner-petitioner (hereinafter

referred to as the petitioner) seeking to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of

this Court vested in term of Article 138 of the Constitution.

Having considered the matter, this Court decided to issue notice on the parties

and the respondents were allowed to file their objections if any. At the

arguments on this matter, this Court heard the submissions of the learned

Counsel for the petitioner and the views expressed by the learned State

Counsel on behalf of the respondents.

The facts that led to the confiscation of the three-wheeler vehicle owned by the

petitioner can be briefly summarized in the following manner.

The Officer-in-Charge of Udugama police filed a charge against the accused in

Udugama Magistrate Court Case No-10122 for transporting Venivelgeta,

without a permit as required in terms of the Forest Ordinance, in the three-

wheeler vehicle No SP AAV-0722, and thereby committing an offence

punishable in terms of section 25(2) read with section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance.

The accused has pleaded guilty to the charge preferred against him and has

been convicted and sentenced accordingly.

Thereafter, the learned Magistrate of Udugama, as he should have, has called

upon the owner of the vehicle to show cause as to why the vehicle that was

used in the commission of the offence should not be confiscated as a result of

the conviction.

At the inquiry held in that regard, the petitioner has given evidence claiming

the three-wheeler vehicle and has called a representative of a leasing company

as the vehicle was subject to a leasing agreement.

Page 5 of 13

The learned Magistrate of Udugama by his order dated 27-01-2022 has ordered

the confiscation of the vehicle on the basis that the petitioner failed to establish

that he has taken the necessary precautions sufficiently to prevent the offence

being committed.

I would like to highlight the following observations made by the learned

Magistrate in his order, which I find material for the matter under

consideration.

After having determined as above, the learned Magistrate has proceeded to

confiscate the three-wheeler on the basis that the owner has failed to call his

brother who was the driver of the vehicle to corroborate his evidence, and

therefore, he has failed to satisfy the Court that he has taken sufficient

precautions to prevent an offence being committed.

When the revision application challenging the determination of the learned

Magistrate was supported before the learned High Court Judge of Galle for

notice and an interim order on 22-02-2022, the application has been refused

without notice being issued to the respondents mentioned, on the basis that

there are no exceptional circumstances, and a miscarriage of justice had not

been occasioned to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate.

For the completeness of this judgment, I would like to reproduce some of the

observations made by the learned High Court Judge in order to justify the

refusal to issue notice to the respondents of the application.

(Page 08 of the appeal brief)

It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the learned

Magistrate has observed that the driver of the vehicle has not followed the

instructions given by the owner. It was his view that there cannot be any

justification to come to a finding that the owner of the vehicle has failed to take

necessary precautions to prevent an offence being committed if the evidence led

at the inquiry was evaluated in its correct perspective by the learned

Magistrate.

Citing the judgment pronounced by Malini Gunaratne, J. in Sadi Banda Vs.

Officer-in-Charge of Norton Bridge Police Station (2014) 1 SLR 33, it was

the submission of the learned Counsel that the charge preferred against the

accused in this case has no value or the quantity of the Venivelgeta the

accused is supposed to have transported, and there was no way to measure the

gravity of the offence, which is necessary to consider exceptional circumstances

in a matter of this nature.

It was also his submission that the learned High Court Judge should have

noticed the respondents and should have given a hearing to the petitioner as

his property rights were at stake.

The submission of the learned State Counsel was that the learned Magistrate

was correct in his conclusions, and the petitioner has clearly failed to satisfy

the Court that he has taken all necessary precautions to prevent the offence. It

was his position that the quantity of the transported Venivelgeta was 50

kilograms. The learned State Counsel moved for the dismissal of the

application on the basis that it is without merit.

Page 8 of 13

The relevant section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance under which the

confiscation of the vehicle was ordered reads as follows;

40(1). Where any person is convicted of a forest offence-

(a) All timber or forest produce which is not the property of

the state in respect of which such offence has been

committed; and

(b) All tools, vehicles, implements, cattle, and machine used in

committing such offence,

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence,

be confiscated by order of the convicting Magistrate.

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicle,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence,

is a third party, no order of confiscation shall made if such owner

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the

offence.

It is settled law that the mode of proof in an inquiry of this nature is on the

balance of probability. Hence, if it can be determined that the registered owner

of the vehicle has established that the he has taken due precautions to prevent

the offence and he was unaware of the commission of the offence, it needs to be

considered in favour of the owner of the vehicle.

In the case of The Finance Company PLC Vs. Priyantha Chandra and Five

Others (2010) 2 SLR 220, after considering several judicial decisions Dr.

Shirani Bandaranayake, J. (As she was then) held:

On a consideration of the ratio decidendi of all the aforementioned

decisions, it is abundantly clear that in terms of section 40 of the Forest

Page 9 of 13

Ordinance, as amended, if the owner of the vehicle in question was a third

party, on order of confiscation shall be made it that owner had proved to

the satisfaction of the Court that he has taken all precautions to prevent

the use of the said vehicle for the commission of the offence. The ratio

decidendi of all the aforementioned decisions also show that the owner

has to establish the said matter on the balance of probability.

Held further;

As has been clearly illustrated by several decisions referred to above, it

would be necessary for the owner of the vehicle to establish that the

vehicle that had been used for the commission of the offence had been

used without his knowledge and that the owner had taken all precautions

available to prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission of such an

offence.

I must emphasize that what is meant by the legislature when it was stated by

its wisdom, in section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance, had taken all

precautions to prevent the use needs to be interpreted in a pragmatic

manner, rather than giving a strict interpretation. It is my view that facts and

circumstances relevant to a given situation should be considered in its totality,

in order to find out whether there is justification in releasing a vehicle to its

owner. This is especially so, since, if the Court is to look for all the possible

precautions that an owner of a vehicle can take in a given scenario, there can

always be some other precaution that could have been taken.

The facts considered in the case of Sadi Banda Vs. Officer-in-Charge of

Norton Bridge Police Station (Supra) was very much similar the facts under

consideration in this appeal. The son of the owner of the vehicle was found to

be transporting Tuna timber valued at Rs. 876/42 on 04-02-2004, and pleaded

Page 10 of 13

guilty to the charge against him. The vehicle was confiscated after inquiry, and

the revision application to the High Court was dismissed.

It was observed and held:

I have to admit that nowhere in the said inquiry proceedings there is

evidence that the appellant had taken all precautions to prevent the

commission of the offence. However, at the inquiry the appellant has given

evidence and stated, he purchased the lorry on 26-02-2000 and gave it to

his son to transport tea leaves. Further stated, that he had no knowledge

about transporting of timber. The learned Magistrate in his order has

accepted the fact that the appellant did not have any knowledge about the

transporting of timber without a permit.

Nevertheless, the learned Magistrate has confiscated the lorry. I am of the

view before making the order of confiscation the learned Magistrate should

have taken into consideration, value of the timber transported, no

allegations prior to this incident that the lorry had been used for any illegal

purpose, that the appellant and or the accused are habitual offenders in

this nature and no previous convictions, and the acceptance of the fact that

the appellant did not have any knowledge about the transporting of timber

without a permit. On these facts the Court is of the view that the

confiscation of the lorry is not justifiable.

In the instant matter, it clearly appears that by determining that the driver had

failed to follow the instructions given to him by the owner, and if he followed

the instructions, an offence of this nature would not have occurred, the learned

Magistrate had in fact, had impliedly come to a finding that the owner had

taken necessary precautions, and he had no knowledge. Despite that, the

vehicle had been confiscated on the basis that the owner had failed to take the

precautions in a meaningful manner as highlighted above.

Page 11 of 13

It is the considered view of this Court that if the learned Magistrate addressed

his mind to the other relevant facts and the circumstances, there was ample

reasons before the learned Magistrate to release the vehicle to the owner, after

being satisfied as to the requirements of the proviso of section 40(1) of the

Forest Ordinance.

I am of the view that the prosecution's failure to mention the quantity of the

transported Venivelgeta, and its value, also becomes a relevant factor, given the

above context.

I am in no positions to agree with the reasons given to justify the refusal of the

revision application by the learned High Court Judge either, which are reasons

that had not been considered by the learned Magistrate in his order of

confiscation.

The learned High Court Judge had considered the part that should have been

played by the absolute owner of the vehicle who has not claimed it before the

Magistrate Court, which was matter the learned Magistrate had decided not to

consider very correctly, as the absolute owner was not the party who had the

physical control over it at the time of the commission of the offence.

The learned High Court Judge has considered the petitioners evidence before

the Magistrate Court, where he has stated under cross-examination, that the

amount he has to pay as lease rentals is about eleven thousand odd rupees,

and at a later stage that it may be Rs.11085/- per month as far as he can

remember, as relevant. He has also considered his evidence that since he

cannot take the vehicle to his house, the vehicle was used to be parked in his

brothers house, as relevant, to justify the conclusions of the Learned

Magistrate that the owner has failed to take necessary precautions.

Page 12 of 13

It is my view that, if the learned High Court Judge intended to look the

additional material to justify the order of the learned Magistrate, the proper

procedure would have been to issue notice in relation the revision application

and give a hearing before coming to his own conclusions. As this was a matter

where property rights of a third party are involved as a result of a conviction of

an accused in a case, it is the view of the Court that refusing to issue notice in

this matter was without justification.

At this juncture, I would like to quote again from the case of Sadi Banda Vs.

Officer-in-Charge of Norton Bridge Police Station (Supra), which I find

relevant in the above context.

The revisionary power of Court is a discretionary power. This is an

extraordinary jurisdiction which is exercised by the Court and the grant of

relief is entirely dependent of the Court. The grant of such relief is of

course a matter entirely in the discretion of the Court, and always be

dependent on the circumstances of each case. Existence of exceptional

circumstances is the process by which the extraordinary power of revision

should be adopted. The exceptional circumstances would vary from case to

case and their degree of exceptionality must be correctly assessed and

gauged by Court taking into consideration all antecedent circumstances

using the yardstick whether a failure of justice would occur unless

revisionary powers are invoked.

For the reasons considered as aforementioned, it is my view that this is a case

where the learned High Court Judge should have considered the merits of the

revision application rather than dismissing it without issuing notice, and if

considered in its correct perspective, the application in revision should have

been allowed by the learned High Court Judge.

Page 13 of 13

I find that the petitioner has adduced sufficient exceptional circumstances for

this Court to allow the application invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court.

Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 27-01-2022 of the learned Magistrate of

Udugama and the order dated 22-02-2022 of the learned High Court Judge of

Galle, as both the orders cannot be allowed to stand.

I direct the learned Magistrate of Udugama to make appropriate orders to

release the three-wheeler vehicle No- SP AAV-0722 to the petitioner.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the

relevant Magistrate Court and the relevant High Court for necessary action.
