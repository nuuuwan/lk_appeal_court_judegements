However, the Petitioners claim that their request for legal representation was refused by the 1st Respondent. The Petitioners state that subsequently, the inquiry was held and that at its conclusion 2nd to 5th Respondents imposed punishments on five different occasions as evidenced by the Orders marked P14 to P18 on the Petitioners, in terms of Section 66(1)(a) of the said Law in respect of the charges contained in the P8 without allowing them to properly defend themselves at a formal inquiry to be held under Section 60B of the Co-operative Societies Law.",

Inquiries were held by the Prison Board of Visitors into the charges against the applicants. Some of the applicants requested legal representation while some requested assistance of a friend at the hearing. The Board of Visitors refused the requests in each case. The applicants applied to the Court by way of a writ of certiorari on the ground that a prisoner was entitled as of right to legal representation or assistance of a friend or advisor. The Court held that although a prisoner appearing before the Board of Visitors on a disciplinary charge was not entitled as of right to have legal representation or the assistance of a friend or, advisor, as a matter of natural justice a Board of Visitors had a discretion to allow such representation. The Court held that it was wrong for such a Board to take the firm view that the applicant had no right to legal representation or assistance and that it had no power to grant it.

The said decisions contained in the Orders P14, P15, P16, P17 and P18 have been arrived under Section 66(1). It is imperative to note that Section 66(1) inquiries stand apart from Section 60B inquiries, and they are completely independent of each other. This distinction must be acknowledged and respected at all times. Inquiry under Section 60B is not a statutory prerequisite for making orders under Section 66(1). Therefore, I am unable to accept the Petitioners argument.",

I make this observation based on the overall circumstances of this case.
