JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The 1st Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) filed a charge sheet Under Section 24(1) of the Forest

Ordinance against the Accused in the Magistrate Court of

Tissamaharama. As the Accused pleaded guilty to the charge sheet, the

Learned Magistrate of Tissamaharama had convicted the Accused and

imposed a fine of Rs.15000/- with a default sentence and fixed for an

inquiry whether to confiscate or not the Vehicle bearing No. SP LE-8799

which had been used for the transportation of the timber mentioned

above.

At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate had decided to

confiscate the aforesaid vehicle by his order dated 29.03.2016. At the

inquiry, only the Appellant had given evidence on her behalf and

marked documents X-X1.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Magistrate, the Applicant-Petitioner-

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) filed a Revision

Application in the High Court of Hambantota to revise the order of the

Learned Magistrate of Tissamaharama. After the inquiry, the Learned

High Court Judge had dismissed the said application on the premise

that the Petitioner has failed to establish that she took all necessary

precautions to prevent the allege offence being committed.

Now the Appellant filed this appeal to set aside the order of the Learned

High Court Judge of Hambantota dated 07.03.2018 and the order of

Learned Magistrate of Hambantota dated 26.03.2016.

The Appellant submitted following grounds of appeal:

1. The order to confiscate the said vehicle has been made in

disregard of the fact that the Appellant has not provided a

reasonable and acceptable explanation that she was unaware of

the commission of/had no knowledge of the commission of the

illegal act.

2. The Learned Judge of the Provisional High Court of Hambantota

has failed to consider existing judicial dictum in decided cases

pertaining to the value of the item.

3. The confiscation of the said vehicle is not in line with the

Human Right of the Appellant and is not just and equitable.

It is settled law that revision is a discretionary remedy, and such power

shall be invoked only upon demonstration of exceptional

circumstances.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

In Marian Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed 69 CLW 34 the court held that:

Power of revision is an extraordinary power of the court

which is independent and distinct from the appellate

jurisdiction. The object of revisionary jurisdiction is to ensure

the due administration of justice and the correction of all

errors in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice.

CA PHC 31/2018

5 | P a g e

In the case of Rasheed Ali v.Mohammed Ali and Others [1981] 1 SLR

262, the court held that:

the powers of revision vested in the Court of Appeal are

very wide and the Court can in a fit case exercise that

power whether or not an appeal lies. When, however, the

law does not give a right of appeal and makes the order

final, the Court of Appeal may nevertheless exercise its

powers of revision, but it should do so only in exceptional

circumstances. Ordinarily the Court will not interfere by

way of review, particularly when the law has expressly

given an aggrieved party an alternative remedy such as the

right to file a separate action, except when non-interference

will cause a denial of justice or irremediable harm.

In Commissioner of Police v. Tanes (1957-58) 68 CLR 383, the court

held that:

"It is a deep-rooted principle of the law that before anyone

can be punished or prejudiced in his person or his property

by any judicial or quasi-judicial procedure, he must be

afforded adequate opportunity of being heard ... "

As the appeal grounds mentioned above are interconnected, all appeal

grounds will be considered together hereinafter.

The Appellant contended that the order to confiscate the said vehicle

has been made in disregard of the fact that the Appellant has not

provided a reasonable and acceptable explanation that she was

unaware of the commission of/had no knowledge of the commission of

the illegal act.

CA PHC 31/2018

As the law stands today, the Claimant in a vehicle confiscation inquiry

should prove that he or she had have taken all preventive measures on

a balance of probability. Hence, the Learned Magistrate should consider

all the evidence very carefully before coming to a conclusion.

In The Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd v The Range

Forest Officer, Ampara and Hon. Attorney General [2013] 1 SLR

208 the Court held that:

1. Before an order for forfeiture is made the owner should be given

an opportunity to show cause. If the owner on balance probability

209 satisfies the Court that he had taken precautions to prevent

the commission of the offence or the offence was committed without

his knowledge nor, was he privy to the commission of the offence,

the vehicle has to be released to the owner.

2. When it comes to showing cause as to why the vehicle should

not be confiscated, only the person who was in possession and

control of the vehicle could give evidence to the effect that the

offence was committed without his knowledge and he had taken

necessary steps to prevent the commission of the offence.

In this case the Petitioner, as the owner of the vehicle had given

evidence and explained to the Court that she had taken all the possible

and necessary precautions to prevent the vehicle being used for illegal

purposes. The evidence demonstrate that the usual driver assigned was

a neighbour of the Petitioner. The vehicle was not used for any illegal

activities by the permanent driver at any stage. When this vehicle was

taken into custody, the driver was the closely related brother of the

Petitioner. According to the evidence of the Petitioner she had given

instructions not to use for illegal activities. She has placed full trust on

her brother when she gave the vehicle to him. As it was not used for

any illegal purpose up to then, she had given the vehicle to her brother

subject to her supervision to transport paddy. Hence, it is not correct to

CA PHC 31/2018

7 | P a g e

say that the Petitioner had not taken any action to prevent the vehicle

being used for illegal purposes.

Although the timber value is Rs.4836.89 mentioned in the charge sheet

filed against the accused, this was not considered at all in the order of

the Learned Magistrate of Hambantota.

In Sadi Banda v OIC of Police Station Norton Bridge [2014] 1 SLR 33

the Court held that:

Before making the order of confiscation the learned magistrate

should have taken into consideration, value of the timber

transported, allegations prior to this incident that the lorry was

being used for any illegal purpose that the appellant and or the

accused are habitual offenders in this nature and no previous

convictions and the acceptance of the fact that the petitioner

appellant did not have any knowledge about the transporting of

timber without a permit. In the instant case confiscation of the lorry

is not justifiable.

The Learned Magistrate also should have considered that there had

been no previous or pending case against in respect of the vehicle that

had been used for illegal activities and the permanent driver or the

accused are not habitual offenders.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge only considering the order of

the Magistrate Court of Tissamaharama and decided to dismiss the

revision application stating that that the Appellant had failed establish

exceptional circumstances. The Claimant of the vehicle has given

evidence in the court and has claimed that she was unaware of the

crime being committed as she has given the vehicle to the accused who

is a brother of the Petitioner.

The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the said

vehicle was not involved in any illegal activities previously nor wanted

for any offence committed. Further, the person driven the vehicle is

CA PHC 31/2018

8 | P a g e

Petitioners relative who had taken the vehicle previous occasions too.

But not involved in any illegal activities previously.

In Mallawa Arachchige Supun Malhara v The Attorney General

CA(PHC) 09/2015 dated 28.08.2020 the Court held that:

The Accused is not a driver employed by the Appellant; he is a

person doing business of his own who has access to the vehicle

when requested. It is fair to assume that the Appellant would not

have expected the Accused to do anything illegal. This is what is

elicited in the evidence of the Appellant. It is quite apparent that

there is no evidence that the Appellant was privy to the illegal act

of the Accused.

In Ceylinco Leasing Corporation v M.H. Harrison and others SC

Appeal 43/2012 dated 07.12.2017 His Lordship Aluvihare P.C J. held

that:

Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance provides for the confiscation of

the conveyance used to transport the illicit timber and the provision

to my mind is intended to strike at the means of transportation by

providing for the confiscation of the conveyance used to transport

the illicit timber, and is both a logical and legal response to the

problem of illicit felling. Even in the instant case the two persons

who were charged happened to be the driver of the lorry and

another person who had been seated next to the driver. Although

they were in physical possession of the illicit timber, may have

been employees of the owner of the lorry. Thus, not much

deterrence is achieved by imposing punishment on the persons

who were in actual physical possession of illicit timber, when in

most cases, the owner is behind the illegal operation.

It is apparent that in the absence of the Petitioner having had

knowledge of the transportation of timber and /or having had any

CA PHC 31/2018

9 | P a g e

monetary or personal benefit from the crime committed cannot be

deemed as the person behind the illegal operation.

Hence, the Learned Magistrate simply dismissing the application on the

basis that the Claimant had failed to show that she took all necessary

precautions to prevent a crime being committed is not correct in this

case.

Further, finding of the Learned High Court Judge that there are no

exceptional circumstances to grant relief is also erroneous.

Hence, I set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Hambantota dated 07.03.2018 and the order of Learned Magistrate

Court of Tissamaharama dated 26.03. 2016.

Therefore, this appeal is allowed.

I direct that the vehicle No. SP LE 8799 be released to the Appellant.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this Judgement

to the High Court of Hambantota and the Magistrate Court of

Tissamaharama.
