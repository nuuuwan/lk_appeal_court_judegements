MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

When this matter was mentioned on 08-08-2023, the learned Counsel for theRespondents raised preliminary legal objections as to the maintainability of thisApplication on the basis that;

1. The impugned decision made by the Land Reform Commission (LRC)

dated 26-02-2013 had already been determined by this Court inApplications No. Writ/270/13, 271/13 and 272/13.

2. The impugned decision made by the Land Reform Commission (LRC)

dated 26-02-2013 that is being challenged by the Petitioners in the instantApplication is not in force. A fresh decision made by the LRC dated06-04-2023 is being challenged by the Petitioners before this Court inApplication No. Writ/263/23. In this context, the instant Application isfutile.

The LRC, on 26-02-2013, decided to transfer the land in dispute to oneJayasundara Mudiyanselage Migara (14th Respondent) or to a suitable 3rd party(paragraph 43 of the Petition). Being aggrieved by that decision, the Petitionersinvoked the Writ jurisdiction of this Court in Applications No. Writ/270/13,Writ/271/13 and Writ/272/13, seeking Mandates inter-alia in the nature of aWrit of Mandamus prohibiting the LRC from transferring the subject matter to a3rd party and a Writ of Mandamus compelling the transfer of the subject matterto the Petitioners. The said Applications were dismissed by the Court of Appealon 15-10-2019. Being aggrieved by that Judgment, the Petitioners soughtSpecial Leave to Appeal from the Supreme Court, whereas the Supreme Courtrefused to grant leave to appeal (SC-SLA. No. 415/2019).

Thereafter, the 14th Respondent, in Application bearing No. Writ/191/2021invoked the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court seeking inter-alia, a Writ ofMandamus directing the LRC to implement the impugned decision dated26-02-2013 to transfer the subject matter to the 14th Respondent and a Writ ofProhibition restraining the LRC from transferring the subject matter to a thirdparty. The Court of Appeal allowed the Application on 03-08-2022.

In the instant Application, the Petitioners are seeking, inter-alia, a Writ ofCertiorari to quash the decision dated 26-02-2013 of the LRC to transfer thecorpus to the 14th Respondent or a 3rd party. In those circumstances, it is the

Page 5

considered view of this Court that the instant Application is misconceived inlaw and facts, and futile on the basis that;

1. TheApplicationsmadebythePetitioners,namelyWrit/270/13,Writ/271/13 and Writ/272/13, challenging the impugned decision of theLRC dated 26-02-2013 had already been dismissed by this Court, andtherefore, the Petitioners are precluded from challenging the samedecision in the instant Application.

2. In Application bearing No. Writ/191/2021, the Court of Appeal had

already issued a Writ of Mandamus directing the LRC to implement theimpugned decision dated 26-02-2013 to transfer the subject matter to the14th Respondent and therefore, in the Application in hand, this Court hasno jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said decision ofthe LRC.

Moreover, It transpired that the LRC has taken a fresh decision on 06-04-2023to transfer the subject matter to Jayasundara Mudiyanselage Miniruwanthi,Ajith Kumara Nawalage and the 14th Respondent which is being challenged bythe Petitioners in Application bearing No. Writ/263/23 that is pending beforethis Court. As such, it is abundantly clear that the LRC is not implementing theimpugned decision dated 06-04-2013. Hence, the reliefs sought by thePetitioners in this Application are futile.

It is trite law that a Writ will not be issued where it would be vexatious or futile.A Writ of Certiorari will not be issued to quash a particular exercise of power ifit is futile to do so because it is no more operational or it has had its effect.

In Samsudeen Vs. Minister of Defence and External Affairs1, it was held that

a writ of mandamus will not be issued if it will be futile to do so and no

purpose will be served.

and further in Siddeek v. Jacolyn Seneviratne 2

Certiorari being a discretionary remedy will be withheld if the nature of the

error does not justify judicial intervention. Certiorari will not issue where the

end result will be futility, frustration, injustice and illegality.

For the foregoing reasons, the preliminary legal objections are upheld andaccordingly the Application is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 75,000/-.

Application dismissed.
