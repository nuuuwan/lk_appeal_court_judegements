This is an appeal filed by the 2nd party petitioner appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) against the order dated 01.08.2017 delivered by the Provincial High Court of

Western Province holden in Gampaha which acted in revision against the order dated

30.07.2015 delivered by the learned Magistrate of Gampaha.

The facts of the case are as follows. The 1st Party 1st respondent (Hereinafter referred to

as the respondent) lodged a complaint against the appellant in the Police Station of

Ganemulla on 24.01.2015 stating that the appellant is using the respondents 10 feet

road way (which does not belong to the appellant) way to enter the appellants land. The

inquiry by the Police commenced on 26.01.2015 and 12.02.2015 respectively and in the

meantime the road in question was barricaded by the respondent to prevent the

appellant from using it. Thereafter, the appellant made a complaint to the Police Station

on 20.03.2015 against such action of the respondent. An inquiry was held in respect of

the said complaint made by the appellant. However, as the appellant has claimed

prescriptive rights over the disputed road way which was blocked by the respondent, a

direction by senior police officer was made to settle the matter by filing a Section 66

application in the Primary Court.

Consequently, with respect to the right of way over the disputed road, the complainant

respondent Inspector of Police had filed a Section 66 application on 31.03.2015 in the

Magistrate Court bearing No.27249/2015/PC under Section 66 (1) of Primary Courts

Procedure Act no.44 of 1979 against the respondent and the appellant.

After the filing of the affidavits and the counter affidavits by the petitioner and the

respondents, the learned Magistrate by the order dated 30.07.2015, held that the

petitioner does not have a right of way over the disputed road. The learned Magistrate

has made his order under Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

It is the contention of the appellant that the learned Magistrate has failed to consider

the inherited rights of the appellant over the land and that he has prescriptive rights

over the roadway. Therefore, aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate dated

30.07.2015, the appellant filed a revision application in the High Court of Gampaha

5

CA-PHC-140-2017 Page 5 of 10 30/05/2023 IJ-21-23

against the order of the Magistrate Court claiming that the learned Magistrate has

arrived at an erroneous conclusion.

However, by the order dated 01.08.2017, the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha

dismissed the petition of the appellant after careful consideration of the facts and

circumstances of the case which included the delay in filing the revision application.

The appellant averred that he was abroad during the time of the delivery of the learned

Magistrates order and that he filed for revision at the first opportunity after returning

to Sri Lanka. However, in the exercise of the discretionary power vested within the High

Court with regards to revision applications, it was observed by the learned High Court

Judge that the appellant had the ability to appoint a power of attorney to file the said

revision application without delay and in the absence of such actions, the revision

application cannot be maintained. Thereby, the appellant has filed an appeal before this

court to revise the order of the learned High Court judge dated 01.08.2017.

Hence, this Court is called upon to determine whether the learned High Court Judges

dismissal of the revisionary application of the appellant, on the basis of undue delay is

in any way illegal or irregular. To that end, one must first examine the legislative

rationale behind the applicable provisions of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

A matter to be highlighted at this point is that the order of the Primary (Magistrate)

Court cannot be impugned as per Section 74 (2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act,

therefore, an appeal against such order cannot be made. This is however, despite the

availability of revisionary jurisdiction under Article 154P of the Constitution which is

aimed at preventing a blatant miscarriage of justice and or for the due administration

of justice. (Abeywardena vs. Ajith de Silva 1998 1 Sri LR 134: Sharif and Others Vs.

Wickramasuriya and Others 2010 1 S.L.R 255)

At the outset of this matter, the application of revisionary powers of a court has to be

brought to the limelight. The revisionary powers of a court are wide and extensive, albeit

its application is restricted to instances where flagrant violations of justice has resulted

in exceptional circumstances which a court must consider judiciously. When

circumstances out of the ordinary transpire which results in a miscarriage of justice, it

is the duty of the court, whether it be the High Court or any other apex court to interfere

to rectify such errors. However, the nature of such remedies is absolutely discretionary.

6

CA-PHC-140-2017 Page 6 of 10 30/05/2023 IJ-21-23

The above observation is reflected in the case of Kulatilake v Attorney General (2010)

1 SLR 212 at page 215 where it was held that Court would exercise the revisionary

jurisdiction, it being an extraordinary power vested in Court specially to prevent

miscarriage of justice being done to a person and or for the due administration of justice.

In the case of Siripala v Lanerolle & another 2012 1 SLR 105, in a similar instance

concerning Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, it was held that a

revisionary power is a discretionary power and its exercise cannot be demanded as of

right unlike the statutory remedy of an appeal

Moreover, In the case of Abdul Hassan Mohamed Kaleel v Mohamed Kaleel Mohamed

Imithiyas CA/PHC/APN/141/16 CA Minute dated 25.01.2017 at page 6 His Lordship

Justice L. T. B. Dehideniya. after considering several authorities expressed the view

that; Thus the existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the Court

selects the cases in respect of which this extra-ordinary method of rectification should be

adopted. If such a selection process is not there, revisionary jurisdiction of this Court

will become a gateway for every litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a revision

application or to make an appeal in situations where the legislature has not given right

of appeal [..] (emphasis added)

The above statement brings to light the essence of invoking the revisionary jurisdiction

of a court which is to ensure a mechanism to revise and rectify an order where there are

exceptional circumstances or a gross violation of the law and rights of the parties

involved. However, such a mechanism should not be perceived as a gateway for the

litigants to make appeals where the legislature has not provided such a right of appeal

as is the case in matters falling within the ambit of Section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

The rationale behind such a deprivation of right of appeal is the lack of finality in the

orders delivered by the Primary Court in matters affecting land. The sole purpose and

the intention of the legislature under Section 66 is to provide the parties a momentary

remedy which resolves the conflicts among the parties, thereby preventing breach of

peace. Therefore, the law has not provided for a right of appeal as the order of the

Primary Court is temporary and in order to obtain a permanent remedy, the parties

7

CA-PHC-140-2017 Page 7 of 10 30/05/2023 IJ-21-23

must take up their applications before a suitable civil court. Hence, even if the matter

is appealed and taken up before an apex court, still the nature of the remedy is

temporary unless the matter is separately argued before an appropriate court.

Be that as it may, in the instant case the parties have sought the revisionary jurisdiction

of the High Court which is a discretionary remedy. Therefore, in exercising such

revisionary powers, the Court ought to bear in mind the lack of finality of the order

which is being impugned and the lack of a right of appeal for such matters.

Having mentioned that, it is pertinent at this juncture to examine the intention and the

purpose of the law promulgated under Section 66 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act which reads as follows;

(1) Whenever owing to a dispute affecting land a breach of the peace is threatened

or likely-

(a) the police officer inquiring into the dispute- (i) shall with the least possible delay

file an information regarding the dispute in the Primary Court within whose

jurisdiction the land is situate and require each of the parties to the dispute to enter

into a bond for his appearance before the Primary Court on the day immediately

succeeding the date of filing the information on which sittings of such court are

held; or

(ii) shall, if necessary, in the interests of preserving the peace, arrest the parties to

the dispute and produce them forthwith before the Primary Court within whose

jurisdiction the land is situate to be dealt with according to law and shall also at

the same time file in that court the information regarding the dispute; or []

(emphasis added)

The law promulgated under Section 66 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act was

introduced in lieu of the previous law which was embedded in the Administration of

Justice Law no. 44 of 1973, under Section 62. The primary goal of the aforementioned

law was to provide the community with a quick recourse in instances of conflict and

disharmony of the society. The law as espoused above provides first-aid or a first

instance remedy to breach of peace in the community affecting land. The legislature

intended such matters to be resolved as expeditiously as possible as the application of

8

CA-PHC-140-2017 Page 8 of 10 30/05/2023 IJ-21-23

Section 66 and the remedies provided therein, by the Court are temporary. Therefore,

as breach of peace or a likelihood of breach of peace is a matter of great concern to a

society, the law has provided such a mechanism to dissipate disputes and conflicting

situations by curtailing the opportunity for such matters to escalate.

The intention of the legislature is clearly elucidated at the second reading debate on the

Primary Courts Procedure Bill in parliament, (Hansard dated 22.06.1979 Column 944)

which stipulates that the time period intended for purposes of filing complaints, counter

objections and inquiry is three months with regards to matters directed to Primary

Courts. The rationale behind such a legislative prescription was to ensure the

dissolution of disputes at the earliest without reaching escalation. Therefore, it is

evident that the legislative intention behind Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act was to conclude the matters directed to Primary Courts within 03 months which is

in the interest of maintaining peace in the society.

The aforementioned observation is supported by the following dictum in, Perera et al v

Gunetilike et al 4 NLR.181 p, where His Lordship Bonser C.J. held that:

In a country like this any attempt of parties to use force in the maintenance of their

rights should be promptly discouraged, slight brawls readily blossom into riots with

grievous hurt and murder as the fruits. It is therefore all the more necessary that

courts should be strict in discountenancing all attempts to use force in the assertion

of such civil rights as are in dispute in the present case. [Emphasis added].

Therefore, it is clear that the application of Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act maintains peace in the society without allowing minor disputes to mature into larger

violations of the law. Hence, it is the view of this Court that time is of the essence with

regards to matters concerning breach of peace in the society and that in the interest of

justice such matters must be concluded expeditiously.

Furthermore, in the case Jayantha Gunasekara v Jayatissa Gunasekara & Others,

2011 1 SLR 284, His Lordship Justice Salam, after an appreciation of the judgment

delivered by Sharvananda J. in Kanagasabai v Mylvaganam 1978 N.L.R. 280 which

held the following: The primary object of the jurisdiction so conferred on the Magistrate

is the prevention of a breach of the peace arising in respect of a dispute affecting land.

9

CA-PHC-140-2017 Page 9 of 10 30/05/2023 IJ-21-23

The section enables the Magistrate temporarily to settle the dispute between the parties

before the Court and maintain the status quo until the rights of the parties are decided by

a competent civil Court. All other considerations are subordinated to the imperative

necessity of preserving the peace. ...The action taken by the Magistrate is of a

purely preventive and provisional nature in a civil dispute, pending final adjudication of

the rights of the parties in a civil Court. The proceedings under this section are of a

summary nature and it is essential that they should be disposed of as expeditiously as

possible delineated the following as salient points that are in favor of expeditious

execution of orders in Section 66 matters: It is quite clear, that the intention of the

legislature in enacting Part VII of the PCPA is to preserve the peace in the society. If an

unusual length of time (sometimes more than a decade) is taken to execute a

temporary order for the prevention of peace, the purpose of the legislation would

definitely be defeated and the intention of the Legislature in introducing the most

deserving action of the era in the nature of sui generis would be rendered utterly

ridiculous (emphasis added)

The above deliberations bear testimony to the importance of adhering to the prescribed

time period as matters related to Section 66 concerns breach of peace in the society and

the role of the Magistrate in such matters has been expounded as that of a preventive

nature. Therefore, if the parties are not satisfied with the given remedies by the

Magistrate Court, the parties may resort to seeking redress at a suitable forum which

will provide a permanent remedy for the conflicting rights of the parties. Hence, in light

of the temporary nature of the remedies provided by the Primary Court and the urgency

in resolving disputes effected by land to prevent the breach of peace in the society, the

expeditious conclusion of matters under Section 66 is of paramount importance.

Therefore, the contention of the appellant that the delay in filing the revision application

was due to his engagements abroad cannot be accepted as a viable reason given that

the very rationale behind the applicable provisions of the Primary Courts Procedure Act

is to provide expedient and temporary relief to a civil dispute that would otherwise

escalate to a breach of peace.

It can be further observed that delay is a subjective matter. The facts constituting delay

could vary according to the circumstances of the case and the intention of the

10

CA-PHC-140-2017 Page 10 of 10 30/05/2023 IJ-21-23

legislation. In the matter at hand, under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act, the intended time period for the conclusion of the matter, as expounded above, is

three months. Furthermore, given the temporary nature of the order and the

requirement of resolving disputes at the earliest possible opportunity, time is of the

essence.

Moreover, based on the travel records made available to this Court, it cannot be

established with clarity that the appellant was indeed stationed abroad during the time

period concerned. It is the onus of the party to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that

the reasons averred for delay are reasonable and justifiable. In the instant matter, the

appellant has failed to satisfy the court with cogent evidence that the said delay was

caused due to justifiable reasons.

Further, the learned High Court Judge has carefully deliberated over the facts of the

case in arriving at the final determination. It was the observation of the learned High

Court Judge that the case can be dismissed on the sole ground of delay. Hence, it is the

view of this Court that the learned High Court Judge has correctly dismissed the revision

application of the appellant and such dismissal even solely upon delay does not lead to

a miscarriage of justice, as I explained. Therefore, this Court has no reason to interfere

with the order dated 01.08.2017 delivered by the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha.

Appeal dismissed.

This is an appeal filed by the 2nd party petitioner appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) against the order dated 01.08.2017 delivered by the Provincial High Court of

Western Province holden in Gampaha which acted in revision against the order dated

30.07.2015 delivered by the learned Magistrate of Gampaha.

The facts of the case are as follows. The 1st Party 1st respondent (Hereinafter referred to

as the respondent) lodged a complaint against the appellant in the Police Station of

Ganemulla on 24.01.2015 stating that the appellant is using the respondents 10 feet

road way (which does not belong to the appellant) way to enter the appellants land. The

inquiry by the Police commenced on 26.01.2015 and 12.02.2015 respectively and in the

meantime the road in question was barricaded by the respondent to prevent the

appellant from using it. Thereafter, the appellant made a complaint to the Police Station

on 20.03.2015 against such action of the respondent. An inquiry was held in respect of

the said complaint made by the appellant. However, as the appellant has claimed

prescriptive rights over the disputed road way which was blocked by the respondent, a

direction by senior police officer was made to settle the matter by filing a Section 66

application in the Primary Court.

Consequently, with respect to the right of way over the disputed road, the complainant

respondent Inspector of Police had filed a Section 66 application on 31.03.2015 in the

Magistrate Court bearing No.27249/2015/PC under Section 66 (1) of Primary Courts

Procedure Act no.44 of 1979 against the respondent and the appellant.

After the filing of the affidavits and the counter affidavits by the petitioner and the

respondents, the learned Magistrate by the order dated 30.07.2015, held that the

petitioner does not have a right of way over the disputed road. The learned Magistrate

has made his order under Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

It is the contention of the appellant that the learned Magistrate has failed to consider

the inherited rights of the appellant over the land and that he has prescriptive rights

over the roadway. Therefore, aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate dated

30.07.2015, the appellant filed a revision application in the High Court of Gampaha

5

CA-PHC-140-2017 Page 5 of 10 30/05/2023 IJ-21-23

against the order of the Magistrate Court claiming that the learned Magistrate has

arrived at an erroneous conclusion.

However, by the order dated 01.08.2017, the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha

dismissed the petition of the appellant after careful consideration of the facts and

circumstances of the case which included the delay in filing the revision application.

The appellant averred that he was abroad during the time of the delivery of the learned

Magistrates order and that he filed for revision at the first opportunity after returning

to Sri Lanka. However, in the exercise of the discretionary power vested within the High

Court with regards to revision applications, it was observed by the learned High Court

Judge that the appellant had the ability to appoint a power of attorney to file the said

revision application without delay and in the absence of such actions, the revision

application cannot be maintained. Thereby, the appellant has filed an appeal before this

court to revise the order of the learned High Court judge dated 01.08.2017.

Hence, this Court is called upon to determine whether the learned High Court Judges

dismissal of the revisionary application of the appellant, on the basis of undue delay is

in any way illegal or irregular. To that end, one must first examine the legislative

rationale behind the applicable provisions of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

A matter to be highlighted at this point is that the order of the Primary (Magistrate)

evident that the legislative intention behind Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act was to conclude the matters directed to Primary Courts within 03 months which is

in the interest of maintaining peace in the society.

The aforementioned observation is supported by the following dictum in, Perera et al v

Gunetilike et al 4 NLR.181 p, where His Lordship Bonser C.J. held that:

In a country like this any attempt of parties to use force in the maintenance of their

rights should be promptly discouraged, slight brawls readily blossom into riots with

grievous hurt and murder as the fruits. It is therefore all the more necessary that

courts should be strict in discountenancing all attempts to use force in the assertion

of such civil rights as are in dispute in the present case. [Emphasis added].

Therefore, it is clear that the application of Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act maintains peace in the society without allowing minor disputes to mature into larger

violations of the law. Hence, it is the view of this Court that time is of the essence with

regards to matters concerning breach of peace in the society and that in the interest of

justice such matters must be concluded expeditiously.

Furthermore, in the case Jayantha Gunasekara v Jayatissa Gunasekara & Others,

2011 1 SLR 284, His Lordship Justice Salam, after an appreciation of the judgment

delivered by Sharvananda J. in Kanagasabai v Mylvaganam 1978 N.L.R. 280 which

held the following: The primary object of the jurisdiction so conferred on the Magistrate

is the prevention of a breach of the peace arising in respect of a dispute affecting land.

The section enables the Magistrate temporarily to settle the dispute between the parties

before the Court and maintain the status quo until the rights of the parties are decided by

a competent civil Court. All other considerations are subordinated to the imperative

necessity of preserving the peace. ...The action taken by the Magistrate is of a

purely preventive and provisional nature in a civil dispute, pending final adjudication of

the rights of the parties in a civil Court. The proceedings under this section are of a

summary nature and it is essential that they should be disposed of as expeditiously as

possible delineated the following as salient points that are in favor of expeditious

execution of orders in Section 66 matters: It is quite clear, that the intention of the

legislature in enacting Part VII of the PCPA is to preserve the peace in the society. If an

unusual length of time (sometimes more than a decade) is taken to execute a

temporary order for the prevention of peace, the purpose of the legislation would

definitely be defeated and the intention of the Legislature in introducing the most

deserving action of the era in the nature of sui generis would be rendered utterly

ridiculous (emphasis added)

The above deliberations bear testimony to the importance of adhering to the prescribed

time period as matters related to Section 66 concerns breach of peace in the society and

the role of the Magistrate in such matters has been expounded as that of a preventive

nature. Therefore, if the parties are not satisfied with the given remedies by the

Magistrate Court, the parties may resort to seeking redress at a suitable forum which

will provide a permanent remedy for the conflicting rights of the parties. Hence, in light

of the temporary nature of the remedies provided by the Primary Court and the urgency

in resolving disputes effected by land to prevent the breach of peace in the society, the

expeditious conclusion of matters under Section 66 is of paramount importance.

Therefore, the contention of the appellant that the delay in filing the revision application

was due to his engagements abroad cannot be accepted as a viable reason given that

the very rationale behind the applicable provisions of the Primary Courts Procedure Act

is to provide expedient and temporary relief to a civil dispute that would otherwise

escalate to a breach of peace.

It can be further observed that delay is a subjective matter. The facts constituting delay

could vary according to the circumstances of the case and the intention of the

10

CA-PHC-140-2017 Page 10 of 10 30/05/2023 IJ-21-23

legislation. In the matter at hand, under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act, the intended time period for the conclusion of the matter, as expounded above, is

three months. Furthermore, given the temporary nature of the order and the

requirement of resolving disputes at the earliest possible opportunity, time is of the

essence.

Moreover, based on the travel records made available to this Court, it cannot be

established with clarity that the appellant was indeed stationed abroad during the time

period concerned. It is the onus of the party to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that

the reasons averred for delay are reasonable and justifiable. In the instant matter, the

appellant has failed to satisfy the court with cogent evidence that the said delay was

caused due to justifiable reasons.

Further, the learned High Court Judge has carefully deliberated over the facts of the

case in arriving at the final determination. It was the observation of the learned High

Court Judge that the case can be dismissed on the sole ground of delay. Hence, it is the

view of this Court that the learned High Court Judge has correctly dismissed the revision

application of the appellant and such dismissal even solely upon delay does not lead to

a miscarriage of justice, as I explained. Therefore, this Court has no reason to interfere

with the order dated 01.08.2017 delivered by the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha.

Appeal dismissed.
