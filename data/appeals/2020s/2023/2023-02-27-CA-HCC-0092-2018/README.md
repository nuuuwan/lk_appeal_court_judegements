Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Colombo for having in his possession, 14.60 grams of

Diacetylmorphine commonly known as heroin on 4th October 2007, which is a

dangerous and prohibited drug, an offence in terms of Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984, punishable in

terms of the same Ordinance.

Page 3 of 21

He was also indicted for trafficking the same quantity of heroin at the same time

and at the same transaction, which is also an offence punishable in terms of the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Colombo by his judgement dated 14th

March 2018 found the appellant guilty as charged, and he was sentenced to

death by his sentencing order of the same date.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant preferred

this appeal.

The Facts in Brief

This is a raid conducted by the officers of the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB). PW-

01 who led this raid has received an information from a known informant that a

person called Ananda who lives in Kalubowila area has gone to bring heroin and

he would be returning to his house after 5 p.m. The said information has been

received by PW-01 around 1.30 p.m. in the afternoon.

Accordingly, he has assembled a team of officers. The informant has also come

to the PNB to take part in the raid. After making the necessary entries and having

followed the relevant procedures, PW-01 and his team of seven officers has left

the PNB along with the informant to the place mentioned by the informant. They

had reached a place in front of the Buddhagosha School near Kalubowila

hospital and had stopped their vehicle. The informant who was with the team

has left them stating that he will look whether the mentioned Ananda is coming

to his house and let them know.

The team of officers has waited near the said school in their vehicle expecting

the return of the informant. The informant has returned around 11.30 in the

night and had informed that the mentioned Ananda may come towards his house

at any moment. Expecting the arrival of the said person, PW-01, along with

another officer called Sampath and the private informant have walked towards

the house of the mentioned Ananda and has laid in wait near a salon, which was

Page 4 of 21

about 20 meters away from the house. Just after the midnight, the informant

has pointed to a person who is coming towards them, and after identifying him

as Ananda, has discreetly left them.

PW-01 along with the mentioned officer Sampath have confronted the person

and after identifying themselves as police officers had questioned him. According

to the evidence of PW-01, after they identified themselves, the person had

behaved strangely and had started to sweat and shiver. Upon checking the said

person, PW-01 has recovered a blue-coloured cellophane parcel with a brown-

coloured powder in his left trouser pocket. Inspecting the contents, he has

identified the brown-coloured powder as heroin through his experience as a

narcotics officer. Accordingly, the person whom the witnesses have identified in

the Court as the appellant had been arrested 10 minutes passed midnight, that

is to say, early hours of 4th October 2007.

It had been his evidence that when questioned, the appellant informed him of a

person called Shiran Harshik as the person from whom he received the heroin

and agreed to show the place from where he got it. He has given further evidence

to say that although they went in search of the mentioned person, they did not

search the place but decided to come later and returned to PNB with the

appellant and the productions taken (at page 85 and 86 of the appeal brief).

When weighed at the PNB, the brown-coloured powder has shown a weight of

186 grams. The witness has explained the procedure followed by him in order to

safely seal the productions and to handover the productions to the relevant

productions officer at the PNB on the following morning.

When PW-01 was cross-examined on behalf of the appellant, the position taken

up has been that no heroin was recovered from the appellant and no raid as

stated by the witness took place. It has been suggested that the appellants son

was taken into custody and kept in a place at Bambalapitiya and released only

after the appellant came and a parcel found near the salon was introduced to

Page 5 of 21

the appellant. The witness has rejected the suggestion, saying that he has no

reason to implicate the appellant falsely.

In supporting the evidence of PW-01, Police Inspector Sampath Ariyaratne (PW-

02) who was the officer who assisted the PW-01 in the arrest has given evidence.

He has given similar evidence to that of PW-01 in describing the incident of arrest

of the appellant with heroin in his possession.

He too has stated in his evidence that upon questioning the appellant, it was

revealed that the heroin recovered from the appellant was obtained by him from

a person called Shiran Barza, and although they went in search of him as well,

but could not arrest him (evidence recorded at page 159 of the appeal brief).

In this matter, the Government Analyst had confirmed that the productions

received in relation to this case had a pure quantity of 14.60 grams of heroin.

When called for a defence at the conclusion of prosecution evidence, the

appellant has chosen to make a statement from the dock. He has called his son

and wife to give evidence on his behalf.

Making his statement from the dock, it has been his position that, on the day in

question, he went to Kottawa to purchase some goods for the repairs of his

house. While there, he received a call that one of his workers in his garage has

fallen sick and advised him to be taken to the hospital. In a little while, he

received another call informing him that a parcel containing drugs was recovered

from Suresh who was running a salon. After some time, he received another call

from his wife Renuka informing him that the earlier mentioned Suresh and his

son Sachintha were taken away which prompted him to return home. It was his

position that he went with his wife in a three-wheeler to Bambalapitiya and he

found the van. After questioning whether he was Ananda, he and his wife were

taken inside the van where he found his son. He has stated that, thereafter, all

three of them were taken back to a place near the salon. He was severely

assaulted inside the van, and the son was handed over to his wife. Thereafter,

Page 6 of 21

he was taken to Colombo. He was asked to sign black papers and his fingerprints

were taken. He has claimed that nothing was recovered from his possession.

Evidence of Chamika Sachintha who is the son of the appellant had been that,

on the day of question, he returned home around 1.45 p.m. When he returned

home, his father was not in the house, and the mother too has gone with his

sister to attend a tuition and a swimming class. Around 2 pm, two persons came

and inquired about his father and wanted his fathers telephone number. Since

he did not have his fathers number, he gave a call to his mother and informed

that two persons are inquiring about his father. The persons who came informed

that they are from the police, although they were in civilian clothing. After about

five minutes, they left the house informing the witness not to get out of the house.

According to his evidence at around 7.30 p.m. in the night, about eight persons

including the two persons who came earlier have come to the house. By that time

too, his parents were not in the house. The persons who came have escorted the

witness to a van. After taking him, they have gone near the salon, which was

nearby, and taken Suresh, the person who runs the salon, also into the van.

It was the evidence of the witness that he was assaulted while inside the van and

one of the officers allowed him to call his mother through the officers phone and

he informed her that a group of persons came and took him away. The position

of the witness had been that he was taken to Wellawatta beach around 11 p.m.

Thereafter, the officers called the uncle of Suresh to come and pick him up. His

uncle came in a three-wheeler and took Suresh away. Later, his abductors called

his mother and informed her to come near the old passport office situated in

Bambalapitiya. After both his mother and father came, both of them were taken

into the van and taken near the salon belonging to Suresh, where the witness

was released along with his mother. The witness has stated that he saw his father

being severely assaulted inside the van and taken away.

The witness has been subjected to a lengthy cross-examination by the

prosecution. However, he has maintained the same position as above.

Page 7 of 21

In her evidence, the wife of the appellant has stated that while she was travelling

with her daughter to take her for swimming classes, she received a call from her

son stating that some persons have come and inquiring him about the father. It

was her evidence that around 7.30 in the night, she received another call where

his son told her that he is being taken away and come with the father. When she

attempted to contact the number from which the call originated, she had been

unable to do so as no connection could be established.

After coming home, she has informed her husband what took place, and both of

them had been looking for the son. She has received another call from the same

number of which she received the previous call around 1.00 a.m. in the morning

requiring her to come to the bus stand near the old passport office at

Bambalapitiya, along with her husband. When they went there, both she and

her husband were taken into the van and they found their son inside. Her

evidence was that after taking them near the salon of Suresh, she and her son

were released.

According to her evidence, the officers had assaulted her husband and taken

him away claiming that her husband will be charged for possessing heroin.

She too had been subjected to lengthy cross-examination by the prosecution.

Although it appears from the case record that the Counsel representing the

appellant had informed the Court that he is closing the defence case, the learned

trial Judge who presided over the case then, has ordered the appellant to take

steps to obtain the telephone call details as revealed in the defence evidence on

the basis that the truthfulness of the defence position can be determined if the

telephone call details are available to Court.

However, it appears from the case record, that endeavour has not been

successful and the learned trial Judge before whom the defence evidence was

taken has gone on transfer.

When this matter was mentioned before the learned High Court Judge who

ultimately pronounced the judgement, it has been informed that the defence has

Page 8 of 21

closed its case. It has been decided to proceed with the trial by adopting the

previous evidence.

However, the learned High Court Judge has informed the appellant that if he so

wishes he can recall the relevant previous witnesses for the purpose of cross-

examining them again, obviously, because the relevant witnesses have not given

evidence before the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly, at the request of the appellants Counsel, the learned High Court

Judge has allowed the recalling of witness number 01 and 02 and subjecting

them to cross-examination again, which has resulted in PW-01 and 02 being re-

summoned.

Accordingly, PW-01 has been subjected to cross-examination again. While being

cross-examined, it has been noted by the learned High Court Judge, that the

said witness was recalled for the purpose of observing the demeanour and

deportment of the witness. The learned High Court Judge also has questioned

the witness as to the street value of the heroin alleged to be found in the

possession of the appellant.

It appears from the proceedings of 25-05-2017, it was the learned High Court

Judge who has decided to conclude the further cross-examination on the basis

that the Court had the opportunity of observing the demeanor and deportment

of the witness. Furthermore, the learned High Court Judge has decided that it

was not necessary to recall PW-02 for the purpose of cross-examination, as he

has already observed the demeanour and deportment of PW-01, who was the

raiding officer and there is no need for him to observe PW-02 for that purpose.

However, subsequent to an application made against the order of the learned

High Court Judge, the Court of Appeal has given a direction to the Court that

PW-02 should also be recalled and the defence should be given the opportunity

of cross-examining him, which has resulted in PW-02 also being subjected to

cross-examination for the 2nd time.

Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel urged the following

grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. The conviction of the appellant by the learned High Court Judge was

contrary to the law and the evidence led in the trial Court.

2. The learned High Court Judge has failed to take to his notice the

improbability and the inconsistency of the prosecution witness number

1 and 2 and that the prosecution has failed to prove the case against

the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

3. The learned High Court Judge has failed to properly analyze the

evidence.

4. The learned High Court Judge has failed to analyze and consider the

defence evidence in its correct perspective.

5. The appellant has been denied of a right to a fair trial, as the learned

High Court Judge has been prejudiced before the conclusion of the trial

and even before the analysis of all the evidence presented to Court.

Commenting on the probability factor of the evidence of PW-01 and 02, it was

the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel that the Court should have

looked at whether it was probable for an informant who gave a call and provided

an information, to come to the PNB thereafter and expose himself and also to

travel together with the raiding party.

It was his position that the raiding party waiting for such a long time as

mentioned in the evidence, expecting the return of the informant who has left

after they reached the place where the informant has stated that the appellant

would come, was also not probable given the way the evidence has been

unfolded.

He was also of the view that as of normal practice, if a person is arrested with

heroin in front of his house as alleged by the prosecution witnesses, the raiding

Page 10 of 21

party not going into the house of the arrested person and searching it creates a

doubt whether this was an actual incident or not.

Referring to the contradictions in the evidence of PW-01 and 02, it was the

position of the learned Presidents Counsel that in his evidence-in-chief, PW-02

had stated that PW-01 informed him to get ready for a raid at 2.55 p.m. (at page

147 of the appeal brief) while PW-01 has stated that they left for the raid at 2.35

p.m. (at page 80 of the appeal brief). He points to the facts that at a later stage

of his evidence, PW-02 has stated that they left at 2.15 p.m. (at page 150 of the

appeal brief).

Furthermore, it was pointed out that PW-02 in his evidence (at page 154 of the

appeal brief) has stated that the person they apprehended was wearing a brown

coloured trouser and a T-Shirt while, PW-01 (at page 82 of the appeal brief) has

stated that the person apprehended by them was wearing a white and grey

coloured three-quarter trouser. It was contended that the learned trial Judge has

failed to consider these contradictions and infirmities per se and inter se, and

the learned High Court Judge was not correct when it was determined that there

were no contradictions in the prosecution witnesses evidence.

The learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the trial Court has permitted the

evidence, which amounts to a confession as to the offence committed by the

appellant to be admitted at the trial. He pointed out to the evidence in chief by

PW-01 where he had stated that after the arrest, the appellant confessed about

a person who supplied heroin to him (at page 85 and 86 of the appeal brief). It

was contended that even when PW-02 was giving evidence, same confessional

statement alleged to have been made by the appellant had been admitted as

evidence (at page 159 of the appeal brief).

It was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel that admitting such

evidence was against the law, and it was his view that the leaned High Court

Judge has made use of such inadmissible evidence in his judgement in a subtle

way, which has denied a fair trial towards his client.

Page 11 of 21

He was critical of the procedure adopted by the learned trial Judge by curtailing

the cross-examination of PW-01 when he was recalled to be cross-examined on

the basis that evidence of PW-01 and 02 were not recorded before him,

apparently in terms of Section 48 of the Judicature Act. It was his position that

the way the learned trial Judge has decided to end the cross-examination of PW-

01 and not to recall PW-02 after he was summoned in order to allow the appellant

to cross-examine him for a 2nd time was not correct. The fact that the appellant

had to go before the Court of Appeal challenging the order of the learned High

Court Judge where the Court of Appeal ordered that the learned High Court

Judge should allow PW-02 to be subjected to cross-examination are also matters

in his view, that has denied a fair trial towards the appellant.

Commenting on the defence taken up by the appellant, it was the position of the

learned Presidents Counsel that the appellant who has made a dock statement

has called his son and the wife to substantiate the position taken up by him at

the trial. It was his complaint that the learned trial Judge had failed to consider

the defence evidence in an equal footing and come to a finding in the correct

perspective as to whether that has created a reasonable doubt on the prosecution

case, rather than rejecting the defence evidence in a biased manner.

It was his submission that the learned High Court Judge has first considered

the prosecution evidence and had come to a finding that the prosecution has

proved its case before considering the defence evidence and thereby

compartmentalized the evidence rather than considering them as a whole. It was

his view that the learned High Court Judge has been prejudiced when he

considered the defence evidence and rejected it. It was the position of the learned

Presidents Counsel that this is a judgement that should not be allowed to stand

as the prosecution has failed to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt.

It was the submission of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) that

although the judgement of the learned High Court Judge gives an appearance

Page 12 of 21

that the learned High Court Judge has compartmentalized the evidence in his

findings, each Judge has his or her own way of writing.

It was the position of the learned DSG that the evidence of the prosecution as

well as that of the defence has been well considered by the learned High Court

Judge and there is no material to consider that the appellant has been prejudiced

in the way the judgement has been written.

Taking up the position that when the learned High Court Judge mentioned that

the prosecution case has been established through means that the

prosecution has presented cogent evidence, and considering the defence case

thereafter, does not amount to prejudice, it was the position of the learned DSG

that it should not be looked at in such a manner.

Commenting on the evidence that has been admitted which amounts to that of

confessional in nature, it was his position that since this is not a trial by jury

and Judges are learned in the law, where they have the ability to distinguish

admissible and inadmissible evidence. It was his contention that in the instant

matter, the mentioned evidence relating to a confession has not been considered

by the learned High Court Judge in his judgement and therefore, it cannot be

said that a fair trial has not been afforded to the appellant.

It was pointed out that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the

prosecution and the defence evidence and accepted the prosecution evidence

with clear reasoning, while rejecting the defence also with clear reasoning, has

come to his finding of guilt within the accepted parameters of the law. Relying

on the proviso to Article 138 of the Constitution and the related judgements of

our Superior Courts in that regard, it was his submission that this is a

judgement that needs no interference as the contested defects and irregularities

have not prejudiced the substantial rights of the appellant or occasioned a failure

of justice.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

As the grounds of appeal urged by the learned Presidents Counsel are

interrelated, I will now proceed to consider the said grounds as a whole in order

to find whether there is merit in the same.

Since one of the main arguments presented on behalf of the appellant was that

the trial Court had permitted evidence that amounts to a confession to be

admitted, hence, it is not safe to let the conviction stand, I would now proceed

to consider the relevant argument and the law in that regard.

The contentious parts of the evidence by PW-01 are as follows.

When PW-02 gave his evidence, the question posed to the witness and the answer

was as follows.

:

.

Page 14 of 21

(At Page 159 of the appeal brief)

In terms of section 17 (2) of the Evidence Ordinance, a confession has been

defined as follows;

17 (2). A confession is an admission made at any time by a person,

accused of any offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he

committed that offence.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his book The Law of Evidence Volume 1 at page

378 refers to the necessary elements of a confession in the following manner.

Section 17 (2) defines a confession as an admission made at any time by

a person, accused of any offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he

committed that offence. This definition suggests 4 elements.

(a) It must be an admission, that is, a statement, oral or documentary,

which suggests an inference as to any fact in issue or relevant fact

within the meaning of Section 17 (1) of the Ordinance:

(b) It may be made at any time;

(c) It must be made by a person accused of an offence;

(d) It must state or suggest the inference that he committed that

offence.

This definition tallies substantially with Stephens definition of a

confession as an admission made at any time by a person charged with

a crime stating or suggesting the inference, that he committed that crime.

(Stephen, Digest, op. cit., 4th Ed., Art. 28, pp. 28-29)

There cannot be any doubt that the above-mentioned pieces of evidence led

before the trial Court are evidence that shows that the appellant has confessed

as to his source of heroin, which amounts to an admission of his guilt. It is also

in evidence that the said statement has been made when the appellant was under

arrest in the custody of PW-01.

Page 15 of 21

Section 25 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance reads thus;

25 (1). No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as

against a person accused of any offence.

The above provision is subject to exceptions in relation to laws like Prevention of

Terrorism Act where a confession becomes relevant if it can be proved that such

a confession was not caused by inducement, threat, or promise as provided for

in Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance.

As contend correctly by the learned DSG, although a confessional statement has

been admitted in evidence, if it can be shown that the learned trial Judge who

pronounced the judgement has not made use of such a confession in his

judgement by applying the correct legal principles, it cannot be said that the

learned trial Judge has been prejudiced and a fair trial has not been afforded. It

was his view that as a person trained in law a Judge is well equipped not to

consider inadmissible evidence in a judgment.

Under the circumstances, the matter that needs the attention of this Court is

whether the mentioned confessional statement has been considered by the

learned trial Judge in his judgement. In the judgement, while analyzing the

evidence of PW-01, at page 08 of the judgement (at page 410 of the appeal brief),

the learned High Court Judge has stated as follows;

.

. .

.

Page 16 of 21

Referring to the evidence of PW-02 at page 13 of the judgement (page 415 of the

appeal brief), it has been stated that;

.

It is my view that by looking at the way the learned High Court Judge has referred

to the relevant evidence of PW-01 and 02, the learned High Court Judge being a

person well learned in the law, had been aware that a statement made to a police

officer which amounts to a confession cannot be accepted as evidence. This

becomes clear in the way the learned High Court Judge has referred to the

contentious part of the evidence by avoiding the portion where the witnesses say

that the appellant informed them that the heroin was supplied by the mentioned

Shiran, and that was the reason why they went in search of that person.

The learned High Court Judge has glossed over the contentious statement in

order to take it out of the meaning of a confession. It is my view that this should

not be the way the evidence in a case should be looked at.

If the learned trial Judge had determined that he is not going to consider the

parts of the evidence which amounts to a confession and had not used it in a

way giving it a different meaning, it can be agreed that such a statement has not

prejudiced the mind of the learned High Court Judge being trained as to how

such prejudicial evidence should be disregarded.

However, I am not in a position to agree with the submissions of the learned DSG

that the learned High Court Judge has not been influenced by the evidence of

PW-01 and 02 that the appellant disclosed his source of heroin in the judgement.

I am of the view, that the judgement points to the fact, that although not in a

direct manner, it has influenced the final outcome of the judgement, when the

learned High Court Judge stated; At page 25 of the judgement (page 427 of the

appeal brief) that;

Page 17 of 21

186

. (The emphasis is mine)

Under the circumstances, it is my view that this is an irregularity that goes into

the core of the judgement, which cannot provide cover in terms of the proviso to

Article 138 of the Constitution.

The next matter I would like to highlight is the way the learned High Court Judge

who finally pronounced the judgement has proceeded to hear the case from

where his successor has stopped.

When the learned High Court Judge commenced the hearing of the matter, the

evidence of the prosecution had been concluded and the evidence of the defence

as well.

In terms of section 48 of the Judicature Act, when a matter is taken up before a

successor of a Judge who previously heard the case, the matter may be

continued before such Judge who shall have the power to act on the evidence

already recorded by his predecessor or partly recorded by his predecessor and

partly recorded by him, if he thinks fit, to re-summon the witness and commence

the proceedings afresh.

The proviso to the section 48 of the Judicature Act reads as follows:

48. Provided that where any criminal prosecution, proceeding or

matter (except on an inquiry preliminary to committal for trial) is

continued before the successor of any such Judge, the accused may

demand that the witness be re-summoned and reheard.

There is nothing to indicate that the appellant made such a demand before the

learned High Court Judge. However, it appears that on his own motion, which I

believe for the purposes of fair play, the learned High Court Judge has allowed

Page 18 of 21

the defence to determine whether it needs to recall any witnesses for the purpose

of cross-examination.

As a result, an application has been made by the defence to recall PW-01 and 02

and subject them to cross-examination. Accordingly, they have been re-

summoned, and witness number 01 has been subjected to cross-examination

partly.

It is my considered view that once you allow a witness to be re-summoned and

subject him to be cross-examined for the 2nd time, the defence should be allowed

to cross-examine the witness in full, rather than concluding the cross-

examination by the trial Judge himself on the basis that he had the opportunity

of observing the demeanour and deportment of the witness sufficiently.

When the PW-01 was subjected to cross-examination for the 2nd time, at page

376 of the appeal brief, the learned High Court Judge has recorded the following.

.

.

, ,

.

.

After recording as earlier, the learned High Court Judge has proceeded to

question the witness as to the value of the heroin detected by him in the year

2007, and the witness has answered the question indicating a general value he

can determine for a gram of heroin at that time.

After allowing the learned Counsel for the appellant to further cross-examine the

witness on the questions posed by the Court, the learned High Court Judge has

Page 19 of 21

decided that since the Court heard sufficient evidence to determine the

demeanour of the witness, the cross-examination will be concluded.

He has determined further, that although PW-02 has also been summoned for

the purposes of cross-examination, since he has observed the demeanour and

deportment of witness number 01, there would be no necessity to recall PW-02.

The above determination, which appears in page 380 of the appeal brief, reads

as follows.

. .

. .

.. 2 . ..

1 .

.. 2

. .. 2 .

.

It is my view that although the appellant had gone before the Court of Appeal

and obtained a directive that the learned High Court Judge should allow witness

number 02 to be cross-examined and accordingly, it had been done, the damage

caused by then, when it comes to the principle of a fair trial, is a matter that

cannot be ignored.

I find that when the learned High Court Judge decided to stop the cross-

examination of witness number 01, the said witness had not been confronted

with the position taken up by the defence. Although, the learned High Court

Judge has decided that the evidence recorded in the cross-examination before

him was sufficient for him to determine the demeanour and deportment of the

witness, I am of the view that without observing his evidence with regard to the

Page 20 of 21

defence put forward by the appellant, determining the demeanour and

deportment would be of no value.

As trained witnesses in giving evidence in this type of matters, there may hardly

be any infirmity of a witness in relation to a raid conducted by him. It would be

only by confronting a witness in relation to the defence of an accused person and

cross examining the supporting witnesses, an accused person can create a doubt

in the evidence or in the other hand, the Court can be satisfied that the evidence

was cogent and truthful.

Furthermore, it needs to be remembered that the judicial system in this country

is based on adversarial system and not on the inquisitorial system. Judges are

not expected to assume the role of a prosecutor and put questions to witnesses

which may tend to cause prejudice to either party, may it be an accused or the

prosecution. This does not mean that a trial Judge has to be a silent observer. A

trial Judge is always permitted to question witnesses in order to clarify matters

and to have a control over the proceedings before him.

For the reasons as stated above, I am of the view that this is a matter where a

fair trial principle has been violated which has caused prejudice towards the

appellant.

Hence, it is my considered view that this is a case where it is not safe to allow

the conviction and the sentence of the accused appellant to stand.

I am of the view that considering the other grounds of appeal urged would not

be necessary, as the appeal should succeed as stated above.

Therefore, I set aside the conviction and the sentence of the appellant by the

learned High Court Judge.

The next matter to be considered is whether this a fit and proper case to consider

sending the matter for a retrial.

This is a matter where the offence had alleged to have been committed on 4th

of October 2007. The accused had been released on bail by the High Court on

27th of July 2010, nearly 3 years after being in remand custody. The judgement

has been pronounced after a protracted trial on 14-03-2018, nearly 10 years

after the alleged offence. Up to now, the appellant has been in incarceration

pending the determination of the appeal for a period of nearly 4 years and 10

months.

Taking all these factors into account, I am of the view that ordering a retrial is

not warranted and this is not a fit and fair case to order such a retrial.

Accordingly, I am of the view that this Court has no option but to acquit the

appellant.

The appeal is allowed, and the appellant is acquitted of the charges preferred

against him.
