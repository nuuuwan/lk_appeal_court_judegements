RESPONDENTS

Before: Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Dhammika Ganepola J.

Counsel: Sanjeewa Jayawardena PC with Rukshan Senadheera for the Petitioner.

Sumathi Dharmawardena PC ASG with S. Dunuwille SC for the 1st to 14th, 16th,

and 19th to 21st Respondents.

Argued on: 19.09.2023

Written Submissions- Petitioner - 06.11.2023

1st to 14th,16th, and 19th to 21st Respondents - 03.11.2023

Decided on: 05.12.2023

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The main relief sought by the Petitioner is for a quashing order against the decision of

some of the Respondents including the 1st Respondent- National Insurance Trust Fund

(NITF) to interdict the Petitioner with effect from 16.12.2019, as evident from the letter

dated 15.12.2019 marked P14. The Petitioner also challenges the communication of the

4th Respondent- Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (Commission) dated

12.12.2019 marked P13. The said Commission notified the Chairman of NITF by the

said letter 'P13' that the NITF's operations were being run in a way that was harmful to

the organization, the national interest, and the policyholders' interests. This information

was gleaned from the Ernst and Young special audit report in which it is further revealed,

Page 6 of 12

inter alia, that the Petitioner- Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the NITF had been acting

without due care neglecting the fiduciary duties. In addition to the above reliefs, a

directive is also sought by the Petitioner against several Respondents, to reinstate the

Petitioner as the CEO of the NITF.

The Petitioner has also filed another Writ Application bearing case No. CA/

Writ/114/2021 in this Court seeking relief pertaining to the decision of several

Respondents to send the Petitioner on alleged premature retirement with effect from

15.04.2021 as reflected in a letter dated 08.10.2020. When the instant Application as well

as the case bearing No. CA/Writ/114/2021 was taken up in open Court on 19.09.2023

both parties of the said CA/Writ/114/2021 agreed to abide by the final determination of

this Court in respect of the instant Application. Accordingly, all parties moved that the

legal issues of the said CA/Writ/114/2021 also be addressed by this Court in the final

judgement of the instant Application.

The issues relating to both of the above writ applications revolve around the interdiction

of the Petitioner and his subsequent retirement. It is important to note that at the time of

the said interdiction, the Petitioner was on probation, however, his services have not been

confirmed at any point in time. Given the letter of appointment dated 17.11.2014 marked

P4, the Petitioner needs to be on probation for three years from the date of appointment

and his position was to be confirmed after satisfactory services. Since the third year of the

Petitioner's services, the Regulator (the Commission/ Insurance Board of Sri Lanka1) by

way of letters such as R9, R11, R12, R10, R13 and R6 has voiced several concerns

about the alleged mismanagement of risks related to business operations, non-submission

of statutory returns, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements against the NITF.

Apart from those, several directions have been issued by the Commission to the Petitioner

to rectify several shortcomings and to improve the standards of the business operations of

NITF. (Vide-'R4, R5, and the annexures to R6.)

It appears that the Petitioner has been interdicted primarily based on a direction issued by

the said Commission under section 57(1)(b) of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act

1 By the Regulation of Insurance Industry (Amendment) Act, No. 23 of 2017 the principal enactment (Act No. 43 of 2000) has been amended and accordingly, in the principal enactment and in any other written law, there shall be substituted for the words "Insurance Board of Sri Lanka" and "Board" (denoting the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka), of the words "Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka" and "Commission" respectively.

Page 7 of 12

No. 43 of 2000 (Act). The said Commission by its letter dated 12.12.2019 ('P13') has

informed the Petitioner that seven critical issues identified by the special audit report of

Ernst and Young had been considered and given the seriousness of such matters, the

Commission had decided to direct NITF inter alia, to remove the Petitioner and the Chief

Financial Officer from their respective positions and to appoint suitable persons with

immediate effect. Further, the Commission has directed the NITF to warn the Members

of the Board of NITF for not taking corrective action referring to the 151st and 153rd

Board Meetings.

The Petitioner states that an independent audit can be commissioned by the 4th

Respondent only if the interest of the policyholders of an insurer is in danger; or any

insurer is unable to meet its obligations; or has made a default in complying with any of

the provisions of the said Act. Further, it is submitted that giving reasonable notice and

providing an opportunity to be heard is necessary in that regard. The Petitioner contends

that the interests of the policyholders of the NITF were not in danger and the insurer never

failed to meet its obligations or never made a default in complying with the provisions of

the Act.

However, the Petitioner was interdicted and disciplinary proceedings were commenced

against the Petitioner. In the meantime, the Petitioner reached the age of 55 years; the

optional retirement age. The Board of Directors of the NITF on 10.09.2020 granted

approval to retire the Petitioner at the age of 55 years in view of Clause III of the Public

Enterprise Circular 01/2013 (PE Circular). Clause III of the said PE Circular reads;

If the appointing authority decides that the extension of service beyond the age of

55 years, should not be granted to any officer, whose efficiency and performance is

not satisfactory, the appointing authority has the authority to retire him/her from

the service by giving 06 months prior notice, enabling the officer to appeal against

the decision.

The Chairman of NITF issuing a letter dated 08.10.2020 informed the Petitioner that he

will be made to retire with effect from 15.04.2021 in terms of the above Clause III of the

PE Circular but subject to the pendency of the disciplinary inquiry against him. A charge

sheet dated 09.06.2021 was served on the Petitioner who has subsequently denied all the

charges framed against him. When the instant Application was supported before this

Page 8 of 12

Court on 06.08.2020 while issuing formal notice of this Application on the Respondents

the Court directed the NITF to pay the Petitioner half the last drawn salary with effect

from the date of his interdiction up to a determination that could be made consequent to

a disciplinary inquiry. Nevertheless, the retirement of the Petitioner was made effective on

the dates reflected in the letter dated 08.10.2020.

The Petitioner challenging the decision of the Commission to remove the Petitioner from

his position submits that the Commission has not exercised its powers with due adherence

to the basic rules of Natural Justice and the fundamental principles of administrative law.

The additional argument raised by the Petitioner is that the decision to interdict him was

taken by the Board of NITF at a meeting held without the necessary quorum. Another

facet of the argument of the Petitioner is that under section 21 of the National Insurance

Trust Fund Act No. 28 of 2006 ('NITF Act') the Board of the NITF is the appointing and

disciplinary authority of the Petitioner and as such the 15th Respondent who was the

Acting Chairman of NITF at that time had no authority to interdict the Petitioner.

The Commission contends that the Principal Officer of an insurer is responsible for the

general control, direction and supervision of the insurer's business activities. It is further

stated that the Commission has received several complaints about the procurement process

for reinsurance in respect of the NNDIS Cover (National Natural Disaster Insurance

Scheme). Additionally, the NITF which was under the control and supervision of the

Petitioner has been accused of failing to comply with regulations issued by the

Commission; failing to file statutory returns, and also to respond to the repeated directives

and orders of the Commission relating to such failures. The Commission under section 54

of the said Act ordered an investigation into the affairs of NITF as a consequence of the

above-mentioned mismanagement.

It is important to observe that by way of the letter dated 09.04.2018 marked P8 the

Petitioner has communicated to the Commission the concurrence of the NITF to appoint

an independent auditor to carry out an audit and as per the scope indicated in the

Commissions letter dated 27.03.2018 (R14). According to the Commission, the

Petitioners allegation of failing to give a fair hearing is limited to the Petitioners personal

opinion and not that of the NITF. Not only is the aforementioned R14 evidence of the

NITF's agreement to appoint an independent auditor, but the Director of Finance of the

NITF also addressed the Petitioner with a letter marked R15 in that regard. Similarly,

Page 9 of 12

Board Paper No.155-09, marked 'R22', emphasizes the concurrence of the Board of the

NITF to conduct an independent audit. The Petitioner has neither challenged the

respective audit report per se nor has he taken steps to name Ernst and Young as a party

in this Application.

Having carefully perused the communication between the Commission and the NITF, it

appears that the Commission has given sufficient opportunity to the NITF to raise any

concerns on the decision to commence an investigation. Hence, the question that arises is

whether due notice or opportunity to defend was given to the Petitioner personally.

It is not in dispute that the Petitioner served as the CEO who is considered the Principal

Officer of the NITF. The primary duty of a Principal Officer is to hold the responsibility

for providing dynamic leadership to steer whatever the organization he gets in all aspects

such as policy, teamwork, labour force and also to uphold the objectives and vision of the

respective institution. In terms of the Board Paper marked 'P5', the CEO of the NITF shall

be the Chief Administrative and Operational Officer and he shall direct and supervise its

administrative affairs and general management; and perform such other duties as may be

prescribed from time to time by the Board of the NITF. Thus, the Petitioner was bestowed

with a paramount responsibility to carry out his duties enabling the Board of the NITF to

fulfill its objectives laid down in section 12 of the said NITF Act. In light of the sequence

of circumstances that occurred since the time at which it was decided to carry out an

independent audit, I take the view that the Petitioner's rights and opportunities to defend

himself did not tend to be eliminated until the moment he was interdicted.

One of the main allegations against the Respondents is that the Petitioner was never

informed that his standard of services was unsatisfactory to the Respondents. It is observed

that most of the communication originating from the Commissioner was addressed to the

personal name of the Petitioner. In light of my findings above, especially in respect of the

gravity of the responsibilities of a CEO, I am of the view that the totality of the contents

of those letters focus on the conduct of the Petitioner to a greater extent. The Petitioner

himself has responded to some of the letters by which the NITF was requested to provide

reasons for alleged mismanagement.

There is no evidence before Court for me to disbelieve that the Petitioner being the CEO

of NITF had the full privilege of responding effectively to any communication including

Page 10 of 12

the directives of the Commission. Despite the Petitioner's complaints of a breach of natural

justice, I cannot see any instance where the Petitioner's right to defense was restricted or

hampered. In contrast to a typical employment contract between a minor employee and

an employer, the Petitioner's role and responsibilities must be assessed from a broader

perspective while taking into account the required standards of service concerning the

advancement and enhancement of the statutory obligations of the NITF. Hence, the issue

of whether the Petitioner has been heard or been allowed to defend himself should be

evaluated based on the overall facts and circumstances of this case without clinging to

objections of a technical nature. The judgement of Thalayarathne Mudalige Jagath

Wickramasekara v. State Mortgage and Investment Bank CA/Writ/160/2022 decided on

23.11.2023, portrays a certain evolution of legal jurisprudence, regarding the concept of

Natural Justice which has gone beyond its ancient parameters and giving it a broader

definition. To my mind, the issue relating to the Petitioner continuing to hold the post of

CEO as emanated through the documents annexed as R2 dilutes the strength of the

Petitioner's argument on Natural Justice.

As opposed to the argument raised by the Petitioner that the 15th Respondent had no

authority to issue the letter interdicting the Petitioner, the NITF asserts that the respective

letter of interdiction ('P14') has been copied inter alia, to the Secretary to the Treasury and

on a subsequent date the Board of the NITF ratified the decision to interdict the Petitioner.

In support of such assertions, the NITF has annexed Board Paper No. 162-01 dated

17.02.2020 & 24.02.2020 ('A2' and 'A3') and the letter dated 12.12.2019 (marked 'P13')

addressed to NITF by the Commission. One may argue as per the traditional norm that if

an initial stage during a decision-making process is faulty then the whole process becomes

a nullity. If I am to uphold such a stand stand, I will be restricting the modern evolution

of legal jurisprudence concerning the customary principles of the Rule of Natural Justice.

Anyhow, I am not inclined to accept such a proposition in this case. The facts and

circumstances of this case lead me to hold that the subsequent ratification by the members

of the Board of the NITF, who met many a time after issuing the letter of interdiction

(P14), transformed the said impugned decision to interdict the Petitioner into a

semblance where such decision was taken with everyone's approval.

Now I advert to the issue on the retirement of the Petitioner. As mentioned above, the

Board of the NITF at its 166th meeting held on 03.09.2020 has decided to place the

Page 11 of 12

Petitioner on retirement in terms of Clause III of the PE Circular. The Petitioner placing

reliance on the judgement of Devendra Budalge Sudesh Lalitha Perera v. Janatha Estates

Development Board CA/ WRIT/004/2022 decided on 06.10.2022 formulates an argument

that the NITF marginalizing and victimizing the Petitioner has prematurely retired him a)

without even issuing a show cause notice on the Petitioner; b) without holding an inquiry

or carrying out an efficiency/ performance evaluation, in accordance with the basic rules

of Natural Justice. In the said Devendra Budalge Sudesh Lalitha Perera case this Court has

observed that in reference to the said PE Circular 01/2013 the appointing authority has

not been bestowed with an unfettered discretion to terminate the services of an employee

under such Circulars, unless an appropriate inquiry is held or a proper assessment on

efficiency and performance is carried out according to the rules of Natural Justice and the

rule of law.

I cannot possibly overlook at this stage, the fact that the Petitioner was not an employee

whose services were confirmed even after the lapse of the initial period of probation

stipulated in the contract of employment. Thus, the Petitioner was made to retire when he

was serving as an unconfirmed officer. This court earlier in this judgement observed that

the Commission started raising various issues on the management of NITF during the

period the Petitioner was serving his first three years as a probationer. I believe, by now,

that I have substantially dealt with the argument of the Petitioner upon the rule of Natural

Justice. The phrase whose efficiency and performance is not satisfactory, embodied in

Clause III of the PE Circular cannot be assessed in isolation of the other related events

that have taken place both before and after the interdiction of the Petitioner. Based on the

evidence made available to Court, I am satisfied that a proper assessment on efficiency

and performance of the Petitioner has been carried out by the Commission.

Anyhow, the decision to retire the Petitioner was taken whilst a disciplinary inquiry

against the Petitioner was pending. Despite my findings above it is observed that a fresh

question emanates due to the non-conclusion of the disciplinary inquiry commenced

against the Petitioner. The question as to whether the Petitioner should be afforded an

opportunity to establish his alleged defense at the said disciplinary inquiry to clear his

image needs to be resolved. This is because the Petitioner in the said CA/Writ/114/2021

asserts that the principles of Natural Justice have been violated by not giving an

opportunity for him to defend himself against the allegations of unsatisfactory service that

Page 12 of 12

is embodied in Clause III of the PE Circular. Thus, I take the view that the said question

should be duly examined in CA/Writ/114/2021 for the best interest of justice and for the

fuller and proper adjudication of the said Application.

Having considered the main questions pertaining to the instant Application what remains

to be considered is whether a deep evaluation is necessary regarding the Respondents'

objections. The Respondents among other objections resist the maintainability of the

instant Application. One such is that no writ lies upon the alleged grievances of the

Petitioner as those emanating from the contract of employment entered into between the

Petitioner and the NITF. However, it is important to note that this court has constantly

decided, inter alia, that the Court of Appeal has the discretionary power to exercise writ

jurisdiction even on a question arising out of a contract of employment if the disciplinary

order of a public authority was in breach of statutory restrictions/provisions2. I am

convinced that all such issues in relation to breach of statutory restrictions have been

considered above and thus, there is no necessity to assay this objection as well as the other

objections which are in preliminary nature.

In the circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs as prayed

for in the prayer of the Petition. Thus, I proceed to dismiss the instant application.

Application is dismissed.
