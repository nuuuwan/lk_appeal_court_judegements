D. N. Samarakoon J.,

Section 02 (1) and (2) of RECOVERY OF POSSESSION OF PREMISES GIVEN ON

LEASE ACT, No. 1 OF 2023 says,

2. (1) Where any premises has been given on lease by a lessor, such

lessor may, subject to the provisions of subsection (2), institute action for

the recovery of possession of such premises in the Court having

jurisdiction over the local limits within which

(a) the premises given on lease is situated;

(b) the lessee resides;

(c) the cause of action arises; or

(d) the lease agreement sought to be enforced was made.

(2) An action shall not be instituted by a lessor under the provisions of this

Act for the recovery of possession of a premises given on lease or for any

relief specified in subsection (2) of section 5 unless possession of such

premises has been given to the lessee by a lease agreement.

Section 04(1) says,

4. (1) The lessor (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff) shall institute

an action by presenting a plaint in the form specified in the Civil Procedure

Code and shall file with such plaint

(a) an affidavit to the effect that the possession of the premises given on

lease which is the subject matter of the action (hereinafter referred to as

the premises) is lawfully due to the plaintiff from the lessee (hereinafter

referred to as the defendant);

(b) a draft decree nisi together with the applicable stamps as required by

law, for the decree nisi and service thereof; and

(c) such number of copies of the plaint, affidavit and lease agreement,

together with any document relied on by the lessor, as is equal to the

number of defendants in the action, if there are more than one defendant.

Section 05, among other things, says,

the Court shall enter a decree nisi in the form set out in the First

Schedule to recover the possession of the premises described in the plaint,

together with any of the reliefs specified in subsection (2).

Section 08(1) says,

8. (1) A decree nisi shall be served on the defendant to recover possession

of the premises as asserted by the plaintiff while giving the defendant a

reasonable opportunity to make an application to seek leave to appear and

show cause, in respect of his position.

Section 11(1) and (2) says,

11. (1) The date to be specified in the decree nisi as the date on which

the defendant is to make an application seeking leave to appear and show

cause, if any, against the decree nisi shall be as early a date as can

conveniently be specified, regard being had to the distance from the

defendants residence to the Court. In any such instance, the said date to

be specified shall not be later than six weeks from the date of the decree

nisi.

(2) The Court shall not grant the defendant any further time to make an

application to enable the defendant to seek leave to appear and show cause

against such decree nisi.

The learned Additional District Judge has entered decree nisi on 11.08.2023.

The notice returnable date was 14.09.2023.

On 14.09.2023, the learned Attorney at Law who appeared for the defendant

stating that the defendant is in remand custody and moved for two weeks time

to file to file petition and affidavit to obtain leave to appear and defend, as per

section 12 of the Act, the relevant parts of which reads,

12. (1) In an action instituted under this Act, the defendant shall not

appear and show cause against the decree nisi unless he first obtains leave

to appear and show cause from the Court which issued the decree nisi.

(2) The defendant shall, for the purpose of subsection (1), file an

application by way of a petition for leave to appear and show cause against

the decree nisi supported by an affidavit and such petition and affidavit

shall deal specifically with the plaintiffs case and state clearly and

concisely what the defence to the plaintiffs case is and what facts are relied

upon to support it.

However, the learned Additional District Judge on the basis, among other things,

that section 11(2) does not permit her to permit the defendant to do so Ehi 11(2)

wyawasthadayakaya wisin adhikaranayata labaadee netha, refused that

application and made the decree nisi absolute.

Two of the reliefs claimed by the defendant petitioner before this Court is to set

aside the order dated 14.09.2023 and to set aside the order absolute.

There is no dispute, that, the defendant was in remand custody from 06.09.2023

to 20.09.2023.

This matter was supported on 02.10.2023 ex parte, on the basis of urgency and

the Court satisfied on a prima facie basis issued (formal) notice and a stay order

staying the execution of the writ in case No. DRE(S).41/2023 until the next date

of this case.

On 10.10.2023, the notice returnable date, the learned counsel for the plaintiff

respondent moved to file objections by 12.10.2023 (within 02 days) and both

learned counsel agreed to file Counter Affidavits on 31.10.2023 and to argue the

matter on 03.11.2023.

Court heard submissions of both the learned counsel on Friday the 03rd

November 2023 and they agreed to file written submissions on Monday the 06th

November 2023, thus working during the weekend.

The judgment was fixed for 27th November 2023.

On that day or the next date for judgment, which was, 08th December 2023, it

could have been given, if not for the fact that I have to sit on a Specially

Constituted Bench in regard to Writ 685/2023, which concerned the Sri Lanka

Cricket and which continued up to 13th and 15th December for which I had to sit

on eight different occasions, which case was ultimately terminated.

As a mark of respect to both learned counsel, who cooperated to conclude this

case within the above tight time schedule, without prolonged and unnecessary

legal positions raised in certain other cases in the name of advocacy (especially

to Mr. Boopathy Kahathuduwa for the plaintiff respondent who did not raise the

preliminary objection he had relied upon earlier) this Court determined to give

its judgment within this term and year refixed the date of the judgment from 15th

December to today, 19th December, which is within the period colloquially

referred to as the Court Vacation.

It is appropriate to note, as I have done in certain other judgments too, that, on

04th June 2023, delivering the Keynote address at the National Law Conference

held at Nuwara Eliya, His Lordship Justice Priyantha Jayawardane, Judge of the

Supreme Court said,

During this conference we will be discussing the Ease of Doing Business

and Enforcement of Contracts within a Conducive Legal Framework and

related topics..

Another contributing factor is the raising of preliminary objections on

trivial matters resulting in the delay of disposing of cases. In this regard,

it is worthy of mention that there is currently a new trend of going before

the Court of Appeal and objecting to the issuing of notices on the

Respondents. Sometimes even the Respondents file limited objections in

support of their preliminary objections. Thereafter, both parties file written

submissions on the matter.

I am at a loss to understand as to how anyone can object to the issuing

of notices in such circumstances, because the Respondents are

present in court having taken notice of the case.

The situation worsens if the Court of Appeal issues notices on the

Respondents, as they then come to the Supreme Court challenging that

order. Now see the predicament of the Petitioners and the courts. The

courts are overburdened with writing judgments over frivolous objections

and the litigants are saddled with unnecessarily protracted litigation. I

recall when I was at the Attorney-Generals Department, we were advised,

not to take up technical objections. Even if the action was prescribed, we

were advised not to take up the objection of prescription, unless, the facts

of the case did not warrant adjudication by court.

I think it is high time that we stop these new practices that are outside the

law. In this regard I must mention that in developed countries, the courts

award actual Costs. Further, if a lawyer files a frivolous case, the Costs

should be paid by the respective lawyer.

This Court wishes to humbly add, that, if the above actions deprecated by Justice

Jayawardane is done, it would be a step in the direction of this country achieving

better position in the Index of Ease of Doing Business and Enforcement of

Contracts.

Although a preliminary objection was not taken, as both parties have referred to

the availability of revision and restitutio in integrum, this Court wishes to say

the following in regard to the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

It is pertinent to examine the origin of the revisionary jurisdiction.

BUGALO MARIPE, of South Africa in his Doctoral Thesis THE REVISIONARY

JURISDICTION OF THE HIGHER COURTS OF BOTSWANA AND ENGLAND IN

THE REVIEW OF DECISIONS OF PRIVATE BODIES dated February 2022,

dealing with History of revisionary powers in England, says,

It appears from the brief account above that from the very beginning

there was no separate independent exercise of revisionary power by any

designated body. Such powers were subsumed under the whole gamut of

governmental power that the King exercised over decisions of public

bodies. In time, however, with the intensification of bodies which fell

directly under the royal supervision, it was felt necessary, for reasons of

convenience and expediency, that some of the powers be decentralised,

and be exercised by other bodies on behalf of the King. When the de-

centralisation of power from the King occurred, the court of Kings Bench

became the deliberate repository of powers of control over statutory bodies.

8 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

From the seventeenth century it developed to a point where it

exercised supervisory powers over the actions of government bodies,

and in particular, bodies created by statute. This power, which today

expresses itself in the process of judicial review, was in the nineteenth

century cemented through the pronouncements of the courts. It was held

in R v Local Government Board that:

[W]here the legislature entrusts to anybody of persons other

than to the superior courts the power of imposing an obligation

upon individuals, the courts ought to exercise as widely as they

can the power of controlling those bodies.

The power of control that is given to the courts is stated to be excisable as

widely as they can. But this case in which orders of prohibition were

sought by a local authority against a central government body, is but one

example of the exercise of the courts powers over the actions of statutory

or administrative bodies. In this case the court did not lay down the

parameters for control. It would not have been advisable to lay down

specific parameters given the range of possible circumstances that

could require the intervention of the courts. (page 59)

Therefore, the writer has considered the origin of revisionary jurisdiction with

that of judicial review.

This Court agrees with this view for revision and review are nothing but the two

sides of the same coin.

When the legislature has not provided a right of appeal, for it is a

universally applied rule that there cannot be an appeal without a specific

right being given by a statute, which principle is based on the finality of a

decision (it is not final only if there is a statutory right of appeal) the courts

intervened to examine the legality of the decision not the merits of it.

But on the other hand, if a court sees a miscarriage of justice it intervened

9 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

to review merits too in revision, which is a residuary jurisdiction of the

court.

This Court fully agrees with the 01st respondent when he submits at paragraph

3.17 of the above Written Submission that revisionary jurisdiction is distinct

from appellate jurisdiction. In fact, that is exactly what the above paragraph

says.

As the immortal words of Chief Justice Melani Claude Sansoni, who once

presided as the Judge of the District Court of Tangalla and rose to become the

32nd Chief Justice of this country in Marian Beebee vs. Mohamed and others

68 NLR 36 says,

The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite

independent of and distinct from appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Its

object is the due administration of the justice and the correction of errors,

sometimes committed by this Court itself, in order to avoid miscarriage of

justice.

Taking the word extraordinary it is sometimes argued and in fact even held,

that, it is a power that should be used only sparingly.

As it would be seen, following an American case came the phrase which shocks

the conscience of the court. It is worthwhile to examine this history which, in

the view of this Court was contrary to the first principles in English, American

or South African law.

In Gunewardane vs. Orr 2 Appeal Court Reports 172, Hutchinson C. J.,

said, '...here the party aggrieved might have obtained leave to appeal

notwithstanding the lapse of time that has expired'. In Perera vs. Silva 4 Appeal

Court Reports 79, Hutchinson C. J., said, 'This is a case in which the applicant

had another remedy provided by the legislature; and it is not a case in which the

order is obviously wrong '. In Ameen vs. Rasheed 6 C. L. W. 8, Abrahams C. J.,

said, 'I can see no reason why the petitioner should expect us to exercise our

10 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

revisional powers in his favour when he might have appealed,...' In

AlimaNatchiya vs. Marikar 47 N. L. R. 82,Keuneman S. P. J., stated, '..we

should be slow to exercise our discretion to allow an application in revision in

view of the fact that no appeal has been taken in this case'.

In Rustom vs. Hapangama& Co. 1978-79-80 (1) S. L. R. 352, Ismail J., in the

Supreme Court said,

'It is only in very rare instances where exceptional circumstances are

present that the Courts would exercise powers of revision in cases where an

alternative remedy has not been availed of by an applicant'.

It is seen, that, it was in support of aforesaid dictum, Ismail J., then referred to,

Gunewardane vs. Orr,Ameen vs. Rasheed,Perera vs. Silva,and AlimaNatchiya vs.

Marikar, referred to above, together with another case decided by Bonsor C. J.

In Thilagaratnam vs. E. A. P. Edirisinghe 1982 (1) S. L. R. 56, which is a case

decided in 1982, and hence after Rustom vs. Hapangama& Co. decided in 1980,

L. H. de Alwis J., in the Court of Appeal said,

'The Leave to Appeal application No. 50/81 as stated earlier, is admittedly

out of time. Counsel for the petitioner however invited this Court to

exercise its powers of revision ex mero motuor in application No. 1265/81

and grant the petitioner relief under section 759(2) of the Civil Procedure

Code'.

Hence that was a case in which the interlocutory appeal was out of time, and the

court was invited to exercise revisionary powers, by its own motion or in

application No. 1265/81, which was a revision application, but which the court

decided belated. L. H. de Alwis J., further stated,

'No exceptional circumstances thus have been made out by the petitioner

as to why this Court should exercise its powers of revision ex mero motu.

As regards the Revision Application No. 1265/81 itself, it has been made

very belatedly. According to the motion dated 12.10.81 filed by the

11 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

Attorney-at-Law for the respondent, it was pointed out by Counsel for the

respondent in open Court on 5.8.81 that the application for Leave to Appeal

was out of time. This statement has not been denied by the petitioner, so

that even though the petitioner was well aware that her application for Leave

to Appeal was out of time, she took no prompt steps to file an application

for revision until the 23rd October, 1981. The order sought to be revised is

dated 6.3.81 and in view of the inordinate delay of over seven months to file

the application for revision No. 1265/81, it must be dismissed'.

Conversely, it seems to mean, that had a petitioner, having some defect in his

leave to appeal application, filed an application for revision without such delay

he may have a possibility of succeeding.

In the case of Bank of Ceylon vs. Kaleel and others 2004 (1) S. L. R. 284, too

Justice Wimalachandra observed,

'The plaintiff has not chosen to apply for leave to appeal from the said

order as provided by section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. Nor has he

set out in this petition for revision any exceptional circumstances why he

failed to file leave to appeal application as provided by law'.

Hence it is seen that the afore cited cases are basically those either in

which the applicants have not availed of the other remedy or instituted

belated applications for revision when the appeal was found to be subject

to some defect. It was in such cases, the court has observed that it would

have been intervening, notwithstanding the lapse on the part of the

applicant, had the order been ex facie wrong or which shocks the

conscience of court.

It seems to this court that the phrase ' shocks the conscience ' came to be used

in United States of America and Canada. It is stated that the term originally

entered into the United States case law with the decision in Rochin v. California

12 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

in 1952. It is Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 1651, decided by the Supreme

Court of the United States that added behavior that "shocks the conscience" into

tests of what violates due process. This balancing test is often criticized as having

subsequently been used in a particularly subjective manner. Justice Felix

Frankfurter, wrote the opinion of the court, with which no one dissented, only

one Justice abstaining, which overturned the decision of California Supreme

Court, which said illegally obtained evidence is admissible on a criminal charge

in this state. Today, the phrase ' shocks the conscience of court ' is defined in

United States as something that invokes which is the courts equitable power to

decide issues based on notions of fairness and justice. The Black's Law

Dictionary, online edition, defines conscience of court as 'This occurs when a

matter of equity is decided by the court and it uses its conscience to decide the

issue'. Law Dictionary: What is CONSCIENCE OF THE COURT? definition of

CONSCIENCE OF THE COURT (Black's Law Dictionary)

However, in Rustom vs. Hapangama& Co., itself, Ismail J., considered decisions

that said that in appropriate cases revisionary powers will be exercised whether

the other remedy was availed or not or if that fails on some technicality. For

example the Supreme Court referred to the judgment of T. S. Fernando J., in

Sinnathangam v. Meera Mohideen, 60 NLR 393 where it was stated, that,

'The Supreme Court possesses the power to set aside, in revision, an

erroneous decision of the District Court in an appropriate case even though

an appeal against such decision has been correctly held to have abated on

the ground of non-compliance with some of the technical requirements in

respect of the notice of security'.

Ismail J., further referred to the dictum of Pulle J., in Abdul Cader v. Sittinisa

52 NLR 536, which said,

1https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/342/165/case.html.

13 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

'The respondents have not been in any manner prejudiced by the fact that

the appellant in applying for the typed-written copy paid only Rs. 20/-

instead of Rs. 25/-. Nonetheless we have in mind that the hearing was, as

a matter of indulgence, by way of revision. In the ultimate result we have

the satisfaction of knowing that we have interfered with the judgment of the

Learned District Judge substantially on a point of law only'.

It was seen that the 'shocking the conscience of court' test, and considerations

whether the order is ex facie wrong have been often applied when the petitioner

failed to avail himself of the other remedy or when that fails on a technicality.

However, as Ismail J., says in Rustom vs. Hapangama& Co.,

'The trend of authority clearly indicates that where the revisionary powers

of the Court of Appeal are invoked the practice has been that these powers

will be exercised if there is an alternative remedy available only if the

existence of special circumstances are urged necessitating the indulgence

of this Court to exercise these powers in revision. If the existence of special

circumstances does not exist then this Court will not exercise its powers in

revision'.

Standing alone, not coming within the aforesaid mainstream cases, there is at

least one other decided case, which adopted a different approach. But it was

based on section 753 of the Civil Procedure Code itself.

Quite apart from aforesaid reasons, it may also be noted that in FERNANDO v.

CEYLON BREWERYS LTD. (1997) 1998 (03) S. L. R. 61, decided by Upali de

Z. Gunewardane J., in Court of Appeal, it was observed,

'It is to be observed that, if as argued by the counsel for the defendant-

respondent, an application in revision in respect of an order is precluded by

or in virtue of the fact that an appeal too lies in respect of the same order,

then that would entail a dismissal or rejection of the application in revision

and the two grounds, stated therein ie (a) and (b) above, impeaching the

14 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

correctness of the order of the learned District Judge, would not arise for

consideration'.

Having considered the dictum of Abrahams, CJ in Ameen v. Rasheed, that ' I can

see no reason why the petitioner should expect us to exercise our revisional

powers in his favour when he might have appealed and I would allow the

preliminary objection and dismiss the application with costs ', His Lordship

Gunewardane J., further observed,

'But the validity of the above reason for denying the relief in revision can

no longer be accepted with favour inasmuch as the Court of Appeal in

consequence of the amendment of section 753 by Act No. 79 of 1988 is now

clothed with greater amplitude of power in making orders and is not

confined, as formerly, ie before the aforesaid amendment, to making the

same order which it might have made had the matter been brought before

it by way of appeal. Since, prior to the amendment of section 753 the court

could whilst acting in revision only make the same order as it could have

made in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction - the right of appeal and

right in revision were justifiably treated as more or less, alternative remedies

- available, more or less, in such a way that when one was accepted or made

available the other had to be rejected or refused. When, as was the case

prior to the amendment of section 753 of the Civil Procedure Code, the

reliefs available or the orders that could be made by the court, by way of

appeal and revision, were conterminous or the same - it could legitimately

and even logically be inquired or queried, as had been done by His Lordship,

Abrahams, CJ, in the excerpt of the judgment cited above, as to why the

revisionary process, which may be described as a privileged procedure, was

invoked in preference to that of appeal,several advantages or benefits being

attendant on the revisionary process which would not be available to one

who seeks relief by way of an appeal (for instance one need not furnish

security or keep to certain prescribed time-limits as in the case when one

15 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

appeals against an order) - the recourse to revision was treated as an

extraordinary procedure in contradistinction to the procedure of appeal

which was considered to be the normal remedy, when the order in question

was appealable - as is the order in this case before me'. Page 66

The amendment to which His Lordship referred to was that to section 753 made

by Amendment Act No. 79 of 1988. Justice Gunewardane observed,

'The essence of the difference between the two forms of section 753 ie in

its original and amended form is this: as the said section stood originally,

the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court in the exercise of its revisionary

powers could have only made the same order which it might have made had

the case been brought before it by way of an appealwhereas in the

amended form the section empowers the Court of Appeal, in the exercise

of its powers of revision, to make any order as the interests of justice

may require'. Pages 64,65

His Lordship concluded,

'Thus it would be noticed that the amended section enables the court to

be more flexible and less legalistic in its means and in approach in dealing

with a matter for section 753 in its amended form seems to exalt not so

much the rigour of the law but unalloyed justice, in the sense of good-

sense and fairness. So that the basis of the rationale for insistence on the

requirement of special circumstances as a condition - precedent to the

exercise of revisionary powers had disappeared as a consequence of the

amendment of section 753 of the Civil Procedure Code by virtue of which

amendment the Court of Appeal is now freed from the duty or rather the

necessity of making the same order as it would have made in appeal and

In deciding FERNANDO v. CEYLON BREWERYS LTD., in 1997, Justice

Gunewardane lamented that he has not been referred to any decision of superior

courts on this question made after the aforesaid amendment.

The judgment in Rustom vs. Hapangama& Co. 1978-79-80 (1) S. L. R. 352, in

which several other cases they also cite, had been referred to by Ismail J., was

decided in 1980. The decision in Bank of Ceylon vs. Kaleel and others 2004 (1)

S. L. R. 284, although decided in 2003, has not considered FERNANDO v.

CEYLON BREWERYS LTD. It is so in several other cases such as Somindra vs.

Surasena and others 2000 03 S.L.R. 159, Leslie Silva vs. Perera 2005 02 S.L.R.

184 and also in BengamuweDhammalokaThero vs. Dr. Cyril Anton Balasuriya

S.C. Appeal No. 09/2002, S.C. spl. L.A. No. 242/2001 cited on behalf of the

plaintiffs in favour of availability of revision too.

It appears to this court hence, that in addition to reasons given for the

aforesaid decision to exercise revisionary powers, based on considerations

of traditional views requiring exceptional or special circumstances,

including the existence of important question of law or possible existence

of an error in the decision, the judgment in FERNANDO v. CEYLON

BREWERYS LTD., is a strong persuasive authority in favour of availability

of revision, especially as the decision is based on the very construction of

the words in the amended legal provision enacted by the legislature in its

wisdom.

Though the decision in The Ceylon Brewery Limited vs. Jax Fernando, Proprietor,

Maradana Wine Stores, 2001 decided in the Supreme Court by Mark Fernando

J., overruled the above decision of U. de Z. Gunewardane J., it was done only in

respect of the decision in the latter that an application made under section 86(2)

of Civil Procedure Code can be allowed even if that was made one day after the

stipulated time of 14 days. The Supreme Court said, I therefore set aside the

judgment of the Court of Appeal on that point. The decision pertaining to wider

powers given by amended section 753, the ability of the court to make a

17 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

justifiable order in revision and hence revision not being only an additional

remedy granted on mere discretion was hence not set aside.

But, under the new approach which was suggested in FERNANDO v. CEYLON

BREWERYS LTD. (1997) 1998 (03) S. L. R. 61, by Upali de Z. Gunewardane

J., which was not set aside by the Supreme Court in The Ceylon Brewery Limited

vs. Jax Fernando, Proprietor, Maradana Wine Stores, 2001, as it is not the same

order that the court would have made in an appeal a court can make under the

amended section 753, this court is of the opinion that even if there is no blatant

error or circumstances that shock conscience of court, revisionary jurisdiction

can be exercised in the present application.

The answer lies in the dicta of Chief Justice Sansoni.

The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite

independent of and distinct from appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Its

object is the due administration of the justice and the correction or

errors, sometimes committed by this Court itself, in order to avoid

miscarriage of justice.

To correct an error should the conscience of a court be shocked? The

answer is no, because whether the courts conscience is shocked or not an

error thereby does not become right. It must be corrected by a court.

It is true that the new section 753 of the Civil Procedure Code does not apply to

this application presently before this Court. But it shows the trend and the

development of the law and Article 138 of the Constitution which just confers

revisionary jurisdiction on this Court without any limitation except subject to

the provisions of the Constitution or of any law is wide enough.

It is true that the Right to Information Act has provided for an appeal and until

the rules are made rules made in respect of an application for revision applies.

But by that provision the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court is not excluded.

In SC/Revision/02/2019 decided on 25.03.2022, the Supreme Court said,

18 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

Under the Administration of Justice Law, No.44 of 1973, the Supreme

Court is vested with the Revisionary Jurisdiction. Under Section 11, where

it was expressly provided that, jurisdiction for the correction of all errors

in fact or in law committed by any subordinate court by way of revision is

vested in the Supreme Court.

Therefore the power of correction of errors was vested in the Supreme Court and

after the 1978 Constitution it vests in the Court of Appeal.

In the case of Sinnathangam v. Meera Mohideen, 60 NLR 393, T. S. Fernando J.,

said,

'The first of these is the case of Abdul Cader v. Sittinisa [1(1951) 52

N.L.R. 536.], where this Court, notwithstanding that an appeal had

abated, heard the appellant by way of revision observing that it did so as

a matter of indulgence and interfered with the judgment appealed from on

a point of law. The other is a more recent and hitherto unreported decision-

S. C. 309/D. C. Colombo 36064/M- S. C. Minutes of 17th March 1958-in

which this Court while rejecting an appeal for non-compliance with the

provisions of sections 755 and 756 of the Civil Procedure Code stated that

it would be prepared to deal with the questions raised by way of revision

as important questions of law arose on the appeal'.

The same thing learned T. S. Fernando J., said in Sinnathangam v. Meera

Mohideen, 60 NLR 393, could be said about this case too, as the application of

section 11(2) of the Act No. 01 of 2023 too raises an important question of law

in this application.

In regard to its jurisdiction on restitutio in integrum this Court whishes to say

the following.

Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardena vs. Hector Perera, Officer in Charge, Police

Station, Kollupitiya and others S.C. Application 20/1983 was an application

filed in respect of an alleged violation of a fundamental right, where Mrs. Vivionne

19 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

Gunawardena alleged, among other things, that she was unlawfully arrested by

the OIC of Kollupiya Police Station. The IGP, the 02nd respondent filed an affidavit

from one Vinayagam Ganeshananthem, Sub Inspector, to the effect that he and

not the 01st respondent who arrested Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardena because she

had no permit to go in a procession. Although Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardane

countered this position, the Supreme Court consisting of a three Judge bench

did not believe her, but believed the affidavit of Vinayagam Ganeshananthem

and decided that the petitioners fundamental rights have been violated as

Vinayagam Ganeshananthem is guilty of unlawfully arresting her.

Vinayagam Ganeshananthem then petitioned to the Supreme Court requesting

to set aside the said decision of the Supreme Court itself, as he was only a

witness (on affidavit) and he was not informed before finding him guilty and

therefore the rule audi alteram partem is violated. This second case was decided

by a Seven Judge bench of the Supreme Court, including the incumbent learned

Chief Justice. The decision was divided 05 to 02 and the majority decided against

Vinayagam Ganeshananthem.

The learned Chief Justice, who wrote the leading judgment of the majority said,

He submits that this caption read with prayer (a) to the petition invokes

a jurisdiction in revision which this Court does not have. One has to look

at the legislation which created this Court to find an answer to this

dispute. That legislation is to be found in the second Republican

Constitution of 1978. The Supreme Court which existed up to the time

of the first Republican Constitution of 1972 and which continued to

exist under that Constitution ceased to exist when the 1978

Constitution became operative. (Vide Article 105 (2) of the Constitution).

Its place was taken by the Court of Appeal (Vide Article 169 (2) of the

1978 Constitution). A new Supreme Court has been constituted which is

the highest and final Superior Court of Record. (Article 118 of the

Constitution).

The relevant portion of Article 169(2) says,

Unless otherwise provided in the Constitution, every reference in

any existing written law to the Supreme Court shall be deemed to be a

reference to the Court of Appeal.

Ranasinghe J., despite being in the minority of the 07 Judge bench judgment

referred to a case decided by Dias S.P.J. in 1950 which was on restitutio in

integrum and said,

The real basis upon which relief is given and the precise nature of the

relief so given by the Supreme Court upon an application made to it for

relief against an earlier Order made by the Supreme Court itself was very

lucidly and very effectively expressed by Dias S.P.J. way back in the year

1951 in the case of Menchinahamy v. Muniweera, (40). In that case, about

six weeks after an appeal to the Supreme Court from an interlocutory

decree in the District Court was dismissed by the Supreme Court, an

application was made to the Supreme Court, on 23.3.1949, " for revision

or in the alternative for restitutio-in-integrum" by the heirs of a party

defendant, who had died before the interlocutory decree was entered but

whose heirs had not been substituted in his place before the interlocutory

decree was so entered. It was contended on behalf of the respondents: that

there was no merit in the application: that if the relief sought is granted

then the Supreme Court would in effect be sitting in judgment on a two-

Judge decision of the Supreme Court which had passed the Seal of the

Court that the Supreme Court cannot interfere with the orders of the

Supreme Court itself. In rejecting these objections, Dias S.P.J., placed this

matter in its proper setting quite convincingly in the following words:

"In giving relief to the petitioner we are not sitting in judgment either

on the interlocutory decree or on the decree in appeal passed by this

Court. We are merely declaring that, so far as the petitioner is

concerned, there has been a violation of the principles of

21 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

natural justice which makes it incumbent on this Court, despite

technical objections to the contrary, to do justice. "

Ranasinghe J., referring to the judgment of Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera (1950)

52 NLR 409, while being on the minority will not diminish its value. It shows

how the then Supreme Court, exercised the power of restitutio in integrum, even

against a judgment of its own. Today, such a power is vested, hence, not only

under Article 138 of the Constitution, but also empirically, so to say, in the

arrangement of the powers of Courts, referred to by the learned Chief Justice, in

the present Court of Appeal.

Ranasinghe J., further said in the said judgment,

The Supreme Court, as constituted under the 1978 Constitution, is not

vested with the revisionary powers as exercised by the Supreme Court

which was created by the aforesaid Courts Ordinance (Chapter 6).

Despite this view being expressed in a minority judgment in that case, the

judgment of the learned Chief Justice in the majority, drew a similarity between

the present Court of Appeal and the former Supreme Court, to say that the

present Supreme Court does not have revisionary powers. The majority of the

Supreme Court also decided that there is no justification for exercising any of

the inherent powers of the Court in this case.

Thus it appears, that,

(a) The power of restitutio in integrum, as exercised by Dias S.P.J. in

Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera (1950) in the then Supreme Court is now

vested in the present Court of Appeal,

(b) The power of revision is also vested with the present Court of Appeal,

(c) The present Supreme Court has, with respect, exercised its inherent

powers very rarely (vide., the 07 Judge bench judgment referred to)

Hence, the petitioner in this case seems to be having no remedy other than

seeking redress in the power of restitutio in integrum in this court.

22 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

Coming back to the facts of the case, although the plaintiff respondent has stated

in its Statement of Objections, that, the defendant signing a proxy while in

remand custody shows, that, he could have given instructions to his lawyer to

file papers to obtain leave to appear, this Court is of the view, that, whereas a

proxy could be send to the remand prison for the signature, it is not only a

difficult thing but an almost impossible thing to obtain meaningful instructions

while the defendant was in the remand custody.

Therefore the defendant had a valid reason to move for time on 14.09.2023.

Now the section 11(2) says,

(2) The Court shall not grant the defendant any further time to make an

application to enable the defendant to seek leave to appear and show cause

against such decree nisi.

This was the main reason which led to the learned Additional District Judge to

refuse to grant time. Whereas she is not at fault on the face of the section, under

the powers of revision and restitutio in integrum this Court can consider whether

the Legislature intended the abrogation of the Rules of Natural Justice, in that,

the Rule Audi Alteram Partem in enacting the above provision.

On the basis of the references to the RULE OF LAW and INDEPENDENCE OF

JUDICIARY in capital letters in the Preamble to the Constitution of 1978, this

Court is of the view that the Parliament will not intend and therefore a legislation

would not be interpreted to shut out a party from legal proceedings pending

against him when he has a valid and reasonable reason to move for further time.

Since Megarry J., in John vs. Rees, has explained to the hilt, the

elusive nature of the concept of Natural Justice, what is relevant from

the next twelve passages will be quoted. For the reader who might decry

the extensive quoting, this Court would answer, that it is because, the

question of Natural Justice, forms the basis of this determination.

23 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

Megarry J., said,

However that may be, what matters here is, in my judgment, not

the terminology but the substance and the reality: and looking at

that, it seems plain that the principles of natural justice prima facie

apply. Mr. Sparrow sought to avoid this conclusion by urging that what

was done bore generally on P.D.L.P. and was not directed against

individuals. He further contended that the principles of natural justice did

not apply because the acts were administrative, because there had been

no dismissal of any disaffiliates, and because these principles did not

apply to unpaid offices.

I do not find any of these contentions persuasive. I look to the

realities and not to the labels.

.Accordingly, I must consider what are the principles of natural

justice which prima facie are applicable, and whether or not there is

anything to oust their application. In doing this, it is convenient to refer

to a case concerning an avowed expulsion from a political party which

came before me some three weeks after the conclusion of the argument in

this case, namely, Fountaine v. Chesterton..

In that case I said:

"The expression 'the principles of natural justice' is, I think, now

a technical term. As Maugham J. pointed out in Maclean v. Workers'

Union [1929] 1 Ch. 602, 624, among most savages there is no such

thing as justice in the modern sense. In a state of nature, self-interest

prevails over any type of justice known to civilisation; the law of the

jungle is power, not justice. Nor am I clear what the word 'natural'

adds to the word 'justice.' It cannot be intended to indicate the

antithesis of 'unnatural justice,' which would indeed be an odd

concept; I imagine that it is intended to suggest justice that is simple

24 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

or elementary, as distinct from justice that is complex, sophisticated

and technical.

The term 'natural justice' has often been used by eminent judges,

and although Maugham J. said (at p. 624) that it 'is, of course, used only

in a popular sense,' I would prefer to regard it as having become

something of a term of art. To extract the quintessence of the process

of justice is, indeed, notoriously difficult. 'The ideas of natural

justice,' said Iredell J., 'are regulated by no fixed standard; the ablest

and the purest men have differed on the subject': Calder v. Bull (1798)

3 U.S. 386, 399. In Ridge v. Baldwin [1964] A.C. 40, 132, Lord Hodson

referred to a 'certain vagueness' in the term, but rejected the view

that because the requirements of natural justice depended upon the

circumstances of the case, this made natural justice so vague as to

be inapplicable. He added: 'No one, I think, disputes that three

features of natural justice stand out - (1) the right to be heard by an

unbiased tribunal; (2) the right to have notice of charges of

misconduct; (3) the right to be heard in answer to those charges.' I do

not think that I shall go far wrong if I regard these three features as

constituting in all ordinary circumstances an irreducible minimum of

the requirements of natural justice. I need only add that all these

requirements are essentially procedural in nature; I regard natural

justice as a distillate of due process of law.

I then turned to consider a submission based on the judgment of

Denning L.J. in Lee v. Showmen's Guild of Great Britain [1952] 2 Q.B.

329, 342 to the effect that public policy would invalidate any

stipulation excluding the application of the rules of natural justice to

a domestic tribunal, and said that although I respectfully inclined to the

same view, it seemed to have been expressed obiter and was not

mentioned by the other members of the court, so that I would hesitate

25 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

to decide the case on that ground. I went on to refer to the rule which

was said to justify the expulsion, and then said:

"It is trite law that the rules of an unincorporated association form

a contract between all the members of that association. It is, indeed,

a somewhat special form of contract; but subject to that, what I am

required to do is to construe the terms of a contract. Where the

terms in issue deal with the exercise of a power of peremptory

suspension or termination of the rights of one of the parties to such

a contract, then I think that the common expectation of

mankind would be that the power would be exercised only in

accordance with the principles of natural justice unless the

contrary is made plain. This expectation rests upon high and

ancient authority. When a member of a university was deprived of

his degrees without being given an opportunity to defend himself,

Fortescue J. said: 'The laws of God and man both give the party an

opportunity to make his defence, if he has any. I remember to have

heard it observed by a very learned man upon such an occasion,

that even God himself did not pass sentence upon Adam, before he

was called upon to make his defence. Adam (says God) where art

thou? Hast thou not eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee

that thou shouldst not eat? And the same question was put to Eve

also': Rex v. Cambridge University (1723) 1 Stra. 557, 567. Even if

the law permits the principles of natural justice to be effectually

excluded by suitable drafting, I would not readily construe the

rules as having achieved this result unless they left me in no

doubt that this was the plain and manifest intention. Put a little

differently, I would say that if there is any doubt, the

applicability of the principles of natural justice will be given the

benefit of that doubt. The cry 'That isn't fair' is to be found from

earliest days, in nursery, street and school alike; and those who wish

26 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

to confer upon the committee or other governing body of a club or

association a power to act unfairly or arbitrarily in derogation of

common and universal expectation must make it plain beyond a per

adventure that this has been done. This view is, I think, at least

consistent with the approach of Romer L.J. in Lee v. Showmen's

Guild of Great Britain [1952] 2 Q.B. 329, 349, C.A. on a not

dissimilar point, where he said that it would require 'the use of clear

language' before he was satisfied that the members of any body such

as the trade union in question had agreed to leave the construction

of the trade union's rules to the committee, to the exclusion of the

courts.

Having now had the opportunity of reconsidering the language that I used

in that case, I must say that I can see no reason for resiling from it. Before

resorting to public policy, let the rules of the club or other body be

construed: and in the process of construction, the court will be slow

to conclude that natural justice has been excluded. Only if the rules

make it plain that natural justice was intended to be disregarded will it be

necessary for the courts to resolve the issue of public policy. In this case,

accordingly, I approach both clause 8 (2) of the Labour Party constitution

and the resolution of the N.E.C. dated April 24, 1968, as provisions

requiring to be construed strictly, and as not excluding the processes of

natural justice except in so far as this is made plain. Nothing that I can

see in clause 8 (2) even begins to exclude the process of natural justice.

The phrase "to take any action it deems necessary" cannot, in my

judgment, be read as if it continued "however contrary to natural

justice it may be"; nor, in my judgment, are the words "disaffiliation,"

"expulsion" or even "or otherwise" to be qualified in any such way.

These things may be done: but they must be done fairly and justly,

and not unfairly or unjustly.

27 | C . A . R I I 4 0 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e N e i l I d d a w a l a 1 9 t h D e c e m b e r 2 0 2 3 .

.Whatever may be said about the right to an unbiased tribunal, the

process of giving notice of the charges and giving those concerned the right

to be heard in answer to the charges was plainly not followed

Mr. Sparrow did contend that sending out the form amounted to affording

the members an opportunity of being heard: but not even his considerable

powers of advocacy sufficed to give any life to as barren a contention as I

have heard..

At the apotheosis of this narrative, Megarry J., came to the passage

which is so often quoted from his judgment, which is also quoted in the

appellants written submissions dated 27.07.2022, and said,

It may be that there are some who would decry the importance which the

courts attach to the observance of the rules of natural justice. "When

something is obvious," they may say, "why force everybody to go through

the tiresome waste of time involved in framing charges and giving an

opportunity to be heard? The result is obvious from the start." Those who

take this view do not, I think, do themselves justice. As everybody who has

anything to do with the law well knows, the path of the law is strewn with

examples of open and shut cases which, somehow, were not; of

unanswerable charges which, in the event, were completely answered; of

inexplicable conduct which was fully explained; of fixed and unalterable

determinations that, by discussion, suffered a change. Nor are those with

any knowledge of human nature who pause to think for a moment likely

to underestimate the feelings of resentment of those who find that a

decision against them has been made without their being afforded any

opportunity to influence the course of events.

On the basis of audi alteram partem referred to and explained above, this Court

sets aside the order of the learned Additional District Judge dated 14.09.2023

and sets aside the decree absolute, exercising the powers of revision and

restitutio in integrum and allows the defendant petitioner to file papers in terms

of section 12(2) of the Act within 06 weeks from the date of this judgment, subject

to the depositing in the District Court of a sum of Rs. 11,795,506.00 either in

cash or upon a bank guarantee or an acceptable security.

Once the defendant so enters the case and files his papers, the learned Additional

District Judge will consider, among other things, objections raised by the

defendant in regard to the constitution and the maintainability of the action of

the plaintiff respondent.
