In this regard, I refer to the observation made by the Supreme Court in DFCC Bank Vs. Mudith Perera and others1, which reads thus; As per Saleem Marsoof, J. In my opinion, it is the Bank that stands to gain when it exercises the right of parate execution, and the Board of Directors is simply its managing body that takes decisions primarily for the benefit of its shareholders. It is clear from the decision of the House of Lords in Salomon v A. Salomon and Co. Ltd. (1897) AC 22 that the company has a personality distinct from its shareholders and board of directors, and the same principle applies to Banking companies. I am therefore of the opinion that the decision of the Court of Appeal in Ukwatte v DFCC Bank 2004 (1) Sri LR 164, in which interim relief prayed for in that case was refused on the basis that the members of the Board of Directors of the Bank that passed the resolutions sought to be quashed by certiorari, were not cited as respondents to the writ Application, is irreconcilable with the principle enunciated by the House of Lords in Salomon v A. Salomon and Co. Ltd., which has been consistently and universally followed.",

It is pertinent to be noted that a decision to enter into the Mortgage Bonds in disputes was also taken at the same meeting chaired by the Petitioner. Moreover, it is borne out from the document marked 1R17 that the Petitioner has drawn allowances from the 3rd Respondent Company for his role as a Director. In these respects, it is abundantly clear that the Petitioner, as a working Director (Chairman) of the 3rd Respondent Company, has played a major role in the business transactions of the 3rd Respondent Company, and therefore, he can not be considered as a 3rd party as far as the said Mortgage Bonds are concerned.",
