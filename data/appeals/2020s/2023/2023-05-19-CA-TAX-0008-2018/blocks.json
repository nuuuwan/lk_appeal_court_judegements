Even if one transposes the words and communicate to such persons in writing the reasons for not accepting the return to the first line of the section after the word return and before the word estimate it will not make it a condition precedent. One has still to read more words into it to have the effect of postponing the rest of the exercise to sometime later. This would be doing violence to the section. The section imposes a duty, but does not impose a time limit within which it should be done. To my mind the section merely states that if the Assessor does not accept a return, he may assess on an estimate. His exercise is not complete till he has also communicated his reasons for not accepting the return. In effect he also justifies his act of assessing on an estimate.

The primary purpose of the amending legislation is to ensure that the Assessor will bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite determination whether or not to accept it. It was intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly unfair assessments which many Assessors had been making as a protective measure. An unfortunate practice had developed where some Assessors, due to pressure of work and other reasons, tended to delay looking at a return till the last moment and then without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a grossly exaggerated assessment. The law, I think, enabled the department to make recoveries pending any appeal on such assessments. The overall effect of this unhappy practice was to pressurize the taxpayer to such an extent that he was placed virtually at the mercy of the tax authorities. The new law was a measure intended to do away with this practice. Under the amendment when an Assessor does not accept a return, it must mean that at the relevant point of time he has brought his mind to bear on the return and has come to a decision rejecting the return. Consequent to this rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the assessee. The provisions for the giving of reasons and the written communication of the reasons, contained in the amendment is to ensure that in fact the new procedure would be followed. More particularly, the communication of the reason at the relevant time is the indication of its compliance. The new procedure would also have the effect of fixing the Assessor to a definite position and not give him the latitude to chop and change thereafter. It was therefore essential that an Assessor who rejects a return should state his reasons and communicate them h. His reasons must be communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated income. Any later communication would defeat the remedial action intended by the amendment (emphasis added). [31] The Appellants argument is that the substance of the statement made by Samarakoon C.J. is that a duty is now imposed on the Assessor who rejects the return and makes an assessment to state reasons for such rejection, communicate the same to the taxpayer, issue and serve the notice of assessment before the expiration of the period for the making of the assessment. In my view, all what His Lordship Samarakoon CJ said in D.M.S. Fernando and another v. A.M. Ismail (supra) was that the assessor who rejected a return should state his reasons and communicate them at or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated income to the taxpayer. I am afraid, there is nothing to indicate or gather from His",

This was why it had been argued in CA Tax 17/2017 that no lawfully valid assessment can be made without first serving a valid notice of assessment. The Division of this Court in C.A. Tax 17/2017 though that this is a practical impossibility. A letter cannot be sent without being written. But what was meant is not this. The argument of the appellant is that an assessment becomes valid only when the notice is given. This position was the basis of Ismail despite those two cases were concurred with the duty to give reasons. The position of the appellant is that an assessment is no assessment until notice of assessment is given. The position could have been otherwise, viz. an assessment could have been a valid assessment, as soon as an estimate is made. If like in Honig (administrators of Emmanuel Honig) v Sarasfield (H.M. Inspector of Taxes), the Commissioners Inland Revenue also maintained a register in which an assessment is entered. In the absence of such procedure in this country. It cannot be accepted that the making of an assessment without giving notice of assessment is a valid assessment.

In the present case, the assessee furnished its return on 30.11.2010 and the Act, No. 22 of 2011 came into force on 01.04.2011 and the assessment was made on 26.11.2012. Thus, by the time the Act, No. 22 of 2011 came into force, the taxpayer had already filed its return. With regard to the second part of the decision, it is not in dispute that the time period for making the assessment had not expired by the time the amendment was made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment. The second part of the judgment related to the inability of the assessee to benefit from the extended period given to file the return under the Act, No. 19 of 2009, and therefore, the law should not be interpreted to give an advantage to an assessor, and deprive an assessee in violation of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. It is an additional factor in that individual case for the Supreme Court to hold that the law should not be interpreted to give an advantage to an assessor and deprive an assessee in violation of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. In view of the inability of the assessee to benefit from the extended period given to file the return under the Act, No. 19 of 2009, the Supreme Court further held that the assessee had a right to have the assessment passed within the 18 months from the end of that year.

After that year notice could not issue unless the limit of time was increased or removed. But the fact that the notice could not be issued after 1951 did not clothe the assesee with a right not to pay the tax if it became legally claimable again. If the law conferred a power on the income-tax Officer to deal with such a case, the assessee would again be exposed to proceedings, provided it said in clear terms that the law was retrospective. This is what the law did in precise and clear terms. In 1953 an Act was passed amending s. 34 which enabled action at any time if there was a finding or direction of the character indicated in the second proviso to sub-s. (3) of s. 34. Section 31 also made this position clear by applying the amended s. 34 to all assessments commenced after September 8, 1948, and saved all notices issued and assessments made in respect of any year prior to April 1. 1948, whether the notices were issued or the assessments were made before or after April 1, 1952. But a Court is required to take judicial notice of statutes and if s. 31 of the Act of 1953 said that sub-ss. (1), (2) and (3) of s. 34 of the principal Act (including of course the amendments as made by the 1953 Act) shall apply and shall be deemed always to have applied to any assessment or re-assessment for any year ending before April, 1948, it is the duty of Court and Tribunal to read s. 34 in that manner and in no other. In our opinion it was not open to the High Court to read s. 34, without s. 31 which contained a legislative construction and made s. 34 retrospective[Emphasis added]",

However, the position in law would be different in the matters which relate to procedural law, but so far as substantive rights of parties are concerned they remain unaffected by the amendment in the enactment. We are, therefore, of the view that where a repeal of provisions of an enactment is followed by fresh legislation by an amending Act, such legislation is prospective in operation and does not affect substantive or vested rights of the parties unless made retrospective either expressly or by necessary intendment. We are further of the view that there is a presumption against the retrospective operation of a statute and further a statute is not to be construed to have a greater retrospective operation than its language renders necessary, but an amending Act which affects the procedure is presumed to be retrospective, unless amending Act provides otherwise (emphasis added).",
