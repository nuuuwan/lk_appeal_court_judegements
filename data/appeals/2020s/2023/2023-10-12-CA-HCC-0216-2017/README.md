JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (b), 54(A) (d) and 54(A) (c) of the Poisons,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984

for Trafficking, Possession and Importing of 43.74 grams of Heroin

(diacetylmorphine) on 29.10. 2013.

The prosecution had called 03 witnesses in support of their case and marked

the Government Analyst Report under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No.15 of 1979. When the defence was called, the Appellant

had made a dock statement and closed his case.

After the consideration of the evidence presented by the prosecution and the

defence, the Learned Trial Judge found the Appellant guilty on the second

and third counts and acquitted from the first count. Thereafter, he was

sentenced to life imprisonment on the second and third counts on

07/07/2017.

CA/HCC/0216/17

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Counsel for the Appellant informed this Court that the Appellant had

given his consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. Hence, argument was taken up in his absence but was connected

via Zoom platform from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law by failing to consider the fact

probably favourable to the Appellant.

2. Last link of the inward journey is not proven beyond reasonable ground.

3. The version of the prosecution is not credible as the Appellant was not

produced before a JMO and also the reasons given by the prosecution

is not tenable.

4. The way the investigation carried out by the police is in violation of

Article 11 of the Constitution.

Background of the case.

On 29.10.2013, IP/Basnayake attached to Katunayake Airport Police

Narcotics Bureau, while on usual surveillance duty with other officers

attached to the bureau, received an information through PW4, PC/61100

Dinesh regarding a person who traffics drugs into the country. After getting

all the necessary information about the Appellants description including his

type of attire he had clad with, IP/Basnayake proceeded to the location which

was in the baggage section. When the Appellant was about to go out through

the green channel, he was stopped at the bank lobby and taken to the bureau

after declaring their identity. The Appellant had two bags in his custody.

CA/HCC/0216/17

Although the two bags were checked thoroughly, no incriminating items were

found by the police. As the Appellant started to sweat unusually in the air-

conditioned room and behaved in an uncomfortable manner, it raised a

suspicion to the officers. Hence, the Appellant was taken to a toilet allocated

for disabled persons observing the Appellants uncomfortable behaviour. At

the toilet the Appellant had excreted three wraps of substances, suspected

to be Heroin (Diacetylmorphine). The substances found in the wraps were

weighed using an electronic scale used in the bureau and the substances

weighed about 145 grams.

The production was sealed and placed in the personal locker of PW1.The

Appellant was produced before the Magistrate of Negombo and obtained a

detention order to investigate further under police custody. On 31.10.2013

the Appellant was taken to the Police Narcotics Bureau, Colombo-01 along

with the production. Although the Appellant was taken to the JMO Office

Colombo, he was not seen on that day due to non-availability of a JMO. But

he was examined by a JMO on a subsequent date.

PW4 had given evidence and corroborated the evidence of PW1.

At the Police Narcotics Bureau, the productions were handed over to PW7,

IP/Rajakaruna who had handed over the production to the Government

Analyst Department thereafter.

As the Government Analyst Report was admitted under Section 420 of the

CPC, the prosecution had closed the case after marking the same as P32.

When the Learned Trial Judge had called for the defence, the Appellant made

a dock statement taking up the position that he was falsely introduced to

this case by the police officers and closed the case for the defence.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden never

CA/HCC/0216/17

shifts. Hence an accused person has no burden to prove his case unless he

pleads a general or a special exception in the Penal Code.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states thus: [1987} 1 SLR 155

"The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence. His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the

case, and his guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in

a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is

well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of

probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond

the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility

in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, of course it is

possible, but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond

reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.

CA/HCC/0216/17

6 | P a g e

As the first, third and fourth grounds of appeal are inter-connected, I decided

to consider those grounds jointly hereinafter. At the hearing, the Learned

Counsel for the Appellant contended that the Learned Trial Judge failed to

consider that the prosecution version did not pass the test of probability and

erred in both facts and law when concluding that the prosecution proved the

case beyond reasonable doubt.

In this case, PW1 had vividly given evidence as to how the raid was conducted

after the information he had received while on duty. Acting on that

information, he had successfully arrested the Appellant who was totally a

stranger to him. The Learned Counsel strenuously placed his submission on

the time factor consumed for the arrest, as the Appellant arrived four hours

before his arrest, improbability of carrying drugs in anus, absence of medical

evidence, storing the productions in the personal locker of PW1 and

conflicting evidence regarding taking the Appellant from the Airport to

Colombo Narcotics Bureau.

These positions had been very clearly explained during the trial by the

witnesses. The Learned High Court Judge had very accurately discussed and

analysed the evidence pertaining to the entire raid and accepted the

prosecution position which clearly demonstrate that the prosecution had

passed the test of probability of the prosecution case.

The consideration of the evidence of the Learned High Court Judge can be

found from pages 286-291 of the judgment.

Considering the analysis of evidence of the Learned High Court Judge, it is

very clear that the appeal grounds raised in 1st, 3rd and 4th have no merit.

In the second ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the last link of

the inward journey has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Thereby

the learned counsel for the Appellant argues that the conviction is bad in law

and unsafe.

CA/HCC/0216/17

7 | P a g e

In Perera v. Attorney General [1998] 1 Sri.L.R it was held:

the most important journey is the inward journey because

the final analyst report will depend on that.

In Witharana Doli Nona v.The Republic of Sri Lanka CA/19/99 His

Lordship Justice Abrew remarked thus;

It is a recognized principle that in drug related cases the

prosecution must prove the chain relating to the inward

journey. The purpose of this principle is to establish that the

productions have not been tampered with. Prosecution

must prove that the productions taken from the accused

Appellant was examined by the Government Analyst

Therefore, proving the chain of custody is a very important task for the

prosecution. If investigating officers do not do their duty properly, the chain

of custody can be successfully challenged at the trial. This is because the

prosecution always relies on evidence gathered by police officers in cases of

this nature.

It is the contention of PW1 that after sealing the productions, it was in his

locker until it was handed over to PW7 at the Police Narcotics Bureau

Colombo-01. The witness very clearly gave evidence regarding the recovery

of the body packed production, sealing and handing over to PW7.

In this regard the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had adequately

analysed and satisfied that the prosecution had proved the chain of

production beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, this ground also has no merit.

In this case PW1 and PW4 are key witnesses. Their evidence is clear, cogent

and unambiguous. The court considering all other evidence presented by the

CA/HCC/0216/17

8 | P a g e

prosecution, without any hesitation relied on that evidence and convicted the

Appellant. Further, their evidence has passed the probability test.

As the prosecution had proven this case beyond reasonable doubt, I affirm

the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge

of Negombo dated 07/07/2017 on the Appellant. Therefore, his appeal is

dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Negombo along with the original case record.
