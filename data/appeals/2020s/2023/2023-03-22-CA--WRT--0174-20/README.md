This is an application for writs of certiorari and mandamus to quash the

order of the Debt Conciliation Board dated 22.01.2020 and to direct the

2nd to 6th respondents to hear and adjudicate the application of the

petitioner bearing number 42123 in accordance with the provisions of

3

the Debt Conciliation Ordinance (hereinafter referred to as the

Ordinance).

The 1st respondent-debtor made an application to the Debt Conciliation

Board, praying to declare the deed bearing number 1512, dated

19.07.2010, attested by M.L Wickremasinghe, Notary Public, a

mortgage. After a preliminary inquiry, the Debt Conciliation Board

(hereinafter referred to as the Board) decided that the said deed is a

mortgage. Aggrieved by the said decision, the petitioner made an

application to the Board in terms of Section 54 of the Debt Conciliation

Ordinance to review the said decision. The application for review was

rejected by the Board on the basis that the powers granted to the Board

in terms of Section 54 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance could not be

exercised to review this order. Stating that the 2nd to 6th respondents

have acted ultra vires and committed errors of law by making the said

order, the petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this court seeking writs

of certiorari and mandamus.

At the hearing, the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned

counsel for the 1st respondent made oral submissions. The learned

Deputy Solicitor General, who appeared for the 2nd to 6th respondents

informed the court that he would not make oral submissions.

Objections were also not filed on behalf of the 2nd to 6th respondents.

The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that his application to

review the order dated 17.07.2019 was rejected by the Board on the

basis that, the Board has the power under Section 54 of the Ordinance

to review an order only when an application is dismissed, settled, or

concluded by any other way without an inquiry. The learned counsel

contended further that the said determination is erred in law and

according to Section 54 of the Ordinance, any order made by the Board

could be reviewed, irrespective of the fact whether an inquiry was held

or not.

In reply, the learned counsel for the 1st respondent contended that the

Board can review its order in accordance with Section 54 of the

Ordinance only when dismissing an application, granting a certificate,

approving a settlement, or before the payment of the compounded debt

has been completed, as correctly determined by the Board.

The Section 54(1) of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance reads as follows;

The Board may, of its own motion or on application made by any

person interested, within three months from the making of an order

by the Board dismissing an application, or granting a certificate, or

approving a settlement, or before the payment of the compounded

debt has been completed, review any order passed by it and pass

such other in reference thereto as it thinks fit.

According to the proceedings of the Debt Conciliation Board, a

preliminary inquiry was held and the impugned order was made

declaring that the deed bearing the No.1512 is a mortgage. In

determining whether Section 54 gives power to the board to review the

impugned order, it is important to consider the procedure laid down in

the Ordinance in determining an application of this nature.

After an application had been made by the 1st respondent under Section

19A(1A) of the Ordinance, notices were sent and a preliminary hearing

was held in terms of Section 24. Thereafter, the order had been made

on 17.07.2019 that the deed bearing number 1512 is a mortgage.

Further, the Board directed to act in terms of Section 25(1) (a), (b), (c).

At that stage, the instant writ application has been preferred.

The next step which had to be followed as per the procedure laid down

in the Ordinance was to call the statement containing the particulars

of the debt under Section 28 of the Ordinance and then fix a day for the

5

hearing of the application. Thereafter, three types of orders could be

made. An order could be made granting a certificate in terms of Section

29 of the Ordinance. The board could also dismiss an application in

terms of Section 32(1) of the Ordinance at any stage of the proceedings.

Apart from that, Section 30 deals with the Board's approval of a

settlement.

It is apparent that Section 54 of the Ordinance gives power to the Board

to review the aforesaid orders of dismissing an application, granting a

certificate or approving a settlement. Other than that, Section 54 gives

power to the board to review an order made before the payment of the

compounded debt is completed. That is, any order made with regard to

the payment of the debt could be reviewed by the Board before

completing the payment of the compounded debt.

Therefore, as the learned counsel for the 1st respondent correctly

contended, an order made only on those four instances could be

reviewed in terms of Section 54 of the Ordinance. The order made

following the preliminary hearing in determining whether the deed

bearing No.1512 is a mortgage or not does not fall within the

aforementioned four instances. Although the learned counsel for the

petitioner advanced an argument that the words any order mean any

order made at any time from the filing of the application to the stage of

the debt being completely paid, I regret that I am unable to agree with

that contention. If the contention of the learned counsel for the

petitioner is accepted, it is apparent that enumerating the

aforementioned four instances in Section 54(1) serve no purpose.

Hence, it is evident that any order means any order relating to the

aforesaid four instances. As the order dated 17.07.2019 was not an

order of dismissing an application or granting a certificate or approving

a settlement or an order made before completing the payment of the

compounded debt as explained previously, I hold that the decision of

6

the Debt Conciliation Board dated 22.01.2020 dismissing the

application made under Section 54 for a review is correct and lawful.

Accordingly, the application for writs of certiorari and mandamus is

dismissed without costs.
