Prasantha De Silva J.,

Order

This is an appeal emanating from the Order of the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial

High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province holden at Ratnapura, exercising revisionary jurisdiction

against the Order made by the learned Magistrate who was acting as the Primary Court Judge

in terms of Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act no 44 of 1979.

It appears that the Petitioner had filed a private Plaint in terms of Section 66 1(b) of the said Act

in the Magistrate Court of Ratnapura.

The learned Magistrate after following the procedure stipulated under Section 66 of the said

Act, allowed parties to file Affidavits, Counter Affidavits and Written Submissions and thereafter

made his Order on 29.01.2009 against the Petitioner on the ground that the Petitioner has not

established a right over the disputed roadway.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Petitioner had invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa holden in Ratnapura seeking to revise/set aside the

said Order.

However, after the conclusion of the hearing, the learned Provincial High Court Judge affirmed

the Order of the learned Magistrate and made his Order on 20.09.2017 dismissing the revision

application of the Petitioner.

Thereafter, the Petitioner had preferred an Appeal to this Court seeking to set aside the Order

dated 20.09.2017 by the learned High Court Judge and the Order dated 29.01.2009 of the

learned Magistrate.

The Petitioner submitted that he has been allocated a premises to set up his business Panda

Noodles manufacturing company in the Nalanda Ellawela Industrial Zone Phase II for an extent

of 05 Acres.

According to the Affidavit dated 05.06.2008 by the Petitioner namely Jen Seling, the said

premises more fully described as lot 204 in plan bearing no 226 dated 18.11.1998 marked as

P3. The Petitioner has stated that access given to said lot 204 through a 40 feet road more fully

depicted as lot 206 in the said Plan [P3].

Although the Petitioner had stated in his Affidavit that the disputed access road claimed by the

Petitioner to access the business premises is in Lot 206, this was incorrect and it was corrected

by the Petitioner as lot 205 in his Counter affidavit dated 24.07.2008.

Furthermore, the Petitioner had stated that Respondent too was allocated premises to carry out

a business in the same industrial zone.

The Petitioner alleged that the Respondent had taken steps to erect a structure in the access road

given to Petitioner through lot 206 marked as Y in Plan P3 which has prevented the Petitioner

from accessing lot 204, his business premises.

Therefore, it is abundantly clear that the dispute relates to an access road to the Petitioners

business premises over lot 205, thus the learned Magistrate has very correctly applied Section

69 (1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act to resolve the dispute.

In this instance, Court draws attention to document 4 issued by the Regional Director of

Industries of the Industrial Development Ministry dated 14.08.2008, addressed to the

Respondent.

In view of the said letter 4 the disputed roadway belongs to the state, hence the Appellant

cannot claim any prescriptive right, over the disputed roadway.

According to Section 69(1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act, it is the burden of the Appellant

to establish that the Appellant is entitled to use the impugned roadway as of right.

In view of the findings of the learned Provincial High Court Judge, it is my considered opinion

that according to said letter 4, the Petitioner is not entitled to use the disputed road access as

of right.

The learned High Court Judge has stated in his Order dated 20.09.2017,

As rightfully identified by the learned Magistrate Appellant already has a road access marked as

A2.

The learned High Court Judge has determined that the Order of the Learned Magistrate is correct

in facts and in law.

It appears that the learned High Court Judge had analysed and evaluated the evidence placed

before the learned Magistrate and affirmed the said order of the learned Magistrate. Therefore,

it is seen that the Order of the Learned High Court Judge is well-founded.

As such, we see no reason for us to interfere with the Order dated 20.09.2017 by the learned

High Court Judge as well as the Order dated 29.01.2009 by the Learned Magistrate.

Hence, the order appeal is dismissed with costs.
