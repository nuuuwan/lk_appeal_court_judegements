Judgement

The Plaintiff instituted an action bearing no 4221/L in the District court of the Ratnapura seeking

a declaration of title to the land described in the schedule to the Plaint. Plaintiffs had sought an

interim injunction in the first instance and a permanent injunction, restraining the Defendant and

his servants, agents and anyone coming under him from gemming in the said land, until the final

determination of this case.

It appears that the application for interim injunction was supported on 11.07.1980 and the court

granted an interim injunction ex-parte and issued notice on the Defendant. Consequently, the

Defendants proxy was filed on 11.07.1980 and he had objected to the issuance of interim

injunction. However, interim injunction was not dissolved by the learned District Judge.

It is to be noted that on 16.03.1980 counsel for the Plaintiffs had moved for a commission to

survey the land claimed by the Plaintiffs.

At this stage counsel for the Defendant had informed court that the land which the Defendant

claims and is in possession is depicted in plan bearing no 416 dated 22.08.1980.The counsel for

the Defendant had made an application to super impose the said plan on the commissioned plan

moved by the Plaintiffs.

The said Commission was returned by the licensed surveyor S. Ramakrishan with plan bearing no

1436 dated 29.12.1980 to court.

The said 1st commissioned plan and the report was marked and produced in evidence as X and X1

respectively.

Although the counsel for the Defendant moved to super impose the said plan bearing no. 416

dated 22.08.1980, which depicts the land claimed by the Defendant - it was not super imposed

on the said 1st commissioned plan X by the said surveyor Mr. R. Ramakrishnan.

According to the said surveyors report X1, it states

.

Therefore, it clearly shows that the land surveyed by the said 1st commission is not the land

described in the schedule to the plaint and the Defendant is in possession of the land which was

surveyed on the said commission.

Since the said plan marked X is not in conformity with the land described in the schedule to the

plaint, on behalf of the Plaintiffs, a second commission had been taken to survey the land described

in the schedule to the Plaint. The said second commissioned plan bearing no 1436 (A) dated

25.02.1981 and the report which was prepared by the same surveyor is marked and produced in

evidence as Y and Y1 respectively.

At the trial, no admissions were recorded, and issues numbered 1-5 were raised on behalf of the

Plaintiffs and issues numbered 6-14 were raised on behalf of the Defendant.

It is to be noted that on behalf of the Plaintiffs only the 6th Plaintiff had adduced evidence and

none of the other Plaintiffs had come forward to give evidence. The 6th Plaintiff adduced evidence

and produced documents P1-P3 in evidence.

It seems, most of the deeds marked by the 6th Plaintiff was to prove their title to the subject matter

described in the schedule to the Plaint in the Plaintiffs action.

It was the contention of the Plaintiffs that they have proven title to the land in suit which is shown

in plan bearing 1436 (A) marked and produced as Y in evidence. Therefore, the Plaintiffs

contended that they were entitled to a declaration of tittle in respect of the said land.

In contrast, it was the position taken up by the Defendant that he himself along with some other

third parties [who are not Parties to the instant case] are entitled to the land called and known as

Ihala Kalale Kumbrua alias Kalale Kumbura. Which is shown in plans marked X and Y.

It is relevant to note that the Plaintiffs had taken two commissions to survey the land described in

the schedule to the Plaint, which is the land described in the title deeds relied on by the Plaintiffs.

6

When questioning the Plaintiffs witness about taking two commissions to survey the same land, it

was the answer of the 6th Plaintiff that since the boundaries of the first Commissioned plan marked

X does not tally with their tittle deeds, to match the boundaries of the said land with their title

deeds, they had to take another commission.

I will now draw the attention to the evidence adduced by the Plaintiffs witness in this regard,

As indicated from the said evidence of the Plaintiffs witness, it is obvious that the witness was not

familiar with the location of the premises in suit with the boundaries.

Furthermore, it is obvious that the same land was surveyed in the 2nd commission by the same

surveyor R. Ramakrishnan depicted in both Plan X and Plan Y, described the land to be surveyed

by the same extend of 1 acre, 3 roods and 30 perches and same boundaries.

Court observes that the shape of the land depicted in plan X is identical to the land depicted in

plan Y.

It clearly shows the Northern-Eastern boundary in both plans X and Y bounded with a

separating the paddy land and the land named .

According to the Plaintiffs Eastern-Southern boundary in plan X is and in plan Y it is

. On the other hand the Defendant has indicated it as in both

plans.

7

According to the report X1, the boundaries of the subject matter were shown by 2nd, 3rd and 6th

Plaintiffs and Defendant. Nevertheless, the said Plaintiffs had not shown the Eastern boundary as

ihale kalale kumbura.

Similarly, the said Parties had shown the Southern-Western boundary in Plan X as

- - . However, the surveyor,

has indicated it in Plan Y as according to the Plaintiffs, and the Defendant

has shown it as .

Therefore, it is seen that the surveyor has not specifically said whether the Southern-Western

boundary is or . Thus, it seems that the surveyor was uncertain

about the said boundary and apparently the surveyor had not attempted to clearly identify the

boundaries.

It is observable that the Plaintiffs only witnesses, the 6th Plaintiff had failed to give evidence with

regard to the identification of the subject matter and its specific boundaries. The witness had stated

in evidence that she does not know the boundaries to the subject matter.

Therefore, it is apparent that the Plaintiffs had not substantiated that the land surveyed in the 1st

and 2nd commission is the land described in the schedule to the Plaint and the land described in

schedules to the Plaintiffs title deeds.

The learned District Judge had stated in his judgement that

X Y

.

Nevertheless, there is no admission to say that the disputed land is the land described in the

schedule to the Plaint. What the Parties have agreed to is, the disputed land is depicted in plans X

and Y which is not the same thing.

It is evident that the disputed land is the paddy land which the Defendant was in possession.

At the outset, counsel for the Defendant had moved to super impose the land claimed by the

Defendant, which is depicted in plan bearing 416 dated 22.08.1980. Although, the learned

District Judge allowed the said application for a super imposition, for some reason it has not been

done. If it were done, no doubt that the disputed land would have been properly identified with

metes and bounds.

However, it is noteworthy that, report Y1 prepared by the surveyor, Mr. Ramakrishnan states,

8

: 1981.02.25 1436A

: 1436

.

: .

1436A .

: .

According to the said report Y1 it seems that the surveyor Mr. Ramakrishnan had not properly

identified the subject land and its boundaries. It seems to me that, instead Mr. Ramakrishnan had

just indicated the boundaries as informed by the Plaintiffs to match the land described in the

schedule to the Plaint and also the land described in the Plaintiffs title deeds.

It is in evidence that the Plaintiffs were unaware of the identity of the subject land since they did

not know the boundaries of their land described in the schedule to the Plaint.

It is apparent that the surveyor had surveyed the land where the Defendants were in possession

and named the four boundaries according to the Plaintiffs title deeds and the land described in

the schedule to the Plaint in order to fit into the Defendants land in the instant case.

The learned District judge did not consider why the Plaintiffs moved for a 2nd commission or why

the surveyor disregarded the application for super imposition.

It is pertinent to note, that the Plaintiffs had not called the said surveyor Mr. Ramakrishnan to

adduce evidence and explained about executing of the said two commissions and prepared plans

X and Y, and reports X1 and Y1 respectively.

The burden of proving the identity of the land and proving the title claimed by the Plaintiffs rests

squarely and fairly with the Plaintiffs.

It is well settled law that in a vindicatory action the burden of proof rests upon the Plaintiffs to

prove his title including the identity of the boundaries.

However, it is clear that the Plaintiffs had failed to identify the land described in the schedule to

the Plaint. As such, Plaintiffs action should fail on that ground alone.

Although the learned Trial Judge pronounced a lengthy judgement of about 33 pages, the only

form of analysis of the burden of proof of the Plaintiffs case is only confined to the last three pages.

9

The learned Trial Judge had not considered any of the infirmities of the Plaintiffs action,

nevertheless the learned Trial Judge held with the Plaintiffs on the assumption that the Defendant

had failed to prove his case.

It was held in the case of Dharmadasa v Jayasena 1997 (3) S. L. R. 327,

In a rei vindicatio action the burden is on the Plaintiffs to establish the title pleaded and

relied on by him. The defendant need not prove anything.

In the recent case of K. A. Munasinghe v Lal Siriiwardena 155/2000(F) [C.A.M. 07.06.2019],

Janak de Silva J expounded on the duty of the Plaintiff relating to properly identifying the land

and its boundaries in the following manner referring to various judicial dictums,

In a rei vindicatio action it is a paramount duty on the part of the plaintiff to establish

correct boundaries in order to identify the land in dispute [Peeris v. Savunhamy (54 N.L.R.

207)]. There is a greater and heavy burden on a plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action to prove

not only that he has dominium to the land in dispute but also the specific precise and

definite boundaries when claiming a declaration of title [Abeykoon Hamine v. Appuhamy

(52 N.L.R. 49)]. To succeed in a rei vindicatio, the owner must prove on a balance of

probabilities, not only his or her ownership in the property, but also that the property

exists and is clearly identifiable. The identity of the land is fundamental for the purpose of

attributing ownership, and for ordering ejectment [Lathee! v. Mansoor and another (2010)

2 SrLL.R. 333 at 349)]. In a vindicatory action it is necessary to establish the identity of the

corpus in a clear and unambiguous manner and the action must fail upon the failure to

do so [Fernando v. Somasiri (2012 B.L.R. 121)].

In the instant case the Plaintiffs did not identify the land where the Plaintiffs sought a declaration

of title. Since the court holds that the Plaintiffs had failed to prove the land referred in schedule to

the Plaint (for which the Plaintiff has sought declaratory relief) is the same land that was surveyed

and depicted in Plans X and Y, the Plaintiffs action should fail.

Hence, the Judgement of the learned District judge dated 17.02.2000 is set aside and the Plaintiffs

action is dismissed with costs.

Further, court draws attention to issue no. 12 and 13 raised on behalf of the Defendant.

12:

:

10

13:

: .

In respect of those issues no 12 and 13, it appears that the Defendant in his amended answer, has

prayed relief for damages caused to him by granting of the interim injunction against him and

restraining him from gemming in the subject land. It is seen that the Defendant had adduced

evidence in this respect.

Accordingly, we hold that the Defendant-Appellant is entitled for damages. Hence, we award Rs.

10,000 as damages prayed in prayer II of the amened answer as the initial capital cost of setting

up the gemming operation and also damages prayed in prayer II of the amended answer, as Rs.

1000 per mensem from the date of filing of the Plaint and until the date of pronouncement of this

judgement amounting to Rs. 530,000.

It is reiterated that in our law in rei vindicatio action, a significant burden lies on the Plaintiff not

only to establish title over the land but to properly identify the corpus of the land and its

boundaries. In view of the foregoing reasons Plaintiffs have failed to prove the identity of the

corpus thus the Plaintiffs had not discharged this burden. Therefore, the decision of the learned

District Judge is set aside, and we allow this appeal.

Appeal allowed with damages.
