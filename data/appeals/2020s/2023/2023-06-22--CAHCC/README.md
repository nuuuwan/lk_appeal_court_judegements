The 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Accused-Appellants (here in after referred to as

Accused) along with one Ihagama Ambagaswela Gedara Weerakkody alias Rohan,

deceased by the time the trial had commenced) were indicted as described in the

indictment before the High Court of Colombo on the following three counts,

1. 1.That the Accused persons were members of an unlawful assembly with

the common object of which was to cause hurt to Roshan Lasantha

Gomas alias Shan, and thereby committing an offence punishable under

Section 140 of the Penal Code,

2. At the same place, time and in the course of same transaction, being one

or more members of the said unlawful assembly, in prosecution of the

said common object, caused the death of said Shan and thereby

committed the offence of murder punishable in terms of Section 296 read

with Section 146 of the Penal Code.

3. At the same place, time and in the course of same transaction, the

accused persons, caused the death of said Shan, thereby committed an

offence punishable in terms of Section 296 read with Section 32 of the

Penal Code.

It should be noted that the abovesaid indictment only be levelled against the above

Accused named as only persons who were only participated, whereas the said indictment

had not been presented with the phrase with those unknown to the prosecution.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Colombo on 18th May 2007

where all Accused opted for a trial without jury. The prosecution led evidence of four

witnesses including the judicial medical officer. After the conclusion of the prosecution

case, for the defense, 1st, 2nd 3rd and 6th Accused made statements from the dock whilst

the 5th Accused gave evidence from the witness box. Upon considering the evidence

elicited during the course of the trial, the learned High Court Judge by her judgment

dated 30th April 2015 convicted all Accused for all charges in the indictment. It was the

contention of the learned counsel who appeared for the Accused that their clients had

been falsely implicated and that the story of the prosecution cannot be relied upon due

Page 4 of 12

to several inconsistencies and overall lack of credibility, therefore following grounds of

appeal was urged by them.

Grounds of appeal

1. Conviction is wholly unsafe in view of the uncorroborated and unsatisfactory

nature of the evidence of the sore eye witness.

2. The learned trial judge has failed to apply the principles governing the evaluation

of evidence.

3. The learned Trial Judge when writing his judgement has seriously misdirected

himself on very critical issues of the facts causing serious prejudice to the

appellant.

4. The prosecution has not been able to prove murderous intention of the 4th, 6th

Accused Appellants.

5. The accused persons were indicted for being members of an unlawful assembly in

the prosecution of common object of which to commit murder of the deceased and

thereby committing an offence under section 146 of the Penal Code, but this has

not been proved by the prosecution.

6. The evidence available in the present case is not sufficient to convict the Accused

Appellants under Section 32 of the Penal Code.

When the matter came for argument on 28.03.2023, the learned Senior Deputy

Solicitor General, indicated to this court that the learned Trial Judge did not properly

direct herself with regard to the unlawful assembly, very correctly and in the best of

spirits demonstrated the role of the Hon. Attorney General not to support the conviction

of 2nd, 5th and 6th Accused. As such, 2nd, 5th and 6th Accused were acquitted and the

sentences against them were set aside on the same day.

The factual background, in brief, as deduced from the evidence is as follows. According

to the eye witness PW1 namely Abeysingha Weerakoon Hettige Roshani Nilanthi Gomas,

the sister of the deceased, there was anonymity between the deceased and the neighbors

with regard to a pigeon cage belonging to the deceased, which was stolen by unknown

persons. It was suspected to be stolen by people who came to buy drugs from the property

on which the pigeon cage was located. As a measure of retaliation, the deceased

purportedly started attacking people who came to the said property to buy drugs,

disrupting the foregoing business activity, which tipped off the neighbors. (It should be

noted that except for PW5 all were neighbors.) On the fatal day, PW1 heard the 3rd and

Page 5 of 12

4th Accused call out to the deceased, while they were sleeping. Deceased went out the

house from the kitchen door and went to the front as the witness and the family followed

him. She could identify the persons at the gate from the street light, as they were

neighbors. At the gate, there was an exchange of words between the deceased and the

both Accused. She overheard the third Accused saying; (On page 122 of Brief)

" "

This piece of evidence had established in this case that 3rd and 4th Accused were

indeed neighbors, therefore there arises a motive for the said Accused to attack the

deceased. PW1 in her evidence claims there was a three-wheeler stopped at the gate,

which she recognized to have belonged to the 5th Accused, who she claims was sitting in

the driver's seat. The deceased, then got into a three-wheeler on his own and they

proceeded from the house. In the meantime, the third and the fourth Accused persons

took steel rods from a nearby land belonging to them and followed the three-wheeler.

Seeing this, she and the rest of the family of the deceased has also run after the

two Accused. The three-wheeler stopped about 25 yards from the house, and the deceased

got off from the three-wheeler. According to PW1, by this time all six Accused were there.

When the deceased got off, the 1st Accused chased him off to the middle of the road and

hit his leg with a rod. The deceased fell down, at which point the fourth Accused hit the

deceased with a steel rod three times, yelling; (On page 133 of Brief) " ".

PW1 claims that the fourth Accused hit the deceased on the head, followed by the

first Accused.

(On page 133 of the Brief)

- , 4 .

- ?

- .

As the fourth Accused was hitting the deceased, PW1 has yelled "

", and hanged on to the rod causing him to drop it. Then only the assault was stopped

and the deceased by this point had been laying on the road, bloody and groaning. She has

identified the 2nd Accused at the scene, but she has not disclosed the degree to which (if

any), the 2nd Accused participated in the assault. When the assault stopped, the 6th

Page 6 of 12

Accused gathered the weapons and put them in the three-wheeler and thereafter all six

of them have left. It's in PW1 evidence that they struggled to find a three-wheeler to take

the deceased to the hospital right away as the neighbors feared to help them in lieu of the

events that had just occurred. According to PW1 she identified all the Accused persons as

they were neighbors except for PW5.

When we pursue her evidence, we don't see any major contradictions

in PW1s evidence, as she's consistent throughout. Minor contradictions in evidence are

usually found in witness testimony, especially when the witness has to recollect their

memory years after the events. Were mindful towards the observations made by Justice

Thakkar with regard to contradiction in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai vs State of

Gujarat 1983 AIR HC 753;

(1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is

replayed on the mental screen. (2) ordinarily it so happens that a witness is

overtaken by events. The witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which

so often has an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be

expected to be attuned to absorb the details. (3) The powers of observation differ

from person to person. What one may notice, another may not. An object or

movement might emboss its image on one person's mind whereas it might go

unnoticed on the part of another. (4) By and large people cannot accurately recall

a conversation and reproduce the very words used by them or heard by them. They

can only recall the main purport of the conversation. It is unrealistic to expect a

witness to be a human tape recorder. (5) In regard to exact time of an incident, or

the time duration of an occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess

work on the spur of the moment 1.1 at the time of interrogation. And one cannot

expect people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters. Again, it

depends on the time- sense of individuals which varies from person to person

The main argument put forward by the defence is that PW1 is the sole eye witness

to the incident, therefore the court could not act upon her sole testimony. With regard to

credibility of sole eye witnesses, our courts have followed the dictums pronounced in the

following cases.

Page 7 of 12

Anil Phukan v. State of Assam AIR 1993 SC II 1462, A. S. Anand J. along with N. P. Singh

J.,

A conviction can be based on the testimony of a single eye-witness and there is no

rule of law or evidence which says to the contrary provided the sole witness passes the

test of reliability. So long as the single eye-witness is a wholly reliable witness the courts

have no difficulty in basing conviction on his testimony alone. However, where the single

eye-witness is not found to be a wholly reliable witness, in the sense that there are some

circumstances which may show that he could have an interest in the prosecution, then

the courts generally insist upon some independent corroboration of his testimony, in

material particulars, before recording conviction.

Wijepala v. The Attorney-General, 2001 (1) SLR 45, Ismail J. held;

Senaratne who was the sole eyewitness has thus been cross-examined on vital

aspects relating to the incident and doubts have been raised in regard to his presence at

the scene. Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance lays down a specific rule that no

particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact, thus

attaching more importance to the quality of evidence rather than the quantity. The

evidence of a single witness, if cogent and impressive, can be acted upon by a Court, but,

whenever there are circumstances of suspicion in the testimony of such a witness or is

challenged by the cross-examination or otherwise, then corroboration may be necessary.

The established rule of practice in such circumstances is to look for corroboration in

material particulars by reliable testimony, direct or circumstantial. In this instance, the

prosecution has not led any other evidence, which even barely supported Senaratne in

regard to the infliction of the injury by the appellant.

We're mindful that the PW1 is the sister of the deceased, which renders her an

interested witness. Accordingly, this court has to consider whether there is an

independent corroboration available before accepting the evidence of this witness. As per

the expert evidence of PW6, Ayanthie Saliya Gunasekara, Judicial Medical Officer who

conducted the post mortem, injury No. 1 is identified as a fracture on the head of the

deceased and a fatal wound, likely caused by a heavy, blunt object.

Page 8 of 12

At this juncture we will reproduce the relevant portions from an extensive

evaluation by the learned Trial Judge of the PW6 evidence for the purpose of clarity.

The trial Judge has evaluated PW1 evidence in corroboration with the PW6s

expert medical opinion and concluded PW1 to be a trustworthy witness. Therefore, we

are of the view that learned High Court Judge correctly accepted the evidence of PW1 as

the witness No. 1 is consistent in her evidence and have been corroborated by the expert

medical opinion.

The learned counsel for the Accused in his argument, has brought up that the

prosecution failed to prove the common intention beyond reasonable doubt. The court has

to consider whether 1st, 3rd (now deceased) and 4th Accused shared the common

murderous intention to cause death to the deceased. What is common intention is

specified in under Section 32 of the Penal Code.

"When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common

intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were

done by him alone"

Page 9 of 12

Before we analyze the evidence, it is pertinent to consider how our courts have

interpreted "common intention" and its applicability.

The Queen v. Vincent Fernando 65 NLR 265, Basnayake CJ. held;

Now where a series of criminal acts is done by several persons, each act would be

done either jointly or severally. But whether the criminal acts in the series of criminal

acts are done jointly or severally if each criminal act is done in furtherance of the common

intention of all each of the persons sharing the common intention and doing any act in the

series of criminal acts is not only liable for his own act but is also liable for the acts of the

others in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.

The King v. Assappu 50 NLR 324, Dias J. held;

We are of opinion that in all cases where the question of common intention arises

the Judge should tell the Jury that, in order to bring the rule in section 32 into operation,

it is the duty of the prosecution to satisfy them beyond all reasonable doubt that a criminal

act has been done or committed; that such act was done or committed by several persons

; that such persons at the time the criminal act was done or committed were acting in the

furtherance of the common intention of all ; and that such intention is an ingredient of

the offence charged, or of some minor offence. The Judge should also tell the Jury that in

applying the rule of common intention there are certain vital and fundamental principles

which they must keep prominently in mind-namely (a) the case of each prisoner must be

considered separately ; (b) that the Jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that

he was actuated by a common intention with the doer of the criminal act at the time the

alleged offence was committed ; (c) they must be told that the benefit of any reasonable

doubt on this matter must be given to the prisoner concerned-47 N. L. R. at p. 375; (d) the

Jury must be warned to be careful not to confuse " Some or similar intention entertained

independently of each other " with " Common intention "; (e) that the inference of common

intention should never be reached unless it is a necessary inference deducible from the

circumstances of the case-A. I. R. 1945 P. C. 118 ; (f) the Jury should be told that in order

to justify the inference that a particular prisoner was actuated by a common intention

with the doer of the act, there must be evidence, direct or circumstantial, either of pre-

arrangement, or a pre-arranged plan, or a declaration showing common intention, or some

other significant fact at the time of the commission of the offence, to enable them to say

that a co-accused had a common intention with the doer of the act, and not merely a same

Page 10 of 12

or similar intention entertained independently of each other-47 N. L. R. at p. 375, 48 N.

L. R. 295 ; (g) the Jury should also be directed that if there is no evidence of any common

intention actuating the co-accused or any particular co-accused, or if there is any

reasonable doubt on that point, then the charge cannot lie against any one other than the

actual doer of the criminal act-44 N. L. R. 370, 46 N. L. R. 135, 473, 475 ; (h) in such a

case such co-accused would be liable only for such criminal acts which they themselves

committed ; (i) the Jury should also be directed that the mere fact that the co-accused

were present when the doer did the criminal act does not per se constitute common

intention, unless there is other evidence which justifies them in so holding- 45 N. L. R.

510 ; and (7) the Judge should endeavour to assist the Jury by examining the case against

each of the co-accused in the light of these principles.

Wimalasena v. Inspector of Police, Hambanthota 74 NLR 176, Siva Supramaniam, J.

held;

The prosecution apparently relied on S. 32 of the Penal Code to bring home the

offences against the 2nd and 3rd accused. It has been repeatedly held by this Court that

the mere presence of an accused is not sufficient to establish common intention.

Anthony v. The Queen 55 NLR 35, Gunasekara, J. held;

A common intention does not necessarily and in all cases imply an express

agreement and a plan arranged long before the assault. The agreement may be tacit and

the common design conceived immediately before it is executed. In the present case the

jury may well have been satisfied that at the time of the provocation the appellants were

already so united by a common bond of relationship to each other and hostility to Mack

on the score of his attitude to the third accused, that as soon as he laid hands on the third

accused, they readily came to a tacit agreement to inflict grievous injuries on him. In our

opinion there is no inconsistency in the verdict.

Raju and Others v. Attorney General 2003 (3) SLR 116, Edirisuriya J. held;

The learned trial judge has failed to consider the case of each accused separately.

He has failed to consider as to whether all the accused were actuated by common

murderous intention. There is nothing in the judgement to suggest whether the learned

trial Judge looked for evidence of pre arrangement or pre-plan from which the inferences

of common intention could be inferred as a necessary and inescapable inference.

Page 11 of 12

The abovesaid judgement was followed in Kotawila Vithanage Chandradasa and

Other v. Attorney General 113-114/2016, Decided On 26.09.2018,by his Lordship Achala

Wengappuli J.

With the above cited judicial decisions, we now consider whether the evidence led

by the prosecution regarding common intention is sufficient to prove murderous common

intention without any doubt. PW1 in his evidence stated that the 3rd and 4th accused

came to their home, thereafter they have followed him with clubs and iron rods. When

deceased got down from the three-wheeler 1st Accused started attacking him with the

iron rod, as well as the 3rd and 4th Accused. The 4th Accused has hit the deceaseds head

while others were also hitting with clubs. Learned High Court Judge has reproduced the

above evidence in his judgement and decided that 1st and 3rd Accused shared the common

murderous intention with 4th Accused. The repeated blows on the body by all three with

significant force has established clear murderous intention. Therefore, we hold that 1st,

3rd (now deceased) and the 4th Accused shared the common murderous intention to kill,

one Roshan Lasantha Gomas alias Shan.

Unlawful Assembly

The 1st and 4th Accused were also convicted for the first count and second count,

that is based on unlawful assembly. Since the 2nd, 5th and 6th Accused were acquitted for

all counts including unlawful assembly, and also without the phrase in the indictment

that is with those unknown to the prosecution, whether this court affirms the conviction

only against the 1st, 4th along with the 3rd (deceased) for unlawful assembly. This court is

mindful that to form unlawful assembly, there should be five or more persons according

to Section 138 of the Penal Code. This concept was articulated in the following cases.

The Queen v. Appuhamy 62 NLR 484, Sansoni, J held;

A common object is different from a common intention, in that it does not require

prior concert and a common meeting of minds before the offence is committed. If each

member of the assembly has the same object, then their object would be common, and if

there were five or more with this object, then they would form an unlawful assembly

without any prior concert among themselves. If these elements are established, the

prosecution has then proved the existence of an unlawful assembly with that particular

common object: see Sukha v. Stale of Rajasthan.

Page 12 of 12

In the light of the authority mentioned above, we hold that persecution has failed

to establish with 1st and the 4th Accused were members of unlawful assembly. Therefore,

we acquit both 1st and 4th Accused from charges of first and second counts.

We hold that the learned High Court Judge correctly applied the relevant legal

principle, in coming to his findings in regard to the third count. Therefore, we affirm the

conviction and sentence imposed on the 1st and 4th Accused by the High Court of

Colombo.
