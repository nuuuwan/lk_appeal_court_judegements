The 1st suspect was arrested by the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) on 19.07.2021, while packing heroin in a house at Kotugoda, Ja-ela. She was alleged to have been in possession of 1.225 kilograms of heroin. The police also recovered Rs. 868,900/=, alleged to be the proceeds of heroin trafficking. According to the Government Analyst, the pure quantity of heroin is 809.6 grammes. The first suspect has been in remand custody since 19.07.2021. An application seeking for bail was filed in the High Court of Negombo, which was rejected by the Learned High Court Judge. Section 83 of the Poison, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states; 83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance shall not be released on bail by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

Considering the gravity of the offence and the sentence prescribed under the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, there is a high risk of the suspect absconding, if he is enlarged on bail. In view of this, it is prudent to conclude the High Court case expeditiously while the suspect is in remand custody. The grounds urged by the petitioner, in this case, cannot be considered as exceptional circumstances. Further, the delay of more than two years in remand does not fall into the category of excessive and oppressive delay, considering the gravity of the offence and other circumstances of this case. Considering all the material placed before this Court, the petitioner has failed to satisfy that there are exceptional grounds to enlarge the suspect on bail.
