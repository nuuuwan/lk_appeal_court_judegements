Thereafter, the PW2 has gone and inquired about the incident from the 1st appellants family, upon which the family members of the 1st appellant have tried to assault the PW2. Then the PW2 has taken her daughter to the police station and has lodged a complaint. 7. The grounds of appeal No. 1 and 2 will be discussed together. The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellants submitted that, the complaint to the police was lodged 13 days after the alleged sexual offences were committed on her. The prosecutrix has failed to even inform her mother until the mother heard certain rumours regarding the incident. It is the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel that, the dispute which arose when the PW1s mother went to inquire from the 1st appellants family, has led to the complaint to the police being lodged. The learned Presidents Counsel further submitted that, the evidence of the PW1 is contradictory to the evidence of the police officer with regard to the house to which the PW1 was taken by the appellants. The evidence of the PW1 revealed that, her mother has added certain facts to her statement to the police and therefore, the evidence of the PW1 is not credible.",
