The main reliefs sought by the Petitioners in this Application, inter alia,

are remedies, by way of a Writ of Prohibition, preventing the Respondents

from taking any action to recall the said product (" .") from the

market and/or interfering with the airing of the advertisements, and to

issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision (P13) made by the

Respondents.

At the outset, the Petitioners are engaged in the trade of food

manufacturing, primarily manufacturing rice flour noodles. The

Petitioners claim that they have been prejudiced by the decision of the 2nd

Respondent, namely the Chairman of the Food Labelling and Advertising

Sub Committee, in the letter marked P13 which posits that the trade

name, , of the Petitioner Companys product of rice noodles,

misleads the public and thereby should be changed.

Prior to addressing the question on whether the term could

be used as the trade name in the sale of the product, as it is purported to

be misleading, one must first familiarize himself with the sequence of facts

prior to the arrival of the said decision by the Respondents.

The Petitioners on 26-10-2015 received a letter (marked P6) from the 2nd

Respondent, stating that there are concerns raised with regard to the

Petitioner Companys product of rice noodles, namely , and to

submit a justification in relation to the use of the trade name. The reason

for concern was provided for in a letter dated 14-12-2015 (marked P6c)

which states that

Page 4 of 9

The term " " misleads the people as it is an

alternative for rice. Therefore, remove that phrase as soon as

possible from all of your communication.

Subsequently the 2nd Petitioner, via fax, received a request on 24-01-2016

to attend a meeting, by the 2nd Respondent Committee, to discuss the

usage of the term as the trade name. As the 2nd Petitioner was

unable to attend the meeting, an alternative date was sought (P6e).

The Petitioners receiving a letter on 02-05-2016 (P7) was requested to, inter

alia, recall all products in the market with the alleged misleading title.

Seeking an opportunity to be heard, and at the request of the Petitioners,

the Petitioners were invited to partake in a meeting on 27-07-2016, to

which was attended by two senior officials of the 1st Petitioner Company.

It was posited during the meeting, by the Petitioners, that they deny that

they have violated any Regulation made under the Food Act, and further

deny the averments stipulated in letter marked P7, which informed the

Petitioner that the product of the Company cannot be described as a

substitute for rice or , which is in contravention of Regulation

13(6) of the Food (Labelling and Advertising) Regulation 2005. Being

aggrieved by the decision stipulated in P7, the Petitioners filed CA Writ

Application No.163/2016. On the direction of their Lordships of the Court

of Appeal, the matter was to be adjusted in a manner acceptable to all

parties. Thereby in response, the Petitioners changed the product name

from to . However, the change was met with

objections by the Respondent Committee via a letter dated 24-10-2016

(P10) as such use of the term was not approved by the said

Committee. Reasons against the use of the term was provided

Page 5 of 9

for in a letter dated 17-09-2018 by the 2nd Respondent as it misleads the

consumers (P13).

In response to such allegations by the Petitioners, the Respondents in their

statement of objections posit that they were compelled to issue the letter

marked P13 as the Petitioners were in constant violation of the decision

made by the Respondent Committee through the usage of the term

. Denial on the use of the said term was decided at the Committee

meeting dated 09.08.2016 marked 1R3, which reads thus;

03. Writ application No 163/2016 by at the Court of appeal: It was

communicated to the committee that a hearing was given to "Raigam"

on this matter on the directive of the Attorney General. Committee

decided that the name "Devani Betha" ( ) cannot be allowed

as it sounds very similar to earlier name and due to other reasons

expressed. However, committee agreed to give a grace period of 3

months to change the name.

It is further submitted that the trade name of food products must comply

inter alia, with the provisions of the Food Act, No. 26 of 1980, Food

Standards Regulation 1989, Food (Labelling and Advertising) Regulation

2005 and the SLS standards for food products. The Food Standard

Regulation for Rice is contained in Gazette extraordinary No: 637/18 and

the SLS specification, for Rice Noodles, no. 858:1989 has been adopted as

the Standard for the said product by gazette extraordinary No 1838/12.

Documents marked as 1R4and 1R5 therefore, prescribe what can

respectively be labelled as Rice or Rice Noodles in the domestic market.

The Respondents aver that the term infers 'Rice' or a

substitute for rice. Therefore, and thereby the Respondents have obtained

Page 6 of 9

a clarification in this regard from the Sinhala Dictionary Compilation

Institute as to the linguistics of the term (IR6). Thus, it is

averred that using the said term to describe the Petitioners product, which

is a Rice Noodle, clearly misleads the public and falls foul of Regulation

Nos. 4 (1), 12 and 13(2) of the Food (Labelling and Advertising) Regulation

2005.

Returning to the primary query on whether the term could be

used to describe the product, in referring to the report compiled by the

Sinhala Dictionary Compilation Institute, the word , in the indigenous

language of paddy culture denotes the idea of rice in the husk which is

obtained after the rice stalks are crushed, or in general terms, paddy.

Although, the use of the term does not directly imply that it

is rice, it still indirectly imputes the idea that it could be substituted for

rice () and it is also similar, though not the same, to the previous trade

name and also in meaning.

The use of the term which denotes a substitution for rice, for a product

which should be classified as rice noodles, is misleading to the public and

creates a false impression. Thus, the Petitioners cannot expect themselves

to be absolved from liability by simply changing the word to another word

which still denotes the same meaning, indirectly.

Thus, there must be a differentiation between the products of noodles and

rice. One cannot liken the two products, through the use of misleading

words, to be the same. The use of imputes the idea that it is

similar to rice whilst in reality there is a clear differentiation between the

two products, may it be visually or even nutritionally as claimed by the

Page 7 of 9

Respondents in the food composition comparative analysis report marked

1R8. One could draw a simple analogy differentiating a lake and a river,

although they both contain the common ingredient of water, in reality, they

are two different bodies of water. Similarly, the mere usage of rice flour in

manufacturing rice noodles cannot render the noodles to be asserted as a

substitute to rice. Thus, I view that and denote the same meaning

in this context, which in turn misleads the purchasers or consumers of

such food.

With due regard to the relevant provisions of the Regulations as well as to

the primary meanings of the words and , I view that the usage of

as the trade name to describe rice noodles, acts in contrary to

Regulation No. 4 (1) b, of the Food (labelling and Advertising) Regulation

2005 which states;

4. (1) The following declarations shall be on the main panel of the

package or container-

(a) common name of the contents, at least in any two of the three

languages in bold face type;

(b) brand or trade name if any, in any one or more of the

three languages in a manner that shall not mislead any

person:

(c) the net contents of the package or container expressed by the

international symbols "g' or *kg' in the case of solids, and "ml' or 'I' in

the case of liquids and, if packaged in liquid medium, the net drained

weight expressed as *g' or *kg"

Regulation No. 12 of the Food (labelling and Advertising) Regulation 2005,

which states;

Page 8 of 9

12. No label or advertisement relating to any food shall contain a

statement or claim thereon that such food has special characteristics

unless approval is granted by the Chief Food Authority.

And further, Regulation No. 13(2) of the Food (labelling and Advertising)

Regulation 2005, which states;

13. (1) No label relating to any article of food shall contain a false

claim or misleading description of such food in such a manner as to

mislead the purchaser or consumer of such food.

(2) No food shall be described or presented in a manner that is false,

misleading or deceptive or is likely to create an erroneous

impression regarding its character in any respect.

(3) For the purpose of this Regulation Claim" means any

representation which states, suggests or implies that a food has

particular qualities relating to its origin, nutritional properties, nature,

processing, compositon or any other quality.

In addressing the contention that the Petitioners have not been granted a

hearing prior to the issuance of the decision in P13 by the 2nd Respondent

Committee, it is a fact that the Petitioners were invited to partake in a

meeting hosted by the Respondent Committee on 27.06.2016 (1R1). They

were thereafter informed that the suggestion for the usage of

will have to be approved at the next Food Advisory Committee meeting.

The decision on the denial of approval for the usage of the term was

subsequently communicated to the Petitioners as per P10. Thereby, the

contention that the Petitioners were unheard is unsound as the Petitioners

Page 9 of 9

were invited for, and partook in, the meeting (1R2) and discussed the

issues pertaining to their usage of the term.

For the foregoing reasons, it is the considered view of this Court that the

Application of the Petitioners is devoid of merits, and therefore, the

Application is liable to be dismissed.

Accordingly, I dismiss the Application without cost.

Application dismissed.
