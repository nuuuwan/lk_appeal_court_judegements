Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Accused) was

i. Section 54A (d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

Possession of 2.60g grams of Heroin (Diacetyl Morphine),

ii. Section 54A (b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

Page 3 of 10

iv. Section 54A (b) of the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

Trafficking of less than 1g of morphine,

The prosecution led evidence of seven witnesses and marked seven documents and

closed the case for the Prosecution. The Accused Appellant made a Statement from the

Dock and closed his case.

After the trial, the Accused was convicted of all 4 counts. For the 1st and 2nd counts,

the Accused was sentenced to Life Imprisonment, and for the 3rd and 4th counts sentence

of 2 years each to run concurrently was imposed. Being aggrieved with the said conviction

and the sentence the Accused had preferred this appeal and submitted the following

grounds of appeal.

a) That the learned trial Judge failed to observe that the inward journey of the

productions was not proved beyond reasonable doubt and in any event, there is

reasonable doubt cast on the production chain emanating from the evidence

adduced before the Court and that the appellant must thereby get the benefit of

the doubt,

b) That the learned trial Judge has failed to consider the contradictions, omissions,

and inconsistencies reflected in the prosecution evidence,

c) That the learned trial Judge misdirected himself on the law relating to burden of

proof and also failed to appreciate that the prosecution failed to establish the case

against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt,

d) That the learned trial Judge failed to appreciate that the evidence led at the trial

was insufficient to rebut the presumption of innocence and the duty of the

prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt,

e) That the learned trial Judge failed to appreciate that the duty of discharging the

burden of proof is on the prosecution,

Page 4 of 10

f) That the learned trial Judge misdirected himself by imposing an unnecessary

burden on the defence in a case of bare denial,

g) That the learned trial Judge erred in law in failing to properly consider and

evaluate the evidence place before him in totality and that convicting the appellant

is explicitly contrary to the law and against the weight of the evidence led in this

case,

h) That the learned trial Judge failed to consider the evidence placed before Court by

the defence in this case,

i) That the learned trial Judge failed to appreciate that the prosecution failed in its

duty to call key witnesses which would deprive the right of appellant to have a fair

trial,

j) That the learned trial Judge failed to consider that the prosecution failed to prove

the offences to trafficking to the requisite standard,

k) That the learned trial Judge failed to appreciate that the prosecution evidence led

by the prosecution contradicted itself and prima facie failed to prove the charges

of possession and trafficking of Morphine,

l) That the conviction and sentence cannot be supported having regard to the

evidence led at the trial,

m) That the conviction and sentence of the appellant who was denied a fair trial

should be set aside.

Before we analyze the evidence of the prosecution, we are mindful of the 3rd and

4th counts related to the possession and trafficking of morphine.

According to the evidence of Sandhya Rajapaksha PW08 Government Analyst

has stated that heroin is made from opium. According to her, Opium is first converted to

morphine and thereafter subjected to acetylene to change to heroin, which is also known

as Diacetyl Morphine.

Due to the time factor, Diacetyl Morphine can turn back into Morphine. (Here 15

months were taken to analyse the production). Therefore, there is a possibility that a

particular production would have been changed into morphine before analyzing the

production. In other words, 74mg of Morphine found by the Government Analyst would

have been reformed from heroin during the said time from the drugs recovered.

Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider this fact and convicted the

Accused for Counts 3 and 4.

Therefore, the conviction and sentence for the 3rd and 4th Count could not be sustained.

The main ground urged by the Counsel for the Accused is that the prosecution had

failed to establish the chain of Custody, a break in the chain of production being sent to

the Government Analyst.

According to the Prosecution, the accused was arrested on the 19th of August 2008

at a checkpoint on the Dehiwala-Wellawatte bridge consequent to being subjected to a

random search. The officers were able to recover the alleged 2.6 grams of Heroin from the

Accused.

According to the prosecution, they found a green shopping bag in his Denim pocket

which contained 9 white shopping bags each of them containing 40 packets of heroin. This

amounts to 360 packets in total.

After arresting the Accused PW01 along with PW02 PC 68801 Saman took him to

the Wellawatte police station and was handed over to PW04 Jayathunga along with the

production.

The productions have been separately marked as PR 84/08 - 87/08. Productions

have been purportedly sealed using PW01 and the Accused signature, but no police seal

has been used.

Page 6 of 10

PW01 and PW02 went back to the STF camp in Kalubowila to sign out from their

duty and came back together to the Wellawatte police around 8:20 am. They have taken

the Accused and the production to the narcotics bureau for the purpose of weighing.

The alleged packets of heroin were emptied into an A4 sheet and weighed 8.15g.

Thereafter he proceeded to Wellawatte police station and entered the production

containing heroin in 88/08 and empty envelopes in 89/08 and handed to the (PW09) PC

20505 Pathiraja.

According to (PW09) Pathiraja, who was on reserve duty between 2 p.m.-9.00 pm

has received production from PW01 and he stated that before him it was (PW04)

Jayathunga who was on reserve duty.

PW09 had handed over the productions to PW10, PC 22659 Kulathunge at 9:50

pm on 19.08.2008. It is pertinent to note that in PW10s evidence all productions namely,

PR 84/08, 85/08, 86/08,87/08,88/08,89/08 have been received by him at 9:50 pm on

19.08.2008.

We note that the prosecution has only asked questions from PW09 about the

production of 88/08 and 89/08. therefore, he has not mentioned the other productions.

According to him, his duty was over in the early morning at 5:50 am. Therefore he

has handed over the production 88 and 89 to PC 8069 Anthony(PW06) at night for as he

was the person who takes the production to the Court. Further, he has stated that he has

given the other production to (PW09) Pathiraja.

According to PC 8069 Anthony PW06, he has received production PR 84/0889/08

from (PW09) Pathiraja, , and handed over the production to the clerk Inoka Uswatte

under case number 2412/2008, he further stated that he has taken the production from

We note that according to (PW10) Kulathunge, he has handed over the production

to (PW06) Anthony. When we peruse the evidence of (PW09) Pathiraja we note that he

Page 9 of 10

has not mentioned handing over production to Anthony or receiving production from

Kulathunga.

According to (PW11) Jinasinghe has stated that there is no name indicating who

received the production from (PW06) Anthony.

Page 222 of the appeal brief;

: .

Also, we note that the person who received the production from (PW06) Anthony

was not called to give evidence. When we analyze the evidence placed before the High

Court Judge there is a discrepancy regarding the chain linking the production.

We are mindful of the observation made by Justice J.A.N De Silva (as he was then)

in Perera v Attorney General 1998 (1) SLR page 379 held that;

it must be recognized principle that in a case of this nature, the prosecution must

prove that the productions had been forwarded to the Analyst from proper custody,

without allowing room for any suspicion that there had been no opportunity for tampering

or interfering with the production till they reach the Analyst. therefore, it is correct to

state that the most important journey is the inwards journey because the final Analyst

report will depend on that. The outward journey does not attract the same importance.

In CA 99-101/96 Decided on 12.11.1997 held that;

We are of the view that the prosecutions has failed to establish the chain linking

the production which were recovered at the detection to the productions which were

forwarded to the Government Analyst. The prosecution has therefore failed to prove its

case beyond reasonable doubt.

In the light of the above decision, in Witharana Doli Nona v. The Republic of Sri

Lanka, CA 19/99, His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew remarked thus;

It is a recognized principle that in drug-related cases the prosecution must prove

the chain relating to the inward journey. The purpose of this principle is to establish that

the productions have not been tampered with. Prosecution must prove that the

productions taken from the accused-appellant was examined by the Government Analyst.

To prove this, the prosecution must prove all the links of the chain (emphasis added) from

Page 10 of 10

time it was taken from the possession of the accused-appellant to the Government

Analyst department.

In Faiza Hanoon Yoosuf v. Attorney General CA/121/002 decided on 22.11.2010 it

was held that;

"In effect the first ground of appeal is that the prosecution failed to establish the

nexus between the Heroin detected and what was produced in Court. In Court, the

prosecution must prove the chain of custody. This must be done by establishing the nexus

between the heroin detected and what was handed over to the Government Analyst for

examination and report. The prosecution must prove that, what was subjected to analysis

is exactly the same substance that was detected in that particular case. In this regard,

the inward journey of the production plays a dominant role and is most significant".

In considering the totality of evidence led in this case, in the light of the said

judicial decisions, we are of the view that the prosecution has to establish beyond

reasonable doubt that there is no break in the inward journey. In the instant case, there

is a discrepancy of evidence, and Inoka who was a clerk who received the production was

not called to give evidence. PW11 could not identify the signature of Inoka. Therefore, the

prosecution had failed to establish the chain of custody with regard to the inward journey

up to the Government Analyst beyond reasonable doubt.

For the above-mentioned reason, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed

on 2019.07.05.

Appeal allowed.
