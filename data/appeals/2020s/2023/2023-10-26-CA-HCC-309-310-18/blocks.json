Hemantha had gone to Terrance Silva Mawatha Dematagoda on 09/12/2010. They had gone to a very small compound by the side of the road which had been built with wooden planks. The said compound had been closed. But they had peeped through a hole on the wall and had seen two people seated on the ground with two candles burning on neither side packeting a powder, therefore they had forced opened the door and had gone inside. They had found on the floor 17 packets of a substance sealed with gum tape and another two packets without tape and another bag which had been left open but containing the same powder. They had also found a pair of scissors, an electronic scale, a spoon and some tape. They had suspected the substance inside the bags to be heroin, therefore the 19 individually wrapped bags and the other single bags had been taken in to",

First, it refers to the corpus or the physical control and the second, it refers to the animus or intent which has reference to exercise of the said control. One of the definitions of possession given in Black's Law dictionary is as follows: \"Having control over a thing with the intent to have and to exercise such control. Oswald v. Weigel [6]. The detention and control or the manual or ideal custody, of anything which may be the subject of property, for one's use and enjoyment either as owner or as the proprietor of a qualified right in it and either held personally or by another who exercises it in one's place and name. Act or state of possessing. That condition of facts under which one can exercise his power over a corporeal thing at his pleasure to the exclusion of all other persons. The law, in general recognizes two kinds of possession: actual possession and constructive possession. A person who knowingly has direct physical control over a thing, at a given time, is then in actual possession of it. A person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has both the power and the intention at given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing, either directly or through another person or persons, is then in constructive possession of it. The law recognizes also that possession may be sale or joint. If one person alone has actual or constructive possession of a thing, possession is sale. If two or more persons share actual or constructive possession of a thing, possession is joint. \"",
