Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner on 12.07.2010, was promoted to the post of Assistant Superintendent of

Police (ASP) with effect from 01.01.2008 and assumed duties immediately. He then

received the letter dated 19.07.2010 cancelling the said promotion. Therefore, the Petitioner

together with other similarly aggrieved officers filed a Fundamental Rights application case

bearing Case No. SCFR/453/2010 (X3). The Supreme Court by its Order dated

21.10.2016 (X4) observed;

However, this Court observes initially all 28 officers whose names are reflected in the

document P6b had been promoted as Assistant Superintendents of Police with effect of

01.01.2008 which was subsequently canceled and re-appointed with effect from the same date.

The National Police Commission should take into consideration the date on which the other

officers were promoted in considering the effective date of granting promotions to the 03

Petitioners, in the instant case.

This Court is of the view that in deciding the effective date of promotions the National Police

Commission should ensure that no prejudice is caused to the Petitioners in deciding the effective

date of the promotions...

However, the National Police Commission (NPC) informed (X6) the Inspector General

of Police that the Petitioners application was rejected whilst the NPC has decided to

antedate the appointment of W. R. A. D. A. K. Ranasinghe, ASP w.e.f. 01.01.2008.

Meantime, the Petitioner was promoted to the post of ASP w.e.f. 13.01.2014 by the 1st

Respondents communication dated 03.03.2016 (X5).

Being aggrieved by the decision of the NPC, the Petitioner preferred an appeal to the 2nd

Respondent, Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) by way of an application bearing

No. AAT/250/2018 (NPC) and the AAT pronounced its Order dated 07.11.2019 (X8)

directing the NPC to antedate the Petitioners promotion to the rank of ASP w.e.f.

01.01.2008. The Petitioner submits that due to typographical errors in the said Order dated

07.11.2019, the AAT by Order dated 17.02.2020 (X9) confirmed the decision contained in

the previous Order. The NPC in compliance with the above orders then directed the 1st

Respondent to antedate the Petitioners promotion (X10) to 01.01.2008. Despite the above,

the Petitioner submits that the 1st Respondent has failed, neglected or refuse to enforce the

AATs Orders and such failure, neglect, refusal or delay is illegal, unreasonable, irrational

and arbitrary.

Thus, the Petitioner seeks a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent, Inspector

General of Police to implement the Orders of the AAT, dated 07.11.2019 (X8) and

17.02.2020 (X9).

When this matter was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner brought

to the attention of this Court the contents of the Respondents motion dated 19.10.2022,

which illustrates that the Attorney General has advised the 1st Respondent to grant the

reliefs sought by the Petitioner in the instant Application. Further, the Respondents have

filed neither a statement of objections nor written submissions.

It is pertinent at this stage to consider whether the reliefs sought by the Petitioner could be

granted without assaying the issues relating to the promotion of the Petitioner.

Sriskandarajah J. in Assembles of God of Ceylon vs. Urban Council, Anuradhapura and another

(2007) 1 Sri. L.R. 89 considering Rule 3(4)(b) and Rule 3(7) of the Court of Appeal

(Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 held;

There is no mandatory requirement in the above rules to file a statement of objections.

Therefore a respondent who fails to file a statement of objection or files an objection not in

compliance with the rules cannot be deprived from appearing and objecting to the application

on grounds of law or to submit on infirmities of the petitioners application.

It is to be noted that the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Respondents (Respondents) were represented

in Court by the Attorney General and however, no objections were raised to the instant

Application on grounds of law. Further, no submissions were made on infirmities of the

Application of the Petitioner. It needs to be stressed that the Statement of Objections of the

Respondents has not been filed not due to a default of such Respondents but by a voluntary

decision which is morefully reflected in the contents of the motion dated 19.10.2022.

The AAT has delivered the Order reflected in X8 on 07.11.2019 whereas the Order X9

being an amendment to the said Order on 17.02.2020. As per the law applicable until the

20th Amendment to the Constitution was certified, any police officer aggrieved by any order

relating to promotion, transfer, or any order on a disciplinary matter or dismissal made by

the NPC in respect of such officer, may appeal therefrom, in terms of Article 155L of the

Constitution, to the AAT established under Article 59 which shall have the power to alter,

vary, rescind or confirm any order or decision made by the NPC. It is now settled law that

the decisions of the AAT can be impugned under Article 140 of the Constitution as it is an

appellate tribunal constituted in terms of the said Article 59(1). However, the jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal under Article 140 would be limited to a review of the decision of the

AAT, and would not extend to quash the decisions of the PSC or AAT.

It is obvious that none of the parties to the matter which was before AAT has taken any

steps to challenge the said decisions marked X8 and X9 of the AAT. Based on such

circumstances, this Court has no option other than granting the reliefs prayed for by the

Page 6 of 6

Petition of the Petitioner. In the circumstances, I proceed to issue a writ of Mandamus as

prayed for in paragraph (b) of the prayer of the Petition of the Petitioner.

Application is allowed.
