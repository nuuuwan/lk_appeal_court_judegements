Decided on: 06.10.2023

JUDGMENT

D.N. Samarakoon, J

The respondents statement of objections dated 27th May 2022 in paragraph 19

draws the attention of the Court to the fastness of the appointment of the

petitioner on 14.09.2018 as the Director General of the Consumer Affairs

Authority. This is accepted in paragraph 05 of the petition dated 21.10.2020. On

14.09.2018 the Minister gave his concurrence under section 52 of the Consumer

Affairs Authority Act No. 09 of 2003. On that day the 01st respondent, the

Chairman of the said Authority informed that to the petitioner. The petitioner

was appointed by letter of appointment dated 23.11.2018, with effect from

14.09.2018.

The same quickness was there, in terminating the services of the petitioner, on

14.02.2020 too. He was informed about the termination by letter dated that day.

It referred to a letter, a copy of which the petitioner was not given, dated

13.02.2020 (previous day) by which the Secretary to the Ministry of Internal

Trade, Food Security and Consumer Welfare informed the 1st respondent, that

the Minister had taken a decision to terminate the services of the petitioner.

[Paragraph 08 of the petition]

The statement of objections does not address paragraph 08 to 13 of the petition.

This is except its 01st paragraph which contains the general denial of all

9 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

paragraphs in the petition. Paragraph 08 refers to petitioners termination. As

already said, neither the petitioner, not the respondents, produced the Ministry

Secretarys letter dated 13.02.2020. But the letter of termination (A.04 of

petitioners documents] dated 14.02.2020 says,

I have been informed by the letter of the Secretary, to the Ministry of

Internal Trade, Food Security and Consumer Welfare dated 13.02.2020

that the Minister has instructed to terminate your services with immediate

effect and to inform him of the same. [English version of Sinhalese

original]

Section 52(1) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act says,

52(1) The Authority may with the approval in writing of the Minister,

appoint a Director General to the Authority

In paragraph 04 of the petition the petitioner states that in 2018 the 11th

respondent, Consumer Affairs Authority fell within the purview of the Ministry

of Industry and Commerce. Paragraph 05 of the petition, as already said, is

regarding his appointment. Paragraph 06 is that he served as the Director

General from 14.09.2018.

Paragraphs 04,05 and 06 above are replied in paragraph 08 of the statement of

objections. However the reply has not accepted what the petitioner averred.

In paragraph 07 of the petition, the petitioner states, that, as a result of the

change of the Cabinet of Ministers in August 2020, the 11th respondent

Consumer Affairs Authority was brought under the Ministry of Internal Trade,

Food Security and Consumer Welfare. The petitioner has attached copies of the

relevant pages of Extra Ordinary Gazette bearing No. 2187/27 dated 09.08.2020.

Paragraph 07 further state that as a result the Consumer Affairs Authority was

brought under the State Minister of Cooperative Services, Marketing

Development and Consumer Protection.

10 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

In paragraph 09 of the statement of objections the respondents only admits the

said Gazette. Copy of the said Gazette marked as A.03 (page 27) shows that

Consumer Affairs Authority was brought under the State Minister of Cooperative

Services, Marketing Development and Consumer Protection.

Paragraphs 08 to 13 of the petition narrates the receiving of the letter of

termination, the fact that there was no reason adduced (as far as the work of the

petitioner is concerned) or a disciplinary inquiry, there was no preliminary

investigation, the letter of appointment specifies Volume II of the Establishments

Code in respect of disciplinary inquiries, the petitioner by his letter dated same

day, i. e., 14.02.2020, requested to know the reasons for termination also

requesting an appointment to meet the Minister, he lodged a complaint to the

Human Rights Commission on 05.03.2020, he wrote to His Excellency the

President on 14.06.2020, he did not receive any response to those letters and

was not granted any opportunity to meet relevant officials and finally by letter

dated 25.09.2020 he requested the respondents to withdraw the letter dated

14.02.2020 to which he received a reply dated 08.10.2020 from an Attorney at

Law acting on the instructions of the 1st respondent, confirming that petitioners

services were terminated.

As already said, there is no response by the respondents to paragraphs 08 to 13

of the petition. The statement of objections answering to paragraph 07 (of the

petition) in paragraph 09 responds to paragraph 14 (of the petition) by paragraph

10. The above paragraphs of the petition have not been specifically addressed in

any other paragraph of statement of objections too except for the general denial

in paragraph 01. But the fact of termination cannot be denied. In fact it is also

the version of the respondents. Hence on pleadings there is no response to

averments in paragraph 08 to 13 of the petition.

The response to the petitioners case by the respondents is found in paragraph

18 of the statement of objections. It says,

11 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

The respondents submit that the purported appointment of the

petitioner to the post of Director General was irregular and unlawful.

However, the respondents state that external compulsions made it

impossible to object to the appointment of the petitioner. However, no

sooner the circumstances changed, immediate steps were taken to redress

the irregularity by removing the petitioner from a post he had no right and

had no qualification and experience, to hold.

In paragraph 08 of the Statement of Objections, by which the respondents

responded to paragraph 05 of the petition [which averred the appointment of the

petitioner as Director General] too, it has been stated that the petitioners

appointment was irregular, improper and illegal and no validity in the eyes of the

law.

Yet, the Consumer Affairs Authority, the 11th respondent, acting through its

officials appointed the petitioner as the Director General with effect from

14.09.2018. They found it impossible to object to it, despite their averment now

that the petitioner possessed no qualification or experience for same, according

to their own words, due to external compulsions.

Averring in paragraphs 36 to 38 of the Written Submissions of the petitioner filed

after the argument, it is submitted, that, submissions were made on behalf of

the respondents inviting this Court to read in between lines.

If there was such a request, I do not think it could be acceded to, because, a

Court has to decide on pleadings, documents and submissions. What the

respondents say, in a nutshell, is that,

(i) They appointed the petitioner

(ii) The petitioner did not have required qualifications

(iii) Still they could not objected to the appointment

(iv) They removed the petitioner when the circumstances changed

What this Court can and should do is to find the law, as decided in several

authoritative cases, to find out, as to what should be done in such

circumstances.

In Ratnesh Kumar Choudhary vs Indira Gandhi Inst. Of M.S. Patna1 & ... on

15 October, 2015, the Supreme Court of India, (Dipak Misra, (later Chief

Justice) Prafulla C. Pant JJ.) in a judgment written by Dipak Misra J.,

considered the situation of the petitioner who applied for a post of

Physiotherapist but was recruited as a Chest Therapist, on the wrong basis that

the post of Physiotherapist and Chest Therapist are of similar nature and hence,

the post of Chest Therapist may be considered from the applications received for

the post of Physiotherapist.

When the appellant was continuing on the post of Chest Therapist, a

complaint was received by the Vigilance Department, Government of Bihar

on 03.11.2004 relating to the illegal appointment of the appellant on the

post of Chest Therapist. The complaint contained that the advertisement

for Physiotherapist and Chest Therapist were different because streams

are different and the appointment of the appellant was absolutely illegal.

Taking exception to the aforesaid order of termination the appellant

invoked the writ jurisdiction of the High Court of Judicature at Patna in

CWJC No. 8069 of 2006. The learned Single Judge vide order dated

04.11.2009 quashed the order of termination and directed that appellant

should be treated in service with all consequential benefits.

Being dissatisfied with the order of the learned Single Judge, the Institute

and its Board of Governors preferred LPA No. 38 of 2010, to the Division

Bench.

13 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

the Division Bench allowed the appeal and unsettled the decision

rendered by the learned Single Judge.

In the case under consideration, the appellant, employee came before the

Supreme Court of India.

Though various contentions were raised by the learned counsel for both

the parties, yet ultimately the controversy centered around the issues

whether the order of termination passed by the authority is stigmatic or

not; and whether there had been violation of principles of natural justice,

for no regular enquiry was conducted.

The Supreme Court said,

It is submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that on a perusal

of the report along with allegations made in the counter affidavit, it is

graphically clear that the termination of the appellant is not a termination

simpliciter. The report comments on his behaviour, knowledge of working,

his conduct, his mis-behaviour, imposition of earlier punishment and

disobedience shown by him to his seniors. It is urged by the learned

counsel that though the appellant was a probationer and his appointment

has been styled as illegal on the ground that he did not possess the

requisite qualification for the post of Chest Therapist, yet under the guise

of passing an order of termination simpliciter, the authorities have, in

many a way, attached stigma which makes the order absolutely stigmatic.

It is canvassed by him that even if the order demonstrably appears to be

an innocuous order, the court in the in the obtaining factual score should

lift the veil or peep through the veil to perceive its true character.

It must be observed, that, in the case at hand, according to the statement of

objections of 15 respondents, there were no allegations of behaviour, knowledge

of working, conduct or mis behaviour of the petitioner. But in Choudharys case

14 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

there were such allegations too, though, the reason for his sudden termination

was the irregularity or illegality of his appointment.

The Supreme Court then considered several decided cases about temporary

servants and probationers, which need not be considered here as the petitioner

was not a probationer. In fact and in law, that is, one distinction between that

case and the case at hand. The Supreme Court finally said,

In the case at hand, it is clear as crystal that on the basis of a complaint

made by a member of the Legislative Assembly, an enquiry was directed to

be held. It has been innocuously stated that the complaint was relating to

illegal selection on the ground that the appellant did not possess the

requisite qualification and was appointed to the post of Chest Therapist.

The report that was submitted by the Cabinet (Vigilance) Department

eloquently states about the conduct and character of the appellant. The

stand taken in the counter affidavit indicates about the behaviour of the

appellant. It is also noticeable that the authorities after issuing the notice

to show cause and obtaining a reply from the delinquent employee did not

supply the documents. Be that as it may, no regular enquiry was held and

he was visited with the punishment of dismissal. It is well settled in law,

if an ex parte enquiry is held behind the back of the delinquent employee

and there are stigmatic remarks that would constitute foundation and not

the motive. Therefore, when the enquiry commenced and thereafter

without framing of charges or without holding an enquiry the delinquent

employee was dismissed, definitely, there is clear violation of principles of

natural justice. It cannot be equated with a situation of dropping of the

disciplinary proceedings and passing an order of termination simpliciter.

In that event it would have been motive and could not have travelled to the

realm of the foundation. We may hasten to add that had the appellant

would have been visited with minor punishment, the matter possibly

would have been totally different. That is not the case. It is also not the

15 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

case that he was terminated solely on the ground of earlier punishment.

In fact, he continued in service thereafter. As the report would reflect that

there are many an allegation subsequent to the imposition of punishment

relating to his conduct, misbehaviour and disobedience. The Vigilance

Department, in fact, had conducted an enquiry behind the back of the

appellant. The stigma has been cast in view of the report received by the

Central Vigilance Commission which was ex parte and when that was put

to the delinquent employee, holding of a regular enquiry was imperative.

It was not an enquiry only to find out that he did not possess the requisite

qualification. Had that been so, the matter would have been altogether

different. The allegations in the report of the Vigilance Department pertain

to his misbehaviour, conduct and his dealing with the officers and the

same also gets accentuated by the stand taken in the counter affidavit.

Thus, by no stretch of imagination it can be accepted that it is

termination simpliciter. The Division Bench has expressed the view that

no departmental enquiry was required to be held as it was only an enquiry

to find out the necessary qualification for the post of Chest Therapist. Had

the factual score been so, the said analysis would have been treated as

correct, but unfortunately the exposition of factual matrix is absolutely

different. Under such circumstances, it is extremely difficult to concur

with the view expressed by the Division Bench.

The last said thing about the non essentiality of a departmental inquiry if the

qualifications were the only question will not arise in this case since the

petitioner is not a probationer.

The Supreme Court concluded,

Consequently, the appeal is allowed and the judgment and order passed

by the Division Bench of the High Court is set aside and that of the learned

Single Judge is upheld, though on different grounds. Accordingly, it is

directed that the appellant be reinstated in service within a period of six

16 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

weeks and he shall be entitled to 50% towards his salary which shall be

paid to him within the said period. In the facts and circumstances, there

shall be no order as to costs.

The Supreme Court of India in H. L. Trehan and others Etc., vs. Union of India

and others on 22nd November 1988 (M. M. Dutt, S. Natarajan and N. D. Ojha

JJ., written by Dutt J.) considered the applicability of the rule audi alteram

partem in a case where a decision is taken to the detriment of employees.

The Chairman of the Board of Directors of CORIL issued the impugned

circular dated March 8, 1978, inter alia, stating therein that consequent

upon the take over of the Caltex (India) Ltd. by the Government, the

question of rationalisation of the perquisites and allowances admissible to

Management Staff had been under consideration of the Board for

sometime, and that as an interim measure, the Board had decided that

the perquisites admissible to the Management Staff should be rationalised

in the manner stated in the said circular

Besides the above contentions, another contention was advanced on

behalf of the respondents Nos. 1 and 4, namely, that the employees not

having been given an opportunity of being heard before altering to their

prejudice the terms and conditions of service, the impugned circular

should be struck down as void being opposed to the principles of natural

justice

All the contentions except the last contention of the respondents Nos. 1

to 4 were rejected by the High Court. The High Court, however, took the

view that as no opportunity was given to the employees of CORIL

before the impugned circular was issued, the Board of Directors of

CORIL acted illegally and in violation of the principles of natural

justice

17 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

It is now well established principle of law that there can be no

deprivation or curtailment of any existing right, advantage or benefit

enjoyed by a Government servant without complying with the rules of

natural justice by giving the Government servant concerned an

opportunity of being heard. Any arbitrary or whimsical exercise of power

prejudicially affecting the existing conditions of service of a Government

servant will offend against the provision of Article of the Constitution

Admittedly, the employees of CORIL were not given an opportunity of

hearing or representing their case before the impugned circular was issued

by the Board of Directors. The impugned circular was therefore, be

sustained as it Offends against the rules of natural justice.

In D.K. Yadav vs J.M.A. Industries Ltd on 7 May, 1993, the Supreme Court

of India comprised of K. Ramaswamy J., Kuldip Singh J. and V. Ramaswamy J.,

(written by K. Ramaswamy J) where an employees services were terminated for

violating a regulation being absent for eight days, the Court said,

The law must therefore be now taken to be well-settled that procedure

prescribed for depriving a person of livelihood must meet the challenge

of Art. 14.

and such law would be liable to be tested on the anvil of Art. 14 and the

procedure prescribed by a statute or statutory rule or rules or orders

effecting the civil rights or result in civil consequences would have to

answer the requirement of Art. 14. So it must be right,just and fair and

not arbitrary, fanciful or oppressive. There can be no distinction between

a quasi-judicial function and an administrative function for the purpose

of principles of natural justice. The aim of both administrative inquiry as

well as the quasi-.judicial enquiry is to arrive at a just decision and if a

rule of natural justice is calculated to secure justice or to put it negatively,

to prevent miscarriage of justice, it is difficult to see why it should be

applicable only to quasi-judicial enquiry and not to administrative enquiry.

18 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

It must logically apply to both. Therefore, fair play in action requires that

the procedure adopted must be just, fair and reasonable. The manner of

exercise of the power and its impact on the rights of the person affected

would be in conformity with the principles of natural justice. Art. 21 clubs

life with liberty, dignity of person with means of livelihood without which

the glorious content of dignity of person would be reduced to animal

existence. When it is interpreted that the colour and content of procedure

established by law must be in conformity with the minimum fairness and

processual justice, it would relieve legislative callousness despising

opportunity of being heard and fair opportunities of defence. Art. 14 has a

pervasive processual potency and versatile quality, equalitarian in its soul

and allergic to discriminatory dictates. Equality is the antithesis of

arbitrariness. It is, thereby, conclusively held by this Court that the

principles of natural justice are part of Art. 14 and the procedure

prescribed by law must be just, fair and reasonable.

Article 14 of the Indian Constitution appears in the Sub Chapter Right to

Equality. Its side note says Equality before law. It says,

The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the

equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.

The said Article is similar in import to Article 12 of the Sri Lankan Constitution

which says,

12. (1) All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal

protection of the law.

Its side note too, like in the Indian Codes sub chapter heading, is Right to

Equality.

Therefore what was said in the case of D. K. Yadev vs. J. M. S. Industries is

applicable in Sri Lankan setting too.

The Indian Supreme Court further said,

In Delhi Transport Corpn. v. D. T. C. Mazdoor Congress and Ors, [1991]

Suppl. 1 SCC 600 this court held that right to public employment and its

concomitant right to livelihood received protective umbrella under the

canopy of Arts. 14 and 21 etc. All matters relating to employment includes

the right to continue in service till the employee reaches superannuation

or until his service is duly terminated in accordance with just fair and

reasonable procedure prescribed under the provisions of the constitution

and the rules made under the provisions of the constitution and the rules

made under proviso to Art. 309 of the Constitution or the statutory

provisions or the rules, regulations or instructions having statutory

flavour. They must be conformable to the rights guaranteed in Part III and

IV of the Constitution. Art. 21 guarantees right to life which includes right

to livelihood, the deprivation thereof must be in accordance with just and

fair procedure prescribed by law conformable to Arts. 14 and 21 so as to

be just, fair and reasonable and not fanciful, oppressive or at vagary. The

principles of natural justice is an integral part of the Guarantee of equality

assured by Art. 14. Any law made or action taken by an employer must be

fair,just and reasonable. The power to terminate the service of an

employee/workman in accordance with just, fair and reasonable

procedure is an essential inbuilt of' natural justice. Arts. 14 strikes at

arbitrary action. It is not the form of the action but the substance of the

order that is to be looked into. It is open to the court to lift the veil and

gauge the effect of the impugned action to find whether it is the foundation

to impose punishment or is only a motive. Fair play is to secure justice,

procedural as well as substantive. The substance of the order is the soul

and the affect thereof is the end result.

In Sriyani Silva v. Iddamalgoda, Officer-in-Charge, Police Station Paiyagala

and Others [2003] 2 Sri LR 6 at page 76 - 77, it was held that

20 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

Article 11 (read with Article 13(4)), recognises a right not to deprive life

whether by way of punishment or otherwise and by necessary implication,

recognises a right to life. That right must be interpreted broadly, and the

jurisdiction conferred by the Constitution on this Court for the sole

purpose of protecting fundamental rights against executive action must be

deemed to have conferred all that is reasonably necessary for this Court

to protect those rights effectively.

Hence in that case the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka recognized an implied

(unenumerated) right to life, which is there in Article 21 of Indian Constitution.

This was followed in Rathnayake Tharanga Lakmali v Niroshan Abeykoon,

SCFR 577/2010.

The Preamble to the Constitution further says,

and assuring to all Peoples FREEDOM, EQUALITY, JUSTICE,

FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS

Therefore there must be freedom from arbitrary action which is the very

basis of natural justice.

In D. K. Yadev vs. J. M. S. Industries, the Indian Supreme Court concluded,

It is thus well settled law that right to life enshrined under Art. 21 of the

Constitution would include right to livelihood. The order of termination of

the service of an employee/workman visits with civil consequences of

jeopardising not only his/her livelihood but also career and livelihood of

dependents. Therefore, before taking any action putting an end to the

tenure of an employee/workman fair play requires that a reasonable

opportunity to put forth his case is given and domestic enquiry conducted

complying with the principles of natural justice. In D. 7. C. v. D. T.C.

Mazdoor Congress and Ors. (supra) the constitution bench, per majority,

held that termination of the service of a workman giving one month's notice

or pay in lieu thereof without enquiry offended Art. 14. The order

21 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

terminating the service of the employees was set aside. In this case

admittedly no opportunity was given to the appellant and no enquiry was

held. The appellant's plea put forth at the earliest was that despite his

reporting to duty on December 3, 1980 and on all subsequent days and

readiness to join duty he was prevented to report to duty, nor he be

permitted to sign the attendance register. The Tribunal did not record any

conclusive finding in this behalf. It concluded that the management had

power under Cl. 13 of the certified Standing Orders to terminate with the

service of the appellant. Therefore, we hold that the principles of natural

justice must be read into the standing order No. 13 (2) (iv). Otherwise it

would become arbitrary unjust and unfair violating Arts. 14. When so read

the impugned action is violative of the principles of natural justice. This

conclusion leads us to the question as to what relief the appellant is

entitled to. The management did not conduct any domestic enquiry nor

given the appellant any opportunity to put forth his case. Equally the

appellant is to blame himself for the impugned action. Under those

circumstances 50 per cent of the back wages would meet the ends of

justice. The appeal is accordingly allowed. The award of the Labour Court

is set aside and the letter dated December 12, 1980 of the management is

quashed. There shall be a direction to the respondent to reinstate the

appellant forthwith and pay him back wages within a period of three

months from the date of the receipt of this order. The appeal is allowed

accordingly. The parties would bear their own costs.

The petitioners Written Submissions allege that respondents have sought to

resile from the document marked A.04. It is also submitted, that, no logical or

lawful reasoning could have been forward by the respondents to justify the

reasons for termination as contained in document marked A.04. There is truth

in this proposition, because, the stance of the respondents is to attack the

appointment of the petitioner, not to justify his termination.

22 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

In this regard, i.e., the absence of justification of A.04 except for attacking the

appointment made by the respondents themselves (and allowed the petitioner to

hold it for about 515 days, that is, from 14.09.2018 to 13.02.2020) the petitioner

cites the case of Sooriyapperuma Arachchilage Amarasiri Sooriyapperuma vs.

Registrar General and others C. A. Writ 81/2020, where the Court has quoted

the following from Fernando J., in Jayawardena,

Respect of the Rule of Law requires the observance of minimum

standards of openness, fairness and accountability in administration; and

this means in relation to appointments to and removal from offices

involving powers, functions and duties which are public in nature that

the process of making a decision should not be shrouded in secrecy and

that there should be no obscurity as to what the decision is and who is

responsible for making it.

The petitioner also cites the case of R (Nadezda Anufrijeva) vs. Secretary of

State for Home Department [2004] 1 A. C. 604, where Lord Steyn has said, In

our system of law surprise is regarded as the enemy of justice. Fairness is the

guiding principle of our public law.

This Court has considered the judgment of the Indian Supreme court in Union

Of India vs Raghuwar Pal Singh on 13 March, 2018, where the question was,

that,

The central questions posed in this appeal are: (i) whether the appointment of the

respondent to the post of Veterinary Compounder, made by the Director Incharge at

the relevant point of time without approval of the Competent Authority, was a nullity

or a mere irregularity, which could be glossed over by the department to avert

disruption of his services and; (ii) in any case, whether his services could be disrupted

without giving him an opportunity of hearing

23 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

and the decision was that his services could be terminated without being heard,

because, in that case it was clear that the appointment was void ab initio, for

the approval of the Competent Authority was not there.

But in the present case, section 52 of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act

provides that, The Authority may with the approval in writing of the Minister,

appoint a Director General to the Authority and on 14.09.2018 the petitioners

appointment had the approval of the then Minister. Therefore, the appointment

is not void. If the petitioner did not have required qualification it could be

voidable. But unless a Competent Court makes it void it is valid and the Act

nowhere confers power to the Minister to summarily terminate services of the

petitioner. Furthermore as per R.1 one of the required qualifications is a

Bachelors degree in Management and although the respondents, who

themselves appointed the petitioner in 2018 now denies, he has a Master of

Business Administration from University of Wolverhampton, United Kingdom

and BA (Hons) in Business Management from Middlesex University, London. In

any event as his appointment was duly made under section 52 it is not void and

cannot be terminated without being heard. The action of the respondents on

13.02.2020 is ultra vires the Act. For the same reason, this court is not in

agreement with the judgment of C. A. Writ 100/2020 dated 07.06.2023 of

another division of this court, in which there is no consideration of the above

Indian cases also.

The above authorities and Constitutional Provisions show, that, when a person

is appointed to a post in accordance with the applicable provisions of a statute,

he cannot be terminated, upon a procedure not provided by the statute, without

being heard and if so terminated the rules of natural justice and fairness

demands that the decision be set aside.

Therefore this Court grants writs of certiorari,

(i) Quashing the purported underlying decision contained in A.04,

(prayer ii)

24 | W r i t 4 1 3 2 0 2 0 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e S a s i M a h e n d r a n 0 6 t h O c t o b e r 2 0 2 3

(ii) Quashing the letter of the Secretary to the Ministry of Internal Trade,

Food Security and Consumer Welfare dated 13.02.2020, referred to in

A.04, (prayer iii)

(iii) Quashing the purported decision said to have been taken by the

Minister of Internal Trade, Food Security and Consumer Welfare

referred to in A.04, (prayer iv) and

(iv) Quashing the purported decision said to have been taken by the 01st to

11th respondents or any one or more of them terminating the services

of the petitioner (prayer v)

Considering paragraph 72 of the Written Submissions of the petitioner, this

Court instead of issuing a writ of mandamus as per paragraph (vi) of the prayer,

acting under the same prayer directs that the petitioner be paid 50% of back

wages and allowances due to the post he held from 14.02.2020 up to the date of

this judgment.

The petitioner is entitled to the costs of this application.
