Argued on: 23.09.2022, 14.07.2023

Written submissions: Petitioners - 08.09.2023 and 15.11.2023

1st Respondent - 04.10.2023

Decided on: 21.11.2023

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner states that the original owners of the subject land called YakiriyaPellessa''

alias WeerawilaWatte in extent of (A101-R2-P27) (101 acres 2 roods 21 perches) were

Gajasinghege Stephen De Silva and Gajasinghege Charles Edward De Silva (both now

deceased). The said Gajasinghege Charles Edward De Silva has made a declaration under the

Land Reform Law No.1 of 1972, that he was a statutory lessee who co-owned the above

agricultural land to an extent of A59-R3-P38 of which A9-R3-P38 was more than the

Page 4 of 8

stipulated ceiling under the Land Reform Law. Gajasinghege Stephen De Silva, who is the

other co-owner, was entitled to A33-R3-P34, which was 1/3rd of the said total extent of A101-

R2-P27.

The Petitioners are allegedly the heirs of their father- Gajasinghege Stephen De Silva.

Moreover, the Petition discloses that the 1st, 3rd, 4th and the 5th Petitioners are the children of

the said Stephen De Silva and the current 2nd Petitioner is the wife of another child of the

same family. The claim of the Petitioners in the instant Application is based on the rights of

the said deceased Gajasinghege Stephen De Silva and accordingly the Petitioners contend

that the said Land Reform Law does not govern the co-owned portion of the land in the extent

of A33-R3-P34.

In regards to the above statutory declaration of Gajasinghege Charles Edward De Silva, the

Land Reform Commission (LRC) released to him the land in extent of A50 (depicted in

FVP 621 -Sheet No.1- marked Lot 41) by Gazette No.163/15 dated 16.05.1957. The LRC

held the remaining portion of the declared land in the extent of A9-R3-P38 (Lot 42 in FVP

621 -Sheet No.1). The issues relating to the instant Application emanates as a result of the

LRC taking over possession of the entirety of the above named, co-owned land in the extent

of A101-R2-P27 on the pretext of identifying the vested area of land and releasing the balance.

There is no dispute that the share of the said Gajasinghege Stephen De Silva has not been

vested under Land Reform Law. Anyhow, there has been a delay in the LRC returning the

said portion of the land to the said Stephen De Silva notwithstanding repeated representations

and requests made by one or more of the Petitioners and their mother. The Petitioners assert

that the LRC has repeatedly assured that the relevant portion of land or an alternative block

would be released. Similarly, the Petitioners allege that the LRC has taken steps wrongfully

to hand over the possession of certain portions of the said land, that is not vested in the LRC,

to third parties. It is noteworthy that the Petitioners at a subsequent stage have agreed to get

the disputes with LRC amicably resolved by taking over the remaining portions of the

aforementioned main land and substituting alternate land for the portions that were

previously granted to third parties.

In proof of such continuous representations made to the LRC, the letters marked

X7,X8,X9,X10,X11 and X12 are annexed to the Petition. Referring to the letters

marked X13,X14,X15, X16 and X17, the Petitioners assert that the LRC has

acknowledged the gaining of the possession of the portions of land upon which the Petitioners

raise their claims that stem from the rights of the said deceased Gajasinghege Stephen De

Silva. Additionally, the Petitioners have annexed letters marked X18 to X31 in which the

correspondence between the relevant authorities and the Petitioners are well reflected. The

steps taken by the Petitioners to make further representations to the Chairman and other

officers of the LRC to resolve the issues amicably are also viewed through such

communications.

The Petitioners further contend that the LRC as a consequence of the aforesaid

correspondence has finally conceded to the Petitioners' entitlement limiting it to a portion of

land in extent of A17-R3-P23. It is submitted that the LRC has limited the extent as above

based on two transfer deeds bearing No.636 and No.637 attested on 22.02.1981 by

A.Kakulawala Notary Public. Anyhow, the Petitioners state that the title has never passed

due to the said transfer deeds, since the respective transferees had been paid due consideration

upon their loss of rights to same/surrendering or the said deeds and disclaiming all

rights/title. Likewise, the Petitioners claim that they are entitled to a portion of land in a

minimum extent of A17-R3-P23.

Now I must examine the aforesaid correspondence annexed to the Petition of the Petitioner.

The letters marked X7, X15, X16 and X18 display that the process of contemplating the

Petitioners request has commenced during the year 1985. The Director-Land Ceiling of LRC

by a letter marked X18 (06.02.1987) has expressed his opinion that the undeclared portion

of land belonging to the said Stephen De Silva should be released. The X19 and X20 also

reflect an attempt of the LRC to find an alternate land. The Director-Land Ceiling, even in

the year 2005 by his letter marked X25 (dated 17.06.2005) has recognized the entitlement of

the said Stephen De Silva for a portion of land in extent of A33-R3-P22 within the land called

WeerawilaWatte.

The Chairman of LRC after an inquiry, emphasized by a letter dated 08.08.2005 marked

X26 that the said Stephen De Silva is entitled to a portion of land in the extent of A33-R3-

Page 6 of 8

P22 in Lot No.09 of WeerawilaWatte. Thereafter on 06.04 2006 (X27), a different

Chairman who was serving during that time reiterated the above entitlement of Stephen De

Silva.

The Working Director of the LRC by a letter dated 19.06.2019 (X17) identifying the

entitlement of the Petitioners has divulged that the demarcating boundaries of an alternate

land in extent of A17-R3-P23 were under progress. The name of the land identified therein

was WadigalaLebeema situated in the District of Hambantota. He has further given an

assurance in the said letter that the request of the 2nd Petitioner can be complied with soon

after the completion of making relevant plans. The letter marked "X31" (dated 19.07.2019) is

one of several similar ones conveying an assurance that Stephen De Silva's undeclared portion

of land will be restored. However, it differs in its description of the extent of such land

depicting a similar extent as mentioned in X17. In the said X31 the Working Director of

LRC, while admitting the entitlement of Stephen De Silva has requested the Director in

Hambantota to consider the possibility of allocating a portion of land in extent of A17-R3-

P23 from the land called WeerawilaWatte.

It appears that the Petitioners also have now limited their claim for a portion of land to the

extent of A17-R3-P23 for reasons not very clear to the Court. Nevertheless, the Petitioners at

one instance have divulged that they were compelled to accept a lesser portion of land without

striving for the total extent due to the reason of LRC transferring several blocks of

WeerawilaWatte to third parties. Considering the facts and circumstances of this case, the

Petitioners rights should not be prejudiced based on the fact that the Petitioners seek a lesser

portion than the original amount upon which they have been agitating for a long time. An

overall consideration of all communications originating from the relevant officers of the LRC

establishes the entitlement of Stephen De Silva in respect of his undeclared portion of land

which has been unduly taken over by the LRC along with the land declared by Gajasinghege

Charles Edward De Silva in 1972.

It is observed that the LRC does not expressly deny any of those communications which

includes both the representation of the Petitioners and the assurances extended by the LRC.

Instead, when answering the relevant averments of the Petition, the LRC in its statement of

objections have used the phrase- correspondence referred to in the Petition may have been written

Page 7 of 8

by the officers of LRC. The stance taken by the LRC in respect of such correspondence is that

those letters have originated without arriving at a valid decision as envisaged in section 44

and other provisions in Land Reform Law. I take the view that such a defense raised by the

LRC is insufficient justification to overrule the conclusions represented in the letters the LRC

exchanged with the parties for more than three decades. A careful consideration of the

contents of those communications annexed to the Petition clearly implies that nowhere in the

chain of such communications do the authorities of the LRC express their doubt or raise

questions on the above-explained entitlement of Stephen De Silva. This position emphatically

establishes the entitlement of the said Stephen De Silva and the legitimate expectations of his

heirs in respect of the aforesaid land which does not come within a statutory declaration under

the Land Reform Law.

His Lordship Justice Yasantha Kodagoda (P.C., J.) with the concurrence of their Lordships

Justice E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, and Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz, in the case of Vavuniya Solar

Power (Private) Limited v. Ceylon Electricity Board and Others SC/FR/172/2017 decided on

20.09.2023 echoed the principles in detail relating to the doctrine of legitimate expectations

and gave an extensive thought to the representations made to the authorities by the members

of the public and vice versa. The principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in the said case

in respect of 'legitimate expectations' can be directly applied to the instant Application in

resolving the related questions. His Lordship Justice Kodagoda in this case observed:

The doctrine of public trust inter-alia requires that public authorities who have been vested with

statutorily conferred power to discharge public functions vested in them for the benefit of the

sovereign of the Republic the public at large, and for no other purpose. Public authorities must

discharge such functions in accordance with the law and they must abide by the expectations

generated by their own representations and practices. In a Republic, the trust conferred by the

sovereign public on public authorities must be respected, unless there are justiciable reasons

developed objectively, diligently and in good faith for the purpose of giving effect to wider public

interests, that necessitate deviating from the previous policy based upon which the previous

representations had been made.

The rationale of the doctrine of legitimate expectations is also that if a public authority has

induced a person to rely upon its representations or practices on the premise that such reliance

Page 8 of 8

was a real possibility and would bear fruit, it is under a fiduciary duty to act in such a way that

the reliance placed by such person will not result in detrimental outcomes to such person, who in

good faith had placed reliance on the representations of a public authority and its practices. Public

authorities must be required by law to honour expectations created by its own representations and

practice. If unable to do so, the public authority concerned should compensate the person affected

by having placed reliance on such representations and practices.

Apart from the legitimate expectation of the Petitioners, no substantial material has been

submitted for this Court to declare that the original rights of the said Stephen De Silva are

unlawful. It cannot be assumed under the Land Reform Law that the LRC has the authority

to take over possession of a larger portion of land for the mere purpose of identifying a lesser

portion that is depicted in a statutory declaration. Moreover, in line with the precedent laid

down by the superior courts, I am not convinced with the proposition of the LRC that the

Petitioners are not entitled to a writ of Mandamus. Further, the representations and the

practice of the LRC emanated through the communications discussed above outweigh the

technical objection raised by the LRC referring to the locus standi of the Petitioners.

In light of my above findings, I take the view that a mandate in the nature of a writ of

Mandamus should be issued directing the Land Reform Commission to release a portion of

land with a minimum extent of A17-R3-P23 from and out of the land described in the 2nd

Schedule to the Petition or an alternate land with the same extent to the legitimate heirs of

Gajasinghege Stephen De Silva without adopting a tedious process that may cause an

additional inconvenience to the Petitioners. However, I am not inclined to issue a quashing

order as prayed for in paragraph c in the prayer of the Petition.
