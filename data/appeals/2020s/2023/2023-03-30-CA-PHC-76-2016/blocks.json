In the said case his lordship went on to state that: the magistrate cannot call for any evidence from the Competent authority in support of the application under section 5, which means the Magistrate cannot call for any evidence from the competent authority to prove that the land described in the schedule to the application is State land. Therefore, the petitioner did not have an opportunity of raising the question whether the land is a state land or private land before the magistrates (page 245).",

In such a situation, the learned Magistrate cannot question the legality or reasonableness of such opinion, nor can the learned Magistrate consider the title of the person who is sought to be ejected. As stated earlier, the scope of the inquiry before the Magistrate's Court is circumscribed by the provisions of Section 9, so that the learned Magistrate can only inquire from the respondent, as to whether he has a valid permit or written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law and if so, whether such permit or authority is in force. If the respondent cannot say 'yes' to both, the learned Magistrate does not have any choice, and is required to issue the order for ejectment. This is the strict legal regime put in place by the Act, which has been referred to in Divisional Secretary Kalutara and another vs Kalupahana Mestrige Jayatissa.",
