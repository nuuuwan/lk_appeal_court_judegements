This is an application by the registered owner claimant-petitioner-petitioner

(hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) invoking the revisionary jurisdiction

granted to this Court by Article 138 of The Constitution.

The petitioner is seeking to challenge and set aside the order dated 16-12-2022

pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle in the Revision

Application Number REV/6052/2020 filed before the Provincial High Court of

Page 4 of 12

the Sabaragamuwa Province Holden in Kegalle, where the application by the

petitioner was dismissed.

The petitioner is also seeking to get the order dated 28-09-2020 pronounced by

the learned Magistrate of Warakapola set aside, wherein, the vehicle belonging

to the petitioner was ordered to be confiscated.

The petitioner is the registered owner of the vehicle bearing registration number

224-4461, which is a vehicle categorized as a boom truck.

One Gamaralalage Chamara Jayaruwan Bandara was charged before the

Magistrates Court of Warakapola for having transported six Mahogany logs

valued at Rs. 22026.69 without a valid permit in the above-mentioned truck,

and thereby committing an offence punishable under section 25(a) read with

section 40(a) of the Forest Ordinance as amended.

The accused had pleaded guilty to the charge and had been sentenced.

Thereafter, the learned Magistrate of Warakapola has permitted the registered

owner of the vehicle, namely the petitioner, to show cause as to why the said

vehicle should not be confiscated.

At the inquiry held in that regard, the registered owner has given evidence and

has stated that she purchased this vehicle in December 2016 by partly financing

it with a finance company. She has engaged this boom truck, primarily for

transportation of concrete rings and other concrete products to various places

for hire. In addition, the vehicle also has been used for transporting machines

belonging to MAS factory when needed, for necessary repairs to their Panadura

repairing facility.

She has stated that she had been paying the lease rental out of the money earned

by using the vehicle for hiring purposes, and she used to engage the services of

the accused since 2019 on daily wage basis if and when his services are required.

It has been her evidence that the vehicle was used not on a regular basis but

only when required.

Page 5 of 12

On 09-02-2020, the driver has informed of a necessary engine repair to the

vehicle, and with her consent he has taken the vehicle to a place called

Oththapitiya Motors in Thulhiriya area. She has paid Rs. 3000/- for the repairs

and had produced the relevant receipt marked as E-3. After bringing the vehicle

back, it has been taken again to a place called Lal Motors situated near the

Tholangamuwa School for further repairs and it had been at the Lal Motors for

two days. The petitioner has paid Rs. 22500/- as repairing fees to Lal Motors,

the receipt which had been produced marked as E-4.

According to her evidence, the Lal Motors had called the petitioner around 4.00

pm on 11-02-2020 and had informed that the repair has been completed. She

has then called her driver and asked him to go to the said Lal Motors and bring

the vehicle back to her home. Since the vehicle has not returned until 6.30

7.00 in the evening, she has called the driver and had been informed that the

vehicle is in police custody. Since it was nighttime, the petitioner has informed

her brother to look into the matter and has come to know that the vehicle has

been taken into police custody for transporting some timber.

It has been her position that she used to be vigilant about her vehicle and used

to call frequently when the vehicle is taken out on hires and the vehicle had never

been subjected to an offence like this previously. Stating that this is her only way

of earning a living, she has sought the release of the vehicle to her.

Although the prosecution has suggested that she was not telling the truth, she

has been consistent with her stand that it was not so, and the vehicle was not

used for transporting logs but only for transporting concrete products. She has

stated that when asked from the driver, he informed that the logs were loaded in

a place called Mahapallegama, which was about 12 kilometers away from

Tholangamuwa.

While the registered owner being cross-examined, the learned Magistrate has

inquired as to the time of arrest. According to police entries, time of arrest had

been at 20.00 hours, which is 8.00 pm in the night.

Page 6 of 12

Pronouncing his order, the learned Magistrate had concluded that the registered

owner might not have had the knowledge of this offence being committed by the

driver. The relevant portion of the order reads as follows.

" 4.00 6.30-7.00

.

.

.

.

."

After having determined as above, the learned Magistrate has proceeded to

confiscate the vehicle on the basis that the evidence of the petitioner had been

that she was vigilant over the vehicle, but has failed to call the driver of the

vehicle in order to establish that she used to call him frequently. The learned

Magistrate has also doubted the version of events by the petitioner on the basis

that the vehicle had been detained some 12 kilometers away from the garage

mentioned by the petitioner and there is no possibility for such an occurrence.

Going by the time of arrest that has been recorded by the police, it has been

further determined that her evidence as to the time she came to know about the

arrest cannot be believed. After having considered the evidence and the relevant

law, the learned Magistrate has determined that the registered owner has failed

to establish that she took the necessary preventive measures to prevent the

offence being committed. The vehicle has been confiscated on that basis.

The petitioner has challenged the said order by way of a revision application

before the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Holden in Kegalle.

The learned High Court Judge of Kegalle agreeing with the determination of the

learned Magistrate had determined that in terms of section 40(1) of the Forest

Page 7 of 12

Act as amended, the petitioner has failed to establish that she took all

precautions to prevent the offence being committed and since the petitioner has

failed to call the owner of the garage where she says the vehicle was repaired and

even the driver of the vehicle to give evidence on her behalf, she has failed to

show sufficient cause before the learned Magistrate. The revision application has

been dismissed accordingly.

When the present revision application filed before this Court was supported for

notice, this Court granted notice after considering the relevant facts and the

circumstances. Accordingly, the respondents filed their objections.

At the hearing of this application, it was the contention of the learned Counsel

for the petitioner that the evidence placed before the Magistrates Court was

sufficient for the petitioner to establish the requirements of the proviso of section

40(1) of the Forest Ordinance. It was the position of the learned Counsel that the

vehicle was not a vehicle that was used for transportation of any item which

require a permit to transport, but only concrete products, and during the time

of the detection, the vehicle had been under repairs and the registered owner

had only expected and informed the driver to being it back to her house after

repairs. The learned Counsel contended that the learned Magistrate should have

considered the evidence in that perspective, and the learned High Court Judge

was not correct in the determination that the learned Magistrate had pronounced

the order of confiscation after considering the relevant facts and the law.

The section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance amended by Forest (Amendment) Act

No. 65 of 2009 reads as follows.

40(1). Where any person is convicted of a forest offence-

(a) All timber or forest produce which is not the property of the

state in respect of which such offence has been committed;

and

Page 8 of 12

(b) All tools, vehicles, implements, cattle, and machine used in

committing such offence,

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence,

be confiscated by order of the convicting Magistrate.

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicle,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is

a third party, no order of confiscation shall made if such owner proves

to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to

prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and

machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the offence.

In the case of Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd. Vs. Attorney

General, SC Appeal No 120/2011 decided on 10-12-2013 Piyasath Dep, P.C.,

J. (As he was then) observed as follows;

The Supreme Court has consistently followed the case of Manawadu Vs.

The Attorney General. Therefore, it is settled law that before an order for

forfeiture is made, the owner should be given an opportunity to show cause.

If the owner on the balance of probability satisfies the Court that he has

taken precautions to prevent the commission of the offence or the offence

was committed without his knowledge nor he was privy to the commission

of the offence, then the vehicle has to be released to the owner.

Although this is a judgement pronounced considering the relevant provisions of

section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance before it was amended by the Forest

(Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009, it is my considered view that the underlying

principles that should be considered would be the same, since an offence of this

nature can still take place even after taking necessary precautions to prevent a

crime being committed without the knowledge of its owner.

Although the learned Magistrate as well as the learned High Court Judge has

found fault with the registered owner for failing to call the owner of the place

Page 9 of 12

where the vehicle was repaired and the driver of the vehicle to substantiate her

evidence, it is settled law that it is the quality of the evidence that matters and

not the numbers.

The relevant section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows.

134. No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required

for the registered owner of any fact.

The learned Magistrate has believed the evidence of the petitioner when it was

determined that she may not have had the prior knowledge of the offence being

committed. It is clear from the evidence of the petitioner that her evidence had

not been challenged at material points, and I do not find any basis for the learned

Magistrate to believe part of her evidence and to reject some other part.

Her evidence clearly shows that this was not a vehicle that used in any hires that

come its way, but for transporting heavy concrete items and other machinery.

The vehicle being a boom truck, there is no basis to doubt her evidence in that

regard. Her evidence that she asked her driver only to bring the vehicle back

from the garage where it had undergone repairs, cannot be disregarded on the

basis that the vehicle was detected some 12 kilometers away from the garage.

I am not in agreement with the learned Magistrates conclusion that her evidence

as to the time she came to know about the detention of the vehicle was wrong in

relation to the time of arrest that had been recorded in the police notebooks.

There is no argument that the vehicle was detained by the police. It is clear from

the petitioners evidence that she had mentioned the times not by looking at a

clock but by going by her instincts. I find that the difference in the timeline has

not caused any doubt of the evidence by the petitioner.

I am of the view that once the learned Magistrate formed the opinion that the

registered owner had no knowledge of the offence being committed and not privy

to it, considering whether the registered owner had taken the necessary

precautions to prevent the offence been committed should be considered in the

Page 10 of 12

light of the facts and the circumstances relevant to the given situation, and not

by giving a strict interpretation to the words all precautions to prevent the

commission of the offence as stated in the proviso of section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance as amended.

I am of the view that the evidence should be considered in order to find out

whether there is justification in releasing a vehicle to its owner, having in mind

that the precautions that an owner of a vehicle can take may vary in a given

scenario, and there can always be some other precautions that could have been

taken.

Although the learned Magistrate has cited the case of Sadi Banda Vs. Officer In

Charge of Nortonbridge Police Station (2014) 1 SLR 33, it appears that he

has decided not to follow the ratio decidendi of the said case on the basis that

the effect of the offences of such nature would have to the environment and social

fabric should also be considered in a situation like this.

I am of the view that if the learned Magistrate considered all those factors and

the judgement of Sadi Banda Vs. Officer In Charge of Nortonbridge Police

Station (supra) in its correct perspective, there cannot be any justification in

confiscating the vehicle belonging to the petitioner.

In the case of Sadi Banda Vs. Officer In Charge of Nortonbridge Police Station

(supra), it was held,

I have to admit that nowhere in the said inquiry proceedings there is

evidence that the appellant had taken all precautions to prevent the

commission of the offence. However, at the inquiry the appellant has given

evidence and stated, he purchased the lorry on 26-02-2000 and gave it to

his son to transport tealeaves. Further stated, that he had no knowledge

about transporting of timber. The learned Magistrate in his order has

accepted the fact that the appellant did not have any knowledge about the

transporting of timber without a permit.

Page 11 of 12

Nevertheless, the learned Magistrate has confiscated the lorry. I am of the

view before making the order of confiscation the learned Magistrate should

have taken into consideration, value of the timber transported, no

allegations prior to this incident that the lorry had been used for any illegal

purpose, that the appellant and or the accused are habitual offenders in this

nature and no previous convictions, and the acceptance of the fact that the

appellant did not have any knowledge about the transporting of timber

without a permit. On these facts the Court is of the view that the confiscation

of the lorry is not justifiable.

For the same reasons as considered, I find that the learned High Court Judge of

Kegalle was also misdirected as to the relevant facts and the law that should be

considered in a matter of this nature, when the revision application of the

petitioner was dismissed.

At this juncture, I find it appropriate to quote again from the above-mentioned

case of Sadi Banda Vs. Officer In charge of Nortonbridge Police Station

(supra), which I find relevant under the given context.

The revisionary power of Court is a discretionary power. This is an

extraordinary jurisdiction which is exercised by the Court and the grant of

relief is entirely dependent of the Court. The grant of such relief is of course

a matter entirely in the discretion of the Court, and always be dependent on

the circumstances of each case. Existence of exceptional circumstances is

the process by which the extraordinary power of revision should be adopted.

The exceptional circumstances would vary from case to case and their

degree of exceptionality must be correctly assessed and gauged by Court

taking into consideration all antecedent circumstances using the yardstick

whether a failure of justice would occur unless revisionary powers are

invoked.

Page 12 of 12

Under the circumstances, I am of the view that this is a fit and proper case where

the discretionary revisionary jurisdiction of this Court should be exercised in

order to prevent a miscarriage of justice.

Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 16-12-2022 pronounced by the learned

High Court Judge of Kegalle and the order dated 28-09-2020 pronounced by the

learned Magistrate of Warakapola, as both the orders cannot be allowed to stand.

I direct that the vehicle numbered 226-4461 shall be released to the petitioner

forthwith.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the

Magistrates Court of Warakapola for necessary compliance, and to the Provincial

High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province Holden in Kegalle for necessary

information.
