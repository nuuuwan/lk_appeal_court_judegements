This is a revisionary application filed against an order made by the learned High Court

Judge of Colombo in case No. 4027/2007. At this juncture this Court is determining

whether to issue notice on the application as the learned State Counsel appearing for

the complainant-respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent)

objected for issuing notices. Thereby, this Court will herein attempt resolve matters

pertaining to issuance of notices for the instant application.

This is a matter on misappropriation of State funds of 3.996 billion LKR by the 1st

accused while holding the post of Deputy Commissioner General of the Inland Revenue

under and in terms of the Offenses Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982. Upon 1st

accused pleading guilty the learned High Court Judge has imposed imprisonment along

with a fine of 11,988,024,454.00 LKR. As the accused failed to duly pay the fine the

State has moved to forfeiture of property under section 6 the said Act. Petitioner claims

that in the guise of the aforesaid provision, several properties purchased in the name of

third parties were purportedly forfeited by an order dated 08.05.2014. One such

property as claimed by the petitioner has been purchased by himself several years prior

to the said order. The petitioner further depicts details on relevant transfer of property.

The petitioner further claims that the instant revisionary application was filed as the

order dated 08.05,2014 is irregular as he was not given an opportunity to be heard and

citing several judgments, he claims that due to the miscarriage of justice, illegality of

the order and irregularity in procedure he is entitled to seek relief by way of a revisionary

application from this Court.

Learned Counsel for the petitioner supported this instant application in the presence of

learned State Counsel appearing for the respondent and he objected to the issuance of

formal notice. This bench has previously analysed in-depth the requirements in

entertaining or dismissing a revisionary application at preliminary stages. (See

Maldeniyage Don Upali Gunaratna Perera and another Vs Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption CA-CPA 77/22 CA Minute dated

CA-PHC-APN-CPA-118-22 Page 6 of 6 28/02/2023 IJ-10-23

12.10.2022) The requirement is to observe a prima facie case made out in the application

that warrants issuance of notice to the respondents. As decided on P.M. Ransasinghe

vs - Aselage Sujith Rupasinghe and Others SC Appeal No. 59/2021 SC Minute dated

08.04.2022, the burden cast on an applicant at the support stage is only to establish

such prima facie case where court becomes satisfied that the application before it

warrants a full investigation at a hearing with the participation of all parties.

In Horathal Pedige Prishriya Ratna Vilovhani vs Attorney General CA/PHC/90/18

CA Minute dated 25.07.2022, Sarath Andarahennadi vs Officer in Charge Police

Station Sigiriya CA/PHC/APN/117/2017 CA Minute date 27.03.2019 and Ingiriya

Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Lt vs Kalubalage Dona Laitha Srimathi

CA/PHC/123/16 CA Minute dated 17.05.2022 this Court has held that in an

application invoking revisionary jurisdiction, the Court should decide whether the

averred circumstances satisfy the threshold of exceptional circumstances expected by

the Court after the issuance of notice to the respondents and when both parties are

given an opportunity to make respective submissions.

Therefore the threshold to be satisfied at this stage to issue notice on the respondents

is cast on the applicant to establish a prima facie case. This Court believes that in the

instant matter the petitioner has duly satisfied the Court of existence of a prima facie

case, therefore I see no reason to entertain the objections of the respondent at this stage.

Accordingly, notice issued.
