The Petitioner is a Member of Parliament appointed on the National List and is a resident of Navithanveli, Kalmunai.

Petitioner invokes the jurisdiction of this Court on his own behalf as well as in the public interest, particularly that of the, public living within the Divisional Secretariat area of Kalmunai North. The Kalmunai North Division was established in 1989, by the Minister of Home Affairs and has been functioning for a period of approximately 33 years. At the time of establishment, it was referred to as the `Karavahu North (Tamil)' division. It is now referred to as "Kalmunai North" division and sometimes also referred to as "Kalmunai Tamil".

Mr. V. Alagaratnam was appointed as the Assistant Government Agent in 1989.04.06, and thereafter Ms. K. Balasingain in 1991.04.30. By way of a Cabinet memorandum dated 17.03.1993, several sub offices were proposed to be upgraded to the status of divisional secretaries. Cabinet memorandum dated 30. 03. 1993 indicates there were no objections of the Minister of Finance to set up new Divisional Secretaries.

Thereafter, cabinet memorandum No. HA/DA/22 dated 31.03.1993 referring to the memorandum dated 17.03.1993 states that the Kalmunai Tamil Division of the Ampara District, among others, be upgraded to the status of a divisional secretariat from the status of a sub office. By cabinet memorandum dated 09.07.1993 the report of the subcommittee on setting up new divisional secretariats was submitted to the cabinet ministers for approval.

The said report states inter alia as follows:

a) 207 Divisional Secretariats have been set up.

b) There are 28 AGA Offices which were set up and included the 3 in the Eastern Province which has not been upgraded to function as Divisional Secretariats and it was recommended that they should be upgraded.

c) A sum of Rs. 127 million was allocated for the said 28 divisions.

During the cabinet meeting held on or about 1993.07.28 the Report of the Cabinet Sub Committee on matters relating to the Public Service on "setting up of new Divisional Secretariats was submitted by the Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs by his memorandum dated 09.07.1993. The said Kalmunai North (Tamil Division) AGA was approved to be converted to function as Kalmunai North (Tamil Division) Secretariat.

The said division has since been functioning as an Independent Division.

Approximately 120 cadres fall within the Divisional Secretary while the remaining appointments are made by the respective ministries. The Ministry of Sports or the Department of cultural affairs for instance would send their officers to be attached to the Kalmunai North Division.

The said allocation and approval of cadres for the Kalmunai North Division would not have been possible if not for the existence of a Divisional Secretariat. The Petitioner also states that transfers have taken place between the Kalmunai North and South Divisions implemented by Ministries and Departments including District Secretariat Ampara, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Public Administration. Many administrative offices and structures have also been established based on the Divisional Secretariat Divisions. Each division has one respective office.

b. Divisional Secretariat Kalmunai by letter dated 2022.05.22 communicated to the 5th respondent and reminded him about the previous letters sent to him, directing him to use the title in the rubber stamp as 'Assistant Divisional Secretary' and to refer to the DS division as the "Sub Divisional Secretariat". The letter requested the 5th respondent to follow instructions and exercise within his official authority.

c. An inquiry in the Deed of Declaration bearing No. 539 attested by M. Arthika, situated within the jurisdiction of the 5th Respondent was a state land or private land.

d. The Respondent by letter dated 2022.10.10 informed said individuals to be present at the Respondent's office by ignoring the authority of the 5th Respondent to settle inquiries of lands within his division. The Petitioner further states that the said letter was sent through the 5th Respondent's office and thereby acknowledging the lawful status of his office and the authority that it Bolds.

e. By letter dated 2022.8.30 the 417 Respondent informs Mr. Nallathambi, Mr. Kanthakutty, Mr. Kanthan and Mr. Arumugam, all of whom were affected by the Tsunami, to be present at the 04th Respondent's office to receive deeds issued under the hand of the President.

f. Individuals were informed through a letter dated 2022.01.13 that the Training Programme for Placement of Unemployed Graduates 2020 is being held at the Kalmunai North (sub) Divisional Secretariat.

The Petitioner further states as follows;

Page 10 of 11

The Petitioner also states that the Kalmunai North Division was also given an official Cheque book from the government account and therefore, it should have received approval from the cabinet for expenditure, which would not have occurred if the said Kalmunai North Division was not recognized by the Cabinet of Sri Lanka. By letter dated 2012.12.21 a separate deed book was approved for the Kalmunai North Division to register the respective documents. Both the North and South Divisions have separate books allocated to them. Following the said letter, additional district registrar at the time, sent a letter dated 2013.2.27 to the Kalmunai North Division requesting a list of Grama Sevaka Divisions and the villages governed by the Kalmunai North Division, in order to implement the said letter. The said letter was also sent to the Kalmunai South Division requesting Grama Sevaka divisions under their authority.

Thereafter, the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat at the time replied to the above by letter dated 2013.4.5 stating that the requested information will be provided by him. The Petitioner states that the 4th Respondent however, has unlawfully, illegally, wrongfully and in ultra vires interfered with the authority of the 5th Respondent and acted beyond his powers and ordered the cancellation of the deed book of the Kalmunai North Division. The Petitioner states that as requested, the administrative areas of Kalmunai North were sent by letter dated 2013.3.7. However, the learned President's counsel for the Petitioner submits that as demonstrated above, there are now attempts to divide administrative divisions that do disregard the divisions in the said documentation.

The Land Registry had a separate book for registration of lands within the Kalmunai North Divisions, however, the Petitioner became aware that by letter dated 2022.04.18, the Additional Registrar General writes to the Land and District Registrar, Kalmunai and directs her to register the instruments hereafter under a common 'Y' division and thereby obliterating registration under the Kalmunai Tamil Division.

The Petitioner states that despite the establishment of the Kalmunai North division over 3 decades ago and the vital part it has played over these years in the administrative system of the country. The Respondents have unlawful; illegally and in ultra vires begun stripping of powers of the Kalmunai North Divisional Secretariat in an attempt to illegally abolish the division entirely. The Kalmunai North Division has been unlawfully, illegally and in ultra vires removed from the official website of the Ministry of Home Affairs and no longer reflects the information seen in annexure.

Several right to information applications were filed requesting information inter alia on who had taken the said decisions and whether permission was given to the officer who took this decision to change the Kalmunai Divisional Secretariat (North) to Kalmunai (sub) Divisional Secretariat.

Accordingly, the following information was obtained:

a. The State Ministry of Home Affairs responded with a letter dated 2021.9.29, claiming that no such decision had been made.

b. Divisional Secretariat, Sainthamaruthu, responded with a letter dated 2021.04.30, informing of how and when the Sainthamaruthu DS Divisional Secretariat was established, as well as that it being a 'Sub' Secretariat claiming that it was purportedly functioning a Sub Secretariat from 1999.12.19 to 2001.02.03.

e. By letter dated 2021.05.11, information Officer, Divisional Secretariat, Eravur Town informs that the Eravur Town Divisional Secretariat was separated from Eravur Pattu, and Senkaladi Divisional Secretariat and it was declared as Divisional Secretariat on 1993.01.01.

f. By letter dated 10.5.2021, the Assistant Divisional Secretary of the Divisional Secretariat, Koralaipattu West-Oddamavadi stated that their Secretariat was separated from Koralai Pattu Valaichchenai Divisional Secretariat and constituted 1990.09.28 purportedly as Sub Secretarial for Ottamavadi. However, this Secretariat did not function as a Sub Secretariat.

g. Gazette No. 1032, dated 12th June 1998.

In the aforesaid circumstances the Petitioner states that the actions complained of herein are unlawful, illegal, unreasonable and against the legitimate expectations of the Petitioner and the public at large. Thus, the Petitioner invokes the jurisdiction of this Court for the issuance of the Writs or Prohibition and Mandamus as prayed for herein. The petitioner states that if the interim prayed for herein are not granted, grave and irremediable mischief and irreparable loss and damage would be occasioned to the Petitioner and the public at large.

The Respondents vehemently objected for issuing of notices as well as the interim relief.

Heard all counsel in regard to this application for notice and an interim relief to be granted. After considering the submissions and documents tendered by all parties, we are of the view that there is an important matter to be decided in this case. In the circumstances the court is satisfied that there is a prima facia case to be looked into, by this court.

Accordingly, we direct the registrar of this court to issue notices on all the respondents. The application for an interim relief is refused as it is the final relief.
