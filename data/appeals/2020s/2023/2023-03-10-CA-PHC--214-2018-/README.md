Judgment

The Applicant-Petitioner instituted action bearing No. 95318/16 in the Magistrates Court

of Mahara against the Respondent namely C.G. Perera and sought an Order under Section

28(A)3 of the Urban Development Act No. 41 of 1978 as amended to have a boundary wall

built by the Respondent demolished on the basis that it was an unauthorized construction. It

was alleged by the Applicant-Petitioner that the said Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner has

obstructed the flow of water along Dewata Road, 6 Post, Dalugama.

The Respondent had filed objections with documents marked R1-R9A to the application of

the Applicant-Petitioner and sought a dismissal of the said action. Thereafter, the Applicant

Petitioner had filed counter objections. After written submissions were tendered by both

parties, the learned Magistrate had delivered her order dated 19.01.2017 allowing the

application of the Applicant-Petitioner to have the boundary wall erected by the Respondent

removed.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner, namely C. G. Perera

had moved in revision to the Provincial High Court of Gampaha seeking to have the said

order of the learned Magistrate set aside. Consequent to the said application, Applicant-

Petitioner-Respondent [hereinafter referred to as the Applicant-Petitioner] had filed

objections and thereafter the matter had been disposed by way of written submissions. The

learned High Court Judge had affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate and dismissed

the revision application of the Respondent-Petitioner by Order dated 16.11.2018. Being

aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner, namely C.G. Perera

[hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Petitioner-Appellant] has preferred an appeal to this

Court.

It appears that the learned Magistrate had allowed the application of the Applicant-Petitioner

to have the boundary wall built by the Petitioner-Appellant demolished on the basis that it

was built without obtaining any permission or approval of the Pradeshiya Sabha of Kelaniya.

The learned High Court Judge too had affirmed the findings of the learned Magistrate and

held against the Petitioner (Appellant).

It was the contention of the Petitioner (Appellant) that he obtained a building permit before

constructing the impugned wall in 1992, which has been marked and produced as R2 in the

Magistrates Court. Major part of the said document R2 has been attacked by termites. As

such, the learned Magistrate had not accepted document R2 on the basis that it is not possible

to draw an inference that Appellant had obtained prior approval from the relevant authorities

to construct the impugned wall from document marked R2, which was severely damaged.

Court draws attention to the said document R2. It seems to be a building permit. However, a

major part of that document has been attacked by termites and damaged. The parts left in R2

indicate that the said building permit was issued to C.G. Perera. It states:

.. .

Petitioner (Appellant) has also marked and produced document R11, a building permit issued

to his neighbor J. J. S. Seneviratne. According to document R11, it is clear that the said J. I. S.

Seneviratne obtained a building permit to construct a wall on premises bearing No/21.

The said document R2 has been signed by

. When you compare the said signature of the issuing authority placed on R11

with part of the signature visible in document R2, they are somewhat similar to each other

and appear to be issued around the same time. R11 was issued in 1992. Although the date of

issue of R2 is not clear, it is evident that Respondent has not disputed the position of the

Petitioner (Appellant) that the impugned wall was built in year 1992.

Page 4 of 7

As the building permit is valid only for 1 year and the said building permit R2 was

presumably issued in 1992 by Dalugama Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha, Applicant Petitioner

seeking an Order for demolition of the wall 22 years later on the basis that the Appellant has

not produced an acceptable building permit is unreasonable as the Petitioner (Appellant)

cannot be expected to safeguard a document which was valid only for 1 year for 22 years.

Court takes cognizance of the order dated 15.12.2016 made by the Magistrates Court of

Mahara in case bearing no 95319/16 which is filed on record and marked as P4. The said

case was filed by Chairman (now secretary) exercising powers under the Urban

Development Authority Act by the Pradeshiya Sabhawa- Kelaniya against Sarath Senarathne,

who is the recipient of the building permit marked R11. The said case was instituted on the

basis that the said Sarath Senarathne had constructed a wall without obtaining a valid permit

from the Pradeshiya Sabhawa and an application had been made to have the unauthorized

construction demolished in terms of Section 28A (3) of the Urban Development Act.

The above case is similar to the facts of the instant case bearing No. 95318/16 instituted

against Petitioner (Appellant) C. G. Perera. This court also observes that the said case

95319/16 had been filed just after the filing of the instant case bearing No. 95318/16.

Furthermore, observing the addresses the Parties have given in both cases indicate that the

cases refer to neighboring houses. The C. G. Perera - Petitioner (Appellant)s address in case

bearing No. 95318/16, is noted as No.20, Kandy Road, Dalugama Kelaniya. Sarath

Senarathnes address - Respondent in case bearing No.95319/16 - is indicated as No.20B, 6

, Kandy Road, Dalugama Kelaniya.

It should be noted that the application of the Applicant-Petitioner in case bearing No.

95319/16 was dismissed by the learned Additional Magistrate of Mahara by decision dated

15.12.2016 on the ground that the impugned construction is not an unauthorized

construction as the Respondent had obtained a building permit (R11) to construct the

boundary wall.

However, the same Additional Magistrate had heard the instant case bearing No. 95318/16,

where the Petitioner (Appellant) in this appeal was the Respondent. In this case, the learned

Additional Magistrate had allowed the application of the Applicant-Petitioner to demolish

the boundary wall on the basis that the Petitioner (Appellant) had not obtained a valid

building permit from the Pradeshiya Sabha to construct the boundary wall.

The building permit R2 was produced in evidence by the Petitioner (Appellant). Although the

learned Additional Magistrate has not refused to accept the document marked R2 which was

Page 5 of 7

attacked by termites, she has held that R2 is an incomplete document and thus, no inference

can be drawn that it is an approved building plan.

The learned Additional Magistrate had stated in her Order:

R2

.

.

R2

.

In this respect, it is relevant to note that even if the Petitioner (Appellant) had requested from

the Applicant-Petitioner to obtain a certified copy of document R2, it is unlikely that the

Applicant-Petitioner-Pradeshiya Sabha would furnish a document which goes against the

Applicant-Petitioner.

In such a situation, it is a duty of Court to ascertain the availability of such document from

the Applicant-Petitioner in the interest of justice, particularly, when the Applicant-Petitioner

has not contended the authenticity or the genuineness of the said building permit marked

R2.

We observe that the learned Additional Magistrate had not rejected the document marked

R2. She has however, held against the Petitioner (Appellant)on the ground he has failed to

satisfy court that the impugned boundary wall was built with the approval of the Pradeshiya

Sabha of Kelaniya (Applicant-Petitioner).

This Court should view the evidence placed before the learned Magistrates Court by the

Petitioner (Appellant) on a balance of probability. The learned High Court Judge had not

given enough credit to the evidence provided by the Petitioner (Appellant), particularly in

the absence of any evidence to the contrary from the Applicant-Petitioner. Learned High

Court Judge has not addressed his mind to the fact that for over 20 years, no issue has been

raised regarding the impugned wall and the fact that similar building permit was issued to

neighbouring house. Applicant-Petitioner has failed to provide any evidence challenging the

building permit, the date of when the construction was actually done or any evidence

regarding any objections raised by the Applicant-Petitioner. The Learned High Court Judge

should have adequately analysed the evidence on a balance of probability. From the above

evidence and the construction of the damaged document, this court can come to a conclusion

Page 6 of 7

that document marked R2 was a building permit that was granted to the Petitioner

(Appellant) to construct the impugned wall.

Furthermore, under section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance, when any fact is especially

within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.

According to Dr. U.L Majeed, in Applicability of the Evidence Ordinance in Civil Actions (at

page 665),

In the administration of justice, it is desirable that the burden of producing evidence

be placed on the party best able to sustain it, and there is authority for the view that

the burden of evidence as to an issue rest on the party having the greater means of

knowledge

In Razik Ram Chouhan A.I.R. (1975) 4 S.C. 667, it was held that section 106 applies to those

matters which are supposed to be especially within the knowledge of a party and not capable

of being known to any other.

In the instant case, Applicant-Petitioner-Respondent has failed to provide any proof to the

effect that the Urban Development Authority or Pradheshiya Sabha has at any point issued

notice or have raised any objection during or after the construction of the wall until twenty

years later. This knowledge would be exclusively within the knowledge of the Applicant-

Petitioner. Thus, the burden is on the Applicant-Petitioner to provide such proof. Failure to

provide such proof by the Applicant-Petitioner, leads to this court to conclude that Applicant-

Petitioner-Respondent has not raised any objection or have made any issue out of the

construction of the boundary wall at the time or after such construction.

Furthermore, details on whether a building permit was registered or not/issued or not, is

within the exclusive knowledge of the Applicant-Petitioner, as the Pradeshiya Sabha would

generally maintain a record of all the permits issued. Particularly, as it is unreasonable to

expect the Respondent-Petitioner to keep the building permit in very good condition, when

the building permit is only valid for a period of one year. Therefore, the burden is on the

Applicant-Petitioner to establish the lack of such registration by providing a logbook or any

other such file available for that period, to indicate the absence of such registration. However,

Applicant-Petitioner has not provided such a document to discharge the burden under

section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance. In light of failure to provide such evidence, the court

has no other means of ascertaining the illegality of the said construction except by relying on

the evidence provided by the Petitioner (Appellant).

In view of the aforesaid reasons, it is imperative to note that the document marked R2, which

was attacked by termites was a building permit issued by the Pradeshiya Sabha of Kelaniya

Page 7 of 7

(Applicant-Petitioner) to Petitioner (Appellant) and no evidence exists to suggest the

contrary. Thus, it is reasonable to presume that said building permit R2 was issued to the

Petitioner (Appellant) in 1992 to construct the impugned boundary wall.

Therefore, I hold that the impugned wall is not an unauthorized construction and that

learned Magistrate has erred in issuing an order for demolition in terms of Section 28A (3)

of the Urban Development Authority Act No. 41 of 1978.

Therefore, we set aside the order of the learned Magistrate dated 19.01.2017 and order of

the learned High Court Judge dated 16.11.2018 affirming the order of the Magistrates

Court.

Appeal allowed.
