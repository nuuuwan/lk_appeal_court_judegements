(1939 A.C. 377 at 393). Each Statute must be considered separately and in determining whether a particular provision of it is mandatory or directory one must have regard to the general scheme to the other sections of the Statute. The Queen vs. Justices of the County of London County Council (1893) 2 Q.B. 476 at 479). It is also stated that considerations of convenience and justice must be considered. Pope vs. Clarke (1953) (2 A.E.R. 704 at 705). Then again, it is said that to discover the intention of the Legislature it is necessary to consider-(1) The Law as it stood before the Statute was passed. (2) The mischief if any, under the old law which the Statute sought to remedy and (3) the remedy itself. (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, Edition 12 page 160). These are all guidelines for determining whether Parliament intended that the failure to observe any provision of a Statute would render an act in question null and void. They are by no means easy of application and opinions are bound to differ. Indeed, some cases there may be where the dividing line between mandatory and directory is very thin. But the decision has to be made. I will therefore examine the Statute bearing in mind these guidelines.",

I am not sure that it is the most fortunate language that could have been adopted to express the idea that it is intended to convey; but still, that is the recognised language, and I propose to adhere to it. The real question in all these cases is this: A thing has been ordered by the legislature to be done. What is the consequence if it is not done? In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all voids. On the other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the legislature could have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters",

This principle has been applied to provisions for holding sessions at particular times and places (2 Hale, P. C., p. 50, Rex v. Leicester Justices (1827) 7 B & C. 6 and Parke B. in Gwynne v. Burnell (1835) 2 Bing. N.C. 7); to provisions as to rates (Reg. v. Inhabitants of Fordham (1839) 11 Ad. & E. 73 and Le Feuvre v. Miller (1857) 26 L.J.

This of course is well within the time limit and I would go to the extent to state that the Board has been very conscious of early disposal of the appeal. Board cannot be faulted for getting the appeal fixed for hearing as stated above since it is the duty and function of the Secretary of the Board to fix a date and time for hearing and to notify the parties. If it was the intention of the legislature that hearing should be concluded within 2 years from the date of filing the petition or that the time period of 2 years begins to run from the date of filing the petition, there could not have been a difficulty to make express provision, in that regard. I do agree with the view of the State Counsel. Hearing no doubt commences from the date of oral hearing. I would as such answer this question in favour of the Respondent and endorse the view of the Board of Review. It is not time barred as the Board arrived at the determination within 2 years.

One has still to read more words into it to have the effect of postponing the rest of the exercise to sometime later. This would be doing violence to the section. The section imposes a duty, but does not impose a time limit within which it should be done. To my mind the section merely states that if the Assessor does not accept a return, he may assess on an estimate. His exercise is not complete till he has also communicated his reasons for not accepting the return. In effect he also justifies his act of assessing on an estimate. The plain meaning of the section is clear. (Emphasis added)",

The primary purpose of the amending legislation is to ensure that the Assessor will bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite determination whether or not to accept it. It was intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly unfair assessments which many Assessors had been making as a protective measure. An unfortunate practice had developed where some Assessors, due to pressure of work and other reasons, tended to delay looking at a return till the last moment and then without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a grossly exaggerated assessment. The law, I think, enabled the department to make recoveries pending any appeal on such assessments. The overall effect of this unhappy practice was to pressurize the taxpayer to such an extent that he was placed virtually at the mercy of the tax authorities. The new law was a measure intended to do away with this practice. Under the amendment when an Assessor does not accept a return, it must mean that at the relevant point of time he has brought his mind to bear on the return and has come to a decision rejecting the return. Consequent to this rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the assessee. The provisions for the giving of reasons and the written communication of the reasons, contained in the amendment is to ensure that in fact the new procedure would be followed. More particularly, the communication of the reason at the relevant time is the indication of its compliance. The new procedure would also have the effect of fixing the Assessor to a definite position and not give him the latitude to chop and change thereafter. It was therefore essential that an Assessor who rejects a return should state his reasons and communicate them h. His reasons must be communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated income. Any later communication would defeat the remedial action intended by the amendment (emphasis added). [102] The Appellants argument is that the substance of the statement made by Samarakoon C.J. is that a duty is now imposed on the Assessor who rejects the return and makes an assessment to state reasons for such rejection, communicate the same to the taxpayer, issue and serve the notice of assessment before the expiration of the period for the making of the assessment. In my view, all what His Lordship Samarakoon CJ said in D.M.S. Fernando and another v. A.M. Ismail (supra) was that the assessor who rejected a return should state his reasons and communicate them at or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated income to the taxpayer. I am afraid, there is nothing to indicate or gather from His Lordship Samarakoon C.

The position of the appellant is that an assessment is no assessment until notice of assessment is given. The position could have been otherwise, viz. an assessment could have been a valid assessment, as soon as an estimate is made. If like in Honig (administrators of Emmanuel Honig) v Sarasfield (H.M. Inspector of Taxes), the Commissioners Inland Revenue also maintained a register in which an assessment is entered. In the absence of such procedure in this country.

The effect of this part of the decision is that the amendment made to section 163(5) of the principal enactment is only prospective and applicable for any year of assessment on or after 1 April 2009 and not before 01.04.2009 and hence, it has no application to the year of assessment 2007/2008.",

The only distinction is that in Seylan Bank case, the assessee had already filed its return by the time the amendments were made, which deprived the assessee to benefit from the extended period given to file the return.

The second part of the judgment related to the inability of the assessee to benefit from the extended period given to file the return under Act, No. 19 of 2009 and therefore, the assessee had a right to have the assessment passed within the 18 months from the end of that year.

However, the position in law would be different in the matters which relate to procedural law but so far as substantive rights of parties are concerned they remain unaffected by the amendment in the enactment. We are, therefore, of the view that where a repeal of provisions of an enactment is followed by fresh legislation by an amending Act such legislation is prospective in operation and does not effect substantive or vested rights of the parties unless made retrospective either expressly or by necessary intendment. We are further of the view that there is a presumption against the retrospective operation of a statute and further a statute is not to be construed to have a greater retrospective operation than its language renders necessary, but an amending Act which affects the procedure is presumed to be retrospective, unless amending Act provides otherwise (emphasis added).",

We are of the view that two thirds of the Nation Building Tax charged by the Nation Building Tax Act, No. 9 of 2009, whether collected by the Inland Revenue or Customs or by any other agent, shall be considered as a prescribed levy and recovery of such amount be made in calculating the annual income tax of the tax payer.",
