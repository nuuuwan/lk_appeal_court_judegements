This is an application for contempt of court filed on 27.09.2021 against the

respondent for allegedly, deliberately and maliciously stating false statements on

his affidavit submitted for the original matter ongoing in the District Court of

Kaduwela. In the instant matter, the Court by its order dated 18/07/2022

decided to have the benefit of the position of the respondent before taking a

decision of issuing formal summons. And thereby directed the petitioner to issue

notice including on all documents directly to the respondent. Respondent

appeared before the Court on 06.12.2022 and made submissions. Respondent

was then directed to file his position with regard to the issuance of summons by

way of written submission. Written submissions were filed by the parties on

31.01.2023. Upon entertaining this application this Court is mandated to

determine whether formal summons should be served on the respondent.

The facts of the original matter are briefly as follows. The plaintiff and one Slam

Studio (Pvt) Ltd. have obtained a loan of 11,000,000 LKR from the 2nd defendant

company via the 1st defendant bank to purchase a lot of land in Talangama.

Upon defaulting to repay the loan with installments of 20,020,000 LKR in

accordance with the loan agreement, the plaintiff and the other, being principal

debtors, have agreed to handover the said land to the 1st and 2nd defendants

claimed to be under constructive trust. However, plaintiff further claims that the

3rd defendant bank which has no involvement in the above incident allegedly

attempts to encroach the said land obstructing the peaceful possession and

enjoyment of the property by the plaintiffs. In the original matter the plaintiff has

prayed inter alia for a declaration of title.

In the matter of contempt of court at hand, the petitioner alleges that the

respondent in this application who is the assistant manager of the 3rd defendant

company (Sri Lanka Savings Bank Limited) has submitted affidavits dated

4

CoC-0006-21 Page 4 of 6 21/03/2023 IJ-14-23

22.02.2021 and 20.05.2021 for the proceedings of the aforementioned case at

Kaduwela DC bearing No. 878/L/2020 with numerous false statements,

deliberately and maliciously, attempting to evade the truth, mislead the Court

and subvert the course of justice. The petitioner has stated in his petition that

he is an individual of good repute; a prominent legal practitioner of 45 years, a

Presidents Counsel and a senior member of the bar. He was elected as the

secretary of the Bar Association from 1991-1993 thereafter as its president in

2013. He has further appeared for several well-known cases and has acted as the

Chairman of Board of Investment from 2015-2017. There is no dispute on those

facts.

The respondent has submitted that the 3rd defendant bank to which he is the

assistant manager, has obtained the superimposition plan bearing No. 015101

(marked as R1 along with respondents submissions) by a licensed surveyor and

claims that it depicts an encroachment and an unlawful occupation by the

petitioner and one Chula Jayasuriya the spouse of the petitioner. It is further

claimed that the above-mentioned individuals had mortgaged portions of land

which said Chula Jayasuriya claims in her affidavit to belong to the plaintiff

company however as per the superimposition plan deem to be an encroachment.

To determine the matter at hand this Court would like to first resort to Section

181 of the Civil Procedure Code which states that Affidavits shall be confined to

the statements of such facts as the declarant is able of his knowledge and

observation to testify to, except on interlocutory applications in which

statements of his belief may be admitted, provided that reasonable grounds

for such belief be set forth in the affidavit." Under Section 183 B it states that

where any person willfully makes any false statement by affidavit or otherwise,

in the course of any of the proceedings aforesaid he may be punished as for a

Contempt of Court, besides his liability to be tried and punished under the Penal

Code for the offence of giving false evidence, where such statement is on oath or

affirmation.

Indubitably the superior courts are conferred overarching powers on contempt of

court under Article 105 (3) of the Constitution. It states the Supreme Court of

5

CoC-0006-21 Page 5 of 6 21/03/2023 IJ-14-23

the Republic of Sri Lanka and the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Sri Lanka shall

each be a superior court of record and shall have all the powers of such court

including the power to punish for contempt of itself, whether committed in the court

itself or elsewhere, with imprisonment or fine or both as the court may deem fit.

The power of the Court of Appeal shall include the power to punish for contempt of

any other court, tribunal or institution referred to in paragraph (1)(c) of this Article,

whether committed in the presence of such court or elsewhere: Provided that the

preceding provisions of this Article shall not prejudice or affect the rights now or

hereafter vested by any law in such other court, tribunal or institution to punish for

contempt of itself. (Emphasis added) Thus, the Court of Appeal is clearly

conferred the jurisdiction to entertain contempt of court committed at any other

court. However, in a matter as the one at hand, where determining the contempt

of court largely depends on findings, perusal and examinations at lower Court

trial, it is plausibly more appropriate for such a forum to determine on the

contempt of court matter as well.

This position was comprehensively analysed in the case of Meththanda vs

Kushan Fernando (2006) 1 Sri LR 290 , where the Court of Appeal resorted to

Section 55 (1) of the Judicature Act, proviso of section 105 (3) read with 183B of

Civil Procedure Code and stated that the inherent jurisdiction on contempt of

court of superior courts shall not prejudice the specific jurisdiction conferred to

lower courts by above mentioned provisions when dealing with contempt of court

by falsified affidavits. Section 55 (1) of the Judicature Act has endowed

jurisdiction on contempt of Court to lower courts where it states that every

District Court, Small Claims Court and Magistrates Court shall, for the purpose of

maintaining its proper authority and efficiency, have a special jurisdiction to take

cognizance of, and to punish with the penalties in that behalf as hereinafter

provided, every offence of contempt of court committed in the presence of the court

itself and all offences which are committed in the course of any act or proceeding

in the said courts respectively, and which are declared by any law for the time

being in force to be punishable as contempt of court (Emphasis added). Therefore,

for the purpose of maintaining proper authority and efficiency any contempt of

court committed at lower court proceedings shall be entertained by the such

court.

CoC-0006-21 Page 6 of 6 21/03/2023 IJ-14-23

Given that Article 105 (3) of the Constitution has specifically given jurisdiction to

the Court of Appeal to deal with matters of contempt of court committed at other

courts and tribunals, this Court would like to reiterate that it is clearly endowed

with jurisdiction to entertain this matter whether it is committed in facie curiae'

(within the well of the Court) or 'ex-facie curiae' (those committed outside the

Court). However, if this Court is to serve summons and determine that there is

contempt of court it would indicate that the respondent has lied in evidence and

if decided otherwise it would indicate vice versa. This determination would clearly

prejudice the proceedings at the trial court. And given that the trial court is

inherently bound to determine boundaries and extent of land lots, this Court

entertaining this application which is inter alia based on determining such

boundaries, would result in inefficiency and delayed justice. This ascertainment

on prejudice of rights, proper authority and efficiency is one of a case-by-case

basis. Therefore, this Court believes that the best forum to entertain this matter

is the trial court. Thereby, this Court refuses to issue summons to the

respondent.

Application dismissed.
