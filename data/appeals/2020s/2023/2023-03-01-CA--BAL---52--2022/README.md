MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to the suspect by

the name Lllangarachchige Chaminda Rumesh under the provisions of

the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses

act.

The suspect in the instant matter had been produced under the instant

act for threatening a witness in a case of rape.

The suspect had been in remand since 23.10.2021.

The main contention of the Counsel for the suspect is the delay in due

administration of justice taking place against the suspect.

The Counsel for the respondents formally objected for the instant

application.

The law pertaining to this matter is that a suspect produced and

remanded under this act can be granted bail only upon exceptional

circumstances by the Court of Appeal, and the term exceptional has not

been defined in the act but our legal literature has held that

exceptionality has to be determined by the facts of each case.

As such this Court observes that the suspect in the instant matter is in

remand since 2021 without any meaningful action is being taken

against him, hence we are of the opinion that, the delay itself is

exceptional enough to enlarge the suspect on bail.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed and we direct the

learned Magistrate to enlarge the above named suspect on suitable

conditions of bail.

Neil Iddawala J.

I agree.
