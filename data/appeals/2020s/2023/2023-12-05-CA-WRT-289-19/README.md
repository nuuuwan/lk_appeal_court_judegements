Respondents)

DECIDED ON : 05.12.2023

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The 3rd to 7th respondents in this matter had made an application to the

1st respondent claiming that they work for the petitioner local authority as

its employees and claimed Employees Provident Fund (hereinafter

mentioned as EPF). After an inquiry, the 1st respondent decided that the

petitioner had defaulted in making the contribution to EPF for the period

Page 3 of 8

from June 1994 to September 2011. In consequence, a certificate in terms

of Section 38(2) of the Employees Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958

(marked P-1) was filed in the Magistrate Court of Nugegoda to recover a

sum of Rs.2,254,630.71 from the petitioner.

This application has been filed by the petitioner seeking a writ of certiorari

quashing the 1st respondents decision/certificate issued against the

petitioner. In addition, the petitioner seeks a writ of prohibition preventing

the 1st respondent from continuing proceedings against the petitioner as a

defaulter.

At the hearing, the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned State

Counsel for the 1st, 2nd, and 8th respondents made oral submissions.

Subsequently, the synopses of the arguments were submitted by way of

written submissions on behalf of both parties.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that the 3rd to 7th

respondents were independent contractors appointed to collect default

rates and taxes and they drew a commission based on the sums collected

by each individual. Warrants issued by the petitioner to the 5th and 4th

respondents to collect default rates and taxes have been marked with the

petition as P-2, P-3 and P-4. As there was no employer-employee

relationship between the petitioner and the respondents, and as the 3rd to

7th respondents were not the employees of the petitioner, the learned

Counsel contended that the petitioner is not liable to pay EPF contribution.

The position of the 1st, 2nd and 8th respondents was that the power of

recovering taxes and payments due to the petitioner is a power given to the

Secretary of the Petitioner Urban Council in terms of Section 170 and 170A

of the Urban Councils Ordinance and the 3rd to 7th respondent were

employed by the petitioner for discharging such duties and functions in

terms of Section 36 of the Urban Councils Ordinance.

Page 4 of 8

The learned State Counsel appearing for the 1st, 2nd and 8th respondents

contended that 1R-12(a) is the letter of appointment dated 06.01.1994

issued to the 3rd respondent and 1R-13, 1R-14, 1R-15 and 1R-18 are the

other letters of appointment issued to 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th respondents. The

learned State Counsel contended further that based on the evidence and

material produced before the inquiry, the 1st respondent has decided that

the 3rd to 7th respondents worked under a letter of appointment and/or

contract of service for the petitioner and they were workmen covered under

the EPF Act.

However, the main contention of the learned State Counsel was that the

petitioner could not maintain this application because the petitioner had

acquiesced to the legality of the certificate filed by the 1st respondent by

submitting themselves to the proceedings before the Magistrates Court

and the revision application filed therein and thus, the petitioner cannot

thereafter challenge that the certificate filed is illegal. The learned State

Counsel pointed out that the learned Magistrate issued the order on

25.05.2016 imposing the sum mentioned in the certificate as a fine. The

said order has been canvassed by way of a revision application bearing

No. HCRA 84/2016 in the Provincial High Court of Colombo, the revision

application was dismissed, and the judgment of the said High Court

revision application was not challenged. In view of these circumstances,

the learned State Counsel contended that the petitioner is going on what

is called a Forum Shopping and making a belated application by abusing

the process of law.

First, I proceed to consider the issue of the maintainability of this

application because if this application could be maintained only, the issue

of whether the 3rd to 7th respondents were independent contractors or not

must be considered. On 09.04.2014, the certificate (P-1) was filed in the

Magistrates Court of Nugegoda in order to recover the Employees

Provident Fund of Rs. 2,254,630.71. Thereafter, summons were issued to

the petitioner on 29.05.2014. The petitioner appeared before the

Page 5 of 8

Magistrates Court on 14.10.2014 and moved for a date to discuss. In a

case of this nature, after appearing in the Magistrates Court, the petitioner

had two options. Either to show cause in the Magistrates Court why the

sum mentioned in the certificate should not be recovered or to challenge

the certificate in a proper forum, if it was wrongly issued. On 24.03.2015,

the petitioner submitted an affidavit showing cause as to why the sum

mentioned in the certificate should not be recovered. It appears that five

months after appearing in the Magistrates Court, the petitioner decided

not to challenge the certificate but to show cause in terms of Section 38 (2)

of the EPF Act why the sum mentioned in the certificate should not be

recovered.

According to Section 38 (3) of the EPF Act, the correctness of any statement

in a certificate issued by the Commissioner for the purpose of this section

shall not be called in question or examined by the Court in any proceedings

under that section. Therefore, it is apparent that the correctness of the

certificate could not be challenged in the Magistrates Court. When

showing a cause in terms of Section 38 (2) of the Act, limited causes such

as (i) that the petitioner was not the person named as the defaulter in the

certificate, (ii) that he has paid the amount specified in the certificate, (iii)

that the defaulter was not a resident within the jurisdiction of the

Magistrates Court, could be shown. If the 3rd to 7th respondents were

independent contractors, the petitioner knew very well that issuing a

certificate to pay EPF to them was wrong. Hence, soon after the certificate

was filed, the petitioner could have challenged the certificate by way of a

Writ Application. But the petitioner did not take any step to challenge the

certificate instead he opted to show cause in the Magistrates Court.

The learned Magistrate delivered his order on 25.05.2016 imposing the

sum mentioned in the certificate as a fine. From 14th October 2014, the

date that the petitioner appeared in the Magistrates Court, up to the date

of delivering the order, for one year and seven months, the petitioner did

not challenge the certificate.

Page 6 of 8

What did the petitioner do after the Magistrates Court order? The

petitioner filed a revision application bearing No. HCRA 84/2016

challenging the order of the learned Magistrate. In addition, the petitioner

filed an appeal bearing No. HCMCA 62/2016 against the same order.

However, the appeal has been withdrawn by the petitioner on 12.02.2017.

The revision application was dismissed by the High Court on 12.07.2019.

It is important to take into consideration that by filing the revision

application, the petitioner sought to revise the order of the learned

Magistrate on the basis that the cause or causes that had been shown by

the petitioner had not been properly considered by the learned Magistrate.

Therefore, it is apparent that even after the order of the learned Magistrate,

the petitioner had gone to the Provincial High Court of Colombo not to

challenge the certificate filed by the 1st respondent but to challenge the

order of the learned Magistrate. In fact, the said certificate cannot be

challenged in a Provincial High Court. What is important to note is that

the petitioner has never challenged the certificate in any forum before filing

this Writ Application. Three days prior to the judgment being delivered by

the High Court, the petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this Court and

filed this Writ Application seeking to quash the certificate issued by the 1st

Respondent.

Throughout the aforesaid legal process, the petitioner did not challenge the

correctness of the certificate, instead, the petitioner opted to show cause

why the sum mentioned in the certificate should not be recovered. After

failing in all other attempts, the petitioner eventually attempted to

challenge the certificate, which should have been done immediately after

the certificate was filed.

The learned State Counsel urged to dismiss this application on the ground

that the petitioner cannot challenge the certificate because the petitioner

is guilty of laches. No doubt, the petitioner is guilty of laches because the

petitioner waited four years and nine months to challenge the certificate.

Page 7 of 8

Hence, this application should be dismissed for the reason of the petitioner

being guilty of laches. There is another fundamental legal bar to maintain

this application. Once the learned Magistrate has made an order

considering the cause shown by the petitioner as to why the sum

mentioned in the certificate should not be recovered, the petitioner cannot

challenge the certificate. There after he can only challenge the order of the

learned Magistrate. If the petitioner wanted to challenge the certificate, it

should have been done without recourse to the option of showing a cause

before the Magistrate. In other words, the petitioner waives off his right to

challenge the certificate by recourse to the option of showing cause.

It must be noted precisely, when the petitioner opted to show cause in the

Magistrates Court as to why the sum mentioned in the certificate should

not be recovered, and when the learned Magistrate delivered the order to

recover the sum mentioned in the certificate as a fine, the time to challenge

the certificate lapses. Thereafter, only the order of the learned Magistrate

could be challenged. In fact, the petitioner has realized that and correctly

filed a revision application against the order of the learned Magistrate. As

stated previously, the said revision application was dismissed. If an appeal

is not filed against the judgment of the revision application in which the

learned Magistrates order was affirmed, what remains is to recover the

EPF contribution due from the petitioner as directed by the learned

Magistrate in his order dated 25.05.2016. I hold that the petitioner cannot

challenge the certificate after the learned Magistrate made an order

imposing the sum mentioned in the certificate to be paid as a fine in order

to recover the EPF dues.

For the reasons stated above, I hold that the petitioner cannot maintain

this application for the reliefs prayed for in the petition. Also, I perceive

validity in the learned State counsel's contention, which is stated in her

written submission that the petitioner is abusing the process of law.

Accordingly, the instant Writ Application is dismissed with costs fixed at

Rs. 75,000/-.
