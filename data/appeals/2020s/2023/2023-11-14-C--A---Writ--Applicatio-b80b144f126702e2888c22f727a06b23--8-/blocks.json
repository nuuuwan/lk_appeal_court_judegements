To her utmost shock and dismay, the Petitioner has been informed that her service in the post of Cook had been made permanent after she reached the age of 45 years and therefore the Department was facing difficulty in processing her pension. However, in view of the above-purported concern in respect of the Petitioners entitlement to the pension, the Department of Social Services sought advice from the Director General of Pensions by its letter dated 14.09.20202 marked P19 to the Petition in respect of the possibility of paying the pension after amending and/or ante-dating the Petitioners date of appointment to 01.07.2005 as the Petitioner has completed all relevant requirements required to be fulfilled for the Petitioner to obtain such appointment as at 01.07.2005. In response, the Director General of Pension has informed the Director of Social Services by his letter dated 05.04.2021 marked P20, that the pension entitlement to the Petitioner cannot be granted to the Petitioner on an irregular appointment as Clause 31 of the Public Service Commission precludes the anti-dating of an appointment for any reason. The Petitioner submits that the above decision to refuse her pension is illegal, irrational, and procedurally defective. Accordingly, the Petitioner is seeking inter alia Writs of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st,2nd and 3rd Respondents to refuse the pension due and payable to the Petitioner and to the effect that the Petitioner is not eligible to the pension, Writs of Mandamus directing the 1st to 5th Respondents to process the Petitioners application for pension and grant the pension and Writ of Prohibition restraining the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents giving effect to the decision reflected in P20.",
