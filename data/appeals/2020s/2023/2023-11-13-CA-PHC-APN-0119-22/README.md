JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Complainant-Respondent (Hereinafter referred to as the

Complainant) filed a charge sheet Under Section 25(2) read with

Sections 40, 40(A) and 40(B) of the Forest Ordinance for transporting

06 cu. Mets. of Mahogany timber classified as firewood(or) using a

vehicle bearing No. SP GC-8735 without a valid permit thereby violating

CA (PHC) APN 119/2022

4 | P a g e

regulation No. 02 of the Forest Regulations of 2008 and causing a loss

of Rs.216.00 to the State.

The charge sheet was filed against the Accused-Respondent (Hereinafter

referred to as the Accused) in the Magistrate Court of Udugama. As the

Accused pleaded guilty to the charge sheet, the Learned Magistrate of

Udugama had convicted the Accused and imposed a fine of Rs.25216/-

and fixed for an inquiry to confiscate the Vehicle bearing No. SP GC

8735.

At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate had decided to

confiscate the aforesaid vehicle by his order dated 15.06.2021. At the

inquiry only the Appellant had given evidence on his behalf.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Magistrate, the Appellant filed a

revision application in the Provincial High Court of Southern-Province

Holden at Galle to revise the order of the Magistrate of Udugama. After

an inquiry, the Learned High Court Judge had dismissed the said

revision application and affirmed the order of Learned Magistrate of

Udugama by her order dated 21.09.2022.

Now the Appellant filed this appeal to set aside the order of the Learned

High Court Judge of Southern-Province Holden at Galle dated

21/09/2022.

The Appellant submitted following grounds of appeal:

1. The Learned High Court Judge erred by not considering whether

the Learned Magistrate of Udugama has correctly evaluated the

evidence placed before him.

2. The Learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate the manner

in which the Petitioner dispensed the burden cast upon him

under the Forest Ordinance.

3. The Learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate that the

prosecution has not properly challenged the evidence given by

the Petitioner.

CA (PHC) APN 119/2022

5 | P a g e

4. The Learned High Court Judge erred by coming to the

conclusion that the Petitioners evidence was not corroborated

by another witness when corroboration is not cine-qua-non in

this instance.

5. The Learned High Court Judge failed to give due consideration

to the evidence led before the Learned Magistrate of Udugama.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge, considering the order of the

Magistrate Court of Udugama decided to dismiss the revision

application stating that that the Appellant had failed shock the

conscious of the court.

In this case a vehicle had been confiscated for transporting timber

(firewood) (or) worth about Rs.216/-.

The Claimant of the vehicle has given evidence in the court and has

claimed that he was unaware of the crime being committed as he has

employed the Accused as a driver of the vehicle. The Claimant has given

specific instructions to the Accused not to use the vehicle for the illicit

transport of sand timber and other items which need permits. Further,

he used to contract the Accused daily in the evening to ascertain and

assess the happenings regarding the hires and related matters for the

day.

The Learned Magistrate has dismissed the application on the basis that

the Claimant had failed to show that he took all necessary precautions

to prevent a crime being committed. The vehicle is brought to the

residence of the claimant if there were any repairs to be effected.

CA (PHC) APN 119/2022

Further, the Accused was working as the driver of the said vehicle for

about three years. During this period there was no complaint about

misusing the vehicle.

Both the Learned Magistrate and the High Court Judge has missed to

comprehend that the timber mentioned in the charge sheet as firewood

(or) and its value mentioned as Rs.216/-.Both the Learned Magistrate

and the Learned High Court judge had failed to consider the value of

the timber (Firewood) (or) transported in the vehicle by the Accused.

Further, The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by coming to the

conclusion that the evidence given by the Petitioner was not

corroborated by another witness.

The Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance sets out that no particular

number of witnesses shall in any case be required for proof of any fact".

As long as the evidence given by a witness is not challenged and

contradicted, corroborative evidence is not sine-qua-non such an

instance.

In this case the Petitioners evidence has not been contradicted or

challenged by the Complainant.

In Sadi Banda v The Attorney General CA (PHC) Appeal No.

03/2013 dated 25.07.2014 the Court observed follows:

Nevertheless, the Learned Magistrate has confiscated the lorry. I

am of the view, before making the order of confiscation Learned

Magistrate should have taken into consideration, value of the

timber transported, no allegations prior to this incident that the

lorry had been used for any illegal purpose, that the appellant and

or the accused are habitual offenders in this nature and no

previous convictions, and the acceptance of the fact that the

Appellant did not have any knowledge about the transporting of

timber without a permit. On these facts the Court is of the view that

the confiscation of the lorry is not justifiable

CA (PHC) APN 119/2022

7 | P a g e

In this case the Petitioner had given cogent evidence that he had no

knowledge about transporting timber (or) in this case. The complainant

had charged the Accused for transporting firewood (or). The value of the

timber-firewood (or) estimated as Rs.216/-.This has not been

considered by both the Learned High Court Judge and the Learned

Magistrate. Further, last three years there was no any offence

committed by the Accused nor the vehicle involved in any illegal

activity. These matters had not been considered by the either Courts.

Considering all these matters in to careful consideration, the only

conclusion this Court could reach is that Learned High Court Judge

has not exercised his revisionary jurisdiction justifiably in considering

the order made by the Learned Magistrate of Udugama.

Hence, I set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Galle

dated 21.09.2022 and the order of Learned Magistrate Court of

Udugama dated 15.06.2021.

Therefore, this appeal is allowed.

I direct that the vehicle No. SP GC 8735 be released to the Appellant.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgement to the

High Court of Galle and the Magistrate Court of Udugama.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.

I agree.
