RESPONDENTS

Kingswood College in terms of Circular No. 29/2019 (marked as P-4 (a)) issued by the

Ministry of Education regarding the school admissions for Grade 1 of the Government

schools for the year 2021 and the instructions thereto issued by the Ministry of

Education on 26.05.2020 (marked as P-4(c)), her Application for admission was

rejected. The decision to reject the Application has been conveyed by the Principal of

Kingswood College, the 1st Respondent to the Petitioner by letter dated 08.09.2020

(marked as P-15). Even though the Petitioner preferred an Appeal to the Appeal Board

headed by the 2nd Respondent against the decision to reject the Application that Appeal

has also been rejected. The decision of the Appeal Board has been conveyed to the

Petitioner by the undated letter marked as P-17. The substantive reliefs sought by the

Petitioner in this Writ Application are, inter alia,

b) Grant/issue an Order in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to the 1st Respondent

and 2nd Respondent to quash the letter of rejection dated 08.09.2020 and the

letter of rejection to the Appeal Board, marked respectively as P-15 and P-17

c) Grant/issue an Order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus to the 1st Respondent

to admit the Petitioners child, Raveesha Damsara Hettiarachchi to Grade 01 of

the Kingswood College, Kandy for the year 2021.

When this Writ Application was taken up for argument on 18.05.2023, it was informed

to the Court that the facts and circumstances in this Writ Application as well as in the

Writ Application No. Writ 0189-21 are similar; therefore, the parties to both actions

consented to abide by a single judgment. Furthermore, all parties agreed to dispose of

the actions on written submissions. The Petitioner to his Writ Application has filed

written submissions on 12.12.2022.

In Clause 7.1 of P-4 (a) it has been mentioned six categories under which students could

be admitted to Grade 1 in Government schools and the percentages that should be

observed under each category when selecting children to be admitted as follows;

i. Children of residents in close proximity to the school 50%

ii. Children of parents who are past pupils of the school 25%

iii. Brothers/sisters of students already studying in the school 15%

iv. Children of persons in the staff of Institutions directly involved in

school education

05%

v. Children of Officers in Government/Corporations/Statutory

Boards/State Banks receiving transfers on exigencies of service

or on annual transfers

04%

vi. Children of persons arriving after living abroad with the child 01%

A copy of the Application submitted by the Petitioner for admission is marked as P-5

(a). In the Application, the category upon which the Application has been submitted is

mentioned as follows;

l%sia;shdks wd.l moku ^wdikak;u l%sia;= Ouh W.kajk mdi,&

In terms of Clause 7.1 in P-4 (a) there is no category under which a child could be

admitted to a Government school based on religion. Therefore, it is understood that the

Petitioner has preferred the Application under the category of close proximity to the

school.

Clause 4.2 in P-4 (a) reads thus;

in filling vacancies in schools vested to the Government under Assisted

Schools and Training Schools (Special Provisions) Act, No. 5 of 1960

and Assisted Schools and Training Schools (Supplementary Provisions)

5

Act, No. 08 of 1961, the proportion of children belonging to different

religions at the time of vesting the school to the Government will be

taken into consideration and the number of vacancies in the said school

shall be accordingly divided among different religions and categories.

When the number of applications is less than the number of vacancies

set apart for a given category of religion, the remaining vacancies shall

be proportionately divided among other categories of the same religion.

When there are no applicants from a religion or when the number of

applications from a religion is less than the number of vacancies set

apart for that religion, such vacancies set apart for the said religion

shall be proportionately divided among other religions.

Admittedly, Kingswood College Kandy is a Government school which was vested in

the Government under the aforementioned Act, No. 5 of 1990 and/or Act, No. 08 of

1961. The document marked P-4 (d) attached to the Petition shows the statistics

regarding the religious composition of students at Kingswood College when it was

vested in the Government. P-4 (d) is neither an original nor a certified copy. In the

statement of objections, the 1st Respondent has stated that P-4 (d) is an unsigned

document with no verifiable identifiable source nor can it be established as being

authentic and therefore no possibility for the School to rely on the same. The Court of

Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules, 1990 regarding the Applications to the Court of

Appeal provides thus;

3. (1)(a) Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the powers

vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the Constitution shall be by way

of petition, together with an affidavit in support of the averments therein, and shall be

6

accompanied by the originals of documents material to such Application (or duly

certified-copies thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender

any such document, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the leave of the

Court to furnish such document later. Where a petitioner fails to comply with the

provisions of this rule the Court may, ex mero motu or at the instance of any party,

dismiss such Application (emphasis added).

Accordingly, the Court of Appeal has the discretion to entertain or dismiss an

Application exercising its jurisdiction under Article 140 of the Constitution if the

Application does not comply with the requirements mentioned in Rule 3. Therefore,

even if the petitioner failed to tender the originals or duly certified copies in the form

of exhibits with the petition and affidavit, in the interest of justice the Court could admit

documents which are neither originals nor certified copies.

In the case of Senanayake vs. Commissioner of National Housing1 Saleem Marsoof J.

held that,

I am of the view that the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules, 1990

have been formulated to facilitate the judicial process and with a view of

achieving justice rather than injustice. It appears from Rule 3 (14) that it is

contemplated that where there is some non-compliance with the Rules, the

Registrar should put up the application for an order of court. The intention of

this Rule is to give opportunity for the Court to exercise its discretion with

respect to the matter as is implicit from the use of the word may in the last

sentence of Rule 3(1)(a). Furthermore, I am of the view that in applications for

prerogative relief where this Court enjoys a supervisory jurisdiction, Court

1 (2005) 1 SLR 182

7

should not non-suit a party where the non-compliance with Rules take place due

to no fault of that party.

The Petitioner has submitted to Court the judgment of the Supreme Court in the

fundamental right application bearing No. 335/2016 in which the Court considered the

same document the Petitioner has tendered to the Court in the instant action marked as

P-4(d). That action was also regarding the admission of a child to Kingswood College

Kandy and the document had been certified by the Methodist Church. Therefore, since

the Supreme Court has admitted and considered the same document there is no

impediment for this Court to accept it.

Furthermore, P-4(d) is a vital document in deciding the composition of students

belonging to different religions at the time of vesting Kingswood College to the

Government. It is helpful for the School in admitting children to Grade 1 every year.

Therefore, the Respondents should possess the original or a certified copy of P-4(d) or

any other document that could be used to decide the religious composition in admitting

students to Grade 1 every year as long as Clause 4.2 of the Circular marked P-4(a)

prevails. Considering all the above-stated facts and circumstances, I decided to accept

and rely on the document marked as P-4(d).

According to the letters marked as P-11(b) and P-11(c) issued by the Methodist Church

the child concerned with this Writ Application is a Christian who belongs to Methodist

Denomination. According to P-4(d), the total number of students when Kingswood

College vested to the State in 1960 was 898 and the total number of Methodist students

was 71. Therefore, the percentage of Methodist students who studied at the school at

the time of vesting was 8%. In terms of Clause 4.2 of P-4(a) in filling vacancies the

proportion of students who belonged to different religions at the time of vesting the

8

school to the Government should be taken into consideration and the total number of

vacancies in the School should accordingly be divided among different religions and

categories mentioned in Clause 7.1 in P-4(a). As per the journal entry dated 21.03.2022,

the Petitioner has filed a document in Court by way of a motion issued by the Ministry

of Education indicating the details about the students admitted to Grade 1 of Kingswood

College in the year 2021. According to that document, the total number of students

admitted for the year 2021 was 140; out of them, 3 students were non-Christians. In

terms of Clause 7.1 of P-4(a), 50% of the total number of students should be admitted

based on residence and therefore out of 140 students 70 should be residents of proximity

to the School. On that basis in terms of P-4(d), 8% of 70 should be Methodist students.

Therefore, the total number of Methodist students admitted to Grade 1 of the School

for 2021 should be 6. Nevertheless, even though there are no provisions in P-4(d) to

consider the students based on non-Christian, only 3 students had been admitted under

all six categories mentioned in Clause 7.1 in P-4(a). Therefore, it is clear that the

decision taken by the 1st Respondents to accommodate 3 students based on non-

Christian is against the Circular issued by the Ministry of Education marked as P-4(a)

and guidelines marked as P-4(c) and the directions mentioned in P-4(d). The 1st

Respondent does not argue that there is any other school other than Kingswood College

in which the child could have been admitted based on residence. Considering all the

above-stated facts and circumstances, I hold that the decisions of the 1st and 2nd

Respondents marked as P15 and P17 respectively not to be admitted the child of the

Petitioners son are illegal and ultra vires. Therefore, the Court decides to issue a Writ

of Certiorari quashing the said decisions of the 1st and 2nd Respondent and issue a Writ

of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to admit the child to a Grade which the

students admitted to Grade 1 in 2021 are now studying before the next school term

9

starts in September this year. This judgment should apply to the connected Writ

Application bearing No. CA Writ 189-21. No costs ordered.
