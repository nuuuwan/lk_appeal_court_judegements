Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner filed the instant Application alleging that his appointment to the post of

Lecturer (Probationary) at the University of Visual & Performing Arts (University) was,

wrongfully and devoid of any justification, delayed by six years from the date of his initial

selection to the said post in 2013. He contends that he has a legitimate expectation to have

the date of his appointment to the said post be antedated to the date of his initial selection.

In focus of the factual matrix of this case, the Petitioner possesses a Degree in Fine Arts and

a Master of Arts in Dance. Subsequent to being promoted to the position of an Instructor

(Grade II) with effect from 25.10.2011 he was placed on a U-AS 1 (Grade II) salary scale at

the said University. While serving as an Instructor the Petitioner applied for the post of

Lecturer (Probationary), advertised by the said University in the Lankadeepa Newspaper dated

15.08.2013 marked P23. The advertisement called for applications under the respective

1st,2nd,3rd and 4th categories of the Scheme of Recruitment marked (9R2) and the Petitioner

submits that he applied for the post of Lecturer (Probationary) under the 3rd category. It is

admitted by both the Petitioner and the 9th to 24th Respondents ('Council' of the University)

that a total of ten candidates applied for the said post; 07 candidates qualifying under the 1st

Category; 02 candidates qualifying under the 2nd category and only the Petitioner qualifying

as a candidate under the said 3rd category.

The said advertisement P23 indicates that special preference would be given to candidates

who possess theoretical knowledge and practical skills in Kadawara Kankariya and

Shanthikarmaya. The Petitioner proceeds to emphasize that he possessed the requisite skills in

the concept of Kadawara dancing which was a key component in his dissertation submitted

for his Master of Arts in Dance.

The Petitioner was interviewed on 19.05.2014 and the respective mark sheet is annexed as

9R3(c). It is alleged by the Petitioner that he was examined at the said interview on the

Page 6 of 13

Kadawara concept of dancing for which he claims to have successfully displayed a sufficient

amount of practical and theoretical knowledge. The Petitioner further states that he secured

the highest marks at the practical examination among all the candidates and thereby he was

the most suitable candidate for the post of Lecturer (Probationary).

The Petitioner was thereafter informed by a letter marked 9R4 by the Vice-Chancellor of

the said University that the Petitioner was recommended by the Selection Committee for the

appointment and it was approved by the Council of the University on 09.07.2014. The

selection of the Petitioner for the post of Lecturer (Probationary) was subsequently submitted

for approval of the University Grants Commission (UGC) by letter dated 23.07.2014 marked

9R5. However, the UGC refused to approve the said selection on the following grounds in

their decision marked 9R7:

I. Not allocating any marks at the practical test for the 5 candidates who falls under

category I, which is a portion 30% of the mark sheet of this selection.

II. Mr. Ranjith Jayasinghe has been recommended by the selection committee under

category 3; overlooking 5 candidates falling to category 1 and 2 candidates falling

to category 2, without a strong justification.

Nonetheless, due to the alleged failure of the said University to fill the vacancy for the post of

Lecturer (Probationary) for a lapse of 2 years, the Petitioner, appealed to the University

Services Appeals Board (USAB), seeking an order directing the UGC and the University to

appoint him to the said post and pay his arrears of salary from the date of his selection (Vide-

P38). However, pending the hearing of the Petitioners appeal a 2nd advertisement dated

23.11.2016 marked P39 was published by the University calling for applications for the

same post. The Petitioner proclaims that the USAB noted that he could take part in the

interview process, and come before the USAB in the event he was not selected to the relevant

post.

Anyhow, the interviews under the said 2nd advertisement were subsequently cancelled and a

3rd advertisement was later published, marked P43. Eventually, recruitment in terms of the

3rd advertisement was also cancelled due to reasons not known to Court. After being

submitted by the Petitioner about the cancellation of the said 3rd interview, the USAB by an

Page 7 of 13

interim order dated 04.12.2018 marked P46 directed the above 1st to 24th Respondents to

conclude the recruitment process within a period of 3 months from the date of the said order

and further observed that in the event of a delay, it would be reasonable to appoint the

Petitioner to the post of Lecturer (Probationary) in light of him initially being selected to the

said post in 2013. It is observed that a 4th advertisement was published subsequently for the

vacancy of the same post, to which the Petitioner then applied and was selected for the second

time for the post of Lecturer (Probationary). Upon his selection and consequent approval from

the UGC for this selection, the Petitioner was appointed to the post of Lecturer (Probationary)

in the Department of Kandyan Dance attached to the Faculty of Dance and Drama at the

said University by the letter of appointment dated 03.01.2020 marked P54.

The Petitioner thereafter, during the pendency of his Appeal, submitted his concerns to USAB

regarding the effective date of his appointment. However, the USAB in its final order dated

19.05.2020 marked P56 expressed the view that it is unable to make an order that the

Petitioners recruitment pursuant to the 2nd selection process be backdated to the first which

had been concluded by that time. The USAB emphasized its decision by stating the following:

I. If the Appellant has faced a 2nd selection process in response to the second

advertisement and if he has been selected and appointed consequence to the 2nd

recruitment process, totally independent of the 1st, there is no possibility of

backdating his appointment.

II. If the Appellant on the other hand has been appointed on the basis of the 1st

selection process, where he was selected after a written examination and an

interview, and recommended, and due to the failure on the part of the University

Grants Commission his appointment was not approved, which appointment has

now been approved, he should be entitled to have his appointment backdated to

the date of disapproval by the Commission. Since in that event the Commission

has now corrected the error they previously committed by disapproving this

appointment.

The Petitioner thereafter opposed this decision in the instant Application before this Court by

claiming that it was unreasonable, arbitrary and ultra vires. The prayer of the Petition of

the Petitioner formally requests the Court to provide reliefs in the form of the following:

Page 8 of 13

a) Issuing a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the Order dated

19.05.2020 of the USAB marked "P56.

b) Issuing a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the

University along with the decision of the Council made on 27.08.2020 at the 174th

Council meeting that there will be no change in the date of the Petitioners

appointment to the post of Lecturer (Probationary) and also the confirmation of the

said decision at the 175th Council meeting dated 22.09.2020 marked P58.

c) Issuing a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus directing the UGC and the

Council of the University to backdate the appointment of the Petitioner as Lecturer

(Probationary) effective from 09.04.2015, which is the date of the UGC's original

refusal to approve the selection of the Petitioner to the said post.

d) Issuing a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus directing the Council of the

University to pay to the Petitioner all arrears of salary and other benefits with effect

from 09.04.2015.

The Petitioner contends that one of the reasons given by the UGC in its refusal to antedate

the effective date of his appointment to the said post, was on the basis that antedating his

appointment would not be deemed appropriate as the Petitioner has faced an additional

interview separate from the other candidates who applied for the same said post. The

Petitioner argues that this refusal is grossly misconceived as the sole reason for him facing

a second interview was due to the USAB refusing the Petitioners interim application to stay

the process of filling the vacancy for the post of Lecturer (Probationary) (Vide- P42).

Apart from this, as previously mentioned the Petitioner further argues that, following his

initial selection to the said post, though his appointment was not approved by the UGC, the

University entrusted him to conduct the functions of a Lecturer (Probationary). These

functions are specified in his Petition as a) conducting classes for all undergraduates from first

to final year, b) functioning as an examiner at all undergraduate examinations by setting

question papers, marking answer scripts and, c) Serving as a member of the Board of

Examiners at the practical examination (Vide- P7-P20). The Petitioner goes on to describe

the role of an Instructor (Grade II), which was the position held by the Petitioner at the

time, to mean Academic Support Staff. Anyhow, the Petitioner has failed to provide this

Page 9 of 13

court with sufficient evidence to prove that the above mentioned tasks are unique to the

position of a Lecturer (Probationary) and are not expected to be performed by an individual

in the position of an Instructor (Grade II). As opposed to such arguments the Council and

the University asserts that the performance of the Petitioner at the aforementioned 2nd

interview process was different from that of the 1st, which took place six years earlier.

In light of the above what needs resolution by this Court in the instant Application is whether

the Petitioner is entitled to get his appointment ("P54") antedated based on the outcome of

the initial interview held on 19.05.2014. Hence, this court is required to examine the following

questions:

I. Whether the petitioner is entitled to raise a claim based on the initial selection

process which was compelled to be abandoned by the University?

II. What is the effect of abandoning or canceling a selection process relating to

recruitment of the University staff?

III. Has the Petitioner waived his rights by exhausting his entitlement of reapplying for

the same post and facing a distinct interview?

IV. Can the Petitioner seek relief based on the recommendations made following the

initial interview, without challenging the abandonment of the initial selection

process?

The primary relief sought by the Petitioner is to quash the USAB order dated 19.05.2020.

(P56) and also the decision taken by the Council that there shouldn't be any change in the

date of the Petitioners appointment as Lecturer (Probationary). The Petitioner has appealed

to the USAB seeking similar reliefs. Additionally, the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of

Mandamus in order to get the appointment of the Petitioner antedated. However, it is

paramount to note that the Petitioner is not challenging the decision of the authorities to call

for fresh applications for the appointment to the relevant post by re-advertising the same. In

other words, the abandonment of the initial process relating to the selection of candidates is

not being challenged.

It is significant that the process of selection of a candidate does not consist of a single step but

includes an interview, a practical examination etc., particularly according to the scheme of

Page 10 of 13

recruitment. The initial selection process has not been completed as no final appointment has

been made after a formal winding up of such a process. Although the Council of the

University has approved the Petitioners name during the initial selection process, no final

decision was made in that regard due to the defects highlighted by the UGC found in the

process of the said selection process. The UGC by its letter dated 27.04.2015. ("9R7") has

instructed the University to re-advertise the said post of Lecturer (Probationary). Ironically,

such decision of the UGC remains unchallenged and stands valid up to date as the Petitioner

is contesting only a subsequent decision taken by the University. On a careful perusal of the

prayer of the Appeal "P38" lodged in the USAB by the Petitioner and the law relating to

appeals to USAB, I am unable to presume that the Petitioner's above Appeal is comparable

to a due protest or challenge against the UGC decision marked "9R7".

The Petitioner has not provided adequate material in order to consider his reliefs by this court,

based on a process of selection abandoned previously as enumerated above. The Petitioner,

without challenging the UGC decision, waited until a consequential or ancillary decision was

taken by the University to file the instant Application. I have considered the 'conduct' of a

Petitioner mainly referring to acquiescence in the case of K.G.D Walter Abeysundera and

another vs. S. Hettiarachchi, Secretary, Ministry of Tourism and others CA /WRIT/371/2020

decided on 22.09.2021, quoting a paragraph from Judicial Remedies & Public Law, 4th edition.

(at para 9-17)

Waiver involves voluntary or intentional abandonment of a known, existing legal right (Vide-

M. P. Jain & S. N. Jain, 'Principles of Administrative Law', 9th edition, p. 2543). The Indian

Supreme Court has observed1 that a waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known right

and there can be no waiver unless the person against whom the waiver is claimed has full

knowledge of his rights and facts enabling him to take effectual action for the enforcement of

such rights. In this backdrop, no contrary evidence can be seen against the fact that the

Petitioner in this instant Application had the full knowledge of his right to canvas the previous

decision of the authorities. This implies that the Petitioner has waived whatever his

entitlements in respect of the 1st selection process by facing the interview held during the final

selection process which was independent of the first one. Christopher Forsyth in

'Administrative Law' by Wade and Forsyth (11th Edition, Oxford) at p. 199, referring to the

judgements of the House of Lords submit that no consent can confer on a court or tribunal

any power to act beyond its jurisdiction. As such, any view or comment expressed during the

proceedings of the aforesaid appeal process by USAB which is in the nature of an obiter would

not affect the Petitioner's consent or waiver described above. At the same time, for the reasons

given above and based on the circumstances of this case I am not convinced that the UGC or

the University has acted beyond its jurisdiction during the selection process in respect of

appointing a candidate to the post of Lecturer (Probationary).

The case of Suneetha Aggarwal v State of Haryana, AIR 2000 SC 1058 narrates a similar

situation to the instant case. The Supreme Court of India has observed therein;

The management of the institution advertised the post of Hindi Lecturer. In response to the said

advertisement, the appellant and other persons applied for selection to the said post. The Selection

Committee of 15th July 1996 interviewed the candidates. The nominee of the Vice Chancellor and

the Director of High Education approved the name of the appellant to be placed at Sr. No. 2

whereas, one Kiran Bala was placed at Sr. No.1. However, the Selection Committee

recommended the name of the appellant and for the said post. This was not approved by the Vice-

Chancellor who, by order dated 5-8-96, directed the said post to be re-advertised.

Accordingly, on the 13th November 1996, the post was again advertised and in response thereto,

the appellant again applied to for being considered for the post of Hindi Lecturer. The date of

interview was fixed as 10th January, 1997. On the said date the appellant appeared before the

Selection Committee without any kind of protest and simultaneously filed a writ petition

challenging the order of the Vice- Chancellor dated 5-8-96 whereby the Vice-Chancellor

disapproved the recommendation of the Selection Committee and issued a direction for a fresh

advertisement.

The court in the above-mentioned case finally held that the appellant having appeared before

the selection committee without any protest and having taken a chance is estopped by her

Page 12 of 13

conduct from challenging the earlier order of the Vice- Chancellor. Accordingly, the relevant

writ petition has been dismissed.

For the reasons mentioned above, I take the view that a plea of antedating an appointment

placing reliance on a previous selection process cannot subsequently be invoked in a case

where such candidate has opted to undergo a fresh selection process for the same post, unless

the relevant public authority has taken decisions against statutory restrictions or exceeding its

jurisdiction. A candidate who becomes successful during such a subsequent selection process

should not be able to raise claims upon his purported rights allegedly emanating from a

previous process of selection that took place, without first protesting or challenging the

abandonment of the said previous selection process. Readvertising or calling for fresh

applications for the same posts amounts to an abandonment of the initial selection process if

there are no special circumstances available to deviate from such a proposition. The initial

instance, wherein the candidate faced an interview but did not secure final approval for the

position, cannot be retrospectively altered based on the outcome of a subsequent interview

conducted years later. The notion of backdating an appointment is grounded in the concept

of rectifying past errors or oversights, which is not applicable in this scenario as further

expressed by the USAB in their above-mentioned order dated 19.05.2020 ("P56").

Accordingly, I am of the view that the passage of time between the two interview processes

introduces a clear demarcation, treating each instance as an independent event. The eventual

success in the latter interview should not serve as a basis for antedating the appointment to

the date of the initial refusal of the appointment. Doing so would undermine the integrity of

the distinct interview processes and compromise the principle of meritocracy that governs

appointment decisions. It is essential to recognize that candidates evolve over time, acquiring

new skills, experiences, and perspectives. As such, the decision to appoint following a later

interview reflects the candidate's updated qualifications and suitability for the position at that

juncture.

Similarly, although this court finds that there has been serious mismanagement on the part of

the said University with regard to the cancellation of the 2nd and 3rd interviews and not being

able to fill the vacancy for the post of Lecturer (Probationary) at the University for 6 long

years, the act of antedating an appointment to the date of first refusal, based on a subsequent

Page 13 of 13

successful interview conducted years later, is untenable as it would not accurately reflect the

individual's qualifications and approval status at the time of the second interview. The

progression of time and the evolution of circumstances necessitate treating each recruitment

process as a discrete event, thereby upholding the integrity of the selection process and

ensuring fairness in appointments. Based on such circumstances, I am not inclined to uphold

the contention of the Petitioner that the USAB have abdicated the power vested in them by

law when issuing its order marked "P56".

In light of the foregoing, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs prayed

for in the prayer of the Petition. Thus, I proceed to dismiss the instant Application.

Application is dismissed
