Counsel:

Shantha Jayawardena instructed by Ms. Hiranya Damunupola for the Petitioners.

Manohara Jayasinghe, DSG for the Respondents.

Written submissions tendered on:

16.06.2023 by the Respondents

Argued on: 29.03.2023

Decided on: 24.10.2023

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioners joined the Employees Trust Fund Board (the 1st Respondent Board) at

different levels/positions at different times and after serving for over 15 years, by the

date of the institution of this action, they were in managerial positions in Grade III. The

1st Respondent Board was established under the Employees Trust Fund Act, No. 46 of

1980. The Department of Management Services in the General Treasury issued the

Management Service Circular No. 30/2006 on 22.09.2006 (marked as P-12) to

regularize salaries of the employees in Public Corporations, Statutory Bodies and Fully

Owned Government Companies and in terms of P-12 upon the recommendation of the

Salaries and Cadre Commission the 1st Respondent Board reclassified the Petitioners in

the posts of Junior Managers for which the relevant Salary Code is JM 1-1. The

Department of Management Services of the Ministry of Finance by the letter dated

22.11.2006 (marked as P-13) approved the new salary structure of the employees in the

1st Respondent Board in terms of P-12 (page 2 of the annexure attached to Page 13).

Nevertheless, by the P-12 the employees of other Public Corporations and Statutory

Boards who were paralleled to the Petitioners Salary Scale and the Grade before P-12

6

was issued were placed in the posts of Middle Management for which the Salary Code

is MM 1-1. To establish the said fact, the Petitioners have tendered to Court the letters

issued by the Department of Management Services of the Finance Ministry to the State

Printing Corporation and Plantation Ministry regarding the reclassification of salary

structure applicable to the employees in those institutions in terms of P-12 (marked as

P-14(a) and P-14(b)).

The Petitioners were formally informed by the 1st Respondent Board in 2013 by P-15

that they were placed in the JM 1-1 Salary Code in terms of P-12. The Petitioners

complained to the Labour Commissioner that they were placed in a lower Salary Code

than the Salary Code in which they should be placed. The Labour Commissioner after

conducting an inquiry held that by placing the Petitioners in JM 1-1 Salary Code they

are demoted and as a result, they would not be entitled to the other benefits which they

are entitled to (P-16). Even though the Petitioners drew the attention of the Chairman

of the 1st Respondent Board and the Treasury about their grievance (P-17(a) and P-

17(b)), they did not receive a favourable response.

In the meantime, between 2010 to 2018 Petitioners were promoted to the posts of

Manager Grade II for which the applicable Salary Code is MM 1-3. On 01.03.2019, the

12th Petitioner was promoted to the post of Assistant General Manager (Legal) and

placed in the Salary Code of MM 1-1.

On 15.02.2018 the Ministry of Finance issued Trade and Investment Department

Circular No. 01/2018 (P-21) regarding the issuance of Motor Vehicle Permits on

concessionary terms (the vehicle permits). After P-21 was issued, the Chairman of the

1st Respondent Board by letter marked as P-22 dated 15.07.2019 informed the Salaries

and Cadre Commission about the injustice caused to the Petitioners when reclassifying

7

the employees in the 1st Respondent Board in terms of the Circular marked as P-12. The

Petitioners in or about November 2019 applied for permits (P-23(a) P-23(s)) in terms

of the Circular marked as P-21. Then the Assistant General Manager (Administration

& Human Resources) of the 1st Respondent Board (the 11th Respondent) informed the

Petitioners by letters dated 20.01.2020 (marked as P-24(a) to P-24(s)) that in terms of

the Circular P-21, the Petitioners are not entitled to the vehicle permits since they have

not completed 12 years service period in a position in the Salary Code of MM or

HM. On that basis, the 11th Respondent refused to recommend/forward the

Petitioners applications for vehicle permits to the Secretary to the Treasury (the 13th

Respondent).

The Petitioners placed material before the Court that prior to the issuance of Circular

No. 30/2006 marked as P-12, the vehicle permits had been issued to the employees of

the 1st Respondent Board amalgamating the service periods in Grade III and the Salary

Code MM 1-3. Under the above-stated circumstances, Petitioners argue that the refusal

of the 1st to 11th Respondents to forward/recommend the Petitioner's applications for

vehicle permits to the 13th Respondent or refusal of issuing the vehicle permits by the

13th Respondent is Ultra Vires, inter alia, for the following reasons.

(a) It is in frustration of Petitioners legitimate expectation;

(b) It is unreasonable and irrational;

(c) The Respondents had failed to take into account the relevant facts;

(d) It is contrary to the Circular marked as P-21;

Therefore, the Petitioners seek the following substantial reliefs.

(a) grant and issue orders in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing P24(a) to

P24(s);

8

(b) grant and issue of an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st

to 11th Respondents to recommend the Petitioners applications for vehicle

permits on concessionary terms and forward the same to the 13th Respondent;

(c) grant and issue an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to

13th Respondents to consider the Petitioners applications for vehicle permits on

the premise that the Petitioners were in the Senior Management Category from

the date of promotion to Grade III;

(d) grant and issue an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to

13th Respondents or one or more of the Respondents, to grant vehicle permits to

the Petitioners;

The Petitioners tendered to Court Treasury Circulars No. 866 issued on 22.02.1999

(marked as P-8) and No. 866(1) issued on 23.06.1999 (marked as P-9) regarding the

issuance of vehicle permits to Government Servants at that time on concessionary

terms. Responding to a letter sent by the Chairman of the 1st Respondent Board to the

Department of Fiscal Policy and Economic Affairs for clarification of P-8, by letter

dated 14.12.1999 the Department of Fiscal Policy and Economic Affairs has informed

the Chairman of the 1st Respondent Board by letter dated 14.12.1999 marked as P-11

that the Treasury has decided to extend the eligible level up to Executive Grade III of

the 1st Respondent Board for the purpose of importation of vehicles on concessionary

terms as per Circulars marked as P-8 and P-9.

Thereafter in 2016, the Ministry of Finance issued Trade and Investment Policy

Department Circular No. 01/2016 dated 14.07.2016 (P-20) regarding the importation

of vehicles on concessionary terms. Section 1.9 of P-20 applies to the officers in the 1st

Respondent Board regarding the issuance of vehicle permits and accordingly, the

officers who have completed 12 years of active service period and confirmed in a

9

Senior Level executive position in State Corporations or Statutory Institutions are

eligible to obtain vehicle permits on concessionary terms. Even though the 1st, 2nd and

7th Petitioners have completed 12 years in Grade III and applied for permits in terms of

P-20, their applications were rejected without giving reasons.

In 2018 again the Minister of Finance issued the Trade and Investment Policy

Department Circular dated 15.02.2018 bearing No. 01/2018 (marked as P-21) regarding

the issuance of vehicle permits and Section 1.9 of P-21 applies to the officers in State

Corporations and Statutory Bodies. Section 1.9 thus provides;

Officers who have completed 12 years active service period in State Corporations or

Statutory Bodies and confirmed at Senior Level executive positions as defined in

Schedule III of the Management Services Circular No. 02/2016 of 25.04.2016 within

the cadre approved by the Department of Management Services.

After issuance of the Circular marked as P-21, 1st to 14th and 19th Petitioners applied

for vehicle permits since they have completed 12 years to the date of issuance of P-21

from the date which they were promoted to Grade III. Nevertheless, those applications

were rejected without any reasons being given. The Chairman of the 1st Respondent

Board by letter dated 15.07.2019 marked as P-22 informed the Secretary of the Salaries

and Cadre Commission about the injustice caused to the Petitioners due to the erroneous

reclassification of employees in the 1st Respondent Board in terms of the Management

Circular No. 30/2006 marked as P-12. Thereafter all the Petitioners, in or about

November 2019 applied for vehicle permits (P-23(a) and P-23(s)). In respect of those

applications, the 11th Respondent by the letters dated 20.01.2020 marked as P-24(a) to

P-24(s) informed the Petitioners that in terms of Circular marked as P-21, the

10

Petitioners ought to complete 12 years in positions belonging to the Salary Code of

MM or HM to be eligible for vehicle permits.

The Petitioners contend that the 1st to 11th Respondents failed or refused to recommend

Petitioners applications for vehicle permits and/or failed or refused to forward their

applications to the 13th Respondent. The Petitioners drew the attention of the Court to

the fact that before P-12 was issued, under the previous Circulars regarding the vehicle

permits, 12 officers in the 1st Respondent Board had been issued with vehicle permits

considering and amalgamating their service periods in Grade III and Salary Scale of

MM 1-1 (P-25 and P-26).

The section which applies to vehicle permits of the Petitioners in this Writ Application

is Section 1.9 of the Circular dated 15.02.2018 of the Trade and Investment Policy

Department of the Ministry of Finance marked as P-21. According to Section 1.9, the

executive officers who have completed 12 years of active service in State Corporations

or Statutory Bodies at the Senior Level as defined in Schedule III of the Management

Services Circular No. 02/2016 of 25.04.2016 are eligible for the vehicle permits. That

Circular is tendered to Court by the Respondents with their written submissions on the

direction of the Court. Even though it is a relevant document for the case of the

Petitioners, they had failed to furnish it at the institution of this action. According to

item 4 of Schedule III of the said Circular, the Senior Level which is expected to be

eligible in terms of the Circular marked as P-21 for vehicle permits is Middle

Management (MM) or Higher Management (HM) levels. Nevertheless, the

Petitioners belong to the Junior Management (JM) category and the officers in that

category are not entitled to the vehicle permits. Therefore, the refusal of the 1st to 11th

Respondents to recommend the Petitioners applications for vehicle permits to the 13th

11

Respondent for the reason that they had not fulfilled the requirements in Circular No.

01/2018 marked as P-21 is legal and not ultra vires as argue by the Petitioners.

The Petitioners also argue that the decision not to issue vehicle permits violates their

legitimate expectations. That argument is based on the fact that, in terms of the Circulars

issued before P-21 regarding the vehicle permits the officers of the 1st Respondent

Board who were in the same salary scale which the Petitioners are now in, were issued

with vehicle permits and as a result of changing the conditions of the Circular by P-21

they became ineligible to the vehicle permits. If the expectation of the Petitioners is

legitimate only, they could have argued that the decision not to issue vehicle permits is

a violation of their legitimate expectation.1 Nevertheless, as per Circular marked as P-

21, the Petitioners are not entitled to vehicle permits even though they were eligible for

vehicle permits under the old Circulars. The Petitioners do not argue that the decision

or action to change the conditions in the previous Circulars and issue Circular marked

as P-21 is illegal or an abuse of power.

Priyantha Jayawardena, PC. J. observed in the case of Ginigathgala Mohandiramlage

Nimalsiri Vs Colonel P.P.J. Fernando and Six Others2, that,

an expectation is considered to be legitimate where it is founded upon a promise or

practice by the authority that is said to be bound to fulfil the expectation. Therefore, an

expectation reasonably entertained by a person may not be considered as legitimate

because of some countervailing consideration of policy or law. Further, clear statutory

words override any expectation howsoever founded. Where an expectation is founded

1 Vasana v. Incorporated Council of Legal Education and Others (2004) 1 SLR 159. 2 SC FR No. 256/2010, SC Minutes of 17th September 2015.

12

on a policy and later a relevant change of policy is notified, the expectation founded

on the previous policy cannot be considered as legitimate. (Emphasis added)

In the case of Union of India Vs Hindustan Development Corporation,3 the Supreme

Court of India held that,

The courts jurisdiction to interfere is very much limited and much less in granting

any relief in a claim based purely on the ground of 'legitimate expectation'. A decision

denying a legitimate expectation based on a policy or change of an old policy, or in

the public interest either by way of G.O., rule or is made by way of legislation does

not qualify for interference unless in a given case, the decision or action taken

amounts to an abuse of power. (Emphasis added)

In the case of W. A. Albert Vs Chief Secretary, Southern Province and 3 Others4, this

Court has held that,

An expectation whose fulfilment requires that a decision maker should make an

unlawful decision, cannot be a legitimate expectation. Thus, it is necessary that the

fulfilment of the legitimate expectation, breach of which is complained of, must be

within the powers of the relevant public authority.

In the case of Union of India Vs Hindustan Development Corporation cited above it

was held that,

As observed in the Attorney General for New South Wales' case "To strike down the

exercise of administrative power solely on the ground of avoiding the disappointment

of the legitimate expectations of an individual would be to set the courts adrift on a

featureless sea of pragmatism. Moreover, the notion of a legitimate expectation (falling

3 [1993] Indlaw SC 1085. 4 C A Writ Application No.401/2015, CA Minutes of 11th October 2016 at Page 11.

13

short of a legal right) is too nebulous to form a basis for invalidating the exercise of

power when its exercise otherwise accords with law." If a denial of legitimate

expectation in a given case amounts to a denial of a right guaranteed or is arbitrary,

discriminatory unfair or biased, gross abuse of power or violation of principles of

natural justice, the same can be questioned on the well-known grounds. but a claim

based on mere legitimate expectation without anything more cannot ipso facto give a

right to invoke these principles.

Since the Petitioners are not entitled to vehicle permits as a result of amending the

Circular on a Cabinet decision, in light of the above-stated legal literature they cannot

argue that the decision not to issue vehicle permits to them is a violation of their

legitimate expectations and/or compel the Court to issue vehicle permits to them

violating the conditions mentioned in P-21.

When the salary structure of the employees in the 1st Respondent Board was

restructured in terms of P-12, the Petitioners were placed in a lower Salary Code than

the Salary Code in which they should be placed and the decision to place them on the

lower salary scale had been officially informed to them in 2013 by the 1st Respondent

Board. Against that act up till this Writ Application was instituted in 2020 in laps of

seven years, the only effective step the Petitioners had taken to rectify that was making

a complaint to the Labour Commissioner. The said delay of seven years has not been

explained by the Petitioners. In Seneviratne Vs Tissa Bandaranayake and another5,

Amerasinghe J. adverting to the question of long delay, commented that,

If a person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law refuses

afterwards to lend him any assistance to enforce his rights; the law both to punish his

5 1999 (2) SLR 341 at Page 351.

14

neglect, nam leges vigilantibus, non dormientibus, subveniunt, and for other reasons

refuses to assist those who sleep over their rights and are not vigilant.

Hence, the Petitioners in the case at hand have slept over their rights and have not been

vigilant, without undertaking the required measures to have themselves placed in the

correct Salary Code they are not entitled to the reliefs prayed for.

Considering all the above-stated circumstances, I hold that the Petitioners are not

entitled to the reliefs prayed for in the Petition to this Writ Application and the

Application should be dismissed. Accordingly, I dismiss this Writ Application without

costs.

Application dismissed.

No costs ordered.
