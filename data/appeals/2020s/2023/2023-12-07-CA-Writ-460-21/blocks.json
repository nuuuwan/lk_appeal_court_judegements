However, the Petitioner had objected to such a transfer. As such, it is claimed that at that point the property could not have been transferred to the 5th Respondent. Subsequently, after the death of the Petitioner's mother, the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent decided to transfer the property in question to the heirs of the original lessee Mr. Gunadasa so that each heir shall be entitled for an undivided 1/5 share of the property. Accordingly, even though the heirs of the original lessee Mr. Gunadasa were requested to submit the necessary documents to transfer the relevant undivided shares to them by letter dated 25.08.2011(P5) and letter dated 22.03.2017(P6), except the Petitioner, the other heirs (5th -8th Respondents) failed to submit such documents. Therefore, it is claimed that the 1st -4th Respondents were unable to take any final decision on the impugned matter in accordance with Circular No. 2011/. /./05(1R4) which prevailed at the relevant time. It has been submitted that the subsequent Circulars No.2018///01(P12/1R5) and No.2018/// 02 (P13/1R6) had come into effect in 2018 superseding the above Circular No. 2011/ //05(1R4).
