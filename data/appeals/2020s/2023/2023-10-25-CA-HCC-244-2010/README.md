Sasi Mahendran, J.

The 2nd Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted

together with Mohamed Faleel (1st Accused) and Abdul Majeed (3rd Accused) before the

High Court of Kalmunai on the 15th of December 2010, on two counts:

Count 1- On or about 06.05.2003 at Kalmunai the Accused together with the

said 1st and 3rd Accused Allegedly conspired to murder one Athambawa Sahul

Hameed an offence punishable under Section 113(b) and 102 of the Penal Code.

Count 2- On the said date, time and place the Accused together with the 3rd

Accused caused the death of one Athambawa Sahul Hameed, an offence

punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

After the trial, The Learned High Court Judge Convicted the 2nd Accused for

murder and was sentenced to death and the other two were acquitted.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction the Accused has appealed to this court.

The following are the grounds of appeal as per the written submission:

i. The learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the discrepancies in the

evidence tendered by the witnesses of the prosecution.

ii. The learned High Court Judge had attached probative value to the evidence of the

1st Witness, especially regarding the identity of the accused despite the omission

and contradiction of her (1st Witness's) evidence, misdirected herself (the learned

3

High Court Judge), and concluded that the identity of the accused was proven

beyond reasonable doubt.

iii. The learned High Court Judge erred in law and in fact. and misdirected herself

when stating in her judgment that the omissions and contradictions that were

marked did not affect the root of the case whereas the same had cast a serious doubt

regarding the identity of the accused.

iv. The learned High Court Judge had erred in law by rejecting the dock statement of

the Accused before the High Court trial, by comparing the dock statement by the

Accused before the learned Magistrate of Kalmunai at the non summary inquiry on

the basis that there were differences between the dock statements whereas it was

not so.

v. The learned High Court Judge had utilized the weaknesses of the case of the defense

in order to strengthen the case of the prosecution, which is contrary to the norms of

criminal prosecution.

The following are the facts and circumstances of this case;

Upon scrutiny of the testimony provided by PW1 Sahul Hameed, the

daughter of the deceased and the sole eye-witness to this case, several salient

points emerge. According to her testimony, she was awakened by an explosive

sound, which she later confirmed as a gunshot during her cross-examination. She

saw an individual fleeing from her parent's room and subsequently encountered

another individual who knocked her shoulder and fled, jumping over the parapet

wall. PW1 asserts that she saw a portion of the Accused's face and later identified

him at the Identification Parade conducted at the Kalmunai Lower Court.

During cross-examination by the Counsel for the Accused, PW1 maintained

her account. She elaborated that although she did not see the second individual's

face directly, she did see it from a side angle and described specific facial features.

She also stated that the area had sufficient light from a nearby lavatory and

streetlight, further confirmed when her younger sister (PW2) switched on

additional lights.

The principal issue for this court's consideration is the adequacy of the

lighting conditions at the time of the incident, which directly correlates to the

4

credibility of PW1's identification of the Accused. Specifically, the court is

concerned with whether the lighting conditions were sufficient to enable an

accurate identification by the witness.

In addressing this issue, we take note of the specific queries put forth by

the Counsel for the Accused concerning the lighting conditions during cross-

examination.

On page 136 of the brief;

Q: Did you put the light on when you ran?

A: No

On page 137 of the brief;

Q: Did you put the light on when you went out?

A: I did not put the light

Q: On that occasion you said you saw somebody else also ran?

A: yes

Q: How did you see that?

A: When he knocked against my shoulder and I turned somebody else also ran

On page 142 of the brief;

Q: In the statement you gave the police you had said you did not see the person. At present

when you give evidence you say that you have seen his face. Which is correct? You have

said, a thin man that you have not seen his face.

A: I did not say so. I did not see his face directly,

Q: That means what did you see?

A: I saw his face sideways

On page 148 of the brief;

Q: You getting up on hearing the noise a person resembling your father running. Later

another one knocking against your shoulder and your mother and sister coming and

putting the light, within the duration of how soon all this happened?

A: Continuously within 1, 1 minutes it happened.

.

Q: Did you get the opportunity to identify his face?

A: No

In further analyzing the testimony related to the lighting conditions at the time of

the incident, it is instructive to also consider the evidence given by PW2. She confirms

that she woke up and proceeded toward PW1, stating that only the bathroom light was on

during this time. This assertion provides supplementary context to PW1's claim about the

adequacy of the lighting conditions, which she says were further augmented by a

streetlight.

The Defense's main objection centers around the accuracy of PW1's identification

of the 2nd Accused. This is a pivotal point in the trial given that PW1 is the sole eye-

witness to the crime. The issue of identification is paramount and necessitates rigorous

scrutiny, especially in a criminal trial where the stakes are exceedingly high and could

significantly impact the prosecution's case.

In the recent judgement of Dassanayake Lekamlage Somapala alias Gangabada

Sudu and others v A.G, C. A 208 210/2011, decided on 02.09.2014, His Lordship Anil

Goonarathne J, echoed our concern:

A very important aspect of a criminal trial is that the perpetrators of the crime need

to be identified with certainty. Absence of identity of accused would be fatal to the

prosecution case. The learned High Court Judge has merely referred to the items of

evidence of the declaration (P5) but has not considered its probative value.

With regard to the identity of the Accused our courts have followed the principles

set out by His Lordship, Lord Widgrey CJ, in R v Turnbull and another [1977] (1) QB 224

at page 228;

First, whenever the case against an accused depends wholly or substantially on

the correctness of one or more identifications of the accused which the defence alleges to

be mistaken, the judge should warn the jury of the special need for caution before

convicting the accused in reliance on the correctness of the identification or

identifications. In addition he should instruct them as to the reason for the need for such

a warning and should make some reference to the possibility that a mistaken witness can

be a convincing one and that a number of such witnesses can all be mistaken. Provided

this is done in clear terms the judge need not use any particular form of words.

6

Secondly, the judge should direct the jury to examine closely the circumstances in

which the identification by each witness came to be made. How long did the witness have

the accused under observation? At what distance? In what light? Was the observation

impeded in any way, as for example by passing traffic or a press of people? Had the witness

ever seen the accused before? How often? If only occasionally, had he any special reason

for remembering the accused? How long elapsed between the original observation and the

subsequent identification to the police? Was there any material discrepancy between the

description of the accused given to the police by the witness when first seen by them and

his actual appearance?

It should be noted that when the 2nd Accused was produced before the

identification parade, PW9, who conducted the parade, stated that the witness had

identified the Accused who was standing directly in front of her. However, according to

PW1, she identified the Accused from a sideways angle.

For the instant case, we shall concurrently compare the evidence with that of the

principles laid out in R v Turnbull (Supra). According to PW1s evidence

1. She was only able to identify the 2nd Accused within the span of 1 minutes as

she had only seen the side portion of his face

2. She had not observed his face in close proximity as the 2nd Accused had knocked

on her shoulder while fleeing

3. The area had poor lighting conditions which was established by the evidence of

PW2

4. She had not known the 2nd Accused as he is a complete stranger to her

In the case of Opatha Widanapathiranege Wasantha and 3 Others v. Attorney

General, CA 179/2006, decided on 29.04.2010, His Lordship W.L. Ranjith Silva, J, held

that:

The Learned Trial Judge ought to have followed the standard guidelines with

regard to his directions to the jury. On the issue of identification evidence the judges must

give accurate directions regarding the identification evidence and direct the jury that they

must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused were correctly identified and

give the benefit of any doubt to the accused. The Jury must be directed as to the possibility

7

of a mistaken identity even by honest witnesses and if they cannot make up their minds

as to whether the witnesses were lying or mistaken the accused must be given the benefit

of the doubt and should be acquitted. The trial judge must direct the jury to examine

closely the circumstances under which the identification came to be made and the means

of identification. The trial judge should direct the jury on the rules laid down in Rex v.

Turnbull.

The aforementioned judgement was referred to in the recent case of Shamila

Ishan Gunasinghe v A.G, C. A 209/2015, decided on 30.10.2017, by Her Ladyship S.Devika

De Livera Tennekoon J.

Upon scrutinizing the evidence provided by PW1, along with the above

observations, I am of the view that her testimony regarding identification casts doubt due

to a lack of cogent evidence concerning the identification of the Accused. In this instance,

the Learned High Court Judge has convicted the Accused of the murder of the Deceased

primarily based on PW1's evidence. However, we find that this evidence is insufficient to

establish the prosecution's case beyond a reasonable doubt.

In light of the above facts and circumstances, it is unsafe to allow the conviction

to stand. When the Accused are facing a capital charge, every point in favor of the Accused

needs to be considered. Therefore, we set aside the conviction and sentence and allow this

appeal.

This appeal is allowed.
