JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

According to the Appellant, during his tenure as the Secretary to the

Ministry of Petroleum Industries, a stock of Octane 92 Petroleum had

been imported by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) from a

Company based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates Governments national

oil company named Emirates National Oil Company or more

commonly referred to as ENOC. As few vehicles which had run on the

said stock of 92 Octane Petroleum had developed engine troubles,

after receiving complaints, the Complainant-Respondent-Respondent

(Hereinafter referred to as the Complainant) had commenced

investigations and decided to file charges against the 1st Accused-

Petitioner-Appellant-Appellant (Hereinafter referred to as the Appellant)

and the 2nd Accused-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the 2nd Accused).

As directed the Appellant and the 2nd Accused appeared before the

Learned Magistrate of Colombo on 22.01.2013 and were formally

charged under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.

The Counsel for the Appellant raised a preliminary objection during the

course of the trial stating that the charge cannot be maintained as the

Complainant had failed to comply with regard to the mandatory

requirement of initiating the proceedings by a written sanction under

Section 78(1) of the Bribery Act.

The Learned Magistrate by his order dated 26.09.2014 rejected the

preliminary objection on the basis that when the Complainant acting

under the directive of the Commission to Investigate Allegation of

Bribery or Corruption) (Hereinafter referred to as the CIABOC) acts

under Section 136(1) (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

CA (PHC) 33/17

6 | P a g e

1979 it is expressly stated that the Complainant acts on the directives

of the CIABOC and therefore it is an instance where action is filed by

the CIABOC and there is due compliance by the Complainant of the

provisions of Section 78(1).

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned Magistrate, the

Appellant filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province Holden in Colombo. The Learned High Court Judge in

interpreting Section 78(1) of the Bribery Act held that when action is

being instituted by the Commission through the Complainant, there is

no requirement of a written sanction by the Commission, dismissed the

revision application No. HCRA 22/2015 and affirmed the order of the

Learned Magistrate of Colombo.

Now the Appellant filing this appeal against the order of Learned High

Court Judge of Colombo, contends that that even in instances where an

action is instituted by the Director General of CIABOC on a directive by

the CIABOC written sanction is necessary.

Section 78 (1) states:

No Magistrates Court shall entertain any prosecution for an

offence under this Act except by or with the written sanction of

the Commission.

The validity of a legislation passed by Parliament cannot be called into

question after the stage set out in Article 80(3) of the Constitution. The

said Article reads as follows:

Where a Bill becomes law upon the certificate of the President, or

the Speaker, as the case may be, being endorsed thereon, no

court or tribunal shall inquire into, pronounce upon or in any

manner call in question, the validity of such Act on any ground

whatsoever.

An important bench of five Justices of Supreme Court in Attorney

General and Others v. Sumathipala [2006] 2 SLR 126 held that:

A judge cannot under a thin guise of interpretation usurp the

function of the legislature to achieve a result that the Judge thinks

is desirable in the interests of justice. Therefore, the role of the

judge is to give effect to the expressed intention of Parliament as it

is the bounden duty of any Court and the function of every Judge

to do justice within the stipulated parameters.

In interpreting the Section 78(1) of the Bribery Act, the Learned High

Court Judge held that when action is being instituted by the

Commission there is no requirement of a written sanction by the

Commission. In my view this is the intention of the Legislature when

enacted the Bribery Law.

There are several judgements had been delivered by the Apex Court of

our country time to time. The Appellant had heavily relied on the

decision in Nandasena Gotabaya Rajapaksha v. DG CIABOC (CA

Revision APN/29/2018) decided on 12.09. 2019.In that case their

Lordship held that:

The prosecution by the Commission is therefore clearly legislative

residue from Section 78(1) from the statutory provisions that existed

before the amendments brought is by Act Nos. 19 and 20 of 1994,

with no corresponding power conferred on the Commission to institute

proceeding. In the circumstances, the orders of the Magistrates Court

and the Provincial High Court are tainted with illegality and thereby

subjected to be interfered with by this Court in exercising its power of

revision.

With utmost respect to their Lordships, I cant see eye to eye with the

above judgment and the reasoning given.

As stated by Salmond, by interpretation or construction is meant, the

process by which the courts seek to ascertain the meaning of the

legislature through the medium of authoritative forms in which it is

expressed.

Interpretation of statutes is the process of ascertain the true meaning of

the words used in a statute. When language is of the statue is clear,

there is no need the rules of Interpretation, But, in certain cases, more

than one meaning may be derived from the same word or sentence. It is

therefore necessary to interpret the statue to find out the real intention

of the statute.

In this regard, a Constitution Bench of five Judges of the Supreme

Court of India in R.S.Nayak v.A.R.Antulay,AIR 1984 SC 684 has held:

. If the words of the Statute are clear and unambiguous, it is

the plainest duty of the Court to give effect to the natural meaning

of the words used in the provision. The question of construction

arises only in the event of an ambiguity or the plain meaning of the

words used in the Statute would be self-defeating. (para 18)

The purpose of Interpretation of Statutes is to help the Judge to

ascertain the intention of the Legislature-not to control that intention or

to confine it within the limits, which the Judge may deem reasonable or

expedient.

In Tennakoon v. Dissanakayake 50 NLR 403 the court held that:

..the plain meaning of the language of an antiquated statute cannot

be given an extended judicial interpretation so as to cope with modern

methods of corruption.

In Nandasena v Senanayake and Others [1981] 1 SLR 238 the Court

held that:

Statutes should be construed, as far as possible, to avoid absurdity

or futility. A statute should be construed in manner to give it validity

rather than invalidity- ut res magis valeat quam pereat.

The judicial decisions cited above and the writings amply demonstrate

that the Court cannot under the guise of interpretation usurp the

intention of the legislature.

In this case the Learned Magistrate as well as the Learned High Court

Judge had followed the literal interpretation of the section concerned.

In the recent judgment in TAB 1A and 1B/2020 decided on

11/01/2023, His Lordship Kodagoda,PC, J. held that:

In the circumstances it is clear that, the Supreme Court when

deciding Anoma S.Polwatte v. Director General Commission to

Investigate Allegation of Bribery and Corruption (supra) had

never intended to impose an additional requirement to submit a

written directive when filing charges before Court, and therefore this

Court is not inclined to impose an additional requirement other than

the provisions already identified.

Considering the interpretation given to the Section 78(1) of the Bribery

Act by the Learned High Court Judge, written sanction requirement is

unnecessary and only cause an additional requirement which certainly

obstruct or delay the smooth function of the Bribery Act. This Court

satisfies that the Bribery Commission had given directions to institute

proceeding in the Magistrate Court of Colombo under section 78(1)

which had been correctly endorsed by the High Court of Colombo as

written sanction requirement contemplated by the Appellant would only

be superfluous.

Therefore, this appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgment to the

High Court of Colombo and the Magistrate Court of Colombo along with

the original case record, if any.
