Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Vavuniya for having committed the offences of

possession and trafficking of 5.919 kilograms of Diacetylmorphine (commonly

known as Heroin) on 14-06-2006, and thereby committing offences in terms of

sections 54A (b) and 54A (d) of the Poisons, Opium And Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984, punishable as stipulated in the

Ordinance.

The Attorney General, by his letter dated 26-08-2009 had transferred the case

to be heard before the High Court of Colombo. After trial, the appellant was found

guilty for both the counts preferred against him, namely, possession and

trafficking of Heroin, of the judgement dated 12-08-2015 by the learned High

Court Judge of Colombo, and accordingly he was sentenced to life imprisonment

on both the counts.

It is against the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant has preferred

this appeal, challenging both the conviction and the sentence.

Page 3 of 36

When this matter was taken up for hearing before this Court, the learned

Presidents Counsel representing the appellant sought permission of the Court

to make submissions in relation to the sentence imposed upon the appellant,

which was allowed by this Court. It was the contention of the learned Presidents

Counsel that although the sentence prescribed by the Ordinance is a mandatory

sentence, there was no impediment for a trial Court to deviate from the

mandatory sentence, as judicial discretion cannot be restricted by way of a

statute. He cited several judgements in that regard, and sought an order from

this Court before he proceeds to argue the appeal proper.

Having listened to the learned Presidents Counsel as well as the learned

Additional Solicitor General (ASG) who represented the complainant-respondent

then, this Court pronounced the order dated 01-04-2022 and dismissed the

contention of the learned Presidents Counsel in that regard.

When this matter was taken up for argument accordingly, the learned Presidents

Counsel formulated the following ground of appeal for the consideration of the

Court.

The Ground of Appeal

1. In considering the totality of the evidence and the judgement, and the

questions asked by the trial Judge when the appellant was giving

evidence, there was no fair trial for the appellant guaranteed under

Article 13 (3) and 13 (5) of The Constitution.

Before considering the submissions made in relation to the ground of appeal

urged by the learned Presidents Counsel, and that of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General (DSG) in that regard, I will now consider the facts as revealed

by the evidence before the trial Court as summarily as possible in the following

manner.

Page 4 of 36

Facts in Brief

PW-01 Chief Inspector of Police Upul Seneviratne was the Officer-in-Charge of

Murukkan police station in Vavuniya on 14-06-2006, which is the date relevant

to this incident.

Around 14.30 in the evening, while at his station, he has received a telephone

call from a person who spoke in broken Sinhala language, informing him that a

person is travelling with a suspicious looking parcel. Few minutes thereafter, at

14.35, he has received another call from a Captain of the Thalladi Army Camp

of a person travelling with a suspicious parcel, which may be a concealed

weapon.

After making the relevant notes of the information received by him, he

immediately proceeded to meet his supervising officer who was the Senior

Superintendent of Police in charge of Zone 10 and informed him of the

information. With his approval, he has assembled a team of police officers and

had issued them with the necessary weapons, as the area they have to travel

was an area having frequent terrorist activities. Subsequently, he has left in the

vehicle number WP HD-9791 to inquire into the information.

As he has received the information that the suspected person is travelling in the

bus of Rathna Tours travelling towards Colombo, he has informed the forward

roadblocks to stop the bus and wait for him. When he reached the roadblock at

Zone 01, he has seen the relevant bus parked as instructed by him. The bus was

parked facing towards Colombo. He has reached the place at 15.10 hours and

after providing security to the rear door, he has entered the bus from the front

door along with 2 other officers, and had instructed the passengers to take their

identity cards and belongings for the police to inspect the same.

At that time all the passengers were seated, and there were some vacant seats

as well. When he reached the right-side front seat next to the drivers seat, the

person seated there had identified himself as Major Kariyawasam and had given

Page 5 of 36

his identity card. Next to the Major, a Police Sergeant serving in his own station

who left the police station on leave was seated.

The Major was dressed in civilian clothes and had a black coloured large bag on

his lap. When he directed the Major to open the bag, he has observed that he

panicked, and was reluctant to open the bag, but had stated that he wishes to

speak with the witness. As the bag was with a padlock, the witness has directed

the person to get the key, for which he has replied that the key is in Colombo.

Having failed to get the person to open the bag voluntarily, the witness has

searched his trouser pockets and found a key inside the purse the person was

carrying, which appeared to be the key of the padlock. When the witness opened

the bag using the key the person had in his possession, he has discovered 15

neatly packed and taped parcels of about 10 x 06 inches. Realizing that these

packets may carry prohibited drugs through his experience, he has pierced one

of the parcels and had taken out a small sample of the powder like content inside,

and had confirmed for himself that the contents are Diacetylmorphine or Heroin.

Accordingly, PW-01 has arrested the person who possessed the drugs, after

informing the charge against him. At the trial, he has identified the appellant as

the person who was arrested by him. Apart from the parcel that was on the lap

of the appellant, he had found another bag under the seat, where he has found

a camouflaged army uniform as well as a uniform of an Army Major. The arrest

has been made at 15.15 hours.

After a brief inspection, he has taken charge of the productions and the appellant

and had decided to immediately go back to his police station, as the area where

the detection took place was a highly insecure area due to constant terrorist

activities. His intention had been to reach a secured location as soon as possible

to conduct further investigations.

In his evidence, the witness has described the steps he took to secure the safety

of the productions and the appellant, who was under his custody. At the police

station, he has weighed the gross weight of the 15 packets he took into custody

Page 6 of 36

from the possession of the appellant, and had taken necessary steps to seal the

productions and enter the productions under PR 166/2006 in the police station

PR registry. In the 15 parcels recovered from the custody of the appellant, PW-

01 has found little over 1 kilogram of the substance he suspected to be Heroin

in each of the packets, which had a total content of over 15 kilograms. After the

due procedural steps, the PW-01 has taken the relevant steps to produce the

appellant before the Magistrate of Mannar.

The witness has identified the productions he detected and had marked the same

before the trial Court. He has explained the procedure he has followed to take

charge of all the other productions recovered and the steps he took in that regard

as well. He has marked and produced the relevant other productions before the

trial Judge.

The next witness of importance called by the prosecution to prove its case was

PW-04 Lance Corporal Dissanayake. He had been serving at the Thalladi Camp

of Sri Lanka Army during the time relevant to this incident as a Corporal

attached to the military police.

His commanding officer had been Major Ratnayake who was a Captain during

the time relevant to this incident. He had been assigned the motorbike numbered

UA 100-606 for his duties as a military police officer. On the day relevant to this

incident, he had been summoned by his commanding officer, and when he

entered his office, he has pointed to the person seated in front of him and

informed that he was an officer who had come from Colombo to travel to

Puthukaman Army Camp on an official duty, and to take him to the said camp

on his motorbike. The said person was wearing a camouflaged army uniform

indicating the rank of a Major and he has identified him as the appellant at the

trial. He has come to know him as Major Kariyawasam. Following the order, he

has taken the appellant in his motorbike intending to go to the Puthukaman

Army Camp, which is situated towards Medawachchiya from his camp at

Thalladi. However, instead of going towards Medawachchiya, the appellant has

Page 7 of 36

ordered the witness to travel towards the opposite direction towards Mannar,

informing him that he needs to go to Mannar to collect some dry fish from a

friend and thereafter, he will be going to the Puthukaman camp. Although PW-

04 was reluctant, he has followed the orders of the appellant since he was a

senior army officer and he had no way of disobeying his orders. After reaching

Mannar, the appellant has directed the witness to travel towards Talaimannar,

which was in an unsecured area. Although the PW-04 was carrying a T-56

weapon, he has informed the appellant that traveling in this area is highly

dangerous as he was dressed in army uniform. The appellant has said do not be

afraid and travel. They have travelled for about 15 20 kilometers towards

Talaimannar and the appellant has directed the witness to turn left from the

Pesalai junction towards Murugan Kovil road. After travelling for about 200

meters, the appellant has directed the witness to stop and the appellant has got

down. Then he has seen the priest of the Kovil coming out and having a

discussion with the appellant. The appellant has returned and got onto the

motorbike and had directed the witness to travel further. When they travelled

about 25 meters, a well-built person has come towards them in a foot bicycle.

The appellant has directed the witness to stop the bike and had gone towards

the person and had another discussion. Afterwards, the said person had turned

back and paddled the foot bicycle. The appellant had directed the witness to

follow him in the motorbike, and after travelling for about 50 meters, the

appellant had asked the witness to stop near a large house, which had parapet

walls around it. The appellant had gone inside the house and had returned after

about 20 30 minutes, this time carrying a black coloured large bag hanging on

his shoulder.

Thereafter, the appellant has informed PW-04 that he got the dry fish and to

travel fast because it is late and he needs to go back to Colombo. While on their

way back, his bike has suffered a tyre puncture near Mannar hospital and the

witness has taken the bike to a repair shop nearby. While they were waiting

inside the repair shop for the repair to be completed, the witness has observed

Page 8 of 36

the black coloured bag the appellant brought from the house having a padlock,

which had aroused his suspicions. Waiting for an opportune moment where the

appellant had walked out of the repair shop, the witness had gone near the bag

and smelled it to find whether it emanates any dry fish smell, and it was his

evidence that there was no such smell emanating from the bag.

After the repair was done, the appellant had instructed the witness to travel

towards Puthukaman. However, as the witness suspected some foul play, he has

lied to the appellant saying that the motorbike has no fuel and he has to get back

to the Thalladi camp to obtain more petrol. The appellant has resisted this and

had informed the witness that it is not necessary to go the camp, but to take the

bike to a petrol station nearby and that he will pay for the petrol. The witness

has stated the appellant that it cannot be done as it would amount to an offence

to get petrol from private sources and had suggested to the appellant to wait near

the place called Runaway Point, which was about 500 meters away from the

camp, and he will go to the camp and get the required petrol and return.

Reluctantly, the appellant had agreed.

After reaching the entrance to the camp, PW-04 has contacted Captain

Ratnayake who was his commanding officer and the officer who directed him to

take the appellant to Puthukaman, and informed him of what happened. Captain

Ratnayake along with the witness has returned to the Runaway Point where the

appellant was, and has found that the appellant has left the place in a firewood

lorry that was travelling to Puthukaman army camp. Although both of them had

gone in pursuit of the vehicle, they had been unable to track it, but when

inquired from the next checkpoint about the vehicle, they have been informed

that the appellant gotten down at the checkpoint, and changed his uniform to

civilian clothing and had gotten onto the Rathna tour bus plying from Mannar

to Colombo. They have decided to pursue the bus and when they had reached

the 215 Brigade Headquarters which was about 15 kilometers away, they had

come to know that the bus has gone past that place. After realizing that they

cannot catch up with the bus by traveling on a motorbike, Captain Ratnayake

Page 9 of 36

has gone inside the Brigade Headquarters and obtained an army truck from the

camp and had pursued the bus further. When reaching the Medawachchi

Parayanakulam junction, they have seen the bus being stopped. They have

observed the appellant under the custody of the Murukkan police. The witness

has identified the appellant as the person who travelled with him and the bag

marked P-05 as the bag the appellant brought from the house near the Kovil. It

was also his evidence that while traveling towards Talaimannar, the appellant

wanted him to stop the bike and took calls 4 5 times using his mobile phone

and informed him that it was from his wife who was worried about his travel to

Mannar. He has testified that when he saw him in police custody, he was in

civilian clothes and had identified the bag marked as P-31 as the bag the

appellant had with him when he met the appellant for the first time in Captain

Ratnayakes office.

Under cross-examination, PW-04 has testified that when the appellant brought

the bag marked P-05, it had a shoulder strap, but the P-05 produced for his

identification had no such strap. It had been suggested to the witness that he

never took the appellant to Talaimannar and he was lying in that regard, and it

was the witness who instigated Captain Ratnayake by telling a falsehood to him,

which the witness has denied saying that he had nothing personal against the

appellant and it was the first time he met him. It was also suggested to him that

the witness did not drop off the appellant near the runaway point as claimed by

him, but near the bunker situated at the turn off to the army camp and he

informed the witness that he needs to wait for one Captain Samaraweera until

he returns from duties, which the witness has again denied saying that it was

not what happened. It was the suggestion made on behalf of the appellant that

the witness is giving false evidence at the instigation of the Police Narcotics

Bureau, which the witness had denied again.

PW-02 who was the Captain Ratnayake mentioned by PW-04 has given evidence

in this matter and had confirmed that on the day in question, the appellant who

was a Major, came to his camp and identified himself as Major Kariyawasam. He

Page 10 of 36

had informed Captain Ratnayake that he came to conduct a preliminary

investigation as to a lost weapon and needs to go to an army unit called 17-SLNG

stationed in Puthukaman area. Accordingly, he has facilitated the appellant to

change into his uniform and provided a motorbike ridden by PW-04 who was

attached to the military police to accompany the appellant. The appellant and

PW-04 have left the camp around 11.30 a.m.

Around 1.15 p.m., PW-04 has given a call using the internal communications of

the camp informing him that the appellant did not go to the place where he

informed that he is going, but went to Mannar and obtained a suspicious parcel.

The witness has corroborated as to the events that took place thereafter, as

stated by PW-04 in Court and, the fact that they saw the appellant in police

custody near the checkpoint.

PW-08 has been one of the police officers who accompanied Chief Inspector

Seneviratne in pursuit of the Rathna tour bus and assisted him in searching the

appellant and arresting him. He has corroborated what Chief Inspector

Seneviratne said in Court in that regard.

PW-05 has been the driver of the Rathna tour bus mentioned in this trial.

According to his evidence, when they were travelling from Mannar to Colombo,

his bus was stopped at Parayanakulam road block and was informed that the

Officer-in-Charge of Murukkan police will come to travel in his bus and to wait

for about 5 minutes. While he was in the process of registering his name at the

checkpoint, the OIC and a team of police officers have come and searched the

bus. It was his evidence that the police arrested the person seated behind the

driving seat along with his bag and taken to the police jeep. He has identified the

person arrested by the police as the appellant in the Court. He has stated further

that the appellant travelled in the bus on their way from Colombo to Mannar as

well, and according to his memory, he got into the bus from either Anuradhapura

or Medawachchiya and wanted him to drop him off at Thalladi camp.

Page 11 of 36

His evidence has been that because of the war situation and several checkpoints

they had to pass, he has the ability to remember a person well, and that is the

reason why he remembers the appellant as a person who travelled in his bus

previously.

It is clear from his evidence that when the police arrived, he was the only person

waiting outside the bus and the search of the appellant had been while he was

seated inside the bus.

The Registrar of the Magistrates Court of Mannar has given evidence in relation

to the handing over of productions to the Court.

PW-03 had been the Commander of the army camp where the appellant had gone

and requested for a vehicle to travel, claiming that he has to conduct an inquiry,

where a motorbike had been provided. He has confirmed the evidence of Captain

Ratnayake and has confirmed the highly volatile situation that existed in the

Talaimannar area during that time, and the precautionary measures the army

used to take while travelling in that area.

When the Government Analyst gave evidence at this trial, the defence has

admitted the competency of the Government Analyst to give evidence, the fact

that the productions had been taken over, properly accepted and the analysis in

terms of section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

The Government Analyst giving evidence has confirmed that the parcels marked

K-01 to K-15 contained a pure quantity of 5919 grams of Diacetylmorphine,

which is also commonly known as Heroin. The prosecution has called evidence

to prove the chain of custody of the productions as well. The prosecution has

recalled PW-01, Chief Inspector Seneviratne to clarify certain matters as to the

identity of the productions, which arose as a result of the evidence of the

Government Analyst.

After the prosecution closed its case, the learned High Court Judge has decided

to call for a defence of the appellant and had informed him of his rights.

Page 12 of 36

The appellant has chosen to give evidence under oath. In his evidence, he has

stated that he had a reason to go to the Mannar area on 14-06-2006. Explaining

the reason, he has stated that he had a financial issue during that period and

one Captain Ajith Samaraweera who served with him in the army was a close

friend of him from his school days, and his family and Captain Samaraweeras

family had a close relationship. It was his position that when he discussed his

financial issues with Captain Samaraweera, he wanted him to come and meet

him at his workplace to help him over the issue and has promised to give him a

cheque, and he was serving at the 17 SLNG camp, which was situated between

Parayanakulam junction and Thalladi army camp. He has stated that towards

reaching the said camp, he got onto a bus from Colombo and got down near the

main camp which was Thalladi camp with the intention of going to 17 SLNG

camp. It was his position that when he started his journey from Colombo, he

was unaware of the location of 17 SLNG camp so he got down near the Thalladi

camp in order to find out from the Commanding Officer of the camp, the location

of the camp he wanted to reach.

He has stated that he was able to meet the Commanding Officer and to obtain a

motorcycle along with a Lance Corporal rider from the military police. He has

claimed that he had to wait for several hours to obtain this facility and he

changed his civilian clothes to a camouflaged uniform in order to travel with the

military police rider. He has admitted that one has to travel passing 17 SLNG

camp to reach the Thalladi camp, but has claimed that he was forced to travel

to Thalladi camp as he was unaware of the said location.

It was his position that to reach the said camp, one has to travel 3 kilometers off

Mannar-Colombo road and once he reached the army check point near the

junction that leads to the camp, he inquired with the assistance of the radio

communication set available with the soldiers manned in the checkpoint whether

Captain Samaraweera is in the camp, and was informed that he has gone out of

the camp for an urgent operation. The appellant has claimed that he decided to

wait near the checkpoint and waited for nearly 2 2.30 hours there expecting

Page 13 of 36

his friend to return. However, the military police Corporal wanted to return to

his camp stating that he cannot wait any longer and there was a verbal

altercation with him in that regard. It was his position that being a Senior Officer,

he insisted the Corporal to stay, but he left the place without obeying his orders.

He has admitted that the said Corporal mentioned by him was Corporal

Dissanayake who gave evidence in this matter. After inquiring from the camp

whether his friend has returned, and after being informed that he will not be

returning until the nightfall, he decided to return to Colombo and changed his

clothing to civilian clothes at the checkpoint and got onto a bus plying from

Mannar to Colombo which is the Rathna tours bus mentioned by the witnesses

in this matter.

He has stated that there was less crowd in the bus at that time and that he sat

on the seat behind the drivers seat. He has claimed that he had only the bag he

took from Colombo. He has denied that he had with him the other bag produced

in this trial which contained Heroin.

He has been adamant that he never travelled to Mannar with Corporal

Dissanayake and never received a black coloured briefcase type bag with a

shoulder strap.

He has admitted that the bus was stopped at the Parayanakulam checkpoint,

but has claimed that the bus was kept there for about 30 minutes, and when

inquired, he was informed that the OIC is coming to travel on the bus. It was his

position that because of the hot weather of the area, he too got down from the

bus along with the driver, and was smoking a cigarette when the police led by

OIC of Murukkan police came and ran towards the bus. He has claimed that

after 2 3 minutes, a police officer inquired who is Major Kariyawasam and at

that point, he got onto the bus and identified himself. It was his position that

when Chief Inspector spoke to him, he showed him the only bag he was carrying

and denied that he had any other bag in his possession. However, according to

him, the Chief Inspector has inquired about another bag and has taken a bag

Page 14 of 36

from the rack above him and had claimed that it belonged to him which he

refuted. He has denied that the police took a key from his purse, but had stated

that he was arrested by the police along with the other bag, and when they could

not open the other bag found, one officer damaged a part of the bag using the

cleaning rod of his T-56 weapon and there was a brown-coloured powder in the

bag. He has strenuously denied that the said bag belonged to him.

He has claimed that after the arrest, he was physically harassed and questioned.

He has further claimed that the police forcibly attempted to take his left thumb

impression to seal the productions, and at that time, his left thumb got burned.

He has denied that he was taken to a hospital, but claimed that the police took

him to various places and ultimately produced him before the Magistrate.

Under cross-examination by the prosecution, he has admitted that the police

officers involved in this detection were not known to him previously and that the

army officers too, apart from meeting them during army operations, have no

enmity with him. He has also admitted that PW-04 Lance Corporal Dissanayake

was a very much junior ranker in the army.

The prosecution has alleged that if the appellant was assaulted as claimed by

him in his evidence, he has failed to put that evidence to the relevant witnesses

when they were cross-examined on behalf of him and there was no dispute when

the police produced the Medico-Legal Examination Form marked P-52 before the

trial Court. Under cross-examination, he has admitted that the bag taken by the

police had a padlock, although he denied that it belongs to him. He has taken

up the position that he wanted to obtain Rs. 200000/= from his friend Captain

Samaraweera.

The position taken up by the prosecution had been that he is making up a story

without any basis, to counter the incriminating evidence presented against him

by the prosecution

Page 15 of 36

Consideration of the Ground of Appeal

During the course of his submissions before this Court, the learned Presidents

Counsel urged the following points for the consideration of the Court to argue

that the appellant did not receive a fair trial, and his appeal should succeed on

that basis.

The indictment was not read and explained to the appellant in his presence

before the trial commenced.

The case was transferred from one High Court to another in Colombo

without giving any reason and at the request of the prosecuting State

Counsel.

The learned High Court Judge failed to mention any legal principles that

a trial Judge should have considered before determining that the case has

been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

The learned High Court Judge has only given a narration of evidence in

his judgement and has failed to analyze the evidence in its correct

perspective.

The learned High Court Judge has cited judgements to cover the infirmities

in the evidence of the prosecution and had failed to consider a single

ground that was in favour of the appellant.

The improbability of the timings from the point of receipt of information

and to the arrest of the appellant, which included PW-01 going to get his

pocket notebook signed by the SSP.

The learned High Court Judge asked several questions during the

appellants evidence and the questions suggest that they were asked in

favour of the prosecution and not in favour of the defence.

The prosecutions failure to call Police Sergeant Ratnayake who was

attached to Murukkan police and was seated next to the appellant who

should have been a vital witness for the prosecution to prove the detection.

Page 16 of 36

The learned High Court Judges failure to consider the major contradiction

marked V-01 in his judgement and has brushed aside the contradictions

pointed out as minor differences between the witnesses for the

prosecution.

The burning of the finger of the appellant was considered quite normal by

the learned High Court Judge, however, the MLEF produced by the

prosecution indicates no injuries, and this should have been considered

in the light of the appellants evidence that although he was taken to a

place resembling a hospital but never produced before a doctor.

Glaring contradictions with regard to the bag alleged to have been carried

by the appellant having a strap was not considered by the learned High

Court Judge but, had made an incorrect assumption that the PW-08 had

identified the bag with a strap.

The learned High Court Judge failed to consider glaring contradictions

with regard to the information received.

The learned High Court Judge failed to consider in a proper manner the

evidence given by the appellant that the bag was opened using a cleaning

rod in the weapon and the bag being torn.

The learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the padlock and the

key were introductions made by the witnesses to implicate the appellant.

The learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the padlock and the

key were not kept in proper custody and was sent to the High Court by the

Registrar of the Mannar Magistrates Court separate to the other

productions.

The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the contradiction between

the police witnesses and army witnesses as to whether the police knew the

name of Kamal Kariyawasam who is the appellant at the time of the raid.

The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the contradiction of

evidence between the driver of the bus and PW-01 with regard to both the

information, and the driver being out of the bus when the police arrived.

Page 17 of 36

The learned High Court Judges comment in the judgement that the

defence did not challenge the evidence of the driver of the bus is untenable,

because the drivers evidence was favourable to the defence as it

contradicted with PW-01.

The learned High Court Judge has made an erroneous comment in the

judgement that the appellant has failed to ask any questions from PW-01

of the fact that he was outside the bus when the police arrived.

There is no proper acceptance of the prosecution evidence on the basis

that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, nor a

rejection of the appellants evidence with reasons. The learned High Court

Judge failed to consider the intermediatory position where the appellants

evidence is neither accepted nor rejected, in which case the appellant

should have been acquitted.

Making submissions extensively in relation to the above points taken, it was the

position of the learned Presidents Counsel that the conviction of the appellant

was bad in law and urged the Court to acquit the appellant from the charges

preferred against him.

The Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) in her extensive submissions pointed out

that the conditions prevailed in the area where the offence had been committed,

and was of the view that it needs to be considered as a relevant factor in

analyzing the evidence presented by the prosecution. Commenting on each of

the points taken by the learned Presidents Counsel, the learned DSG submitted

that none of the positions have any merit as the learned High Court Judge has

adequately dealt with the matters concerned in his judgement.

It was her view that what the appellant claims as evidence that favours him

cannot be accepted as such, and the contention that the learned High Court

Judge has failed to consider evidence favouring the appellant also has no basis.

Commenting on the way the judgement has been written by the learned High

Court Judge, it was the position of the learned DSG that each Judge has his or

Page 18 of 36

her own way of writing and the learned High Court Judge, although may not

have followed the conventional way of writing a judgement, all the necessary

principles that should be considered, have been considered and the evidence had

been properly analyzed before reaching the final conclusion that the prosecution

has proven the case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant.

The learned DSG urged the dismissal of the appeal on the basis that it has no

merit.

I will now proceed to consider each of the points taken up by the learned

Presidents Counsel with reference to the evidence presented before the trial

Court, the judgement, and other incidental matters, to consider whether there is

merit in the ground of appeal urged by the appellant.

The learned Presidents Counsel took up the position that the indictment was

not read over and explained to the appellant, probably based on the fact that

there is no indication in the journal entries maintained by the trial Court in the

case docket and the copies of the proceedings filed of record.

According to the proceedings of this action, the prosecution witness number 01

has commenced his evidence on 26-07-2010. Although there is no indication in

the typewritten proceedings for that day that the indictment was read over and

explained to the appellant and he pleaded not guilty to the charge, it is

abundantly clear from the case record that in fact the indictment had been read

over to him and he has pleaded not guilty.

The learned High Court Judge who presided over the trial at that time has

entered the following note in his handwriting in the indictment itself in the space

provided for recording of the plea of an accused and signed and dated on 26-07-

2010.

Page 19 of 36

The said endorsement reads as follows.

" " .

(Page 07 of the original case record)

The above endorsement made by the learned High Court Judge clearly

establishes the fact that the charge has been read over and explained to the

appellant and he has pleaded not guilty.

The appellant has been represented throughout the trial by a Counsel, and it is

clear that the case had proceeded to trial because the appellant has pleaded not

guilty to the two charges preferred against him. Hence, I find no basis for the

argument considered as above.

This is a case where the indictment had been originally filed before the High

Court of Vavuniya and subsequently transferred to be heard before the High

Court of Colombo. The case record indicates that the trial proper has commenced

before the High Court number 03 of the Colombo High Court and after leading

the evidence of PW-01 halfway, the learned High Court Judge who presided over

the matter has gone on transfer. When the matter was resumed before the

succeeding High Court Judge, the learned State Counsel who prosecuted has

made a request from the Court to send the case before the High Court Judge

who is presiding at High Court number 07 for further trial, which has resulted

in the presiding High Court Judge in High Court number 03 sending it before

the learned High Court Judge of High Court number 01 in Colombo who is the

Judge assigned with administrative functions of the Court to a suitable directive.

This has resulted in the nomination of the learned High Court Judge who

presided in High Court number 07 to hear and determine this matter. When the

matter was taken up before the learned High Court Judge in High Court number

07 in that regard on 15-01-2013, both the defence as well as the prosecution

has agreed to proceed with the trial by adopting the evidence taken previously.

Page 20 of 36

The appellant had been represented by a Counsel, and if he had any issue with

the High Court Judge of Court number 07 taking up the further hearing of the

matter, it should have been informed to the Court, which was not the case. I am

of the view that there is no basis for the appellant to take up that matter on the

basis that he was denied of a fair trial, as the trial had been proceeded in High

Court number 07 of the High Court of Colombo with the consent of all the parties.

The learned Presidents Counsel in his submissions contended that the learned

High Court Judge failed to mention the legal principles a trial Judge should

consider in a judgement and has only narrated the evidence but failed to analyze

in reaching his conclusions.

As submitted to the Court correctly by the learned DSG, each Trial Judge has

his or her own style of writing a judgement. It is correct to say that the learned

High Court Judge has not stated the legal principles that he would consider to

determine whether the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable

doubt against the appellant. However, that in itself does not mean that the

learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the relevant legal principles in

the judgement.

I am of the view that only if it can be determined that the learned High Court

Judge has failed to consider the relevant legal principles and misdirected himself

as to the evidence, there can be merit in the argument. In the judgement under

consideration, although the learned High Court Judge has not mentioned the

fact that he is considering the evidence with the principles of law that has to be

borne in mind by a trial Judge when considering evidence, it is clear from the

judgement that the learned High Court Judge has been well aware of the required

legal principles that he should adhere to in that regard.

I am in agreement with the submissions of the learned DSG that although the

learned High Court Judge has not followed the conventional method of

discussing the charges, relevant legal principles he needs to consider, and

Page 21 of 36

summarizing the evidence before analyzing the same and coming to a final

conclusion, it is very much apparent from the judgement that after considering

the charges against the appellant, the learned High Court Judge has directly

proceeded to consider and analyze the evidence while summarizing the same. I

am in no position to agree with the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel

that the learned High Court Judge has produced only a narration of evidence

but failed to analyze.

The complaint of the learned Presidents Counsel is that the learned High Court

Judge only considered judgements to cover the infirmities of the prosecution but

failed to consider a single ground that was in favour of the appellant.

In the judgement, the learned High Court Judge, while considering the evidence

has cited the judgement of Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai Vs. State of Gujarat 1983

AIR 753 to explain that a witness is not supposed to have a photographic

memory of the events that took place in a given scenario and the Court needs to

be aware of such situations when considering evidence.

I find that this is the correct approach that any trial Court should adhere to

when considering the evidence in a case where number of witnesses have given

evidence some years after the actual occurrence of an event.

I will consider at a later stage of this judgement whether there was sufficient

evidence in this case to consider in favour of the appellant, which creates a doubt

in the prosecution case.

The learned Presidents Counsel contended that the timeline from the point of

receiving of the information and the arrest of the appellant do not match since

the PW-01 has stated that after receiving the information, he went and met his

supervising officer who is the SSP of the area and obtained his endorsement to

conduct the raid. It was his contention that the SSP was stationed in Mannar,

which was several kilometers away from the Murukkan police station and there

was no possibility for him to conduct the raid and arrest the appellant at 15.15

hours as claimed. However, it is quite apparent from the evidence of PW-01 and

Page 22 of 36

that of PW-08, that the SSP meant by PW-01 in his evidence was the SSP in

charge of zone number 10 and not the SSP stationed at Mannar. PW-08 has

given clear evidence that the mentioned zone 10 was a zone especially

established due to the war situation that existed in that area and the SSP in

charge of that zone was SSP Gnanaratne. The OIC has gone to his office and

returned in about 5 minutes time, after which they have proceeded to conduct

the raid (page 597 and 598 of the appeal brief). I find no discrepancy as to the

timeline mentioned by the witnesses in that regard.

It is correct to say that the learned High Court Judge has posed several questions

to the appellant when he was giving evidence. It was the contention of the learned

Presidents Counsel that those questions were asked in favour of the prosecution

and not in favour of the defence.

However, I must emphasize that a trial Judge is not precluded from asking

questions from witnesses in order to clarify matters.

This position was well considered in the Court of Appeal case of Gamage Vs.

Attorney General And Others (2020) 1 SLR 44. This was a transfer application

made in terms of section 46 of the Judicature Act by the accused in a High Court

case on the basis that the learned High Court Judge who presided over the trial

was biased because of the questions posed by the learned trial Judge when the

witnesses were giving their evidence, and a fair and impartial trial could not be

expected. Held:

1. Notwithstanding that the system of justice which prevails in this country

is adversarial as opposed to inquisitorial, a Judge need not be a silent

spectator at the battle fought between two rival parties. The Judge has

the arduous task of delivering the judgement based on true facts devoid

of distortion and falsity. In this endeavour, the Judge cannot be found

fault with for questioning the witnesses to ascertain the truth, as long as

he does it within limits. No hard and fast rules can be laid down to

Page 23 of 36

demarcate such limits. It shall depend on the facts and circumstances of

each individual case.

2. In pursuit of the attainment of truth and justice, a Judge is statutorily

empowered to question a witness as he pleases. (Section 439 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act, sections 164 and 165 of the Civil Procedure

Code, section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance)

3. The number of questions a Judge puts to a witness is not decisive. What

is decisive is whether it results in a miscarriage of justice.

When it comes to the questions posed by the learned trial Judge to the appellant

when he was giving evidence in his defence, I find that although, the learned trial

Judge appears to have used his personal knowledge as to the workings of the

army in some instances, it is clear that such questions have been posed in order

to ascertain whether the evidence given by the appellant can be accepted as

truthful. The learned High Court Judge has questioned the appellant of the

various claims he made during his evidence, and I do not find any reason to

believe that the line of questioning by the learned High Court Judge has resulted

in a prejudice to the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of

justice.

However, I am also very much mindful of the observations made by the

Samayawardhena, J. in the same matter considered earlier which reads thus;

Judges are not above the law. They cannot do anything they think right.

Although section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code, sections 164 to 165 of

the Civil Procedure Code and section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance

seemingly give unfettered discretion to the trial Judge to question witnesses,

this is not so. These provisions are intended to be used by the Judges

sparingly and cautiously not as a rule but as an expression with the ultimate

objective of ascertaining the truth, not to fill the gaps of the case of either the

prosecution or the defence.

Page 24 of 36

It appears from the case record that the learned trial Judge has asked questions

only when the appellant gave evidence because of the obvious deficiencies in his

evidence in relation to the questions posed on his behalf to the witnesses called

on behalf of the prosecution as to his stand in this matter, which I do not see as

a reason to conclude that the questions were posed to boost the prosecution

version.

It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel that Police Sergeant

Ratnayake who was attached to Murukkan police at that time and was

admittedly seated next to the appellant when the detection was made by PW-01

and his team of officers, should have been called as a witness for the prosecution

as he would have revealed what really happened at the time of detection.

As correctly pointed out by the learned DSG, Police Sergeant Ratnayake was not

a member of the police party who went in pursuit of the information received by

PW-01 that a person is carrying a suspicious parcel. However, according to the

evidence of PW-01, when this detection was made, Police Sergeant Ratnayake

who served under him in Murukkan police was seated next to the appellant clad

in civilian clothes as he was going home on vacation. I do not see him as a vital

witness for the prosecution to prove its case as the prosecution has called several

witnesses to prove the detection, made on that day.

It is up to the prosecution to decide for whom to call in order to prove their case

since it is not the numbers that matter, but the quality of the witnesses. Section

134 of the Evidence Ordinance, which deals with the number of witnesses, reads

as follows.

134. No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required

for the proof of any fact.

Page 25 of 36

In the case of The Attorney General Vs. Devunderage Nihal (2011) 1 SLR 409,

it was held:

There is no requirement in law that a particular number of witnesses shall

in any case be required for the proof of any fact. Unlike in a case where an

accomplice or a decoy is concerned, in any other case there is no requirement

in law that the evidence of a Police Officer who conducted an investigation

or raid resulting in the arrest of an offender need to be corroborated on

material particulars.

The next point taken up by the learned Presidents Counsel was that the learned

High Court Judge has simply brushed aside the contradictions pointed out at

the trial on the basis that they are minor contradictions which do not go into the

root of the matter. He has specially pointed out that the contradictions marked

V-01 was a major contradiction that cannot be brushed aside as a minor

contradiction. He argued that the learned High Court Judge decided to ignore

the material contradictions being biased towards the prosecution witnesses. The

contradictions marked V-01 which is in the statement given by PW-04 who was

the military police officer who accompanied the appellant throughout his

motorcycle ride as the rider of the bike reads as follows.

2 .

.

Contrary to the above statement the witness has made to the police, which has

been made on 15-06-2006, when he gave evidence before the trial Court in 02-

10-2013, his position had been that the appellant went into the house and came

out with a bag. When confronted with this difference, the witness has stated that

since the incident happened some years ago, he cannot exactly remember what

happened and he is giving evidence from his memory.

It is trite law that evidence cannot be considered in relation to a small portion of

it taken in its isolation but in its totality.

Page 26 of 36

When considering the evidence of PW-04 in its totality, there cannot be any doubt

that he was telling the truth as to what happened on that day. The evidence

clearly shows that he has no reason to lie by creating a story like this against a

senior officer of the army who has no connection to him or any animosity with

him.

Similarly, I am of the view that the other contradictions referred to in the case

are very minor in its nature that had not created any doubt as to the evidence of

the prosecution witnesses, as correctly considered by the learned High Court

Judge. Therefore, I do not find any basis for the argument that the said

contradictions had created a reasonable doubt as to the prosecution case.

The learned Presidents Counsel strenuously argued that the incident of the

burning of the finger of the appellant mentioned by the witnesses do not tally

with the Medico-Legal Examination Form (MLEF) produced in evidence, and it

was his position that this shows that the position of the appellant that he was

never taken to a hospital, but was taken to a place resembling a hospital and

not produced before a doctor was credible.

If one reads the relevant portions of the evidence, it is clear that the burning of

the finger spoken of by the witnesses are not getting it burnt due to a fire. The

evidence was that when the appellant was asked to place his left thumb

impression on the sealing wax () which was in hot melted form, the

appellant did not wet his finger properly as instructed before doing so, which

resulted in his finger getting burned. It is clear that this does not amount to

getting burn injuries in its proper sense but a temporary incapacitation only.

That may be the very reason why there is no indication of any injury in the MLEF

produced in relation to the appellant in the Court.

I find no basis to accept the appellants version that he was taken to a place that

resembles a hospital but not produced before a doctor. I have no reason to believe

that the appellant being a senior army officer, for the arresting officer to take

Page 27 of 36

him near a hospital and bring him back without producing him to a doctor, or a

doctor of a hospital will sign and hand over the MLEF back to a police officer

knowing very well what such a step would lead to under the given circumstances.

The PW-04 who was with the appellant when he obtained the bag from an

unknown person has stated that when he came back to the motorbike, he was

carrying a black coloured bag with a strap hung around the shoulder, but PW-

01, the arresting officer and PW-08, who assisted him, both have not stated

anything about the bag they detected from the possession of the appellant having

a strap. The said bag which has been marked as a production (P-05) at the trial

had no strap that can be hung around the shoulder. It was the position of the

learned Presidents Counsel that the learned High Court Judge came into an

incorrect assumption that PW-08 who assisted PW-01 in the arrest had identified

a strap in the bag. However, it appears that under re-examination what the PW-

08 has referred to as a bag with a strap was the bag carried by the appellant

when he came to the army camp and had with him when he was arrested at the

checkpoint by the police.

Even if it was a misdirection by the learned High Court Judge, I do not find it a

matter that creates any prejudice towards the appellant. The witnesses have

given credible evidence as to the bag found in the possession of the appellant. It

has been marked and identified at the trial. Although there is no explanation

about a strap that was spoken by PW-04, that is not a reason that can be

concluded in favour of the appellant as the evidence in its totality creates no

doubt as to that fact.

Although it was contended that there was a glaring contradiction with regard to

the information received and also between the evidence of army and police

witnesses, which shows that the police knew the name of the appellant at the

time of arrest, I do not find any merit in that contention either.

Page 28 of 36

The evidence of PW-01 had been that he received two pieces of information few

minutes apart from each other over the phone. The 1st one had been from a

person who spoke broken Sinhalese and informed him about a person carrying

a suspicious parcel, and the 2nd information had been from a Captain attached

to the Thalladi army camp about a person carrying a suspicious parcel suspected

to be a weapon.

Although evidence of the relevant army witnesses is suggestive that they took

steps to inform the name of the appellant to the police, there is nothing to say

that the army captain who spoke to PW-01 and provided the 1st information to

him, informed the name of the suspected person as Major Kariyawasam who is

the appellant. I find no reason to believe that if the information was in relation

to a specific army officer, for PW-01 to not make a note of the name of the person,

as it would be much helpful for him to conduct the raid.

The evidence of PW-01 had been that he opened the bag found in the possession

of the appellant which had a padlock using the key he found in one of his purse

pockets and used a small knife he was carrying to create an opening in one of

the parcels found in order to take out a sample of what was inside. The

prosecution witnesses have clearly identified the bag marked P-05 which had its

cover stitched on a part of it indicating a repair has been done to it previously.

When the bag was produced as evidence, no specific questions had been asked

on the basis that the bag was cut open.

However, it appears that when the appellant gave evidence, he has chosen to

state that the bag was cut open by the police and that is the reason for the

stitches, which appears to be a repair done to the torn off part of the bag. It was

contended that this opening was created when one of the officers of the raiding

party used a cleaning rod of a T-56 weapon to force open the bag, which clearly

appears to be a story created as a result of an afterthought. I find no basis to

consider it in favour of the appellant.

Page 29 of 36

There was nothing to indicate that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as

to the bag being padlocked and the key of it, as introductions by the witnesses

to implicate the appellant. The appellant himself had indicated that the bag had

a padlock when he was arrested although he has claimed that the bag was not

in his possession, but on the rack above the seats. In his evidence in chief, he

has stated as follows.

: ?

: .

.

It is the view of this Court that the evidence of the appellant itself establishes

that there is no basis for the contention.

It is evidence before the Court, that the arresting officer had separately sealed

the padlock and the key and had given a marking as K-16 to the sealed

productions and handed it over to the Magistrates Court of Mannar.

In Court, PW-01 has marked the said cover as P-22. However, when it was

marked, there was no production of a padlock and a key. At a later stage of this

trial, the Registrar of the Magistrates Court of Mannar has given evidence as

PW-17, and had confirmed that the cover marked P-22 along with its contents,

sealed properly, was handed over to the Court under PR 173/06. The Registrar

has explained that when the productions relating to this matter were handed

over to the High Court on 14-07-2010, only the cover of the productions that

was handed over to the Magistrate Court under PR 173/06 was handed over. It

was her evidence that due to some reason, while the productions were in the

Court custody, the sealed cover has been torn off and the lock and the key had

fallen off, and subsequently, that production was separately sealed by the

Magistrate Court and handed over to the High Court along with a covering letter

explaining the reasoning for such a cause of action.

Page 30 of 36

For the reasons as stated above, I find no basis to consider that the padlock and

the key was not a production before the Court.

Another position taken up by the learned Presidents Counsel was that according

to the evidence of PW-01, all the passengers were inside the bus when he reached

the checkpoint where the bus was stopped. According to the evidence of PW-05,

the driver of the bus, he was outside of the bus when the police party came to

the checkpoint. The appellant has given evidence and had claimed that when the

police party came, he was also outside of the bus having a cigarette, and he

decided to get down from the bus because the bus was kept parked there for

about half an hour.

The position of the learned Presidents Counsel was that, the learned High Court

Judge failed to consider these facts that are in favour of the appellant in his

judgement.

He found fault with the learned High Court Judges comment that the appellant

did not challenge the evidence of the driver (PW-05), on the basis that it was

untenable, because, there was no necessity for the appellant to challenge the

evidence as the evidence was in fact favourable to the appellants position.

It needs to be noted that what the PW-01 has stated in his evidence was that all

the passengers who travelled in the bus were inside the bus and they were

checked while being inside. He has not referred to the positioning of the driver

at that time. In his evidence, the driver has stated that after he was informed to

wait for about 5 minutes to pick up the OIC of Murukkan police who were going

on leave, he stopped the bus and got down from it to follow the usual formalities

of entering the details of his bus in the book maintained at the checkpoint. He

has stated that while he was in that process, the police party came, which was

within few minutes of him stopping the bus. His evidence was that the police

officers entered the bus and arrested the appellant after they conducted a search.

Page 31 of 36

There was nothing in the evidence of the driver other than to indicate that in fact

the appellant was arrested while he was inside the bus. He has well remembered

the appellant because he travelled in the same bus when he came to the area

and got down near Thalladi camp. He has stated that the appellant got into the

bus near the army point at zone 11 Uilankulama. He has specifically stated that

because of the war situation that existed, they make it a point to remember the

passengers and their belongings.

I find nothing to conclude that the evidence of PW-05 was in favour of the

appellant. As contended correctly by the learned DSG and considered by the

learned High Court Judge, if the stand of the appellant was different to the

evidence given by PW-05, he should have been confronted with that position

when he gave evidence and was subjected to cross-examination. PW-05 being a

civilian witness, the position taken up by the appellant in his evidence should

have been put to him and confront him at the trial.

The appellant has come out with this position when the PW-01 was cross-

examined, but had failed to take a similar stand when the PW-05s evidence was

led at the trial. Although he has given evidence and stated that he was outside

the bus when the police party came, that in itself does not create any doubt as

to the evidence of the officers who conducted the raid and arrested him and that

of PW-05.

In the Supreme Court case of Galagamage Indrawansa Kumarasiri and Others

Vs. The Attorney General (Angulana Murder Case) S.C. TAB Appeal No.

2/2012 decided on 02.04.2014, it was held that,

Whenever the evidence given by a witness on a material point is not

challenged in cross-examination, it has to be concluded that such evidence

is not disputed and accepted by the opponent.

Page 32 of 36

In the case of Sarwan Singh Vs. State Of Punjab (2002) AIR S.C. 111, it was

held that,

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to

avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-examination, it must

follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.

The learned Presidents Counsel contented that the learned High Court Judge

has failed to properly accept the prosecution evidence on the basis that the

prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, nor had he rejected

the appellants evidence with reasons. It was also his position that the learned

High Court Judge failed to consider the intermediary position where the

appellants evidence is neither accepted nor rejected, in which case, it should

have been considered in favour of the appellant.

I am in no position to agree with the submission of the learned Presidents

Counsel. As I have stated before, each trial Judge has his or her own way of

evaluating evidence. It is clear from the judgement that the learned High Court

Judge has done the evaluation of the evidence while summarizing the relevant

evidence and analyzing it along with the evidence of other witnesses. Although it

may not be the conventional way of considering the evidence, it is my considered

view that the learned High Court Judge has been well possessed of the relevant

legal principles when the evidence of the prosecution as well as of the appellant

was considered.

The learned High Court Judge has well considered the appellants evidence and

decided that he has no basis to accept it and it has not created any doubt as to

the prosecution evidence.

He has found no basis to conclude that this was a concocted story created by

the police and the army officers against the appellant. I have no basis to disagree

with the reasoning given by the learned High Court Judge as to why he is

Page 33 of 36

rejecting the appellants evidence. I am of the view that the learned High Court

Judge has decided to consider appellants evidence and the evidence of the

prosecution in its totality in coming to his conclusions, which in my view has

been done in accordance with the law.

When considering the evidence led in this action in its totality, I do not find any

reason to doubt the credibility and the truthfulness of the prosecution witnesses.

It is clear from the evidence that the appellant being a senior army officer has

convinced the Commander of the army camp to provide him with transport in

the pretext of going to another camp to hold an inquiry.

PW-04 has given clear evidence as to the conduct of the appellant when he left

the Thalladi camp with him. There was no reason whatsoever to believe that PW-

04 being a soldier ranked very much below to the appellant in the army hierarchy

would concoct a story against the appellant in this manner. PW-04 has

immediately informed his superiors of his suspicions in the best way he can,

which has led the officials of the Thalladi camp going in pursue of the appellant,

and I find that the evidence in that regard is very much credible.

PW-1 has well explained the information he received and the steps he took to

investigate the matter. He has gone after the bus where he was informed that a

person is carrying a suspicious parcel, and had taken due steps to search the

bus while it was parked at the checkpoint as revealed in evidence. There is no

doubt that the appellant was seated behind the drivers seat when the search

was carried out.

Although the appellant claims that he was outside the bus when the police party

came and the recovered bag was not in his possession, I find no basis to accept

that version as the raiding police officers as well as PW-05 who is a civilian bus

driver has given evidence which creates no doubt as to what happened and the

manner of the arrest of the appellant, while having in his possession a bag which

carried over 15 kilograms of the suspected drug.

Page 34 of 36

The defence put forward by the appellant in his evidence has not created any

doubt in relation to the prosecution evidence. Even though he has come up with

his own version as to the reasons why he went to Thalladi army camp and

requested a vehicle, he has failed to take up that stand convincingly when the

relevant witnesses gave evidence in Court, as I have considered before.

I am of the view that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable

doubt against the appellant.

Although there may be some misdirections in the consideration of the evidence

and the learned trial Judge may not have followed the conventional way of

evaluating the evidence, that cannot be held in favour of the appellant unless it

has prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of

justice.

The proviso of Article 138(1) of The Constitution, which provides for the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal reads,

Provided that no judgement, decree or order of any Court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

I would also like to draw my attention to the provisions of section 436 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, which reads;

436. Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgement

passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or

altered on appeal or revision on account-

(a) of any error, omission, or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrant, charge, judgement, summing up, or other

proceedings before or during the trial or in any inquiry of other

proceedings under this Code.

Page 35 of 36

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135, unless

such error, omission, irregularity, or want of has occasioned a

failure of justice.

It was held in the case of Hiniduma Dahanayakage Siripala Alias Kiri

Mahaththaya And Others Vs. Hon. Attorney General S.C. Appeal No.

115/2014, decided on 22-01-2020,

Per Aluvihare P.C. J.,

With the promulgation of the 1978 Constitution, if relief is to be obtained in

an appeal, a party must satisfy the threshold requirement laid down in the

proviso to Article 138(1), which is placed under the heading The Court of

Appeal. The proviso to the said Article of the Constitution lays down that;

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed

or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of

justice.

The proviso aforesaid is couched in mandatory terms and the burden is on

the party seeking relief to satisfy the court that the impugned error, defect

or irregularity has either prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

has occasioned a failure of justice. It must be observed that no such

Constitutional provision is to be found either in the 1948 Soulbury

Constitution or the First Republican Constitution of 1972.

The same requirement was considered by the Supreme Court in Sunil

Jayarathna v. The Attorney General, SC 97/09 (SC Minutes of 29.07.2011)

where it was observed that,

When considering the Proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution, it is

evident that the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge need not be

reversed or interfered on the account of any defect, error or irregularity

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned

Page 36 of 36

a failure of justice. An Accused would therefore only be entitled to relief if it

is shown that the irregularity complained of, had in fact prejudiced the

substantial rights of the parties or has occasioned a failure of justice. A mere

statement to that effect would certainly not be sufficient, but it must be

shown as to how the failure of justice resulted.

For the reasons considered aforesaid, I find no basis to interfere with the

conviction and the sentence of the appellant by the learned High Court Judge of

Colombo.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit. The conviction and the

sentence affirmed.

Having considered the period of incarceration of the appellant from the date of

his arrest, it is directed that his sentence shall deemed to have taken effect from
