Hon. Justice Menaka Wijesundera

Accused-Appellants are on bail. When the matter was taken up for argument, Counsel appearing for the 1st and 2nd

Accused-Appellants stated that he is withdrawing his appeal with regard to the

conviction and he is only canvassing the sentence.

Both parties made submissions. We observe that the date of offence had been in

September 2005 which is almost 18 years ago. The two Accused-Appellants had been

convicted on 27th August 2019. At that time the 1st Accused-Appellant was 65 years of

age and the 2nd Accused-Appellant was 60 years of age. But we note the nature of

evidence which had been placed before the trial Judge is not very convincing. Taking

all these matters into consideration, we vary the terms of imprisonment imposed on

the two Accused-Appellants as below.

For the 1st Charge, the imprisonment of the 1st Accused-Appellant is reduced to 6

months rigorous imprisonment. The rest of the sentence with regard to the 1st charge

remains the same.

For the 2nd Charge of the 1st Accused-Appellant the term of imprisonment is reduced

to 6 months rigorous imprisonment. 3rd Charge also the same. 4th Charge also the

same.

The totality of the imprisonment imposed on the 1st Accused-Appellant which is 02

years rigorous imprisonment is hereby suspended for 05 years. The fines and the

default sentences to remain the same as imposed by the trial Judge.

With regard to the imprisonment of the 2nd Accused-Appellant to the 07th Charge is

hereby reduced to 06 months rigorous imprisonment and the fine and the default

sentence to remain the same.

3

The term of imprisonment imposed for the 08th Charge with regard to the 2nd

Accused-Appellant is again reduced to 06 months rigorous imprisonment and the fine

and the default sentence to remain the same. The 02-year term of imprisonment

imposed on the 2nd Accused-Appellant is suspended for 05 years.

Subject to the said variation, the appeal is dismissed.
