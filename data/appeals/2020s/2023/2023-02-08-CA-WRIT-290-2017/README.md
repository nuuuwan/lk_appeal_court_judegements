Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The subject property (Property) of this Application was pledged by way of several

mortgage bonds to secure loans as described in the Petition. The 1st Petitioner who is the

borrower has defaulted the settlement of loans and accordingly, the 1st Respondent-Seylan

Bank PLC (Bank) after passing a resolution, in terms of the provisions of the Recovery

of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 04 of 1990 (Act), auctioned the said

Property. As there were no bidders at the auction, the Bank purchased the Property and

the relevant Certificate of Sale bearing No. 648 dated 26.01.2011 is marked as P6. The

1st Petitioner by his letter dated 27.07.2015, marked P9, informed the Bank that he had

negotiated with the 2nd Petitioner to purchase the Property for a sum of Rs.170,000,000.00.

By letter dated 01.11.2015, marked P10, the Bank has written to the 2nd Petitioner

expressing its agreement to sell the Property to him for a consideration of

Rs.180,000,000.00. As per the said P10, a sum of Rs.25,000,000.00 was required to be

paid by the 2nd Petitioner on or before 16.11.2016 and the balance consideration was to be

paid within two weeks of the Bank informing him that the vacant possession of the

Property has been obtained. It is evident that the Bank has accepted a sum of

Rs.25,000,000.00 as a down payment in respect of the above resale of the Property.

However, there is no evidence to show that the balance payment has been made to the

Bank.

The 1st Petitioner on 08.08.2017 wrote (P12) to the Bank demanding the transfer of the

Property to the 1st Petitioner or to his nominee (2nd Petitioner) by accepting the balance

payment of Rs.155,000,000.00. Anyhow, the Bank by letter dated 17.08.2017, marked

P15, has inquired from the 2nd Petitioner as to whom the above sum of Rs. 25,000,000.00

should be returned. Perhaps that may be due to the inability of obtaining the vacant

possession of the Property through the Fiscal.

The Petitioners of the instant Application, meantime, filed the writ application bearing

No. 269/2017 (Vide-P13) in this Court on 14.08.2017, seeking, inter alia, a writ of

Mandamus compelling the Bank to abide by the terms of the contract reflected in above

Page 5 of 11

letter, marked P10, which has been identified by the Petitioners as a statutory obligation

under Section 17 of the Act. However, before the said application was supported, the Bank

has apparently resold the property to the 15th Respondent by way of a Deed of Transfer

(P20) attested on 17.08.2017. Subsequently, the Petitioners withdrew the said application

(Vide-P21) and filed the instant Application seeking, inter alia, for a writ of Certiorari

quashing the decision of the 1st to 3rd and 6th to 10th Respondents to sell the property to the

15th Respondent and to quash the said Deed of Transfer P20.

The Petitioners contention is that the above resale of the Property to the 15th Respondent

is illegal, null & void and of no force or avail in law. The crux of the argument relied on

by the Petitioners is based on a legitimate expectation that the Bank would take steps to

cancel the Certificate of Sale in terms of Section 17 of the Act by accepting the balance

payment of Rs.155,000,000.00.

The Section 17 of the Act;

Where the property sold has been purchased on behalf of the bank, the Board may

at any time before it resells that property, cancel the sale by an endorsement to that

effect on a certified copy of the certificate of sale, upon the borrower or any person

on his behalf paying the amount due in respect of the loan for which the property

was sold (including the cost of seizure and sale) and interest on the aggregate sum

at a rate not exceeding the prescribed rate per annum. Such an endorsement shall,

upon registration in the office of the Registrar of lands, revest the said property in

the borrower as though the sale under this Act has never been made.

The Bank by letter marked P10 (dated 01.11.2016) informed the 2nd Petitioner referring

to a meeting it had with the Chairman of the Bank to pay a sum of Rs 25,000,000.00 on

or before 16.11.2016. Despite such deadline, the cheque drawn for the same amount

tendered to Bank by the 2nd Petitioner has been realized only on 06.01.2017. The crucial

condition in P10 was to keep the 2nd Petitioner informed only when the vacant possession

of the property would be available for the purpose of settling the balance payment by the

2nd Petitioner. One may assume that the Bank has used this condition as a triumph to twist

the unique elements of the above Section 17 in the backdrop of the discretion prescribed

in the said Section. The Bank has possibly overlooked the request made by the 1st Petitioner

by his letter dated 08.08.2017, marked P12, to transfer the property back to him or to the

Page 6 of 11

2nd Petitioner upon the payment of the balance amount, irrespective of the fact whether

the Property is in vacant possession or not.

It is pertinent to note that the Bank took steps to get the aforesaid Deed of Transfer P20

attested (on 17.08.2017) in favour of the 15th Respondent almost after 8 months from the

initial payment of advance by the 2nd Petitioner. The date of the Petition in

CA/Writ/269/2017 as it appears on its caption is 14.08.2017 (P13) and it was a date

three days before the above resale of the Property. There is no proof tendered to Court that

the said CA/Writ/269/2017 has been mentioned in open Court any time before

17.08.2017 or notice of the said application has been served on the Bank before that date.

As mentioned above the primary relief sought by the Petitioner in the said

CA/Writ/269/2017 was for a writ of Mandamus compelling the Bank to abide by the

terms reflected in the letter, marked P10, by which the Bank extended its agreement to

sell the Property to the 2nd Petitioner based on the conditions therein. It is important to

observe that in the instant Application the Petitioners are seeking for a writ of Mandamus

for a different purpose and that is to direct the Bank to act in terms of Section 17 of the

Act and cancel the Certificate of Sale, marked P6. This is in addition to the other relief

in the instant Application which is for a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision to re-sell

the Property to the 15th Respondent.

It needs to be stressed that granting of above reliefs can be considered only based on the

fundamental principles applicable in exercising the writ jurisdiction of this Court. At the

outset, the question that comes into my mind is whether this Court has the jurisdiction to

review any decision of the Bank after lending money to a borrower. On perusal of the

previous judgements, it implies that this Court has taken an approach to hear and

determine applications filed challenging decisions taken by banks during the recovery

process of loans and particularly, the applications seeking to quash the Resolutions passed

by the respective board of directors of the banks. The reason adopted by Court for such

approach appears to be that respective impugned decisions have a statutory flavour

enriched by several provisions of the said Act.

After drawing out a reasonable explanation to my above question, it becomes necessary

to delineate the boundaries in exercising the writ jurisdiction upon the decisions taken

during the recovery process. The issue that arises in this review Application revolves

Page 7 of 11

around Section 17 of the Act. Hence, the secondary question that I need to consider is

whether the jurisdiction of the review court will be exhausted beyond the point of issuing

the Certificate of Sale by banks.

When you sift the provisions of the said Section 17, it envisages that the Board of Directors

of the Bank is empowered to cancel a Certificate of Sale under such provisions only at any

time before the resale. Hence, the said Section 17 comes into operation only during the

period from the date of the Certificate of Sale and until the date of resale of the property

by the Bank. Moreover, a considerable component of discretion has been bestowed on the

Bank with the word may embodied in the said Section to cancel the Certificate of Sale

and accordingly, the Bank is duty bound to exercise such discretion lawfully.

The Petitioners referring to a passage of Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth, 11th

Edition, p. 195 submits that whether a power, expressed in merely permissive language, is

accompanied by a duty to exercise it in certain circumstances require consideration of the

whole statutory context in which the power is given. Anyhow, the argument put forward

by the 1st to 14th Respondents (Respondents) on the applicability of Section 17 to the

instant Application is vital. The Respondents assert that due to the component of

discretion bestowed upon the Bank in the said Section 17, no writ of Mandamus can be

issued as no public duty involves during the period from the date of the Certificate of Sale

and the date of the resale of the Property. I am inclined to agree with the said argument as

I am convinced that there is no public duty, which is an essential ingredient to seek for a

writ of Mandamus, vested on the Bank under the said Section 17 based on the way in

which the provisions in the said Section have been formulated.

The Respondents on the point of view that the Petition of the Petitioners does not disclose

any statutory duty breached by the Bank has cited the cases of Galle Flour Milling (Pvt)

Limited vs. Board of Investment of Sri Lanka and another (2002) BLR 10; Jayawardena vs.

Peoples Bank (2002) 3 Sri. L.R. 17; U. L. Karunawathie vs. Peoples Bank and others,

CA/Writ/863/10 decided on 12.05.2015; Chandradasa vs. Wijeratne (1982) 1 Sri. L.R. 412;

Jayaweera vs. Wijeratne (1985) 2 Sri. L.R. 413; Siva Kumar vs. Director General of Samurdhi

Authority of Sri Lanka and another (2007) 1 Sri. L.R. 96; Gawarammana vs. The Tea Research

Board and others (2003) 3 Sri. L.R. 120 and Harjani and others vs. Indian Overseas Bank

(2005) 1 Sri. L.R. 167.

However, what needs consideration of this Court is whether a writ of Mandamus can be

issued on the consequences taken place based on the purported agreement, marked P10

and not by considering the whole statutory context in the Act or in its Section 17. The

Petitioners case is clung on the agreement reflected in P10, which is a purported

agreement between the 2nd Petitioner and the Bank. The Respondents strenuously argue

that this Court cannot exercise its writ jurisdiction to enforce agreements between private

parties. In resolving this issue, I need to primarily examine whether the terms or conditions

mentioned in P10 have a statutory flavour.

The approach taken by this Court in several previous cases is that this Court has the

discretionary power to exercise its writ jurisdiction even on a question arising out of a

contract of employment, if the respective order is in breach of statutory

restrictions/provisions and also if such public body has taken a decision assuming a

jurisdiction which he does not have or exceeding his jurisdiction by violating a statutory

requirement which eventually comes under any of the established grounds of judicial

review.

The Petitioners have decided to withdraw the earlier application bearing case No.

CA/Writ/269/2017 and filed the instant Application changing the mode of reliefs for the

reasons best known to them. This Court is compelled to determine this Application based

on the issues raised by the Petitioners in the instant Application as it was existing at the

date of the filing of this Application. It is quite clear that the remedy opted for by the

Petitioners to get the said purported agreement P10 enforced is this writ Application and

not a process of moving for a decree or an order of a District Court commanding the Bank

to pay money, to deliver property etc. At this stage, the contents of the letter issued by the

Bank, marked P15, which illustrates the intention of the Bank to refund the advance

payment of Rs.25,000,000.00 is also required to be considered.

The decision to cancel the Certificate of Sale under Section 17 ofcourse has a statutory

flavour but, in view of the foregoing, I take the view that this Court cannot extend its

review jurisdiction beyond the stage of resale as there is no further statutory duty cast upon

the Bank towards the borrower after the resale. The reason for me to arrive at such

conclusion is based on the scheme of the Act and on the plain reading of the Section. In

this regard, I have borne in mind the fact that the 1st Respondent-Seylan Bank PLC is not

a State Bank which is incorporated by a separate Act of Parliament.

Page 9 of 11

If you go on the strict interpretation of Section 17, it implies that a borrower or any person

on his behalf may apply to a Review Court in respect of transgressions of the bank relating

to the cancellation of the Certificate of Sale. Anyhow a non-cancellation of a Certificate

of Sale can be challenged only if the total amount due in respect of the loan including all

interests are settled. In order to settle such dues mentioned in Section 17, the borrower and

the bank are at liberty to enter into any type of agreement and it cannot be assumed that

such agreement will also be amenable to writ jurisdiction. Hence, I take the view that this

Court cannot intervene to enforce the said purported agreement P10.

Having considered the relief sought by the Petitioners for a writ of Mandamus, now I need

to deal with the Petitioners claim for a writ of Certiorari.

Apart from the provisions in the said Section 17, the Petitioners rely on Section 19 of the

Act. Certain limitation has been imposed by Section 19 of the Act debarring the bank to

hold the mortgaged property for a longer period than it is necessary to enable the bank to

re-sell the property. I cannot assume that the provisions of Section 19 have any bearing on

the instant Application as the Petitioners main claim is on the legitimate expectation

arising from the purported agreement P10.

The Petitioners further argue that the Certiorari that has been sought is superfluous as the

said Deed of Transfer P20 is void. In order to substantiate the said argument, the

Petitioners have referred to the dicta in the judgement of Lord Denning in MacFoy vs.

United Africa Co. Ltd. (1961) 3 A.E.R. 1169 which has been applied in the Sri Lankan case

of Rajakulendran vs. Wijesundera (Sriskanthaa Vol. 1 Part 1 page 164). The following

passage at page 168 of the said Rajakulendran case has been highlighted;

If an act is void then it is in law a nullity. It is not only bad but incurably bad. There is no

need for an order of the court set is aside. It is automatically null and void without more ado,

though it is sometimes convenient to have the court declare it to be so. And every proceeding

which is founded on it is also bad and incurably bad. You cannot put something on nothing

and expect it to stay there. It will collapse. (at page 1172)

If I am to apply the dicta of Lord Denning in MacFoy case, there should be a decision or

act taken totally in terms of the said Act during the process of recovering the loans by the

Bank. I have explained above the demarcations for Judicial Review in respect of the

decisions taken during the recovery process under the Act by the Bank which is considered

Page 10 of 11

as a Private Bank in the country. The assertions that the purported agreement P10 falls

within the ambit of a transaction in a contractual nature between the 2nd Petitioner and the

Bank eventually vitiate the above argument of the Petitioner raised in line with the MacFoy

case. For the reasons setout above, not only the Petitioners claim for a writ of Certiorari

to quash the decision to sell the property but also the relief sought to quash the notarially

executed Deed of Transfer P20 by way of a writ of certiorari fails. The Petitioners are not

acquainted with a blatant miscarriage of justice warranting this Court to consider the

nullification of the said Deed of Transfer P20.

In addition to my above findings, I wish to refer to the rationale adopted by Shirani A.

Bandaranayaka J. (as her Ladyship then was) in her dissenting judgement in

Ramachandran and another vs. Hatton National Bank and others (2006) 1 Sri. L.R. 393 where

she has given weight on a liberal and broader interpretation to the Act in view of recovering

loans. She has observed that;

Considering the purpose of the enactment of Act, No. 4 of 1990, it is obvious as pointed out

earlier, that the intention of the legislature was to provide for the recovery of loans granted by

the Banks. Therefore the Act makes provision for the sole purpose of recovery of the loans they

have already granted. The loans were granted by the Bank, on securities provided by the

debtor to the satisfaction of the creditor, the lending agency. (at page 413)

In Tai Hing Cotton Mill Ltd. vs. Liu Chong Hing Bank Ltd. (1986) AC 426; (1985) 2 All ER

947, the Privy Council observed;

The argument for the banks is that the obligations of care placed on the banks in the

management of a customers account which the courts have recognized have become with the

development of banking business so burdensome that they should be met by a reciprocal

increase of responsibility imposed on the customer. One can fully understand that banks must

today look for protection. So be it. They can increase the severity of their terms of business,

and they can use their influence, as they have in the past, to seek to persuade the legislature

that they should be granted by statute further protection. But it does not follow that because

they may need protection as their business expands, the necessary incidents of their

relationship with their customer must also change.

Page 11 of 11

Thus, I take the view that even during the recovery process of loans under the said Act, all

the transactions between the borrower and the bank cannot be designated with a statutory

flavour. Borrowing money from banks is a complete contractual relationship between the

borrower and the bank and the statutory provisions in the said Act have been provided for

the recovery of loans granted by the banks for the economic development of the country

and for matters connected therein or incidental thereto (See-the long title of the Act).

Therefore, it is important to sever the statutory duties of the licensed commercial banks

among many other transactions of such banks during the process of recovery of loans. It

is stated in Banks and Banking Law in Sri Lanka (by W. S. Weerasuriya, 2006, Institute

of Bankers Sri Lanka, p. 203); While no doubt there is a close relationship between the

banking practice and banking law, bankers must clearly appreciate that banking practice

is not invariably banking law.

In light of the foregoing, I hold that Petitioners are not entitled to any of the reliefs prayed

for in the prayer of the Petition. Thus, I proceed to dismiss the Application of the

Petitioner.

Application is dismissed.
