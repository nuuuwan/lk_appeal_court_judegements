The Petitioner seeks for a writ of Certiorari quashing the Order/Notice, marked P6, issued

by the 1st Respondent-Commissioner General of Labour. By P6 the 1st Respondent has

decided that the Petitioner has terminated the services of the 5th Respondent without the

consent of the 5th Respondent and also without prior approval of the 1st Respondent as

required by Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No. 45 of

1971, as amended (TEWA). Further, the Petitioner has been directed to reinstate the 5th

Respondent with effect from 01.12.2021 without break of service.

The 5th Respondent has been employed by way of a fixed term contract of employment

dated 18.11.2016. Such contract specifically stipulates that it will be operative only until

20.11.2017. It appears that the said contract has been renewed and the services of the 5th

Respondent has been terminated during the pendency of such period of renewal. It is no

doubt that such termination has taken place not on disciplinary grounds but by Petitioner

using his discretion by virtue of Clause 13 of the said contract which deals with termination

of services.

The contention of the Petitioner is that in view of Clause 13.2 of the Contract, such

employment can be terminated by either party giving to the other one months notice

thereof or one months salary in lieu of such notice. Thus, the Petitioner argues, the

requirement of consent of the workman under Section 2 of TEWA is duly embodied in the

said Clause 13.2 enabling the Petitioner to terminate the services only by giving one months

notice.

As opposed to such arguments, the 1st to 4th Respondents assert that the 5th Respondent is

covered by the provisions of TEWA and thus, the Petitioner has failed to follow the

mandatory provisions of Section 2 of TEWA. The Respondents rely on the judgements of

Hiddelarachchi vs. United Motors Lanka Ltd., and others (2006) 3 Sri. L.R. 411 and Lanka Multi

Moulds (Pvt) Ltd vs. Wimalasena, Commissioner of Labour and others (2001) 3 Sri. L.R. 301.

Anyhow, I should draw my attention to the precedent annunciated by the Supreme Court in

the Appeal [(2003) 1 Sri. L.R 143] from Court of Appeal in the above Lanka Multi Moulds

(Pvt) Ltd vs. Wimalasena, Commissioner of Labour and others case where the Court has held

that the Prior consent required by section 2(1)(a) of the TEWA need not necessarily be

contained in a single sheet of paper; it could be inferred from the attendant circumstances in

each case. Thus, the applicability of the precedent laid down by those judgements to the

instant Application need to be examined in the perspective of the true nature of the question

of the instant Application.

The alleged consent expressed by the 5th Respondent to terminate his services based on the

provisions of the said Agreement would come into effect upon a notice by either party, will

be a significant issue in this case.

Hence, a question arises in the instant Application, whether such consent on its own would

fulfil the requirement of obtaining the consent of the workman as stipulated in the Section 2

of TEWA. I take the view that the defence of the 5th Respondent is also need to be

considered when arriving at a conclusion of the relevant questions of the instant Application

but it is noted that the 5th Respondent was absent and unrepresented when this matter was

taken up for support. Although, the learned State Counsel who appears for the 1st to 4th

Respondents moves that the instant Application be dismissed in limine at the threshold

stage, I take the view that the questions of the instant Application need to be assayed at a

trial hearing without prejudice to the stand taken by the Respondents.

In the circumstances, this Court should fully consider the facts and circumstances of this

case on affidavits at a final hearing after issuing formal notice of this Application on the

Respondents.
