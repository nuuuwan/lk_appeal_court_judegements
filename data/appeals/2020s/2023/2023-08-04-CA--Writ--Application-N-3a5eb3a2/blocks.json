The 2nd Petitioner is a director of the 1st Petitioner Company. The Petitioners state that they ordered certain goods from a Chinese exporter. However, the exporter had loaded certain packages of undeclared cosmetics, two Ceramic Commodes and three Ceramic Wash Basins into the container. It is said that the said cosmetic packages which were supposed to have been shipped to Dubai had been mistakenly loaded into the container by the exporter and the said ceramic bathroom fittings had been sent free of charge for the personal use of the directors of the 1st Respondent Company without their knowledge. The Petitioners conceded that those items had not been declared in the Manifest, Bill of Lading, Delivery Order, Packing List or Commercial Invoice. Consequently, Sri Lanka Customs invoking Sections 12,43 and 107 of the Customs Ordinance has forfeited the entire consignment by its Order dated 02.06.2021 including the items which had been duly declared under the said consignment (inventoried items no.1 to 12,16,17,18 and 21) as those items had been used to cover or conceal the goods which had not been duly declared. However, the declared items were subsequently released on a mitigated forfeiture of Rs.5,000,000/= in terms of Sections 163 and 166B of the Customs Ordinance.",

The Petitioners further contend that the cosmetic items which were forfeited could have been mitigated at the discretion of the Director General of Customs without destroying them. Accordingly being aggrieved by the above order dated 02.06.2021 of the 2nd Respondent, the Petitioner seeks intervention of this court inter alia by way of Writs of Certiorari to quash the impugned order dated 02.06.2021, Writs of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to mitigate the forfeiture in respect of the said ceramic bathroom fittings (inventoried items no.19 and 20) and the cosmetic items (inventoried items no.13,14 and 15) and to release the one million cash deposit and four million bank guarantee tendered in order to clear the impugned consignment and Writ of Prohibition prohibiting 1st to 4th Respondents from claiming destroying charges from the Petitioners.",

However, it is apparent that the said items were forfeited primarily on the basis that such items were not declared under the provisions of the Customs Ordinance. Whether an item is licensable or not is immaterial when forfeiting any imported goods if the items imported have not been declared to the Customs authorities in the first place. Hence, the applicability of Regulation 4 of the Gazette Extraordinary marked X5 is immaterial in the given instance since there already were sufficient grounds for the forfeiture of the ceramic items as they were undeclared. Thus, I am of the view that the Petitioners have been misdirected in law in submitting that the said Gazette Extraordinary marked X5 shall be applicable in the given circumstances.",

Said paragraph 07 stipulates that at the time of importation of the impugned ceramic goods, there was a temporary suspension of the importation of ceramic goods. As such, it appears that the Petitioners in violation of the said provisions had attempted to illegally import the impugned ceramic items into the country.

Thus, the Petitioners claim that the impugned order is illegal. The quantity of the cosmetic items found undeclared was fairly considerable. An extent of 2888 kg of undeclared cosmetic items had been found at the far end of the container among other goods at the examination of the consignment. As evidenced by the photographs marked R13(a) to R13(e), it appears that the said cosmetic items had been concealed using other goods (such as paper rolls).

It had been further disclosed from the proceedings of the customs inquiry that the shipper had informed the 2nd Petitioner of the shipment of certain undeclared items along with the consignment, via the email dated 08.03.2021. However, the Petitioners failed to disclose the said email until the Customs inquiry held on 01.06.2021. Even at the time when the consignment was examined on 12.03.2021 by Customs, the Petitioners failed to disclose the said email which was material to the matter in issue to the Customs officials. The explanation given by the 2nd Petitioner for the said failure was that the 2nd Petitioner did not notice the same as he was busy. In view of the contents of the said email and the baseless excuse provided by the 2nd Petitioner to justify his failure to produce the said email dated 08.03.2021, the only inference this Court could draw upon is that the 2nd Petitioner intentionally attempted to conceal the fact that he intended to import the said undeclared goods along with the impugned consignment. Non-declaration of the impugned ceramic and cosmetic items to Customs at the required juncture, the contradictory positions taken up by the 2nd Petitioner at and the concealment of said communication by the 2nd Petitioner further show their mala fide intentions.",

    "text": "One of the main arguments of the Petitioners is that the impugned decision of the 2nd Respondent was made without assigning reasons. In the instant inquiry, the 2nd Respondent inquiring officer performed a quasi-judicial function and is duty bound to act fairly. Fairness requires a reasoned decision. However, the Respondents stance is that the 2nd Respondent has given reasons through the observations made by him and as such the orders are consistent with the DOPL 1488 and the general duty to give reasons. The 2nd Respondent has stated in the document marked X6A, under the heading of Observations (X6A) that having gone through the evidence, led before me which includes documents marked at the inquiry, answers to the questions by the officer assisting the inquiry and response to show cause, I observed following. and considering all the evidence led before me, I make following order. It must be noted that the 2nd Respondent Inquiring Officer has provided the reasons for his determination under the guise of observations and has in fact paid due attention to the evidence led before him. Upon considering the contents placed under the heading Observations, it appears that the observations include an evaluation of evidence under the heading Observations which justify his conclusion.",
