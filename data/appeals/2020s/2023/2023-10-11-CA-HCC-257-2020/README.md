Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was convicted of

raping a woman named Hewassagamage Shakila Priyadharshani (PW1) and was

sentenced to a term of 12 years rigorous imprisonment with compensation of Rs.250,000/-

carrying a default sentence of 2 years simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs.20,000/- and

a default sentence of 9 months simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction the Accused has appealed to this court.

The following are the grounds of appeal set out in the written submission.

1. The evidence of the prosecutrix is unworthy of credit

2. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the legal principles relating

to corroboration as it would be relevant to allegations of rape

3. A fair and comprehensive investigation has not been conducted by the Police,

which has led to a grave prejudice being caused to the Appellant

4. The evidence given by the Appellant, his wife and sister have not been properly

assessed and analysed by the Learned Trial Judge.

5. The learned Trial judge has failed to apply the proper principles relating to burden

of proof in convicting the Appellant.

Page 3 of 11

6. Without prejudice to the above grounds of appeal, it is argued that the custodial

sentence imposed on the Appellant is excessive and deserves to be reduced

considering the facts and circumstances pertaining to this case.

The facts of this case are summarised as follows:

According to PW1, Shakila Priyadarashani (the victim and a distant relative of the

Accused) testified that on the 12th of August 2009, around 2:00 pm when she was going

to the well to have bath which was near to her house her brother, Nishanka, noticed that

the door to the rear entrance of her house was open, a door she recalled locking before she

left. When she returned home and was getting dressed in her room, she heard a noise near

her bedroom door. Turning to identify the source, she saw the Accused and promptly

screamed, asking, , "Then, the Accused covered her mouth

with his hand, leaving her face reda detail she noted when later speaking to the police.

He pushed her onto the bed, positioned himself on top of her, began to remove his trousers,

and forcibly assaulted her. Throughout this ordeal, her hands were restrained together.

She experienced pain during the assault. Afterward, when the Accused tried to leave,

PW1 grabbed his t-shirt, and the Accused pushed PW1 away. Afterwards when she

checked her skirt (evidence marked as P1) she saw blood on it, and noticed her bed sheet

was stained with blood as well (evidence marked as P2). She indicated that she was

abused for half an hour, she affirms that there were houses in the vicinity but that she

could not seek help.

She added that she had not left her house until her mother arrived. After her mother

(PW2) returned, she complained to her. Her mother then went over to the ground where

the Accused was playing and spoke to him. At 7:00 pm, PW1, along with PW2 and PW2s

elder sibling, went to the police to lodge a complaint. Since there was no female officer

present, she was sent to the hospital for an examination. She was examined by a doctor

the following day because the hospital had been closed the night before. Moreover, she

denies having met the Accused or visiting his house.

As stated in her cross-examination, about two weeks before this heinous incident,

she had learned about the Accused because PW2 had informed her of their relationship

and the fact that he was PW1's uncle. They had first met at the market. When the defense

suggested an affair between PW1 and the Accused, she denied such an implication. When

questioned by the defense about why her screams weren't heard by neighboring houses in

Page 4 of 11

close proximity, she explained that the sound did not travel because all the windows and

doors were closed.

It should be noted that this point was raised when PW5 gave evidence; he affirmed

that there were no people around in that vicinity at that time.

She had tried to struggle but she was restrained by the Accused, and she was

abused for half an hour. After she told PW2 who later questioned the Accused, he admitted

to troubling PW1. Thereafter, he brought his wife (DW1) and said that he accepted his

guilt at the time, but nothing of that sort transpired, and he tried to attack both PW1 and

PW2. The defense put forward the demeaning question, suggesting that it was PW1s

mothers plan to implicate the Accused to get him to marry the prosecutrix. PW1

completely denied these implications.

Although we did not have the benefit of observing the demeanour and deportment

of the witness, the Learned Trial Judge, who did, was impressed by the testimonial

trustworthiness of this witness and accepted her evidence as credible and truthful. We

hold that she was consistent with her story given at the trial court; therefore, we are

satisfied that she is telling the truth. The primary objection raised against the victim was

the lack of corroboration in her testimony. Our courts have considered this aspect and

concluded that corroborative evidence is not necessary if the victim's testimony is of such

a character that it convinces the court of its truthfulness.

In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V. State of Gujarat (1983) AIR S.C 753 Indian Supreme

Court stated thus: -

Page 5 of 11

In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in

the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to injury.

However in Gurcharan Singh V. State of Haryana AIR 1972 S.C 2661 the Indian

Supreme Court held: -

As a rule of prudence, however, court normally looks for some corroboration on her

testimony so as to satisfy its conscience that she is telling the truth and that the person

accused of rape on her has not been falsely implicated.

In Premasiri V. The Queen 77 N.L.R 86 Court of Criminal Appeal held: -

In a charge of rape it is proper for a Jury to convict on the uncorroborated evidence

of the complainant only when such evidence is of such character as to convince the Jury

that she is speaking the truth.

In Sunil and another V. The Attorney General 1986 1 SLR 230, His Lordship

Dheeraratne, J held that: -

I think it is perfectly legitimate for a judge, in a case of this nature, to direct a

jury that if they find the evidence of the complainant so convincing, they could act on that

evidence alone, even in the absence of her evidence being corroborated. I find that this

proposition has been succinctly expressed by Salmon, L. J. in the case of Rex

v. Manning (3):

"What the judge has to do is to use clear and simple language that will without any

doubt convey to the jury that in cases of alleged sexual offences it is really dangerous to

convict on the evidence of the woman or girl alone. This is dangerous because human

experience has shown that in these courts girls and women do sometimes tell an entirely

false story which is very easy to fabricate, but extremely difficult to refute. Such stories

are fabricated for all sorts of reasons, which I need not now innumerate, and sometimes

for no reason at all. The judge should then go on to tell the jury that, bearing that warning

well in mind they have to look at the particular facts of the particular case and if, having

given full weight to the warning, they come to the conclusion that in the particular case

the woman or girl without any real doubt is speaking the truth, then the fact that there

is no corroboration matters not at all; they are entitled to convict." (This case was relied

by Justice Sisira De Abrew in K.W.N.K Jayalath v The Republic of Sri Lanka, [2010] C.A

128/206 decided on 06.10.2009 (2010 B.L.R 153).)

Page 6 of 11

The above dictums were heavily relied upon by His Lordship H.N. J. Perera, J in

the case of Thambarasa Sabaratnam v. A.G, CA 127/2012, decided on 03.08.2015, held;

Therefore, it is very clear that an accused person facing a charge of sexual offence

can be convicted on the uncorroborated evidence of the victim when her evidence is of such

character as to convince the court that she is speaking the truth. Although the accused-

appellant took up a plea of alibi in his evidence, it was never put to the prosecutrix in

cross-examination.

We hold that, since the court accepts the prosecutrix's evidence as truthful, we find

there is no impediment for this court to act solely on the evidence of the prosecutrix.

According to PW2 Amarawathie (PW1s mother and relative to the Accused), on the

fateful day after returning home from work at 6:00 pm, PW1 had complained to PW2

about what the Accused did to her, PW2 had inspected the white skirt that PW1 was

wearing at the time and discovered that it was stained with blood. afterwards, PW2

questioned the Accused who was playing cricket on the adjacent ground, The Accused

went on to admit the allegation made by PW2 and stated that he did not expect the

incident to be this severe.

On page 91 of the brief;

.

The Accused, along with his wife (DW1) and his sister (DW2), arrived at PW1s

house and discussed the incident. During that time, the Accused stated he accepted the

accusation because he was afraid. Thereafter, PW2, PW1, PW2's son, and her sibling

proceeded to the police station to lodge a complaint. PW2 rode in a three-wheeler to find

the Accused, while PW1 and PW2's sibling went to the hospital. She added that they were

distantly related to the Accused through PW2's father and did not have a close

relationship with him.

In her cross-examination, she stated that there was a distant relationship with the

Accused and that PW1 did not know the Accused very well. PW2 denied the suggestions

of an affair between the Accused and PW1. After PW1 reported the incident to PW2, she

examined her daughter's clothes. The defense raised two queries: first, whether this was

a scheme between her and her daughter to have her daughter marry the Accused, and

Page 7 of 11

second, whether they went to the police because the Accused had instructed them to. PW2

denied these suggestions. Taking into consideration the aforementioned witness

testimony, we believe that the Prosecutrix informed her mother truthfully about the

incident without any exaggeration. We find PW2s evidence to be consistent.

When we examine the evidence of the aforementioned witnesses, we observe that

the Learned Trial Judge properly evaluated the evidence presented to him. He equipped

himself to adjudicate based on the facts, through the observation of the demeanour and

deportment of the witnesses. We find no reason to challenge the evidence presented to us

by these witnesses, as it is not perverse and does not create any form of doubt. We identify

no inconsistencies in the corroborated evidence between the two witnesses, which

indicates that these witnesses remained consistent throughout. This consistency denotes

their trustworthiness and reliability

PW5, CI Don Padumalal Wijayawickrema, testified that on the day in question, at

7:45 pm, the preliminary complaint was lodged at the police station by PW1 and PW2.

Since the lady officer was not present at the time, he sent PW1 along with her aunt to the

hospital for examination. Later, at 7:55 pm, PW5 led a team of officers from the police

station with the intent to arrest the Accused. However, the Accused was not at home. PW5

informed the neighbours to ask the Accused to report to the police station. The next day,

at 10:35 am, the lady officer, WPC 1078 Gayani (PW7), recorded a statement from PW1.

PW5 inspected the house. During his inspection of the room where the incident occurred,

he found a grey bedsheet stained with blood. He took it into custody, returned to the police

station, entered it as No.79/2005, and handed it over to the reserve officer. He further

noted that there were houses in close proximity

In his cross-examination, he stated that he went to the prosecutrix's residence at

7:55 p.m. on the day of the incident. However, it was closed, so they returned the following

day. The inspection was conducted at 12:40 p.m., and the details were entered at 1:00 p.m.

He further confirmed that wooden items were placed in the corner of the room. During his

visit to the prosecutrix's house for the inspection, both PW1 and PW2 were present.

PW6, P.S 31725 Athula Jayakodi, corroborated PW5's testimony regarding the

date and time the complaint was lodged. He also mentioned that he did not record the

statement because the lady officer was not available at that moment.

On page 122 of the brief;

He further stated that the Accused was informed to come to the police station.

Subsequently, the Accused visited the police station on 14.08.2009 and was arrested there.

In his cross-examination, he mentioned that PW7 had recorded PW1s statement at 12:00

noon on 13.08.2009 while they were at the hospital. He also indicated that the Accused

had voluntarily visited the police station on 14.08.2009 at 8:20 a.m. and was then

arrested. PW7, WPC 1078 Gayani de Silva, shared that she was asked to record a

statement from PW1, who was at the Balapitiya Hospital on 13.08.2009. She left the police

station at 8:30 a.m. to do so. She recorded both PW1s and PW2s statements. In her cross-

examination, she mentioned that she had recorded PW1s statement on 13.08.2009 at

10:35 a.m. and entered it in the crime book by 12:00 noon. PW3, Dr. Dampali Jagoda,

reported that on the 13th of August 2009, she took a brief history of the unfortunate

incident that occurred between PW1 and the Accused and then examined PW1 at 9:00

a.m. Afterwards, PW3 discovered three injuries which were located in her female genitalia

and towards the low side of the said region, she further claimed that there were serious

injuries which appeared to be lacerations. She further stated that these injuries could

have been caused four to five days ago. When it was put forward by the prosecution if this

could have been caused on the previous day, she affirmed that it is possible.

On page 139 of brief:

She further indicated that the laceration observed could be inflicted through a level

of force during intercourse.

In her cross-examination, she confirmed that PW1s statement was taken on

13.08.2009 at 9:00 am, during which a brief history of her being subjected to abuse was

recorded. She further stated that an examination can be conducted without issues even

Page 9 of 11

after 48 hours from the incident. In her expert opinion, she noted that lacerations are not

commonly observed during consensual intercourse. However, they are more likely to occur

when force is involved.

The evidence presented by PW3 directs our attention to the brief history provided

by the prosecutrix, the injuries observed in her female genitalia, and the conclusions

drawn based on her expert opinion. Taking into account the brief history provided by PW1

to PW3, which highlighted that she was subjected to sexual abuse through intercrural sex

by the Accused forcibly, we find that this account remains consistent with all the evidence

we have reviewed above. Given the testimonies of PW2, PW5, PW6, and PW7, as well as

the medical report by PW3, we see no reason to doubt PW1s account of her experience

A similar situation arose in the case of D. Tikiribanda v A.G [2010] B.L.R, CA case

no. 64/2003 decided on 06.10.2009, His Lordship W.L Ranjith Silva held that;

The history given in the medical report is also consistent with the version of the

victim. Although this may not be corroboration in the strict sense it could be taken as

evidence consistent and thus form to some extent, corroboration and is admissible under

section 157 of the Evidence Ordinance. In addition to what I have already stated, in the

light of consistency in the evidence of the victim, of her mother and the medical report

which lend credence to the version of the victim, the discrepancy, if there is any, in the

evidence of the two witnesses on this point, could be easily ignored.

Based on PW3s expert opinion, the observed injuries and their pattern align with

the brief account provided by PW1. It was evident that the Accused exerted significant

force during penetration. After considering all these aspects, I am of the opinion that this

witness's testimony is reliable and can be accepted.

The Accused version

The Accused gave evidence under oath that on 12.08.2009, at about 4:30 p.m., he

encountered PW1, who rushed towards him, asking why he wasn't speaking to her. She

then held both his hands. In response, the Accused slapped her hands away and departed.

Page 10 of 11

Later, around 5:30 p.m., PW2 approached him on the playground, querying if he had

harassed her daughter. He replied that he hadn't. After returning home, he informed his

wife (DW1) about PW2's allegation. The Accused, DW1, and DW2 then went to PW2's

residence to discuss the accusation. Upon their arrival at PW2's home, DW1 told PW2

that her husband hadn't harmed the prosecutrix and suggested that if they believed the

allegations, they should report it to the police. In his evidence, the Accused neither

mentioned a secret affair with PW1 nor challenged the false accusation while at PW2s

residence.

In his cross-examination, when PW2 questioned the Accused about the incident, he

believed it referred to him pushing her away during their conversation. He further

confirmed that no specific allegations were hinted at him. Additionally, he mentioned that

when he visited PW2s house later that day, he did not inquire about the accusation. He

later avoided approaching the police due to fear but claims to have voluntarily reported

to the police station later. Upon reviewing the evidence provided by the Accused, it is

apparent that he has contradicted what he stated earlier during his examination-in-chief.

This clearly indicates a lack of consistency in his evidence, making it unreliable. When

examining the Accused's account, his reason for evading the police and not immediately

reporting to the station is implausible. If he genuinely did not commit such a grievous act,

then why did he refrain from approaching the police? Furthermore, during his cross-

examination, he indicated understanding PW2's inquiry as relating to him pushing PW1,

resulting in her fall. If he truly believes in his innocence, his absence from the police

station on 12.08.2009 seems improbable. Moreover, the Accused did not mention the

alleged secret affair with the prosecutrix when he was at PW2s residence. This detail

wasn't revealed to PW2 until the trial. We find no logical reason why this prosecution

witness would concoct such a lie to implicate the Accused. When contrasting the evidence

provided by PW2 with that of the Accused regarding what PW2 had questioned him about,

PW2's evidence appears consistent, whereas the Accused's does not

DW1, Dulika Priyadharashani Mendis (wife of the Accused and relative of the

victim), testified that the prosecutrix and her family had a very close relationship with

her own family. DW1 mentioned that if the prosecutrix claimed she never interacted with

the appellant, it was a blatant falsehood. This was because the prosecutrix frequently

visited their home, assisting the appellant with household chores and childcare. On the

day in question, the Accused informed her of PW2's claim that he had harmed the

prosecutrix. When she inquired about the truth of this allegation, her husband denied it.

Page 11 of 11

Subsequently, along with DW2, they visited PW2's home to discuss the accusation. The

Accused denied the claim and recommended that they lodge a police complaint instead of

making unfounded allegations. DW1 conceded that she was unaware of any romantic

relationship between the Accused and the prosecutrix at the time of the incident, learning

about it only later on.

I am mindful of the observation made by Justice Sisira De Abrew J in Savinda v

Republic of Sri Lanka [2010], 1 S.L.R 32 at page 37, His Lordship held that;

Learned SSC pointed out that he was arrested whilst hiding on the ceiling of the

appellant's house. She tried to contend that he went into hiding because of the guilty

mind. But when considering this contention one must one forget the fact that his wife was

present at the time of the arrest. No man will admit in the presence of his wife that he

committed sexual intercourse on a woman with or without consent.

For the reasons outlined above, we believe that there is no merit in any of the

grounds of appeal presented by the Counsel for the Accused. Consequently, we, of this

court, find no justification to interfere with the findings, conclusions, or judgment of the

learned High Court judge dated 10.09.2020. We therefore dismiss this appeal.
