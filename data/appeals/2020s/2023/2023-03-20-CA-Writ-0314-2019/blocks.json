The Respondent stated that permit P 2 was given to one Podi Appuhamilage Dayapala whereas the Petitioner named in the caption and the person who has sworn the affidavit in support of the Petition is one G. A. Dayapala and therefore, the application is misconceived in law. In response, the Petitioner stated that the Petitioner's name was misprinted because of a technical error. In fact, in the caption of the affidavit and the declarants name in the affidavit is printed as G. A. Dayapala whereas in fact it should have been P. A. Dayapala. However, on the Petitioner's national identification card submitted with the petition (P 2), the Petitioner's name is Podi Appuhamilage Dayapala. In addition, in the counter affidavit filed by the Petitioner, the name of the declarant is rightly mentioned as Podi Appuhamilage Dayapala.",
