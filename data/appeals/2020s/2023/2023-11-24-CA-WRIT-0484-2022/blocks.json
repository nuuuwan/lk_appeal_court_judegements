Many factors including delayed referral to nephrology services, poor patient uptake, and delays in creating AVF due to lack of trained staff and non-availability of surgical theatre facilities contribute to this. Both haemodialysis and CAPD are provided free of charge in public hospitals. A haemodialysis session in the state sector approximately costs USD 38, while it costs between USD 39-43 in the private sector. Considering that most patients undergo twice-weekly dialysis the approximate cost per month for a patient on haemodialysis is USD 300 - 350. Despite the haemodialysis and the medications provided free of charge in the state sector, indirect expenses including transport and loss of work due to treatment have resulted in many patients not attending dialysis sessions regularly.",
