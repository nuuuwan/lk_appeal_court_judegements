JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General on following charge:

On or about the 25th September 1992 the accused committed the murder of

Pathirennehelage Dayaratna which is an offence punishable under Section

296 of the Penal Code.

3 | P a g e

As the Appellant opted for a non-jury trial, the trial commenced before a

judge and the prosecution had led six witnesses and marked production P1-

3 and closed the case. Learned High Court Judge having satisfied that the

evidence presented by the prosecution warrants a case to answer, called for

the defence and explained the rights of the accused.

On the day of the defence trial, the Appellant through his Counsel informed

the court that after considering the evidence adduced by the prosecution, he

was willing to tender a plea under Section 297 of the Penal Code.

Having considered the application of the Appellant, the Learned State

Counsel extended his willingness to accept a plea under Section 297 of the

Penal Code on basis of a sudden fight, which is an exception to Section 294

of the Penal Code.

The exception 4 to Section 294 (Murder) of the Penal Code states as

follows:

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or

acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation: - It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the

provocation or commits the first assault.

Having heard the submissions of both parties and considering the evidence

presented by the prosecution, the Learned High Court Judge had convicted

the Appellant for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section

297 and sentenced him to 12 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of

Rs.1000/-. In default, 01 months simple imprisonment ordered.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid sentence the Appellant preferred this appeal

to this court.

4 | P a g e

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. At the hearing the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The Learned Presidents Counsel extended his argument on the basis that

the facts and circumstances of this case only warrants a sentence under the

second limb of Section 297 of the Penal Code.

Section 297 of the Penal Code states as follows:

Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be

punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to twenty years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which

the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing

such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;

or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with

the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention

to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause

death.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to PW1, Jayasundara, when the unfortunate incident happened,

he was the Assistant Station Master attached to Keenawala Railway Station.

On 25th of September 1992, when he was on duty at the aforesaid railway

station, at about 6.30 p.m. suddenly he had seen a person chasing another

shouting dont run. When he came out of his office had seen a person being

stabbed by another on the railway platform. As a result, the victim had fallen

on the platform. He had identified the Appellant as the assailant as he is a

well-known person of the area. Although he had asked the Appellant what

he was doing, the Appellant had threatened the witness and stabbed the

5 | P a g e

deceased. Further, the Appellant had stabbed the deceased again on his

neck. This witness had noticed that the Appellant was drunk at that time.

According to the JMO who held the post mortem examination, had stated

that the death had occurred due to two stab injuries on the lung. The doctor

had noted 10 stab wounds on the deceaseds body.

The Learned State Counsel in his sentencing submission submitted that

both the Appellant and the deceased had consumed liquor prior to this

incident. PW1 in his evidence too admitted that the Appellant was drunk at

the time of stabbing.

In Don Shamantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha v. The Attorney General

CA/303/2006 and C.A.L.A. 321/2006 decided on 11/07/2012 the Court

held that:

It is trite law that even if the accused does not specifically take up the

defence of a general or special exception to criminal liability, if the facts

and circumstances before the court disclose that there were such

materials to sustain such a plea then the court must consider whether

the accused should be convicted for a lesser offence.

In this case the prosecution evidence revealed that there is some degree of

voluntary intoxication on the part of the Appellant. Even the State Counsel

who appeared for the prosecution submitted that the appellant was drunk

when the incident had taken place this defence was not taken up by the

Counsel who represented the Appellant in the High Court and made

sentencing submission on that point.

In Jayathilaka v.The Attorney General [2003] 1 SLR 107 the court held

that:

Though the accused has not taken up the defence of intoxication if such

defence arises on the evidence, it is the duty of the jury to consider the

same.

6 | P a g e

In this case the Learned High Court Judge had not considered the

intoxication when the Appellant was sentenced. Had the trial Judge

considered the intoxication of the Appellant and the deceased, the Appellant

should have been sentenced under second limb of the Section 297 of Penal

Code.

Hence, considering all the circumstances of this case, I set aside the sentence

imposed on the Appellant and substitute with a term of 10 years rigorous

imprisonment. A fine of Rs.1000/- with 06 months default sentence also

imposed on the Appellant. As the Appellant is in prison since the date of

conviction by the Learned High Court Judge, I order the sentence imposed

by this Court be operative from 22/03/2018.

Subject to the above variation the appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Gampaha along with the original case record.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.

I agree.
