B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

This is an appeal by the Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Accused) on being aggrieved by his conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High

Court Judge of Colombo.

The Accused was indicted before the High Court of Colombo for having in his

possession 2.11 grams of Diacetylmorphine, commonly known as Heroin, and trafficking

the said quantity of Heroin on 07th May 2013, which are offences punishable under the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

The Prosecution led evidence of eight witnesses including the government analyst

and closed the case for the Prosecution. The Accused made a dock statement and led the

evidence of one witness. The learned High Court Judge of Colombo, in his judgment, found

the Accused guilty on both counts. Accordingly, the Accused was convicted and sentenced

to life imprisonment.

Page 3 of 13

Being aggrieved by said judgment this appeal was preferred by the Accused.

The following grounds of appeal were urged by the learned Counsel for the Accused

in the course of his oral and written submissions:

1. The learned trial Judge had failed to consider the vital contradictions of the

Prosecution witnesses.

2. The learned trial judge had wrongly rejected the dock statement and the evidence

of Defence witness.

3. The learned trial judge has been biased towards the Prosecution and has abused

Defence witnesses.

When this matter was argued before us on 02.03.2023, the learned Counsel for the

Defence informed us that the Accused would not be pursuing the third ground of appeal.

Therefore, it is the first two grounds of appeal that we will address.

Facts in brief, as per evidence led by the Prosecution, are as follows.

The witness SI Nawarathna (PW1), attached to Dehiwala Police Station, had been

contacted by the Officer in Charge (OIC) of Dehiwala Police Station on 7th May 2013 at

around 13.20 while he was on patrol duty, pertaining to information regarding an

individual in possession of Heroin. It should be noted that at this point he had previously

arrested a person for possession of Heroin at 12.10. Upon receiving the call, he proceeded

to the Police Station and handed over the suspect and the production to the reserve. He

then met with the four Army intelligence officers and ascertained information about the

individual in possession of drugs, residing at No. 481 Rajaguru Sri Shubodhi Road,

Wellawatta. Following this, PW1 went to the house in question in a Police three-wheeler

with PC 1568 Bandara (PW2), PC 7248 Prasad (PW3), PC 82459 Kumara (PW4), and the

Army Officers who showed the place. At the house, they searched a person, believing that

person to be the Accused, and found a parcel covered in pink cellophane paper in his right

trouser pocket.

As stated by PW1, (On page 63 of the Brief proceedings dated 20/10/2020)

- , 481 ?

.

Upon inspection, PW1 identified the contents in the parcel as Heroin and accordingly,

they made the arrest at 14.10. Thereafter, the suspect, along with the Heroin which was

in his possession, was taken to Devi Jewelries (situated at No. 269, Galle Road,

Wellawatta) at around 15.00 to weigh the Heroin. It was found that there were 11 grams

and 20 milligrams of Heroin. They reached the Wellawatta Police Station at 18.05, and

the production was sealed and handed over to the reserve along with the suspect.

Thereafter, the police officers PW1 along with other officers proceeded to the Dehiwala

Police Station. They arrived at the said Police Station at around 20.00 and at that time

only, the production from the first raid is properly sealed and the entry is made by PW1.

PC 72992 Prasad (PW3) is an officer who assisted PW1 in the raid. PW3,

corroborates PW1s version regarding the place, time, and way they arrested the Accused,

but varies from PW1s version as to the time of arrival at Wellawatta Police Station.

According to PW3, they arrived at Wellawatta Station at around 16.30 and he had

recorded the statement of the Accused at 17.00.

PW9, namely Major (retired) Wanninayaka was an Army intelligence officer and

a subordinate to Major Peiris (PW7) who led the surveillance of the Accused. According to

his evidence, he only joined the surveillance team on the day before the arrest, and on the

evening of the same day, they reported to Major Peiris. The next day, they went to the

Dehiwala Police Station and met with PW1, and after that followed PW1 and his team to

the house of the Accused, although the Army officers did not enter the house. It is his

position that after the arrest, the Police team took the Accused and the production to Devi

Jewelers to weigh the Heroin. According to PW9, Devi Jewelers was just opposite the

Police Station, on other side of the Galle Road from the Wellawatta Police Station and the

distance between was about 500m.

The Accused, in his dock statement, stated that he was not arrested by PW1 or any

the other police officers, at his house, but he was taken to his house, while he was washing

his vehicle at the public tap, by persons who identified themselves to be army officers.

Once there, after receiving a telephone call, a parcel containing Heroin had been retrieved

Page 5 of 13

from the goat shed near the house. Accordingly, he was arrested and taken to the

Dehiwala Police Station around 13.00. His version was corroborated by one witness called

by him, namely one Weerasingha Arachchilage Gnanasiri (W1).

At the hearing, the learned Counsel for the Accused contended that the learned

High Court Judge failed to consider the vital inter se and per se contradictions in the

evidence of the three main witnesses, namely PW1, the officer who led the raid, PW3, one

of the officers that assisted him, and PW9, one of the Army officers. He further submitted

that the learned Trial Judge failed to evaluate the dock statement and the evidence of the

Defence witness correctly. That is to say, if the learned Judge properly considered the

vital contradictions and evidence of the Prosecution, he would not have dismissed the

version of the Accused.

Before we consider the discrepancy in the two witnesses evidence, as quoted above,

this Court has to consider the evidentiary value in the event such contradictions are

discovered.

In Onassis and Calogeropoulos v. Vergottis [1968] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 403, Lord Pearce

along with Viscount Dilhorne, Lord Morris of Borth-Y-Gest, Lord Guest, held that (page

431):

Credibility" involves wider problems than mere " demeanour " which is mostly concerned

with whether the witness appears to be telling the truth as he now believes it to be.

Credibility covers the following problems. First, is the witness a truthful or untruthful

person? Secondly, is he, though a truthful person, telling something less than the truth on

this issue, or, though an untruthful person, telling the truth on this issue? Thirdly, though

he is a truthful person telling the truth as he sees it, did he register the intentions of the

conversation correctly and, if so, has his memory correctly retained them? Also, has his

recollection been subsequently altered by unconscious bias or wishful thinking or by

overmuch discussion of it with others? Witnesses, especially those who are emotional, who

think that they are morally in the tight, tend very easily and unconsciously to conjure up

a legal right that did not exist. It is a truism, often used in accident cases, that with every

day that passes the memory becomes fainter and the imagination becomes more active. For

that reason, a witness, however honest, rarely persuades a Judge that his present

recollection is preferable to that 'which was taken down in writing immediately after the

accident occurred. Therefore, contemporary documents are always of the utmost

importance. And lastly, although the honest witness believes he heard or saw this or that,

Page 6 of 13

is it so improbable that it is on balance more likely that he was mistaken? On this point it

is essential that the balance of probability is put correctly into the scales in weighing the

credibility of a witness. And motive is one aspect of probability. All these problems

compendiously are entailed when a Judge assesses the credibility of a witness; they are all

part of one judicial process. And in the process contemporary documents and admitted or

incontrovertible facts and probabilities must play their proper part.

This judgment was adopted in the case of Wickremasuriya v. Dedoleena and

Others 1996 [2] SLR 95 in which his Lordship Jayasuriya J. held:

I have already referred to the unsatisfactory and untrustworthy evidence given by witness

Agampodi Sirisena Mendis Gunasekera. Learned Presidents Counsel has referred me to

the evidence given by some of the witnesses called on behalf of the Applicant and certain

contradictions marked in relation to their evidence given at the abortive inquiry. In

particular, he has referred me to contradiction marked V6. After a considerable lapse of

time, as has resulted on this application, it is customary to come across contradictions in

the testimony of witnesses. This is a characteristic feature of human testimony which is

full of infirmities and weaknesses especially when proceedings are held long after the

events spoken to by witnesses; a judge must expect such contradictions to exist in the

testimony. The issue is whether the contradiction or inconsistency goes to the root of the

case or relates to the core of a party's case. If the contradiction is not of that character, the

court ought to accept the evidence of witnesses whose evidence is otherwise cogent, having

regard to the Test of Probability and Improbability and having regard to the demeanour

and deportment manifested by witnesses. Trivial contradictions which do not touch the

core of a partys case should not be given much significance, specially when the probabili-

ties factor echoes in favour of the version narrated by an applicant. Justice Thakkar in his

judgment in Barwada Boginbhai Hirjibhai v. the State of Gujerat, remarks: Discrepancies

which do not go to the root of the matter or to the core of a partys case and shake the basic

version of the witness cannot be given too much importance. More so, when the all

important probabilities factor echoes in favour of the version narrated by the witness.

[emphasis added]

The first discrepancy brought to the notice of this Court is the time and place at

which the information was received by PW1. It is pointed out that according to the

evidence of PW1, he and his team were away from the Police Station when they received

the information. As stated by PW1 (on page 59 of the Brief proceedings dated

20/10/2016):

Page 7 of 13

- , 2013-05-07 .

- .

- ?

?

- ,

.

Later he contradicts the above by saying that he received information when he

came to the Police Station. As stated by PW1 (on page 157 of the Brief proceedings dated

03/09/2018):

- .

?

- .

Another vital point raised by the learned Counsel for the Accused is the

discrepancy in the evidence of PW1 and PW3 as to the time of arrival at Wellawatta Police

Station. PW1 claims that they arrived at 18.05. As stated by PW1 (on page 133 of the

Brief - proceedings dated 03/09/2018):

- ?

- 18.05 .

However, according to evidence of PW3, they arrived at the Wellawatta Police

Station at around 16.30 and he recorded the statement of the Accused at 17.00. As stated

by PW3 (on page 187 of the Brief proceedings dated 03/09/2018):

- ?

- . 16.30 .

(On page 187 of the Brief)

- ?

- .

- ?

- 17.00 .

Page 8 of 13

As the learned Counsel pointed out, according to PW1s evidence the police kept

the Accused at Devi Jewelers for about three hours. Taking such a long time to surrender

the production and the Accused to the Wellawatta Police Station casts a doubt on the

credibility of PW1.

Another discrepancy found in regard to the Prosecution evidence is regarding the

distance from the Wellawatta Police station to Devi Jewelers.

As stated by PW1 (on page 133 of Brief proceedings dated 03/09/2018):

- ?

- .

On the other hand, PW9 stated thus (page 273 of Brief proceedings dated

14/112018):

- ?

- 500 .

It is our considered view that these discrepancies in the evidence need to be

considered in the light of the Defence taken by the Accused to determine whether the

evidence was credible and truthful.

In the case of James Silva v. The Republic of Sr Lanka [1980] 2 SLR 167, his

Lordship Rodrigo J. stated thus:

It is a grave error of law for a trial Judge to direct himself that he

must examine the tenability and truthfulness of the evidence of the

defence in the light of the evidence led by the Prosecution. Our

criminal law postulates a fundamental presumption of legal

innocence of every accused till the contrary is proved. This is rooted

in the concept of legal inviolability of every individual in our society,

now enshrined in our Constitution. There is not even a surface

presumption of truth in the charge with which an accused is indicted.

Therefore to examine the evidence of the accused in the light of the

Prosecution witnesses is to reverse the presumption of innocence.

Page 9 of 13

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to

consider all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the

Prosecution or by the defence in its totality without

compartmentalising and, ask himself whether as a prudent man, in

the circumstances of the particular case, he believes the accused

guilty of the charge or not guilty.

In the instant appeal, we are of the view that the discrepancies alluded to above

cannot be treated as trivial; we cannot justify the same as being a result of human

fallibility, since the evidence of the Prosecution Witnesses, when evaluated along with

that of the Defence, does not appear to be cogent. Although keeping with the wisdom of

Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance, there are judicial dicta that a single Police

Officers evidence would suffice to secure a conviction, in this case, there appears to be a

lack of cogency not only intra the evidence of the chief witness but a lack of cogency inter

the evidence of the Prosecution witnesses; officials who are expected to be trained in their

craft, as opposed to ordinary lay persons who are intimidated or overwhelmed by the

processes. This is not to say that there are no exceptions. When we consider these

contradictions, it is sufficient to reject the prosecution version as these contradictions go

to the root of the case.

The other ground of appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the Accused was the

failure on the part of the learned High Court Judge to consider the improbabilities of the

version of the Prosecution. The learned Counsel for the Accused has submitted that

evidence of the Army officers who gave the information regarding the raid is highly

improbable. It was further submitted by the learned Counsel that the position taken by

the Defence that the Accused was arrested by the Army Officers and later handed over to

the Police is more probable. Learned Counsel further contended that the learned High

Court Judge had clearly erred in rejecting the Defences version.

PW1 stated that he went to the house, searched, and arrested the suspect. Yet,

there is evidence to show that there were a number of people who were on the said

premises, along with the suspect. There are no reasons given by PW1 as to why he had

not searched the others, and how he was able to identify the suspect with such accuracy

and precision, in a room of many. We have to be mindful of the fact that the information

PW1 received concerned only the location of the house and the fact that a person with

Page 10 of 13

Heroin was residing at that location. Therefore, the question that arises is if there were

several people inside the house why the officers did not think to search the others?

According to the evidence of PW1 (on page 61 of the brief proceedings dated

20/10/2016)

- . ?

- , , 481

.

(On page 63 of the Brief)

- , 481 ?

- .

- , .

The question arises without the identification of the Accused and the number of

people who were inside the house how PW1 spotted the Accused and arrested him.

A similar circumstance was considered by his Lordship Sisira De Abrew J. in

Munasighe Arachchilage Samanalee Perera v. The Republic of Sri Lanka CA 270/2006,

decided on 2009-06-19. Where there were multiple individuals at the place of search and

only one was searched by the Police, his Lordship questioned:

If there were several women inside the house why didnt the police officers search

the other women.

According to PW1, they did not take steps to search the house nor around the house

after finding Heroin on the Accused. Therefore, it appears that upon finding Heroin on

the Accused the raiding party has somehow come to the conclusion that it is the only

amount the Accused had in possession. This again conjures up the matter of probability.

How likely is it that the officers did not think to search the house of the Accused, the

house in which the Accused was allegedly caught in possession of Heroin? How likely is it

Page 11 of 13

that the Accused only had the Heroin in his pocket, and the police knew not to look for

anymore?

Furthermore, according to PW9, he along with Major Peiris came to surveil a

person suspected to have Heroin in his possession. Yet, when they came to know the

person is having Heroin in his possession, they left the location without informing the

police officers to come to the place immediately. On the other hand, the next day only they

went to the Station and informed. It is highly improbable that army officers who have

come to know of a person with drugs and identified him, leave the place, go to the police

station and come back to arrest. A prudent officer would have stayed at the location to

make sure the suspect does not leave the place. On the other hand, the Accused and his

witness state that the Accused was handed over to the Police by the Army Officers. It is

our considered view that, in the light of the Defence taken by the Accused, the story of the

Prosecution is improbable.

Another point to consider is PW1s conduct. According to PW1, he handed over the

production from the first arrest and left to No. 481 Rajaguru Sri Shubodhi Road,

Wellawatta immediately. When we analyze how the production of evidence from the

previous arrest was handled, it is evident that PW1 has failed to conduct himself

according to the legal requirements pertaining to the handing over of substances such as

Heroin and the suspect and to make entries in his notes as they left. Instead, the Heroin

is simply handed over to the reserve and the entry is made by PW1 only at 20.00. When

the question is put to him, PW1 claims that he deviated from standard procedure so that

he could reach the place of the Accused immediately. In contrast, it is claimed by PW1

before they left, they checked both police and army vehicles and made sure nothing

unwarranted was carried by the raiding party. The question here is whether it was

possible for a reasonable person to do all these things when he was supposedly in a rush.

This response by PW1 seems inconsistent with his assumed urgency at the time.

As stated by PW1 (on page 124 of the Brief proceedings dated 03/09/2018):

According to the Prosecution, the information was with regard to the surveillance

conducted at No. 481 Rajaguru Sri Shubodhi Road, Wellawatta by the army officers.

According to PW9 Major Wanninayaka, the Army officers had been surveilling the place

for the past three days and got the information regarding Heroin. On the day in question,

they had gone to the Police Station, informed the officers, and together they went near

the house. The Army Officers had shown the house. They did not inform the Police Officers

of the identity of the Accused. On the other hand, PW1 went in, searched the Accused,

and found the Heroin. Despite there being a number of people, they didnt search anyone

else except for the Accused. The story of the Defence was that he was arrested by the army

officers and handed over to the police. When we consider the facts, including the absence

of any explanation as to why the Army Officers did not inform the Police Officers to come

to the place, knowing the fact that there is a person in possession of Heroin; simply

arresting a person without even searching others with him, especially when his identity

was not known, we consider the version of the Prosecution to be highly improbable. The

manner in which the information was given by the Army Officer and the way in which the

Accused was arrested with the production creates reasonable doubt.

Therefore, in the instant case, in the light of vital inter se and per se contradictions

found in Prosecutions evidence, as well as the improbability of the Prosecutions evidence

as a whole, we are of the view that the charges against the Accused have not surpassed

the beyond reasonable doubt threshold.

Page 13 of 13

Taking into consideration all these circumstances, We are of the view that the

conviction and sentence of the Accused cannot stand. We set aside the judgment delivered

on 10/07/2019 by the High Court of Colombo.

Appeal allowed.
