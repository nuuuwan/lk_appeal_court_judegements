In the absence of the Scheme of Recruitment, the Arbitrator has no option but to make an order to confirm the 1st Respondent either to the post of Sports Controller or Director Sports. It is surprising to me that there is no Scheme of Recruitment at the Petitioner Corporation as per the evidence given by the Officers of the Petitioner. At this point, under section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance, the Court can draw the presumption that, had the Petitioner produced the Scheme of Recruitment such evidence would have been unfavourable to the case of the Petitioner.",
