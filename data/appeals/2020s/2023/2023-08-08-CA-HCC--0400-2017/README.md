JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named 1st Accused was indicted under Section 364(2) (e) of the

Penal Code for committing rape on Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Amitha

Kumari in the High Court of Gampaha on 25.10.1999 and in the course of

the same transaction of third count mentioned below.

In the second count, the 2nd Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted under section 364(2)(e) read with section 102 of the

3 | P a g e

Penal Code for aiding and abetting the 1st Accused to commit rape on

Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Amitha Kumari on 25.10.1999 and in the

course of the same transaction mentioned in the 1st count.

In the third count, the Appellant was indicted under section 308 (A) (2) of the

Penal Code as amended for committing an offence of Cruelty on Dissanayake

Mudiyanselage Amitha Kumari in the High Court of Gampaha between

03.09.1999 to 25.10.1999.

After the trial, the 1st Accused was acquitted from 1st count and the Appellant

was acquitted from the 2nd count.

But for the third count, the Appellant was convicted and was sentenced to

two years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.1000/-. In default 02

weeks simple imprisonment was imposed. In addition, the Appellant was

ordered to pay Rs.50,000/- as compensation to the victim. In default, 03

months simple imprisonment was imposed.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that

the Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in her absence. It is

further informed that the Appellant is on bail pending appeal.

The Appellant had filed the following grounds of appeal:

1. The Learned High Court Judge has not evaluated the evidence

properly.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to follow the maxim Falsus

in uno, falsus in omnibus.

3. The Learned High Court Judge had expected some proof from the

defence.

4. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider grave

discrepancies of the prosecution case.

4 | P a g e

The victim was residing at Inginiyagala in Ampara district before she came

to the Appellants house at Ranpukunugama, Nittambuwa. The Appellants

husband who is a relation of the victim had brought her to Ranpokunugama

on the promise that she would be sent to school and could enjoy her leisure

time by watching television. Her parents had sent her to Ranpokunugama

due to poverty. When she came to the Appellants house, she had completed

15 years of age. She has four siblings.

IP/Rajapaksha had conducted the inquiry, arrested the Appellant and

produced her before the court.

PW2, Dr.Paranamana who had examined the victim stated that he had noted

three categories of injuries on the victims body. According to him, the first

category of injuries had been inflicted by blunt weapon. The second category

of injuries had been caused by burning and the third category had been

caused by a sharp weapon.

After the closure of the prosecution case, the defence was called and the

Appellant had elected to give evidence from the witness box and proceeded

and called two witnesses on her behalf.

According to the victim, when she was 15 years old the Appellant had started

to assault and ill-treat her. The victims evidence must be considered very

carefully as she was a child when she underwent the agony.

In Panchhi and Others v. The State of U.P and Others [1998] 7 SCC 177

it was held that:

Evidence of a child witness must be evaluated more carefully and with

greater circumspection because a child is susceptible to be swayed by

what others tell them and thus a child witness is an easy prey to

tutoring.

5 | P a g e

In Kumara De Silva and 2 Others v. Attorney General [2010] 2 SLR 169

the court held that:

Credibility is a question of fact, not of law. The acceptance or rejection

of evidence of witnesses is therefore a question of fact for the trial

judge.

Guided by above mentioned judgments, I will now proceed to consider the

appeal grounds advanced by the Appellant.

As the 1st and 2nd grounds of appeal are interconnected, both grounds will

be considered jointly hereinafter.

In the first ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned High

Court Judge had failed to evaluate the evidence properly and in the second

ground the Learned High Court Judge has failed to follow the maxim Falsus

in uno, falsus in omnibus.

The victim in her evidence had stated that due to unstable economic

condition of the family she had to discontinue her schooling and went for

odd jobs to support her family. During this time, her mothers relation

namely Sisira Uncle who is the husband of the Appellant had come there

and with the permission of the parents of the victim, he took her to

Nitambuwa. Initially the Appellant had treated her properly and the ill-

treatment had started only after some time. Gradually, the Appellant had

entrusted her with household chores. In the meantime, the Appellant had

started to ill-treat her by pricking her body with sharp pins, dropped hot

candle wax on her body and beating her with broomstick and sticks. She was

ordered to wash dishes and was not given proper place to sleep. Due to

assault, she sustained injuries on her body. She was never sent to school.

Once, the Appellant had applied chili powder to her eyes. The Appellant used

6 | P a g e

to beat the victim in the absence of her husband who used to come home

once in three months. Due to this cruel treatment, her life had become

miserable. According to the victim the ill-treatment had started after about

two years of her coming to the Appellants house. Further she had been

threatened not to reveal it to anybody.

As the 1st Accused and the Appellant were acquitted from 1st and 2nd charges

respectively in the indictment, the evidence pertains to 1st and 2nd charges

will not be considered in this appeal.

PW2, the mother of the victim corroborated the evidence given by the victim

how she went to Appellants house and returned. She further said when the

victim was brought back home by the Appellants husband, she had noticed

injuries all over the victims body. Due to injuries sustained on her face, she

could not even identify the victim properly. Further, hearing her cries, her

brother, PW3 had come there and after seeing the victims appearance he

had punched the Appellants husbands face. As the Appellants husband

sustained injuries on his lip, he had run away from the scene after leaving

the victim. Due to fear of police, she had first taken the victim to the hospital.

While corroborating the evidence of PW2, PW3 had further said that he had

noticed injuries on victims body when he went to victims house hearing the

cries of PW2.

PW4, the Doctor who had examined the victim had given very comprehensive

evidence under three categories of injuries noted on the victims body. As he

had noted number of injuries on her body, he had not counted their

numbers. Blunt weapon injuries had been noted all over victims body. The

second category blunt injuries had been noted on front chest and face of the

victim. The third category sharp weapon injures had been noted on back of

the chest of the victim. He could not express an opinion about the age of

injuries, but he was certain that the injuries could have been inflicted at

least two weeks before the examination. In the history given to the doctor,

7 | P a g e

the victim had said that she was beaten and burnt by the occupier of the

house where she lived. The Doctor got photographs of the injuries on victims

body using the services of PW08, who is a freelance photographer cum

reporter of the area.

After leading the police evidence, the prosecution had closed the case for the

prosecution.

Defence was called and the Appellant gave evidence from the witness box.

The Appellant admitted that her husband brought the victim to her house.

When she was brought, she had noticed number of injuries on victims body.

Further she had admitted that she entrusted several household chores to

the victim. But she denied assaulting the victim while she was in her house.

The Appellants husband also gave evidence on behalf of her. He too had

corroborated the evidence of the Appellant. He further admitted that PW3

had assaulted him when he went to hand over the victim to her mother.

Although the Learned Presidents Counsel contented that the Learned High

Court Judge has not properly analysed the evidence of prosecution

witnesses, this contention cannot be accepted as the Learned High Court

very correctly and comprehensively had analysed the evidence to come to his

conclusion on the third count of the indictment. The relevant portions of the

judgement are re-produced below:

Hence it is incorrect to say that the Learned High Court Judge had not

properly evaluated the evidence in this case to consider whether the

Appellant is guilty under Section 308(A)(2) of the Penal Code as amended.

The Section 308(A) states:

Whoever, having the custody, charge or care of any person under

eighteen years of age, wilfully assaults, ill-treats, neglects, or

abandons such person or causes or procures such person to be

assaulted, ill-treated, neglected, or abandoned in a manner likely to

cause him suffering or injury to health (including injury to, or loss of,

sight or hearing, or limb or organ of the body or any mental

derangement) commits the offence of cruelty to children.

In coming to his conclusion that the Appellant is guilty to the third count of

the indictment; the Learned High Court Judge had very correctly considered

the divisibility of credibility of a witness by citing the Judgement

Samaraweera v Attorney General [1990] 1 SLR 256. In this case the court

held that:

10 | P a g e

I find support for this view in Francis Appuhamyv. the Queen (2) where

having considered the circumstances in which the Privy Council [in

Mohommed Fiaz Baksh v. The Queen (3) 1958 A. C. 157] made the

observation that the credibility (of withesses) could not be treated as

divisible and accepted against one and rejected against another the

Supreme Court, stated thus:

We do not think this remark can be the foundation for a principle that

the evidence of a witness must be accepted completely or not at all.

Certainly, in this country it is not an uncommon experience to find in

criminal cases witnesses who, in addition to implicating a person

actually seen by them committing a crime, seek to implicate others who

are either members of the family of that person or enemies of such

witnesses. In that situation, the Judge or jurors have to decide for

themselves whether that part of the testimony which is found to be false

taints the whole or whether the false can safely be separated from the

true. Per T. S. Fernando J.

The next contention is the Learned High Court Judge has failed to follow the

maxim Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus.

The maxim Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus is a Latin term which means

false in one thing, false in everything. This is a legal principle in common

law that a witness who testify falsely about one matter is not all credible to

testify about any other matter. At present this doctrine has been rejected by

many of the common law jurisdictions.

It is necessary to consider the applicability of this maxim in our jurisdiction.

The following mentioned cases are very much important to ascertain the

stance taken by our apex courts regarding this maxim.

11 | P a g e

In Samaraweera v. The Attorney General (Supra) the court held that:

The maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus could not be applied in such

circumstances. Further all falsehood is not deliberate. Errors of memory,

faulty observation or lack of skill in observation upon any point or points,

exaggeration or mere embroidery or embellishment must be

distinguished from deliberate falsehood before applying the maxim. Nor

does the maxim apply to cases of testimony on the same point between

different witnesses. In any event this maxim is not an absolute rule

which has to be applied without exception in every case where a witness

is shown to have given false evidence on a material point When such

evidence is given by a witness the question whether other portions of

his evidence can be accepted as true may not be resolved in his favour

unless there is some compelling reason for doing so. The credibility of

witnesses can be treated as divisible and accepted against one and

rejected against another. The jury or judge must decide for themselves

whether that part of the testimony which is found to be false taints the

whole or whether the false can safely be separated from the true.

In Viraj v The Attorney General [2010] 2 SLR 251 the court held that:

The maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus is not applicable in the

instant case. The maxim cannot be considered as the absolute rule and

that the Judge in deciding whether or not he should apply the maxim

must consider the entirety of the evidence of the witness and the entire

evidence led at the trial.

Considering above cited judgements it clearly demonstrates that the maxim

maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus is not an absolute rule when

12 | P a g e

considering the evidence in a criminal trial in our jurisdiction too. It is now

applied as rule of permissible inference which is basically depend upon the

judge to decide.

In this case, the Learned Trial Judge has very correctly considered the

evidence in applying the maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus in its correct

perfective as considered by our superior courts. Hence, it is incorrect to say

that the Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider this maxim in his

judgment.

As such, the first and second grounds of appeal have no merit at all.

In the third ground of appeal, the Learned Presidents Counsel complains

that the Learned High Court Judge has expected some proof from the

defence. Upon perusal of the judgment, pertaining to the third charge levelled

against the Appellant, the Learned High Court Judge had nowhere expected

the proof from the defence or in other words reversed the burden upon the

defence. Therefore, this ground also has no merit.

Finally, the Appellant contends that the Learned High Court Judge has failed

to consider the grave discrepancies of the prosecution case.

The Learned High Court Judge, in his judgement very correctly considered

all marked contradictions of the prosecution witnesses and had given

plausible reasons as to why he disregarded those contradictions and believed

the prosecution case. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Page 881-882 of the brief.

Learned High Court Judge had very extensively considered the evidence

adduced by the defence. The Appellant had given evidence from the witness

box and was subjected to cross examination. She had vehemently denied the

charge in her evidence. Further, the defence had called two witnesses but

that evidence too failed to create a doubt on the prosecution case.

Hence, this ground also has no merit.

In this case, the victim was under the vicious clutches of the Appellant. She

had fallen victim to ill-treatment as she was taken to Appellants house by

her husband. She had suffered both physically and mentally until she was

taken back home. She was 15 years old when she started living with the

Appellant and her ordeal continued until she was taken back home.

In this case when the victim gave evidence on 04.03.2014, she was 29 years

and married to a differently abled person and blessed with two children. Her

husband does not have a permanent job nor she employed either. The family

is living in a hut. The victim is 38 years old now.

The Appellant was 48 years old when she gave evidence on 28.03.2017 and

she is 54 years old now. The date of offence was between 03.09.1999 to

25.10.1999. Nearly 23 years passed after the offence being committed.

Hence, sending the Appellant to jail will not serve any purpose considering

all the circumstances of the case.

Although minimum mandatory sentence of 2 years has been stipulated for

the offence committed under Section 308(A)(2) of the Penal Code as amended,

considering the circumstances mentioned above I decided to replace the 2

14 | P a g e

years rigorous imprisonment with two years rigorous imprisonment and

suspend the same for a period of 10 years.

Further, Rs.50,000/- compensation ordered is increased up to Rs.500,000/-

with a default sentence of two years.

Subject to above variation, the appeal is dismissed.

The Learned High Court Judge of Gampaha is hereby directed to issue notice

on the Appellant to appear before the High Court, as she is on bail pending

appeal, and to comply with this judgement.
