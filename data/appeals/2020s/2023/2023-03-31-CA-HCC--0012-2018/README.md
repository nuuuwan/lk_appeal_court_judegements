JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter after referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General under Sections 54(A) (d) and

54(A) (b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended

by Act No. 13 of 1984 for possession and trafficking respectively of 5.3 grams

of Heroin on 14th March 2004 in the High Court of Balapitiya.

After trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed life imprisonment on both counts

on 26th of February 2018.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in her absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. During the argument she was connected via zoom from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The prosecution has failed to establish the chain of production beyond

reasonable grounds.

2. Evidence of PW1 and PW3 are contradictory.

3 | P a g e

3. The recovery of a parcel containing 680 packets of Heroin inside

Appellants brassier is not probable/possible.

4. Whether it is safe to convict only on the evidence of PW3.

5. Whether the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the

contradictions of the prosecution case.

6. Whether the Learned High Court Judge properly considered the

defence case.

Background of the case.

On 14/03/2004 IP Vijith Jayantha attached to Ambalangoda Police Station

had received information from one of his informants about the trafficking of

Heroin by a lady named Mallika and she was coming in a three-wheeler

bearing No.SP GE-3341. He with 07 other police officers attached to

Ambalangoda Police Station had left for the raid immediately as per the

information. The team went to Sangaraja Junction, which is situated 50-75

meters away from the police station. As the station vehicle was not available

at that time, the team left in a private vehicle owned by one of the friends of

PW1.When they positioned themselves on the Galle Road, PW1 had seen the

said three-wheeler coming from Colombo towards Galle. As per the direction

the team had stopped the three-wheeler and PW1 had identified the

Appellant who was seated on the rear of the vehicle.

As the place of arrest was not suitable to check a female, the Appellant was

brought to the Ambalangada Police Station and was checked by PW3. A

parcel was found underneath her brassier which consisted about 36 plastic

bags. Upon further check PW1 had found 680 packets in different colours

inside those 36 bags. As the substance in those packets reacted for Heroin,

the Appellant was arrested, and the production was handed over to the

reserve police officer after an initial sealing.

4 | P a g e

On the following day, PW1 with some other police officers had gone to the

Balapitiya Hospital to weigh the production. As the scale was not in order,

the team had gone to Polwatta Hospital, but the pharmacist was on leave on

that day. Hence, the weighing finally had been done at Borakanda Hospital.

The substance weighted to be 10.500 grams.

PW3, WPC 434 Dayawathie was called to corroborate the evidence given by

PW1.

After the conclusion of the prosecution case, the defence was called, and the

Appellant had given evidence from the witness box under oath. She admitted

the arrest but denied recovering any illegal substance from her possession

on that date.

In every criminal case, the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person. In the case of this

nature the prosecution not only need to prove the case beyond reasonable

doubt but also ensure, with cogent evidence that the inward journey of the

production has not been disturbed at all-material points.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although we

take serious view in regard to offences relation to drugs, we are of the view

that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to fill the gaps of

badly handled prosecutions where the identity of the good analysis for

examination has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. A prosecutor

should take pains to ensure that the chain of events pertaining to the

productions that had been taken charge from the Appellant from the time

it was taken into custody to the time it reaches the Government Analyst

and comes back to the court should be established.

5 | P a g e

In Perera V. Attorney General [1998] 1 Sri.L.R 378 it was held:

the most important journey is the inward journey because the final

analyst report will depend on that.

In Witharana Doli Nona v.The Republic of Sri Lanka CA/19/99 His

Lordship Justice Abrew remarked thus;

It is a recognized principle that in drug related cases the prosecution

must prove the chain relating to the inward journey. The purpose of this

principle is to establish that the productions have not been tampered

with. Prosecution must prove that the productions taken from the

accused Appellant was examined by the Government Analyst

Therefore, proving the chain of custody is a very important task for the

prosecution. If investigating officers do not do their duty properly, the chain

of custody can be successfully challenged at the trial. This is because the

prosecution always relies on evidence gathered by police officers in cases of

this nature. Just because the law enforcement found drugs on an accused,

it does not mean that he can be convicted.

In the first ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellant argued that the

prosecution has failed to establish the chain of production beyond

reasonable doubt in this case.

According to prosecution, after the arrest of the Appellant, she was taken to

Ambalangoda Police Station and was subjected to a body search by PW3.

According to PW3 the substances were recovered underneath her brassier.

This had been intimated to PW1 immediately. Thereafter, PW1 had done an

initial sealing in front of the Appellant and handed over the production to

PW09, PS 976 Ariyaratna under PR No.182 on the date of detection. On the

same day PW09 had handed over the same to PW4, PS Munasinghe. The

relevant portion is re-produced below:

But according to PW4, PS 39 Munasinghe he had not received PR No.182

from anybody. But he confirmed that he only took over the production under

PR No.183. (The three-wheeler and two keys.) The relevant portion is re-

The above re-produced portions of evidence of PW9 and PW4 clearly shows

a missing link after the Heroin was handed over to the reserve under PR

No.182 by PW1.

On the following day of the raid, as the production needed to be weighed,

PW1 entered the Heroin packets under PR No.188 and took over from PW9.

The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Although PW1 stated that he took over the quantity of Heroin from the

custody of PW9 on 15/03/2004, the day after the raid, PW9, in his evidence

did not state that he handed over the quantity of Heroin to PW1 on

15/03/2004. According to PW9, by that time the Heroin was in the custody

of PW4. But PW4 had clearly stated that he did not receive any production

under PR No.182 from anybody. This is another glaring contradiction

pertaining to the chain of production in this case.

8 | P a g e

According to PW1, after weighing the Heroin, the production was entered

under PR No.190 and handed over to PW11, PS 22677 Somasiri who was the

reserve officer on 15/03/2004. Further, PW1 went on to say that he handed

over the production to the Magistrate Court on 15/03/2004. PW11 does not

state that the productions were taken over from him by PW1 to hand over

the same to the production clerk of the Magistrate Court on 15/03/2004.

This discrepancy also led to doubt the prosecution evidence.

The chain of custody is the most important of evidence in a drug related trial.

The prosecution has the paramount duty to prove that it is the same

production recovered at the time of detection. The main reason is to establish

that the evidence, which is related to the alleged crime, was collected from

the accused and was in its original condition rather than having been

tempered with or planted deceitfully to make someone else guilty. Handling

of production evidence is a lengthy process but the court necessitates it for

the adjudication of the case. This proves the integrity of production which

had been recovered and until it reaches to the Government Analyst

Department.

The defence can challenge the chain of custody evidence by questioning

whether the evidence presented at trial is the same evidence as what was

collected from an accused person. If there is any discrepancy in the chain of

custody of a production and the prosecution is unable to prove who had the

custody of production until it reached the analyst, the chain of custody

stands broken.

The Appellant takes up the position that the amount of Heroin which had

been mentioned in the indictment was not recovered from her. But she

admits that she was arrested on the date mentioned in the indictment.

Considering the evidence highlighted above of PW1, PW9, PW4 and PW11

there is a missing link from the very inception of handing over the production

to reserve police officer, which had not been explained by the prosecution.

Without a proper chain of custody, drugs do not come in as evidence. The

10 | P a g e

discrepancies highlighted above cannot be ignored lightly, as the entire case

rests on the cogent and unambiguous evidence pertaining to the chain of

production.

Although there is a missing link in the production from very inception of the

investigation, the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment stated that the

production was in the custody of PW1 from the time it was taken for weighing

until it was handed over to the Magistrate Court. The relevant portion is re-

produced below:

In this case, the prosecution has failed to establish the custody of the

production chain beyond reasonable doubt. As this is a substantial fact, and

this ground alone is sufficient to vitiate the conviction in this case. Hence, it

is not necessary to consider the remaining grounds of appeal.

Even though this case is sent for re-trial, the prosecution will not be able to

rectify the breaking of the chain of custody.

In Asrappulige Neel Rohan Gomes v. The Attorney General

CA/276/2007 decided on 03/04/2013, the court held that:

. But the court cannot use its discretion in the interest of justice in

this case. In the event this case is sent back for fresh trial, the court is

encouraging slackness on the part of the investigation and the

prosecution. The court is not only allowing the prosecution to fill gaps in

the prosecution case it is also encouraging the investigators to do now

and what he should have done at the time of the investigation. It is a

bad precedent, and unfair by the accused.

11 | P a g e

Due to the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the conviction and the sentence

dated 26/02/2018 imposed on the Appellant by the learned High Court

Judge of Balapitiya. Therefore, I acquit her from both charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Balapitiya along with the original case record.
