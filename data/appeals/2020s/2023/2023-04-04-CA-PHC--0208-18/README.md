JUDGMENT

Factual Background:

The subject of the dispute in the present case has arisen due to a construction of a building within the building

limits of Kandy-Mahiyangana-Padiyathalawa Road by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant. The following

consideration should be taken into account regarding the above subject matter;

The above road was designated a national highway by Gazette no. 561/5 dated 06.06.1989.

The Minister had not specified a building limit for the Kandy Mahiyangana Padiyathalawa road under

section 42(1) of the Thoroughfares Act. Therefore, the default building limit set out in section

42(2)(a) 15 meters (15 M) from the centre of the roadway is to be considered as the building limit.

Therefore, any construction within a 15M from the centre of the highway of the impugned road is

an illegal construction pursuant to the Act.

Section 45(3) of the National Thoroughfares Act No. 40 of 2008 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) stipulates

that,

Executive Engineer, Executive Engineers Office, Urban Development Authority, Kundasale.

Applicant- Respondent-Respondent

Page 3 of 5

No person shall after the appointed date except under the authority of licence granted by the

Executive Engineer erect, re-erect or make any addition to any building, gateway or any other

structure or construct a basement or other underground structure or dig a well, pond shaft

or any other structure (hereinafter in this Part of this Act referred to as "structure") within a

building limit.

If a construction/structure is built in contravention of section 42(3) of the Act, then Executive

Engineer is empowered to make an application for its demolition/removal under section 45 of the

Act following the procedure set out therein. Under section 45(1) and (2) of the Act;

(1) If any person erects any structure or makes any addition to an existing structure in

contravention of the provisions of section 42, the Executive Engineer shall, by written

notice, require such person to demolish or remove such structure or any addition thereto

on or before such date as may be specified in such notice, being a date not earlier than

seven days from the date thereof.

(2) It shall be the duty of the person on whom a notice is issued under subsection (1) to

comply with the requirements specified in such notice within the time specified therein

or within such extended time as may be granted by the Executive Engineer, on

application made in that behalf

In the present case, the Appellant has built a building within the building limit of the Kandy-

Mahiyanganaya-Padiyathalawa road without a lawful permit. This is evident from the sketch

attached to the notice marked P3 which was presented to the Magistrate court as evidence.

According to the above, it seems that the Appellant has constructed a building within 6 meters (6M)

from the centre of the carriageway, which is within the building limit in violation of section 42(3)

of the Act.

Consequently, Executive Engineer has issued notice under section 45(1) of the Act. This Notice was

not compiled with by the Respondent. Thereafter, Petitioner being the Executive Engineer of the Executive

Engineers office, Kundasala had instituted action bearing no 28844 in the Magistrate Court of Theldeniya

against Respondent K. P. Gunawardene under section 45(3) of the Act for demolition of the unlawful

structure

When this matter was taken up for inquiry certain objections were raised on behalf of the said

Respondent. However, the said objections were overruled by the Learned Magistrate. Afterwards,

Learned Magistrate had ordered to demolish the impugned building of the Respondent.

Page 4 of 5

Being aggrieved by the said order the Respondent-Petitioner had invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy in case bearing

no 84/16.

The learned High Court Judge having heard the aforesaid revision application had dismissed the

same on the ground the impugned building was constructed without a valid permit and no

exceptional grounds exist to revise the said order of the learned Magistrate. Thereafter, the

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant has in the instant case, has preferred this appeal seeking to set

aside the order dated 06.12.2018 of the Learned High Court Judge and the order of the Learned

Magistrate dated 17.06.2016.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (herein after referred to as the Appellant) had taken up the

position that the Applicant, Executive Engineer did not have power to institute the action bearing

no 28844 in the Magistrate Court of Theldeniya in his/her official capacity.

It was contended by the Appellant that since the name of the Executive Engineer is not a legal

person, he in his official capacity does not have the power to institute the said action.

However, it has to be observed that under section 28 of the Thoroughfares Act no 40 of 2008,

Executive Engineer is empowered to issue notice to any person to remove obstruction done to any

road, any public road or national highway. In the event of failure to comply with such notice

Executive Engineer is empowered to institute an action in the Magistrate court. As such, it clearly

shows that the Executive Engineer has power to institute the instant action under the provisions

of the said Act. Therefore, there is no merit for the objection raised by the Appellant.

Hence, I hold that Applicant-Executive Engineer is statutorily empowered to maintain the instant

action in the way it was instituted. Thus, the said preliminary objection is untenable in law.

Second objection taken up by the Appellant in the High Court is that the Respondent had failed to

specify when the unlawful structure had been erected as the section 42(3) only applies to

structures constructed after the appointed date. According to Gazette No. 1612/18 dated

30.07.2009 the National Thoroughfares Act came into effect on 01.09.2008, which is considered

as the appointed date under the Act.

In the instant case, it has been argued that the Notice marked P3 which was issued after the Act

came into operation, was served on the Appellant while he was constructing the shop. The sketch

marked in notice P3 indicates that there was only a concrete slab at the time the sketch was being

made. It seems that by the time the Appellant preferred objections to the learned Magistrate of

Theldeniya Appellant had constructed the impugned building. Thus, we can conclude that the

shop was completed between the time period in which the sketch was drawn, and the application

was made to the learned Magistrate for the demolition of the construction. Furthermore, Appellant

Page 5 of 5

was given ample opportunity to adduce evidence to establish that the impugned structure was

built prior to the appointed date. However, multiple affidavits submitted on behalf of the Appellant

and other such evidence adduced by the Appellant does not indicate the date in which the

structure was built. Therefore, considering all of the above evidence, learned Magistrate has come

to a correct find of fact and law and concluded that the impugned building was built after the Act

has come into force.

In view of the aforementioned reasons it is apparent that the Appellant had not substantiated his

contentions for this court to interfere with the orders of the learned High Court Judge as well as

the learned Magistrate. Hence, the learned Magistrate had correctly made the order to demolish

the impugned construction.

Since the Appellant has constructed the impugned building in contravention of section 42(3) of

the Thoroughfares Act no. 40 of 2008, I hold that the said construction is unauthorised thus the

learned magistrate had exercised jurisdiction within the purview of the power conferred to him

in terms of the provisions in the Thoroughfares act no 40 of 2008

Hence, the learned Magistrate had rightly made an order to demolish the impugned construction.

The learned High Court Judge too affirmed the order dated 17.06.2016 of the learned Magistrate

and held that no exceptional circumstances exist for the Appellant to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of the High Court.

As such we see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate dated 17.06.2016

and the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 06.12.2018

Hence, we dismiss this appeal with costs.
