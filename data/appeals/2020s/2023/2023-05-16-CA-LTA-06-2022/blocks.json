They do not say so. Therefore, they had not sought to be a party to the action in the Wakfs Tribunal and they cannot be treated as persons who seek to be parties within the meaning of section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. That section envisages a person who had made an application in the original court to be a party to an action and whose application was refused by court.

In the case of Sinnathamby Vs Kandaiah 56 NLR 535 it was held that where there are several trustees, they shall all be made parties to an action instituted by one or more of them. It is the case of the 8th to 12th Petitioners that they were not named before the Wakfs Tribunal because they assumed office as trustees after the plaint was filed. If those Petitioners are necessary parties to this application the Petitioners must follow the correct procedure to make them parties to this application. They will not become parties automatically. Until that is done 8th to 12th Petitioners cannot be parties to this application as Petitioners and they can neither be Defendants to the action before the Wakfs Tribunal. For the aforesaid reasons the caption of this application becomes defective.",

Therefore, the rationale in Ibrahim Vs Beebee will apply to this case as well. This judgment was followed in Suwarishamy Vs Thelenis 54 NLR 282 where it was held that where in an appeal, a necessary party has not been made a Respondent, the appeal will be dismissed unless the defect is not one of an obvious character which could not reasonably have been foreseen and avoided.
