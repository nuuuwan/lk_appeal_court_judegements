MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the judgment dated

15.3.2019 of the High Court of Gampaha.

The accused appellant had been indicted for committing the

murder of his girlfriend.

The version of the prosecution is that the deceased and accused

had shifted to a boarding near the free trades zone of Gampaha

on 24th of September 2014 and the accused along with the person

who found the boarding with his wife had come and the deceased

and the accused had remained in the room and the other couple

had left the place.

Page 3 of 8

The owner of the boarding had observed that on the following day the

accused and the deceased going out and coming back to the boarding

and thereafter on the 26th Saturday he had seen around 11 0 clock in the

morning the accused going out of the boarding and rest of the day the

door to the room had been padlocked from outside.

But on the 27th morning which is a Monday the owner of the boarding

had smelt a foul smell from the boarding and had called the police and

the police had found the deceased dead inside and the body

decomposed.

On the 27th morning the body had been sent to the hospital mortuary

and on the 28th the postmortem had been done.

According to the evidence of the Judicial Medical officer the deceased

had died of strangulation and the death had taken place 48 hours prior

to the post mortem, which should falling on the 26th. The JMO had

further said that decomposition of a body takes place within 24 hours

and it is worsened by the weather patterns. Hence by the time the

accused had come to the boarding on the 26th morning as observed by

the owner of the boarding the death of the deceased should have taken

place and if so the question remains as to why the accused did not inform

the authorities.

The accused had been arrested while in hospital for having consumed

poison on the 27th.

The accused had made a dock statement stating that he had found a

boarding on the request of the deceased and he had taken her on the

24th September to the said boarding and had given her the keys and had

Page 4 of 8

left but came back on the 25th to collect the identity card which he had

forgotten to take but thereafter he does not know as to what happened

to the deceased.

The trial judge upon the conclusion of the case had convicted the accused

for the charge in the indictment and had passed the capital punishment.

The main ground of appeal of the appellant is that the time of death has

not been established by the prosecution.

When one considers the above mentioned factors, it is very clear that the

entirety of the case for the prosecution is based on circumstantial

evidence.

Wills on Circumstantial Evidence 7th edition page 296 has set down rules

for the judicial evaluation of circumstantial evidence which is as follows,

01. Every fact and circumstance on which the prosecution

relies as the basis for the inference f guilt must be clearly

proved and connected with the fact to be proved beyond

reasonable doubt and must be such as to lead to a

reasonable inference as to the guilt of the accused.

02. Particularly when circumstantial evidence is relied on, the

best evidence must be adduced. The suppression or non-

production of pertinent and cogent evidence necessarily

raises a strong presumption against the party who

withholds the evidence.

03. The chain or strand of proved facts and circumstances must

be so complete that no viral link in it is missing. A vital link

Page 5 of 8

should never be inferred. Mishra vs. State Bhihar A.I.R.

(1995) S.C. 801.

04. In order to justify the inference of guilt, the inculpatory fact

must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused

and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable

hypothesis than that of his guilt. Any reasonable probability

of innocence must be held for the benefit of the accused.

05. If there be any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused,

he is entitled as of right to be acquitted.

In our legal history it has been very clearly held that in a case of

circumstantial evidence the circumstances against the accused

must only draw the inference of guilt of the accused and nothing

else, and the prosecution must establish that it was the accused

and no one else who committed the offence. It has been so

decided in the cases of The Queen vs Kularatne 71 NLR 529 and

in many others.

In the instant case the circumstances against the accused are as

follows,

1) The accused takes the deceased to a boarding on the 24 of

September and pretends to be her husband,

2) The accused and the deceased are in the room till the 25th and

they are seen going out on the 25th and coming back to the

room by the boarding owner.

3) On the 26th morning the owner of the boarding observes that

the room is padlocked from outside but around the 11 in the

Page 6 of 8

morning the accused is seen coming to the room and going

back but the room remains locked from outside. Coming to

the room on the 26th is contradicted by the accused to be as

the 25th.

4) On the 27th morning the owner of the boarding gets a foul

smell from the room and informs the police and the deceased

is found dead inside and the body is heavily decomposed.

5) The JMO who conducted the post mortem is of the opinion

that the death had occurred 48 hours prior to the post

mortem which was held on the 28th and therefore the death

has to be on the 26th on which day the accused was seen

coming to the room.

6) The accused in the dock statement says that he does not

know as to what happened to the deceased that he only

found her a boarding and on the 25th he left the place but he

came back to the room to collect the identity card which he

forgot to take and thereafter he is unaware as it what

happened.

7) But the police arrest him while in hospital on the 27th after

consuming poison which he makes no mention of in the dock

statement.

On perusal of the above the following factors are very clear.

1) The accused was last seen coming to the room occupied by

the deceased to which the accused had brought the

deceased,

Page 7 of 8

2) The next day the decomposed body of the deceased is found

locked inside the room from outside which had been left by the

accused on the 26th.

3) The accused subsequent conduct which is being arrested while

in hospital after having consumed poison which he fails to

mention in the dock statement.

4) The owner of the boarding says that there was no one else

other than the accused who came to the boarding after the

occupancy after the two persons who found the boarding had

left.

5) The JMO stating that the death having taken place 48 hours

prior to the post mortem which falls on to the 26 on which day

it is only the accused and no one else who had visited the room

where the decomposed body of the deceased had been found.

Hence upon considering the same the only inference one can draw

from the above is that it is only the accused and no one else who

had committed the offence in the indictment and the trial judge

had very cautiously and carefully analyzed the evidence placed

before him and had considered the line of defense out forward by

the defense and -one else who had committed the murder of the

deceased.

Hence, we see no merit in the ground o appeal raised by the

accused appellant that the time of death had not been established

by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt.

As such the instant appeal is dismissed and the conviction and the

sentence of the trial judge is hereby affirmed.
