ORDER

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Petitioner, who is the Suspect named in M.C. Welisara Case No. B

910/2022 had applied for bail for her.

On 11.03.2022, the Petitioner was arrested at Oliyamulla by officers

attached to the Wattala Police Station upon an allegation relating to

possession of 70 grams of Heroin. According to police the contraband

was seized from her private part of her body.

The suspect was produced and facts were reported to the Welisara

Magistrate under Section 54A (d) and (b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 and

a detention order was obtained for further investigations under Section

82(3) of the said Act.

The production had been sent to the Government Analyst Department

on 28/03/2022. After analysis, the Government Analyst had forwarded

the report to Court on 23/09/2022. According to the Government

Analyst, 11.53 grams of pure Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) had been

detected from the substance sent for the analysis. Although police had

reported the substance weighed about 70 grams, the Government

Analyst noted that the substance weighed about 72.67 grams in excess

of 2.67 grams to the weight noted by the police.

According the Petitioner, she was arrested at Orugodawatta without any

contraband in her possession. Soon after her arrest, her two sons, her

sister and her domestic aid were taken in to custody by the police at

Orugoadawata. Having introduced Heroin to them, all had been

produced before the Magistrate Court of Welisara on 12.03.2022.

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in

support of her Bail Application.

1. Weight increase of the contraband sent to the Government

Analyst demonstrate suspicious of the raid allegedly conducted

by the police.

2. No drugs were found in his possession of the Petitioner by the

police officers.

3. The Petitioner had been in remand over 15 months.

The Learned State Counsel opposing for bail, submitted that the delay

is not an exceptional circumstance to be considered to enlarge the

suspect on bail. Further, the time spent for preparing the indictment

does not constitute an exceptional circumstance.

The suspect is in remand for more than 15 months. According to the

Government Analyst Report, the pure quantity of Heroin detected from

the possession of 1st Accused is 11.53 grams.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what

is exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own facts and

circumstances on a case by case.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

CA Bail 17-2023

The Section 83 of the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act

which was amended by Act No. 41 of 2022 states:

83. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 84, 85 and subsection (2) of

this section, a person suspected or accused of an offence under

sections 54A and 54B of this Ordinance, shall not be released on bail

by the High Court except in exceptional circumstances.

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 84 and 85, a person

suspected or accused of an offence under subsection (1) of section 54A

and section 54B-

(a) of which the pure quantity of the dangerous drug, trafficked,

imported, exported, or possessed is ten grammes or above in terms

of the report issued by the Government Analyst under section 77A;

and

(b) which is punishable with death or life imprisonment,

shall not be released on bail except by the Court of Appeal in

exceptional circumstances.

In this case, the pure quantity of Heroin detected in the production by

the Government Analyst is 11.53 grams. Hence, this court has

jurisdiction to consider granting of bail as per the new amendment.

Although a bail application was filed before the High Court of Negombo

on behalf of the Petitioner, the Learned High Court Judge had refused

bail citing that the Petitioner had failed to adduce exceptional

circumstances in her application.

The production was sent to the Government Analyst Department on

28.03.2022 and the report was received by the Magistrate Court of

Welisara on 23.09.2022. Although 08 months have passed the

prosecution is unable to send out indictment to the High Court.

CA Bail 17-2023

6 | P a g e

The Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the police have fabricated

a case against the Petitioner. Further the weight discrepancy of the

substance raises reasonable suspicious about the raid conducted by

the police.

I agree with the learned State Counsel that the factual and evidentiary

matters pertain to the investigations can only be tested at the trial upon

the witnesses being cross examined and shall not be tested at the time

of hearing this bail application considering the nature of this case.

Further, I do not consider the delay more than 15 months in remand

falls into the category of excessive and oppressive delay considering the

circumstances of this case.

The Offence under Section 54A (d) and (b) of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Act No.13 of 1984 is a

serious offence and the seriousness of the offence should be considered

when bail is considered.

The Petitioner admitted that she has two previous convictions and three

pending cases, all are drugs related offences. This clearly shows her

propensity towards committing drug related offences.

In this case the pure Heroin detected is 11.53 grams, which certainly a

commercial quantity. Considering the seriousness of the sentence

prescribed under the Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance,

there is a high risk of absconding. Hence, it is prudent to indict and

conclude the High Court case expeditiously keeping the Petitioner in

remand.

Considering all these factors into account, especially the pure quantity

of Heroin detected, the previous convictions and pending cases related

to drug offences and other circumstances of the case, I consider this

not an appropriate case to grant bail to the Petitioner at this stage.

Hence, the bail application is hereby dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this order to the

Magistrate Court of Welisara and Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station,

Wattala.
