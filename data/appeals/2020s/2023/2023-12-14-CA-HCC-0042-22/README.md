Sasi Mahendran, J.

The 1st Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) along with two

others was indicted in the High Court of Badulla for murdering Mariappan Selvaraj

punishable under section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

During the trial, 2nd Accused passed away. After the trial, The Learned High Court

Judge convicted the Accused appellant for the offence of Murder, imposed the death

sentence, and Acquitted the 3rd Accused.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction the Accused has appealed to this Court.

The main ground urged by the Accused was that he was not provided a fair trial.

Following are the facts and circumstances of this case,

According to the brief the indictment was served to the 1st Accused on 14th May

2002, thereafter he was granted bail by the High Court. When the trial commenced on the

31st of August 2005, he was present and represented.

On 6th September 2011 he was absent. Thereafter on the 8th of November 2011,

steps were taken under section 241 of the criminal procedure code, and the case proceeded

against the 1st Accused in trial in absentia.

6 years later that is on the 27th of June 2013, police produced the Accused to the High

Court. And learned High Court Judge had assigned a counsel to him and proceeded to

trial for calling witness number 12.

When we perused the proceedings on 27th June 2013, we observed that after

assigning the counsel to the accused, the learned High Court Judge had not given

reasonable time for the Accused to give instructions to the assigned counsel regarding this

case. It should also be noted that a number of witnesses have already given evidence.

Purpose of obtaining an attorney at law.

Section 41 (1)of the Judicature Act, No.2 of 1978, reads as follows:

Every attorney-at-law shall be entitled to assist and advice clients and appear,

plead, or act in every Court or other institution established by law for the administration

of justice and every person who is a party to or claims to have the right to be heard in any

proceeding in any such court or other such institution shall be entitled to be presented by

an attorney-at-law.

It indicates that the attorney at law who represents the accused should get the

instructions from the client and assist and advice him but in the instant case we observe

that the Learned High Court judge had not given that opportunity to the Accused.

The issue before us was whether the Accused was given a fair trial.

In the instant case Accused was facing the murder charge which would end up

with a death sentence. Also, to defend his case, counsel should receive proper instruction

from him.

What is a fair trial?

Justice A.R.B Amarasinghe had to say in his work on Judicial Conduct Ethics and

Responsibilities at page 780 :-

Article 13(3) of the Constitution states that the any person charged with an

offence shall be entitled to be heardat a fair trial by a competent Court. The constitution

makes a fair trial a fundamental right in the case of person charged with an offence.

However, in my view, in the exercise of constitutional duties under Article 4 ( c ). A Judge

is legitimately expected by the people on whose behalf Judges exercise the judicial power

Page 4 of 7

to ensure a fair trial, in every case, whether criminal or civil, although in the latter

instance, it is not a fundamental right recognized and declared by the constitution.

Further on page 828;

In Rasiah v. Sithamparapillai the Accused complained that he was tried by the

magistrate immediately after his arrest in the magistrates bungalow on a Sunday before

he had time to consider his position or to seek any advice. Bertram CJ said that the

magistrate was not bound to give every person brought before him an opportunity of

seeking legal advice. The Chief Justices view requires reconsideration. One could hardly

regard a trial as fair in which an Accused person has not had an opportunity of seeking

legal advice. In the case before Bertram CJ the Accused complained not only that he could

not seek legal advice but also that he has no time even to personally consider his own

position.

Although, in my view, it is desirable that a person, especially where a person's

liberty is at stake, should be able to consult an Attorney, neither the Constitution nor any

other law in Sri Lanka recognizes a legally enforceable right of a person in custody to

consult an Attorney before proceedings in Court have commenced. Article 13 of the

Constitution entitles a party to be heard through an attorney at a trial. Section 260 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure gives an Accused the right to legal representation in Court.

Section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure gives an Accused who is tried in absentia

in the High Court the right to be defended by an attorney at law at such trial. Section 148

of the Code of Criminal Procedure gives an absent Accused a right to be represented by

an attorney at on inquiry by a magistrate. In civil matters, sections 24-30 of the Civil

Procedure Code enables a party to be heard by an attorney.

The concept of fair trial was discussed by Justice J.A.N. De Silva (as he was then)in

The Attorney-General V Segulebbe Latheef And Another 2008 1SLR page 245 Held that

;

Our Constitution does not expressly recognize the right of access to legal advice

and assistance to an Accused person under arrest.

However, the Constitution by Article 13(3) expressly guarantees the right of a

person charged with an offence to be heard by person or by an Attorney-at-law at a "fair

trial" by a competent Court. This right is recognised obviously for the reason that a

Page 5 of 7

criminal trial (subject to an appeal) is the final stage of a proceeding at the end of which

a person may have to suffer penalties of one sort or another if found guilty.

The right of an Accused person to a fair trial is recognized in all the criminal justice

systems in the civilized world. Its denial is generally proof enough that justice is denied.

The right to a fair trial was formally recognised in International law in 1948 in the United

Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Since 1948 the right to a fair trial has been

incorporated into many national, regional, and international instruments.

Like the concept of fairness, a fair trial is also not capable of a clear definition, but there

are certain aspects or qualities of a fair trial that could be easily identified.

The right to a fair trial amongst other things includes the following:-

1. The equality of all persons before the Court.

2. A fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial Court/tribunal

established by law.

3. Presumption of innocence until guilt is proven according to law.

4. The right of an Accused person to be informed or promptly and in detail in a language

he understands of the nature and cause of the charge against him.

5. The right of an Accused to have time and facilities for preparation for the trial.

6. The right to have a counsel and to communicate with him.

7. The right of an Accused to be tried without much delay

8. The right of an Accused to be tried in his presence and to defend himself or through

counsel.

9. The Accused has a right to be informed of his rights.

10. If the Accused is in indigent circumstances to provide legal assistance without any

charge from the Accused.

Page 6 of 7

11. The right of an Accused to examine or have examined the witnesses against him and

to obtain the evidence and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same

conditions as witnesses against him.

12. If the Accused cannot understand or speak the language in which proceedings are

conducted to have the assistance of an interpreter

13. The right of an Accused not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess

guilty. (emphasis added)

The above dictum was considered by Aluwihare J in Hattuwan Pedige Sugath

Karunaratne v Hon. Attorney General SC Appeal 32 / 2020 decided on 20.10.2020 held

that;

Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act, No.56 of

2007, an Accused now has a statutory entitlement for a counsel to defend him:

Section 4 (1) of the ICCPR Act stipulates;

A person charged of a criminal offence under any written law, shall be entitled-

(c) to have legal assistance assigned to him in appropriate cases where the interest of

justice so requires and without any payment by him, where he does not have sufficient

mens to pay for such assistance

In Rathnapalage Hemasiri Subhasingha v. Attorney General, CA 206/2016,

Decided on 13.12.2018, S. Thurairaja, PC.J

The Counsel also submits that the Accused-appellant on 16.05.2016 was present

and unrepresented. The Learned Trial Judge had assigned a counsel and taken up the

trial on the same date. The counsel submits that the Accused-appellant had no

opportunity to instruct his counsel properly.

.

We carefully perused the proceedings and find that, the Accused-appellant was not

given proper opportunity to have a fair trial. Hence, we vacate the conviction and the

sentence and order re-trial.

Page 7 of 7

Therefore, we hold that the learned High Court Judge has not given reasonable

time for the Accused to give proper instructions regarding this case. Therefore, we set

aside the convictions and sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge on

03.03.2020. Furthermore, we notice that the Learned High Court Judge has not given

sufficient time for the Accused to submit to satisfy the court that his absence from his

trial was bona fide. As we observe he was arrested on 27.03.2013 and was remanded till

27.06.2013 when he was produced before the high Court. He was not represented by an

attorney-at-law to explain the reason for his absence.

Therefore, we quashed the order made on 03.03.2020 we directed the High Court

to have an inquiry under 241(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code and proceed with the trial

thereafter.

The appeal is allowed.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court of

Badulla along with the original case record forthwith.
