It has been suggested that tour operators might fall into this category, but without a good deal more information I do not feel able to express an opinion on this matter. At the other end of the scale are businesses of which the making and holding of investments form no part. In between these two ends, there will no doubt fall other types of businesses whose position is not so clear. However, in this case it is absolutely clear that the business of NE [Nuclear Electric plc] was to produce and supply electricity. The making of investments was neither an integral nor any part of its business. Furthermore the investments which it did make were in no sense employed in the business of producing electricity during the year of assessment. It follows that wherever the line may be drawn the income from NEs investment cannot be treated as trading income. [74] Dr. Felix submitted that in the present case, the interest received by the",

The interest is embedded in the business (in the words of Rowlatt J.) or a mere incident in the business (in the words of Lord Hanworth M.R.)-see Butler v. The Mortgage Company of Egypt, Ltd. I do not think it can be separated off or identified as distinct from the general business of the company. I do not think therefore that these items are assessable as such.
