In that case, it was held, to deprive a suitor in a pending action of an appeal to a Superior Tribunal, which belonged to him as of right, is a very different thing from regulating procedure. The Privy Council held that the right to file an appeal was a substantive right and not a mere matter of procedure such as the conditions accompanying the filing of an appeal, which is in the realm of procedure. An appeal by way of case stated is also a substantive right, but exercised in a different route. An appeal is a vested right in a party from the commencement of the action and such a right cannot be taken away except by an express provision in any subsequent statute.",

So none of the eight questions of law that have been stated to this Court impacts on the assessments. Section 112(6) of the Inland revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979 mandates a question of law arising on the assessment to be stated to this Court for an opinion. Only then this Court can finally confirm, reduce or annul the assessment determined by the Board, or remit the case to the Board with the opinion of the Court thereon. It is not any question of law that this Court can go into in a case stated. It is only a question of law impacting on the assessment that this Court can hear and determine on a case stated. I am fortified in this interpretation of the words in section 112(6) ..any question of law arising on the stated case and may in accordance with the decision of Court upon such question, confirm, reduce, increase or annul the assessment. This conjunction and connotes that the words any questions of law have to be read conjunctively with the requirement to confirm, reduce, increase or annul the assessment upon such question of law. This shows that the question of law has to pertain to the assessment. In the case before us, none of the questions pertain to the assessments which went up in appeal before the Board of review. The questions of law pertain only to a decision on jurisdiction which is susceptible to a challenge by way of judicial review.",

(emphasis added). The words hear and determine any question of law arising on the stated case appeared in section 74(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, No. 2 of 1932 and was interpreted by Basnayake CJ, in R.M.Fernando v Commissioner of Income Tax (Supra, at 577) to mean that it requires the Court to hear and determine any questions of law arising on the stated case and not any question or questions formulated by the Board. Previously in M.P. Silva v Commissioner of Income Tax (Reports of Ceylon Tax Cases, Vol. 1, page 336 at 338) Canekeratne J., having considered section 74(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, No. 2 of 1932 held that all questions that could be raised on the whole case was intended to be left open. The learned Judge chose to follow the dicta in Ushers Wilshire Brewery v Bruce [(1915) A.C.. 433 at 465,466]. In Commissioner of Income Tax v. Saverinmuttu Retty {Reports of Ceylon Tax Cases, Vol. 1.
