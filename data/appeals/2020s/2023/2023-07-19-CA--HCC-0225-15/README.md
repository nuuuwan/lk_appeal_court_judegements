Menaka Wijesundera J.

The instant appeal has been lodged to set aside the judgment dated 17.12.2015

of the High Court of Polonnaruwa.

The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) has been

indicted for committing the murder of his infant child born out of wedlock.

The version of the prosecution is that the appellant who had been living next to

the house of the deceased has been having an illicit affair with the deceased

mother and on the day of the incident the appellant had come to the house of

the deceased and had cut her to death. She also had been previously assaulted

by the appellant and had been permanently disabled. Thereafter the appellant

had run off and had been evading arrest.

The main ground of appeal by the appellant is that,

1) The appellant has a history of mental ill health and neither the High Court

nor the Magistrates Court had acted under section 375 and 374 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code (herein after referred to as the CPC) and as such he had not been given a fair a trial.

Page 3 of 7

2) When the Magistrate had failed to consider his mental health, the

appellant had not been properly committed to the High Court and thereby it vitiates his conviction in the High Court.

On perusal of the case record we find that initially when the appellant had been

indicted the state counsel had made the application to the High Court to obtain

a report with regard to the metal health of the appellant because in the

Magistrates Court as per V1 the Polonnaruwa Consultant Psychiatrist the

appellant had been diagnosed as being of unsound mind and is not fit to plead

and he had recommended treatment at the Angoda hospital.

As such the High Court had obtained a report from Dr Neil Fernando who also

had been the retired Consultant Psychiatrist at Angoda hospital and he has said

that the appellant is fit to plead and that he may have been of good health

at the time of the commission of the offence.

Hence the High Court Judge had not acted under section 375 of the CPC which is

quoted below and had proceeded to trial and had convicted the appellant for the

charge of murder. The trial judge had stated in his judgment that the report

submitted in the Magistrate Court is not comprehensive enough but Dr Neil

Fernando has gone in to a more detailed examination of the patient. But we find

that the trial judge had failed to act under section 375 of the CPC which says that,

375 (1) If any person committed for trial before the High Court appears to the

court at his trial to be of unsound mind and consequently incapable of making

his defense, the jury or (where the trial is without a jury) the Judge of the High

Court shall in the first instance try the fact of such unsoundness and incapacity,

and if satisfied of the fact find accordingly and thereupon the trial shall be

postponed.

In view of the above section if the accused has a history of unsound mind the trial

judge has to ascertain that the accused is of good health and is capable of

understanding the charge against him and then act accordingly. But in the instant

matter the trial judge had solely relied on the report of Dr Neil Fernando and has

proceeded to trial without considering the contrary report filed of record at the

non-summary. At this stage the learned Counsel for the respondents submitted

that the report of Dr. Neil Fernando was very comprehensive and that a special

inquiry need not have been held. But we are unable to agree with the same

because the legislature had recommended that the trial judge should go in to the

matter first before proceeding to trial is because it is fundamental in criminal law

that an accused has to be able to understand the offence he is being charged

with and especially when there is contrary view on the matter, the best would

have been to lead evidence and give a chance for the accused to cross examine

the expert who says that he is fit to plead. At this stage both Counsel were unable

to assist court with regard to any decided authority except for an Indian

judgement submitted by the learned counsel for appellant. In the said judgment

the parallel section in the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure Code to section 375

and 374 of our CPC is section 328, and the cited judgment which is the state of

Maharastra vs Subasinghe on 20th July 1994 by the Bombay High Court had said

as follows,

It can be seen that section 328 Cr.P.C. provides that if during an enquiry a

Magistrate has a reason to believe that the accused is of unsound mind he has

to first enquire into this aspect, and if he is convinced about the insanity, he

has to stop the enquiry. Under section 329 Cr.P.C. a trial has to be mandatorily

postponed on finding the accused to be insane. Section 330 Cr.P.C. suggests a

course to be taken for the good care or safe custody of such accused. Section

331 to 333 Cr.P.C. provides that the inquiry or the trial as the case may be can

Page 5 of 7

resumed only after the accused has fully recovered from insanity. Thus, the law

takes care, and mandates that the accused must be of sane mind when he is

tried. It is cardinal principal of criminal jurisprudence that the accused must

understand the nature of the charge proceeding against him.

Therefore, we are unable to agree with the learned counsel for the respondents

because the legislature had laid down the procedure to be adopted by courts for

a purpose and the courts must follow the same because justice should not only

be done but it should be seemed to be done as well.

The second point raised by the counsel for the appellant is that in the

Magistrates Court the appellant had not been properly committed to stand trial

in the High court as such the indictment filed by the Attorney General is not

valid.

Chapter 15 of the CPC deals with inquiries to be held by the Magistrate, and

under section 146 of the said chapter the charge has to be read over to the

accused and the accused has to understand the charge. But for that purpose to

be achieved the accused has to be of sound mind, but in the instant matter

according to V1 submitted by Dr. Nallhewa the accused had not been of sound

mind to plead. Hence the next step for the Magistrate would have been to act

under section 374 of the CPC which reads as follows,

374 (1) When a Magistrates Court holding an inquiry or a trial has reason to

believe that the accused is of unsound mind and consequently incapable of

making his defense it shall inquire into the fact of such unsoundness and shall

cause such person to be examined by the Government medical officer of the

district or some other medical officer, and thereupon shall examine such officer

as a witness and shall reduce the examination to writing.

In the instant matter the Magistrate had been in possession of V1 and had taken

steps to write to the Minister of Justice to take appropriate action and thereafter

when the ministry has done so the Magistrate presiding had changed and the

succeeding Magistrate had failed to consider all these steps and instead had

proceeded to have non-summary and had concluded the same and had

committed the accused as well which we consider as a clear violation of

procedure and that type of erroneous procedure only vitiates the committal

which denies the fundamental right of an accused to be able to understand the

charge which is being read over to him by court.

Then the next question posed by the counsel for appellant is that in the light of

not being committed properly whether it vitiates the indictment filed by the

state. The Counsel appearing for the respondents cited sections 436 and 334 of

the CPC which also says that any irregularity during trial or procedure can be

corrected in appeal if it has not caused any miscarriage of justice to the accused.

But in the instant matter we find that the accused had not been properly

committed to the High Court for the reason that the accused had not been able

to understand the charges against him as per medical evidence hence it has

denied one of the basic rights of an accused which is enshrined in the

Constitution of the country which we are all bound by.

At this stage we consider the judgments cited by the counsel for the appellant

and we wish to draw our attention to Piyadasa vs The Queen 66 NLR 242 in

which it has been held that when the Attorney General has included new

charges in addition to the charges for which the accused has been already

committed that it vitiates the indictment for the reason that the error strikes

at the root of the jurisdiction of court .

Page 7 of 7

In the instant matter we find that the accused had not been properly committed

to the High Court and in such an event the Attorney General had no accused

committed to the High Court to be indicted and as a result of which the trial judge

had no accused before him who was indicted to be tried and convicted.

As such we allow the instant appeal and we set aside the conviction and the

sentence entered by the trial judge but we order the Commissioner General of

Prisons to take steps under section 381 of the CPC.
