Judgment

This is an appeal from the Judgement of the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province

holden in Galle exercising writ jurisdiction in respect of the application bearing no Writ

50/2019 made by the Petitioner-Appellant. The said application was made seeking to quash

the decision of the 1st Respondent-Respondent namely the Galle Municipal Council to impose

a trade license fee of 1% of the total takings of the preceding year in order to issue trade

license with regard to the business of the Petitioner-Appellant by way of a writ of certiorari.

Further, the Petitioner-Appellant had prayed for granting a mandate in the nature of a writ

of mandamus compelling payment based on the annual value of the premises as

contemplated in section 247A (1) of the Municipal Council Ordinance No 29 of 1947 (as

amended).

The Petitioner-Appellant is a company involved in the trade of Tourism, conducting a

business running a Boutique Hotel under the name and style of Amangalla.

The said Company is duly incorporated under the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 and duly

re-registered under the provisions of Companies Act No 17 of 2007.

The said certificate of incorporation and license to carry a Boutique hotel was marked as P2

and P4 respectively and produced in the High Court Writ application bearing Writ

50/2019).

It was the contention of the Petitioner-Appellant [herein after sometimes referred to as the

Appellant] that the hotel operated by the Appellant company is registered as a Boutique Hotel

under the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, which was formed under the Tourism

Act No. 38 of 2005.

It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that although the said hotel operates with a

registration under the Tourism Act No 38 of 2005, the 1st Respondent Municipal Council and

the 4th Respondent-Respondent Commissioner of the Galle Municipal Council have been

maliciously and illegally insisting the Appellant Company to pay 1% of the total earnings of

the previous year to obtain a Trade license as required by the Municipal Council Ordinance

No 29 of 1947 (as amended).

The attention of Court was drawn to section 247A of the Municipal Council Ordinance (as

amended).

Page 4 of 17

Section 247 A (1) A Municipal Council may impose and levy a duty in respect of

licenses issued by the Council.

(2) The duty levied under subsection (1) in respect of any license issued by the

Council authorizing the use of any premises for any of the purposes described in this

Ordinance or in any by-law made thereunder shall be determined by the Council

according to the annual value of the premises so licensed, and, where such license

authorizes the use of such premises for the purposes of any trade, having regard to

(a) the annual value of such premises;

(b) the turnover of business of such trade;

(c) the profit that is likely to be earned in such trade; and

(d) the essential nature of the goods or services supplied in the course of such trade:

Provided that where the annual value of such premises falls within the limits of any

item in Column I set out below, the maximum duty shall not exceed the sum set out

in the corresponding entry in Column II-

Provided further, that where any such premises are used for the purposes of a hotel,

restaurant or lodging house, and such hotel, restaurant, or lodging house is registered

with or approved or recognized by the Ceylon Tourist Board for the purposes of the

Tourist Development Act, the duty so levied shall be according to the takings of the

hotel, restaurant or lodging house for the year preceding the year in which the license

duty is levied, and shall not exceed one per centum of such takings. Where such hotel,

restaurant, or lodging house is in its first year of operation, the license duty shall be

determined and levied according to the annual value of such premises.

For the purposes of this section, " takings " in relation to a hotel, restaurant or lodging

house means the total amount received or receivable from transactions entered into

Column 1 Column II

Where the annual value- does

not exceed Rs. 1,500

Rs. 2,000

exceeds Rs, 1,500 but does not

exceed Rs. 2.500

Rs. 3,000

exceeds Rs. 2,500 Rs. 5,000

Page 5 of 17

in respect of that hotel, restaurant or lodging house or for services performed in

carrying on that hotel, restaurant or lodging house.

However, it was contended by the Appellant that the hotel managed by the Appellants

company, namely Amangalla was not registered under the Tourism Development Act No 14

of 1968, thus the Appellant has no obligation to pay 1% of the total earnings of Amangalla

to obtain a trade license for the next year.

It was brought to the notice of the Court by the Appellant that sections 77 to 82 of the Tourist

Development Act No 14 of 1968 were repealed by the Tourism Act No 38 of 2005 and all

regulations made thereunder are repealed and/or annulled by law and there exists no

provisions to register a hotel under the Provisions of the Tourist Development Act No 14 of

1968 at present.

Furthermore, it was submitted that Tourist Enterprise or Tourist Service cannot carry business

unless such Enterprise or service is registered with the said Tourism Development Authority,

created under Tourism Act No 38 of 2005.

As such, any business engaged in Tourist Enterprise or Tourist service is required to obtain a

license subject to a license fee in accordance with the recommendation of the Minister as per

the provisions. The Appellant has complied with subsequent registration under the Tourism

Act No. 38 of 2005 as established by the License to carry on Business on a Boutique Hotel

was marked and produced in the Provincial High Court as P4.

It was submitted on behalf of the Respondent-Respondents [hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the Respondents] that Section 247A of the Municipal Council Ordinance has not been

amended regarding the Trade license levy upon a maximum of 1% of the total takings of the

preceding year of a Tourist Hotel, which is registered with the Sri Lanka Tourism

Development Authority.

Section 68 of the Tourism Act No 38 of 2005 provides as follows,

Section 68: The Tourist Development Act, No. 14 of 1968 is hereby

amended as follows:

(1) by the insertion immediately after section 1 of that Act of the following

new section which shall have effect as section 1A of that Act:

Page 6 of 17

"Tourism Act,

No. 38 of

2005" and "Sri

Lanka Tourism

Development

Authority " to

be substituted

for the

expressions

"principal Act"

and "Board",

respectively.

1A. Wherever the expressions "principal Act" and

"Board" appear in this Act, such expressions shall be

read and construed as being a reference to the "Tourism

Act, No. 38 of 2005" and the "Sri Lanka Tourism

Development Authority" established by section 2 of the

"Tourism Act, No. 38 of 2005", respectively.";

(2) by the repeal of sections 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 and 82 of Chapter I of Part

IV of that Act;

(3) in section 103 of that Act- (a) by the repeal of the definition of the

expression "Board; (b) by the repeal of the definition of the expression

"Competent Authority"; and (c) by the repeal of the definition of the

expression "principal Act"; and

(4) by the repeal of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Schedules to that

Act.

In view of Section 16 of the Interpretation Ordinance,

Section 16 (1): Where in any written law or document reference is made to any

written law which is subsequently repealed, such reference shall be deemed to be

made to the written law by which the repeal is effected or to the corresponding

portion thereof.

(2) This section shall apply to written laws and documents made as well before as

after the commencement of this Ordinance.

As such, it was argued on behalf of the Respondents that when interpreting sections of the

Tourist Development Act, No. 14 of 1968 read with section 247A (1) of the Municipal

Council Ordinance, its clear that Appellants hotel is a duly registered tourist hotel with the

Tourism Development Authority (established by section 02 of the Tourism Act No 38 of 2005

as referred to in section 68(2) thereof) for the purposes of section 247A of the Municipal

Page 7 of 17

Council Ordinance. Hence, the Respondents have submitted that the Appellants contention

is untenable in law.

In contrast, it is worth noting that license document P4 was issued to NOH HOTEL PRIVATE

LTD registered proprietor of AMANGALLE registered as a Boutique hotel in the register of

Boutique Hotel maintained by the Director/standard quality assurance under Registration

No SLTDA/SQA/BH/002 to carry on the business of the above-mentioned Boutique Hotel

under the Tourism Act No 38 of 2005.

In terms of section 48(5) of the Tourism Act No 38 of 2005, on 20th April 2006

Extraordinary Gazette No. 1962/28 was published promulgating regulations, wherein the

Tourist Hotels were classified, the applicable standards are laid down and the fees payable

for licensing and registration for a Tourist Enterprise was determined.

The said gazette notification was marked as P3 and produced to the Provincial High Court.

The said gazette notification was published under section 48(5) of the Tourism Act no 38 of

2005.

It is noteworthy that there are four different Acts which deal with the Tourism Industry (as

given below).

1. Ceylon Tourist Board Act No 10 of 1966

2. Tourism Development Act No 14 of 1968

3. The Tourism Act No. 38 of 2005

4. Finance Act No 25 of 2003.

Therefore, I will briefly analyse the scope of such Acts before considering under which Act a

hotel can be registered in order to charge the above-mentioned levy.

Ceylon Tourist Board Act no 10 of 1966

The Ceylon Tourist Board Act no 10 of 1966 has for the first time established the Ceylon

Tourist Board, an Authority in charge of tourism promotion and related activities. The powers

of the Board appointed under the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No. 10 of 1966 is limited inter

alia to the powers to establishment, regulate, supervise, develop and control:

Tourist resorts;

Tourist services; and

The employment of persons in or about the business of tourist services; and

Page 8 of 17

To formulate for the guidance of the Minister and tourist, travel and other agencies, a

national plan or policy setting out in outline general proposals for the regulation, supervision,

development, and control of tourism.

(Section 28 of the Tourism Act of 2005)

Tourism Development Act No 1968

It seems that the Tourism Development Act No 1968 was enacted while the Ceylon Tourist

Board Act was in force and provision of the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No 10 of 1966 was not

amended or repealed by Tourism Board Act No 14 of 1968 it has merely expanded the powers

given to the Ceylon Tourist Board.

The said Act was enacted for a special purpose as clearly stated in the preamble thereto to

provide for the promotion and carrying out of Tourist Development Projects and the Ceylon

Tourist Board Act was enacted to establish the Ceylon Tourist Board. It is evident from the

provision of the Tourism Development Act No 1968 that the Ceylon Tourist Board Act

remains to be in operation as the Tourism Development Act No 1968 merely provides specific

powers to the Board established by the Ceylon Tourist Board Act. I have given below examples

of such references to emphasize this point,

Section 11 of the Act No 14 of 1968: Without prejudice to the generality of the powers

conferred on the Board by the Ceylon Tourist Board Act, the Board may, with the

approval of the Minister, alienate, for the purpose of any tourist development project,

any land held by the Board, subject to"

Section 58(3): Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred on the

Board by the Ceylon Tourist Board Act, the Board may, with the approval of the

Minister, alienate, for the purpose of any tourist development project, any land held

by the Board, subject to"

Section 103 (interpretation section: "Board" means the Ceylon Tourist Board

established or constituted under the Ceylon Tourist Board Act;

The provisions of the said Act No 14 of 1968 envisage the powers given for the promotion

and carrying out of Tourist Development Projects.

It is to be noted that the powers given under the said Act are,

Section 2: Compulsory Acquisition of Land

Section4: To vest state lands for Tourism Development Projects

Page 9 of 17

Section 7: The power of administration, control, custody, and management of any Part

of foreshore for Tourism Development projects and other powers that are exclusively

granted under the Tourism Development Act No 14 of 1968.

Section 73A: Declaration of areas as Tourist Development areas.

Section 86(e): The Power to summon and examine witnesses or informants, to

administer oaths, to require the production, or to impound documents and search and

inspect premises.

It is observable that the aforesaid powers are vested only under the Tourism Development

Act No 16 of 1968 and no such powers have been vested in any other body created under

any other Acts, particularly the Ceylon Tourist Board Act no 10 of 1966 or the Tourism Act

No. 38 of 2005.

It is therefore abundantly clear that the Ceylon Tourist Board Act was not repealed by the

said Tourism Development Act No 14 of 1968.

Tourism Act No. 38 of 2005

The attention of the Court was drawn to the provisions of Section 66 of the Tourism Act of

2005, and specifically to Section 67 thereof.

Section 67 effectively repeals The Ceylon Tourist Board Act, No. 10 of 1966. According to

section 67,

(1) The Ceylon Tourist Board Act, No. 10 of 1966 is hereby repealed. The Minister

shall by Order published in the Gazette appoint the date on which such repeal shall

take effect.

(2) From and after the repeal of the Ceylon Tourist Board Act, No.10 of 1966,-

(a) all movable and immovable property vested in the Ceylon Tourist Board

on the day preceding the date of repeal, shall with effect from the date

appointed for the repeal, vest in the Authority;

(b) all contracts, and agreements entered into by or with the Ceylon Tourist

Board and subsisting on the day preceding the date of repeal, shall, with effect

from the date appointed for the repeal, be deemed to be contracts and

agreements entered into by or with the Authority;

Page 10 of 17

(c) all actions and proceedings instituted by or against the Ceylon Tourist

Board and pending on the day preceding the date of repeal, shall, with effect

from the date appointed for the repeal, be deemed to be actions and

proceedings instituted by or against the Authority as the case may be, and may

be continued and completed accordingly ;

(d) all persons who were members, officers and servants of the Ceylon Tourist

Board on the day preceding the date of repeal, shall, with effect from the date

appointed for the repeal, be deemed to be members, officers and servants of

the Authority ; and

(e) all judgments and orders made in favour or against the Ceylon Tourist

Board and remaining unsatisfied on the date preceding the date of repeal,

shall, with effect from date appointed for the repeal, be deemed to be

judgments and orders made in favour of, or against, the Authority, as the case

may be, and may been forced accordingly ;

(f) all training schools and institutes being controlled and managed by the

Ceylon Tourist Board on the date preceding the date of repeal, shall, with effect

from date appointed for the repeal, be deemed to vest in the Sri Lanka Institute

of Tourism and Hotel Management established by section 33.

(3) All permits and license issued in terms of the provisions to the Ceylon

Tourist Board Act, No. 10 of 1966 prior to the repeal of the aforesaid Act, shall

continue to be valid and effectual as if issued under the provisions of this Act

unless and until permits and license are issued in terms of this Act.

It was submitted by the Appellant that this is the clearest indication that if there was a

registration of a Hotel, Restaurant or Lodging House registered for the purposes of the

Tourism Development Act that such licenses are kept valid and alive even after the Ceylon

Tourist Board Act No. 10 of 1966 was repealed.

It is noteworthy that under section 67 (3) of the Act, it specifically states that all property,

contracts, and related articles which lay with the Tourist Board Act will vest with the Tourism

Authority created under the Tourism Act of 2005.

The legislature by leaving out the Hotels, Restaurants and Lodging Houses registered under

the Tourism Development Act has left out the same with reason and it should be interpreted

in accordance with the Latin maxim "expressio unius est exclusio alterius".

Page 11 of 17

This is a clear indication that Act No. 14 of 1968 being a different Act which has not been

abolished and the registrations obtained thereunder are kept alive and that there need not be

a renewal of such registrations if obtained under the Tourism Act No. 14 of 1968

Tourism Development Levy

A Tourism Development Levy was introduced by the Finance Act, No. 25 of 2003. This is a

special levy charged on certain Hotels and other Tourist Projects which are specifically

registered under the Tourism Act No. 16 of 1968. This Levy is only in respect of Hotels and

other institutions registered under the Act of 1968.

Section 11 of the said Act reads as follows;

From and after the date of commencement of this Part of this Act, there shall be levied

from every institution licensed under the Tourist Development Act, No.14 of 1968. a

levy of one per centum on the turnover of such institutions in any year, to be called

the Tourism Development Levy.

The said levy was reintroduced under the Act No. 38 of 2005 in the following manner in

terms of section 24 of the Act,

Section 24 (1) There shall be charged, levied and collected by the Director-General,

in terms of section 12 of the Finance Act, No. 25 of2003, a Tourism Development

Levy, on the turnover of every institution, licensed under the Tourist Development

Act, No. 14 of1968.

(2) The provisions of Part II of the Finance Act, No. 25 of 2003 shall apply in relation

to the imposition of the levy, the method of payment of the levy and the manner of

furnishing returns relating to the collection of such levy to the Deputy Secretary to

the Treasury.

(3) Rules may be made by the Authority for the management and administration of

the levy.

[.]

According to section 24(1) of the Act No. 38 of 2005, the Tourism Development levy is to be

collected on the turnover of every institution, licensed under the Act No. 14 of 1968.

Following the literal rule of interpretation, one has to give effect to the plain meaning of the

words in the statue, as held by Lord Diplock in the case of Duport Steel v Stirs (19980) 1

WLR 142;

Page 12 of 17

"Where the meaning of the statutory words is plain and unambiguous it is not for the

judges to invent fancied ambiguities as an excuse to give effect to its plain meaning

because they consider the consequences of doing so would be inexpedient, or even

unjust or immoral."

This dictum by Lord Diplock has been cited in many Sri Lankan case law including, in the

case of Balasooriya Mudiyanselage Soorathunga Balasooriya v Saman Piyasiri and Others

(2012) CA (Writ) No. 342/2012 CAM 29.04.2019 by Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz,

In Craies on Statute Law (7th Edition), Universal Law Publishing it is stated that:

Strictly speaking there is no place for interpretation or construction except

where the words of statute admit two meanings. As Scott LJ said: Where the

words of an Act of Parliament are clear, there is not room for applying any of

the principles of interpretation which are merely presumptions in cases of

ambiguity in the statute... The cardinal rule for the construction of an Act of

Parliament is that they should be construed according to the intention

expressed in the Act themselves.

If the words of a statute are themselves precise, there is no more can be

necessary than to expand those words in their ordinary natural steps

It seems to be that, if the legislature intended the Tourism Development levy to be applicable

to hotels registered under the Act No. 38 of 2005, then the legislature would have specified

that the levy would be applicable for institutions registered under licensed under this Act

and Tourist Development Act, No. 14 of 1968. However, it is evident that such language is

missing in section 24 (1) which reintroduces the Tourism Development levy, indicating that

the Tourism development levy was to apply differently to institutions registered under the

Act No 14 of 1968 than to of institutions registered under the Act No. 38 of 2005. I do not

wish to hypothesise the reasons as to why the parliament wished to impose two different

levies as that is not the duty of this court and the Parties have not brought any material before

this court regarding the same.

It should be noted that, section 28 of the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No 10 of 1996, which

provides inter alia for passing regulations for registration of resorts, which include within it

the meaning hotels were repealed by the Act No. 38 of 2005.

Furthermore, the sections 77 to 82 of the Tourism Development Act No. 14 of 1968 were

also repealed by section 68 (2) [reproduced below] of the Act No. 38 of 2005,

Page 13 of 17

Section 68 (2) by the repeal of sections 77, 78, 79, 80, 81 and 82 of Chapter I of Part

IV of that Act.

The provisions, section 77 to 82 which falls within Part IV, Chapter I of the said Act, provides

for the establishment of the Tourist Hotel Code which empowers the relevant authorities to

make regulations regarding inter alia for supervision, classification, inspection and control

of the establishment, maintenance and operation of tourist services, consisting of tourist

hotels (in this Act referred to as the Tourist Hotels Code ). In simple terms registration an

issuing licenses for hotels were to be done under the said provisions.

As the above provisions were repealed by the Act No. 38 of 2005, any regulation save for the

licenses already issued under the Act (as provided for by section 67(3)) are repealed and

have no effect in law. Therefore, no new hotel can be registered pursuant to the Act No. 14

of 1968.

Furthermore, the Appellants submitted that the Registrations under the Act No. 38 of 2005

are made under the regulation briefed to Court marked as P 5. It seems that the Appellants

have validly registered the hotel under Act No. 38 of 2005 and not under Act No. 14 of 1968.

This court will now consider the applicability of section 247A of the Municipal Council

Ordinance. This Section was amended by the Municipal Councils Amendment Act No. 20 of

1985 (as reproduced above),

Section 247 A (1) A Municipal Council may impose and levy a duty in respect of

licenses council issued by the Council. [3,20 of 1985]

(2) The duty levied under subsection (1) in respect of any license issued by the

Council authorizing the use of any premises for any of the purposes described in this

Ordinance or in any by-law made thereunder shall be determined by the Council

according to the annual value of the premises so licensed, and, where such license

authorizes the use of such premises for the purposes of any trade, having regard to

(a) the annual value of such premises;

(b) the turnover of business of such trade;

(c) the profit that is likely to be earned in such trade; and

(d) the essential nature of the goods or services supplied in the course of such trade:

Page 14 of 17

Provided that where the annual value of such premises falls within the limits of any

item in Column I set out below, the maximum duty shall not exceed the sum set out

in the corresponding entry in Column II-

Column 1 Column II

Where the annual value- does not

exceed Rs. 1,500

Rs. 2,000

exceeds Rs, 1,500 but does not exceed

Rs. 2.500

Rs. 3,000

exceeds Rs. 2,500 Rs. 5,000

Provided further, that where any such premises are used for the purposes of a hotel,

restaurant or lodging house, and such hotel, restaurant, or lodging house is registered

with or approved or recognized by the Ceylon Tourist Board for the purposes of the

Tourist Development Act (Act No. 14 of 1968), the duty so levied shall be according

to the takings of the hotel, restaurant or lodging house for the year preceding the year

in which the license duty is levied, and shall not exceed one per centum of such

takings. Where such hotel, restaurant, or lodging house is in its first year of operation,

the license duty shall be determined and levied according to the annual value of such

premises.

For the purposes of this section, " takings " in relation to a hotel, restaurant or lodging

house means the total amount received or receivable from transactions entered into

in respect of that hotel, restaurant or lodging house or for services performed in

carrying on that hotel, restaurant or lodging house.

Thus, it is clear that for 1% of the Total Earnings to be charged, the Hotel or Lodging House

must be registered with or approved or recognized by the Ceylon Tourist Board for the

purposes of the Tourist Development Act. As such, the 1% levy can only be charged if the

Hotel is registered under the Tourism Development Act of 1968.

In view of the provisions of the abovementioned Acts, the Finance Act of 2003 and the Proviso

to Section 274A of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, make it clear that a levy of 1% of

takings can only be charged to issue a trade license if and only if such Hotel or Restaurant

is registered under the Tourism Act of 1968.

However, as the Ceylon Tourist Board Act is no longer in operation and as the relevant

provisions of the Tourism Development Act of 1968 related to establishment of hotels have

Page 15 of 17

also been repealed, the Appellants hotel has not been registered under the above-mentioned

Acts.

In contrast, the Respondent-Respondent has argued that the section 247A of Municipal

Council Ordinance should be interpreted with section 16 of the Interpretation Ordinance

(reproduced below), by replacing the reference to the Ceylon Tourist Board Act of 1966 and

the Tourism Development Act No. 14 of 1968 in the said section as references to Tourism Act

No. 38 of 2005.

16. (1) Where in any written law or document reference is made to any written law

which is subsequently repealed, such reference shall be deemed to be made to the

written law by which the repeal is effected or to the corresponding portion thereof.

(2) This section shall apply to written laws and documents made as well before as

after the commencement of this Ordinance.

This position is prima-facie not tenable as the Act No. 38 of 2005, it self has not made any

provisions to indicate that levies applicable to Act No. 14 of 1968 is applicable to the said

Act. In fact, as I have analysed above, Act No. 38 of 2005 has recognized the existence of the

tourism development levy applicable to hotels registered under Act no 14 of 1968 but has

not made the same levy applicable to the hotels registered under Act No. 38 of 2005.

In the case of Sebestian Fernando v Katana MPCS 1900 - 1 Sri LR 342 (SC) it was held that,

"Statutes which encroach upon the rights of the citizen have to be "strictly" construed:

they should be interpreted, if possible, to respect such rights, and if there is any

ambiguity, the construction which is in favour of the freedom of the individual should

be adopted. Statues which impose pecuniary burdens or penalties are subject to the

same rule. If there are two reasonable constructions, one of which will avoid penalty,

that construction must be preferred.

It is established law that, a strict interpretation of statutes which imposes taxes/levies on the

citizenry is preferred as such statutes place a significant burden on the people.

In the case of Vallibel Lanka Pvt Ltd Vs. Director General of Customs and others (2008) BLR

(at page 220) Siripavan J. (as he then was) held (with S. N. Silva PC CJ. and Amarathunga J.

agreeing),

The Court cannot give a wider interpretation to merely because some

financial loss may in certain circumstances be caused to the State.

Page 16 of 17

..

It is the established rule in the interpretation of statues levying taxes and duties

not to extend the provisions of the statute by implication, beyond the clear

import of the language used or to enlarge their operation in order to embrace

matters not specifically pointed out. In case of doubt, the provisions are

construed most strongly against the state and in favour of the citizen.

Thus, the intention to impose duties and/or taxes on imported goods must be

shown by clear and unambiguous words.

Considerations of hardships, injustice or anomalies do not play a useful role

in construing fiscal statues. One must have regard to the strict letter of the law

and cannot import provisions in the Customs Ordinance so as to supply any

assumed deficiency.

This Court pays its minds to the trite rule of interpretation that fiscal statutes and statutes

imposing penal or pecuniary liabilities must be strictly interpreted and any ambiguity must

be constructed in favour of the individual [CA. Abraham, Uppoottil, Kottayam v. The Income

Tax Officer, Kottayam and Another (1961) AIR 609, Perera & Silva Ltd. v. Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue (79) 2 N.L.R. 164.

As such, a narrower interpretation of statutes which impose levies is preferable and courts

should not construe such statues in a manner that places a heavier burden on the citizenry

and such businesses.

In the circumstances, it is apparent that Section 16 of the Interpretations Ordinance has no

bearing on the present manner in interpreting the laws pertaining to the instant case, and

the 1% of the Total Earnings of a Hotel or Restaurant can be charged only from a Hotel

Registered under the Tourism Act no. 14 of 1968, and therefore, as the Petitioner-Appellant-

Hotel was registered under the Act No. 38 of 2005, the Petitioner-Appellant is entitled to the

reliefs prayed for in the Petition of Appeal.

Thus, we set aside the Judgment/Order of the learned High Court Judge dated 24.02.2021

in case bearing no Writ 50/2019.

Therefore, we quashed the decision of the 1st Respondent Municipal Council to impose a

trade license fee of 1% of the total takings of the presiding year (as informed by letters marked

as P5, P6, P7, and P8 produced before the High Court in Writ Application bearing no

50/2019.

And we grant a writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents to issue a

trade license after receiving payment based on the annual value of the premises as

contemplated in Section 247A (1) of the Municipal Council Ordinance No 29 of 1947 as

(amended).

Hence, the appeal of the Petitioner-Appellant is allowed. Parties have to bear the cost of

litigation in the Provincial High Court as well as in this Court.

Appeal allowed.
