This is an application by the petitioner in terms of Article 138 of The Constitution

invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court. The petitioner is seeking to

set aside an order dated 16-12-2016 pronounced by the learned High Court

Judge of the Commercial High Court of Colombo in Case No.

H.C.(Civil)/25/2011/CO.

Apart from the above, the petitioner has sought to get several orders made by

the learned Magistrate of Mt. Lavinia in M.C. Mt. Lavinia Case No. 4921/S/10

(Labour) set aside as well.

According to the averments of the petition, the Commissioner of Labour has

initiated proceedings against Tera Net Lanka (Private) Limited in order to recover

Rs. 378,790.00 in terms of section 50 (c) (2) of the Shop and Office Employees

(Regulation of Employment and Remuneration) Act No. 19 of 1954, as amended

by subsequent amendments made thereto.

When this matter was taken up before the learned Magistrate of Mt. Lavinia, the

above-mentioned respondent company has informed the Court that the company

is under liquidation and proceedings have been initiated before the Commercial

High Court of Colombo in terms of the Companies Act.

After considering the legal provisions applicable to such a situation, the learned

Magistrate of Mt. Lavinia has refused to proceed with the application by the

Commissioner of Labour informing the complainant to move the matter before

the relevant Commercial High Court.

It appears that subsequent to an application made by the Commissioner of

Labour to the Commercial High Court in the above-mentioned case, the

Commercial High Court Judge of Colombo by his order dated 16-12-2016,

pronounced in terms of section 279 (1) of the Companies Act, has allowed the

Commissioner of Labour to proceed with the case initiated by him in M.C. Mt.

Lavinia Case No. 4921/S/10 (Labour)

Page 4 of 9

It was subsequent to the above order pronounced by the Commercial High Court

of Colombo; the learned Magistrate of Mt. Lavinia has proceeded to recover the

said amount from the petitioner.

It is therefore clear that what the petitioner is seeking to challenge primarily is

an order pronounced by the Commercial High Court of Colombo in 2016, and

several orders made by the Magistrate of Mt. Lavinia subsequent to that.

Although this Court has previously accepted this application and issued notice

to the respondents, and also issued a stay order, subjected to the petitioner

depositing the amount mentioned in the certificate filed by the Commissioner of

Labour, it is the view of this Court that it becomes necessary to consider whether

this Court has the jurisdiction to determine on an order pronounced by the

Commercial High Court of Colombo before proceeding any further in this matter.

When this matter was considered before the Court, the learned Counsel for the

petitioner insisted that this Court has the jurisdiction to revise an order

pronounced by the Commercial High Court.

He relied on an order pronounced by another division of this Court in CA

Application No. CA/RII/0006/2022 decided on 30th March 2022. This is an

application purportedly for restitutio in integrum/revision under Article 138 of

The Constitution. It has been held that despite the appellate power being vested

in the Supreme Court in a matter of this nature, still the Court of Appeal can

proceed with the application made to the Court in the case considered. However,

it is the view of this Court that the mentioned decision has no binding effect on

this Court. The learned Counsel for the petitioner was also given permission to

file written submissions, on this question of jurisdiction.

Since the petitioner has combined the orders pronounced by the Magistrate

Court as well as an order by the Commercial High Court of Colombo, I would

now proceed to consider the basis upon which the petitioner has filed a revision

application directly to this Court against an order by the learned Magistrate of

Mt. Lavinia.

Page 5 of 9

It appears that the petitioner has filed this application before the Court on the

basis that this Court has parallel appellate and revisionary jurisdiction to that

of a High Court of the Provinces, and there exists no bar for him to initiate

proceedings either in the Court of Appeal or in the relevant Provincial High Court.

The forum jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal has been spelt out in Article 138(1)

of The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

For matters of clarity, I would now reproduce the relevant article.

138(1). The Court of Appeal shall have an exercise subject to the

provisions of the constitution or any law, an appellate jurisdiction

for the correction of all errors in fact or law in which shall be

(committed by the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate or

original jurisdiction or by any Court of First Instance), tribunal or

other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal,

revision and restitutio integrum, of all causes, suits, actions,

prosecutions, matters and things (of which such High Court of First

Instance), tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance.

(The emphasis is mine)

Provided that no judgement, decree or order of any Court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

138(2). The Court of Appeal shall also have an exercise all such powers

and jurisdiction, appellate and original, as Parliament may by law vest

and ordain.

The above-cited Article 138(1) of The Constitution has clearly provided that the

jurisdiction conferred by the said Article is subject to the provisions of the

constitution or any other law.

Page 6 of 9

With the enactment of the 13th Amendment to The Constitution, a system of

Provincial High Courts was established. Article 154P (3) of The Constitution

which provides for the jurisdiction of the relevant High Court of the Province

reads as follows.

154P (3). Every High Court shall-

(a) Exercise according to law, the original criminal

jurisdiction of the High Court of Sri Lanka in respect

of offences committed within the province;

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject

to any law, exercise, appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of convictions, sentences and

orders entered or imposed by Magistrate Courts and

Primary Courts within the province; (The emphasis is

mine.)

(c) Exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as

Parliament may, by law, provide.

Therefore, it is clear that the Article 154P of The Constitution shall prevail over

Article 138 of The Constitution when it comes to the appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction with regard to convictions, orders entered or imposed by Magistrate

or Primary Courts within the province where the relevant Provincial High Court

has jurisdiction.

It is my considered view that since The Constitution, which is the Supreme Law

of this country has provided clear and unambiguous provisions in relation to the

jurisdiction of a Provincial High Court of a province, the petitioner has no basis

to invoke the discretionary power of revision of this Court vested in terms of

Article 138 of The Constitution without first placing his grievance before the

relevant Provincial High Court.

As the primary purpose of the application before this Court by the petitioner is

to challenge an order pronounced by the Commercial High Court of Colombo in

Page 7 of 9

the year 2016, as the prayer of the petition suggests, I will now consider whether

this Court has any jurisdiction to interfere with an order pronounced by the

Commercial High Court of Colombo.

The legislature in its wisdom has brought into operation, the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 10 of 1996 which has been certified on 8th

May 1996. The Court established under the provisions of the Act is the High

Court now commonly referred to as the Commercial High Court.

The Preamble of the Act provides that it is an Act to provide for the exercise, by

High Courts established by Article 154P of The Constitution, of jurisdiction to

hear and determine certain civil actions and matters.

It is clear from the averments of the petition that the matter before the

Commercial High Court is a matter where the said High Court has exclusive

jurisdiction to hear and determine in terms of section 2(1) of the Act.

Since the petitioner has come before this Court by way of a revision application,

seeking to challenge an order pronounced by the Commercial High Court on 16-

12-2016, it becomes necessary to draw my attention to the provisions with

regard to the right of appeal provided for in the relevant Act for a person

dissatisfied with such an order pronounced.

The relevant section 5(2) of the Act reads as follows.

5(2). Any person who is dissatisfied with any order made by a High

Court established by Article 154P of The Constitution, in the exercise

of its jurisdiction under section 2 in the course of any action,

proceeding or matter to which such person is, or seeks to be, a party,

may prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court against such order for the

correction of any error in fact or in law with the leave of the Supreme

Court first had and obtained.

Page 8 of 9

It is the view of this Court that the petitioner has no basis to come before this

Court on a matter where it is the Supreme Court which has the exclusive

jurisdiction to hear and determine.

It is my view that when the legislature has conferred exclusive jurisdiction to the

Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal is not empowered to exercise its jurisdiction

of revision, which would be against the intentions of the legislature.

In the case of Australanka Exporters Pvt Ltd Vs. Indian Bank (2001) 2 SLR

156, it was held that the appellate jurisdiction in respect of judgments and

orders of the High Court of the Provinces made in the exercise of its original civil

jurisdiction is vested in the Supreme Court.

In the case of Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Limited Vs. Wijewardena and

others, S.C. Appeal 81/2010 decided on 15-02-2012;

Per Suresh Chandra, J.

By the enactment of Act No 10 of 1996 it is clear that in any civil matter

dealt within the High Court, the right of appeal lies only to the Supreme

Court. This seems to be the clear intention of the legislature with regard to

the matters dealt in the High Court. When the above special provisions are

being considered in the High Court, if revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeal is given then it would give the party applying for revision in a

situation as in the present case a favorable position by granting an

additional opportunity to review as against a party who comes within the

purview of the of the civil jurisdiction of the High Court regarding other

matters as they will be entitled only to the right of appeal to the Supreme

Court. This would be due to the fact that if the revisionary jurisdiction of the

Court of Appeal is allowed then, if need be, the party would have the option

go further to the Supreme Court by way of canvassing the judgment of the

Court of Appeal in such instances. This would give the party in such

circumstances two opportunities of review of the preliminary judgment when

the clear intention of the legislature is that there should be only an appeal

Page 9 of 9

to the Supreme Court from any judgment or order of the High Court in the

exercise of its civil jurisdiction in terms of sections 5(1) and 5(2).

Accordingly, it is the view of this Court that both the applications, seeking to

challenge the order pronounced by the Commercial High Court as well as the

orders pronounced by the Magistrate Court of Mt. Lavinia, are misconceived in

law.

Hence, I find no basis for the petitioner to proceed any further in this application,

although this Court has previously granted an interim order in this regard.

Therefore, the application of the petitioner is hereby dismissed.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this order to the relevant

High Court as well as the Magistrate Court of Mt. Lavinia for relevant action.

P. Kumararatnam, J.

I agree.
