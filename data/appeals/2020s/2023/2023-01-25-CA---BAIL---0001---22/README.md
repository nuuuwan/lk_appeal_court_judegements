MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to the Suspect-

Petitioner namely Sakkariya Mohamed Rizwam under the Provisions of

the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act.

The facts relate to this case are that the Suspect-Petitioner (hereinafter

referred to as the Petitioner) had pelted stones at the OIC, Potuwil when

the OIC had tried to control a civil commotion in the area. The OIC had

sustained injuries to his ear and had been hospitalized in Ampara

Hospital. The said substantive matter had been referred to the Attorney

General to consider filing of charges. The substantive matter had taken

place on 29.09.2018. According to the Respondent the Petitioner has

several other pending cases.

The incident pertaining to the instant matter is that while the Petitioner

was in the remand cell at the police station he had threatened the OIC

with death. Thereafter, the police had reported facts under the instant

act.

The Counsel for the Petitioner stated that his client is in remand since

2021 without the substantive matter nor the instant matter being

concluded.

The law pertaining to the instant matter is that an accused or a suspect

produced under this act, can obtain bail only upon exceptional

circumstances from the Court of Appeal. The term exceptional has not

been defined in the Statute. But the literal meaning of the term is that

something which is out of the ordinary, but as the Statute had not

defined what is out of the ordinary, the cases so far decided have

Page 4 of 4

concluded that what is out of the ordinary is something which depends

on the facts of each case. Therefore, in the instant matter the

exceptional circumstances or rather what is out of the ordinary is the

period in remand of the Petitioner without the substantive nor the

instant matter reaching a conclusion.

The objective of the instant act is to ensure the rights and the safety of

victims and witnesses. But in the instant matter we note that the

Petitioner had threatened a police officer on duty which is indicative of

the nature of the conduct of the Petitioner. As such, we are of the

opinion that this is not a fit case to be considered for bail. As such, the

instant application for bail is refused.
