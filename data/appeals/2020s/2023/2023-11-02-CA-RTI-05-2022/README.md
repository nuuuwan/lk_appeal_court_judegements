Background

The instant order pertains to an application for intervention filed by the RTI Commission

(hereinafter the Commission) in CA Appeal Application No. CA/RTI/5/2022. It was filed

by the Public Authority-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) against an

3

RTI-05-22 Page 3 of 12 02/11/2023 IJ-34-23

order of the Commission dated 08.04.22 which ordered the petitioner to disclose

information requested by the Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

respondent) in respect of the RTIC Appeal Application bearing no.72/2021.

After the issuance of notices, the appeal was fixed for argument on 02.08.2023. On the

said date, Counsel appearing on behalf of the Commission expressed the Commissions

intentions to intervene in the appeal. It is noteworthy that until this instant, the

Commission was not named a party to CA Appeal Application No. CA/RTI/5/2022.

Consequently, the Court allowed the submission of the application to intervene and gave

one week to file the intervention application and similarly allowed the petitioner to file

objections to such action. Thereafter, the petitioner filed objections and the matter was

fixed for an inquiry on 11.10.2023.

The learned counsel for the Commission (hereinafter referred to as the intervenient

petitioners) has sought, inter alia, the following reliefs in terms of the application to

intervene:

1. The intervenient petitioner has prayed to add the intervenient petitioners as

respondents to the present application.

2. The intervenient petitioner has prayed to tender a Statement of Objection as a

reply to the application of the petitioner.

The intervenient petitioners averred many reasons why their intervention is seminal to

this present application. As such, one of the main averments was that the Commission

must safeguard the intended objectives of the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016

(hereinafter referred to as the Act), in the interest of the public. Furthermore, it was

averred that it is the intervenient petitioners undertaking to ensure just implementation

of the law by safeguarding its primary objectives. In furtherance of such purpose, the

intervenient petitioners argue that there lies an incumbent duty upon the Commission

to assist this Court in the appeal process to ensure the due administration of justice.

The intervenient petitioners claim that in the absence of either party during proceedings,

a proper narrative of the transpired legal proceedings could be provided by the

Commission and such assistance is imperative to this present application to ensure the

sustenance of the spirit of the law and thereby, good governance and inclusive

4

RTI-05-22 Page 4 of 12 02/11/2023 IJ-34-23

development in the country. The Counsel for the intervenient petitioners has drawn

attention to the Preamble of the Act to stress the role of the Commission and has further

elaborated upon, as reiterated above, the need to intervene in instances where either

party is not represented or absent to disclose the material facts of the case before the

court.

However, the petitioner has vehemently objected to this application of intervention on

the basis that once the Commission delivers its decision (which in this case was the

delivery of the decision of RTIC Appeal Application bearing no.72/2021 on 22.06.2023),

it is considered functus officio. This means that the jurisdiction of the Commission over

the matter is exhausted. This Court relies on a recent judgment issued by this Court

which addressed a similar issue to further buttress petitioners argument. As such,

reference was made to Hewa Baddage Gunaratne Vs. The RTI Commission

CA/RTI/01/2020, CA minute 28.06.2023 where the following was held:

Another justification for this view of the Court is that, in general, a tribunal or

commission that decides disputes between two parties would not be made a party

in a higher appeal forum or court. The purpose of an appeal is to review the

decisions made by the lower tribunal or commission, and the parties involved in

the original dispute are typically the ones who bring the appeal and are considered

the parties in the higher appeal forum or court. The commission itself would not

typically be directly involved as a party in the appeal process. When a commission

or tribunal delivers its order, it is considered functus officio, meaning its jurisdiction

over the matter is exhausted. If an appeal is available against the commissions

order, the aggrieved party may initiate the appeal process in the higher court or

forum according to the proper procedure. In this scenario, the RTI Commission is

not typically required to defend its own determination before the Court of Appeal

or it is not so required by the RTI Act. The appeal process focuses on reviewing the

decision made by the RTI Commission based on the evidence and material that

was presented to them during the proceedings before the commission. This

examination involves the scrutiny of the acts of the Public Authority, or the lack

thereof, in determining whether the rights provided under the applicable law have

been protected by the Public Authority and to make a direction accordingly.

Analysis: Principle of Functus Officio

In line with the reasoning of Hewa Baddage Gunaratne Vs. The RTI Commission

(Supra), this Court is of the view that the Commission, after declaring its decision, is

not required to defend its decision as the role of the Commission terminates or is

otherwise exhausted upon the communication of its decision to the parties. Therefore,

it is not required by the Commission to intervene and be made a party to a dispute that

is clearly between two other parties. Hence, this application does not, as highlighted by

the Counsel for the petitioner, constitute a performance of any functions or duties of

the Commission as it is not required by the Commission to operate in such capacity.

However, even though the role of the Commission is terminated upon the

communication of its decision to the parties, the Commission may still exercise its

jurisdiction to ensure that the parties adhere to the decision made by the Commission

under Section 39 of the Act. Therefore, concerning effectuating the decisions made by

the Commission, the Commission may operate in its legal personality to prosecute a

party who disobeys the Commissions decisions. Nevertheless, this power and authority,

cannot be to defend or justify a decision delivered by the Commission while it is being

reviewed by a higher court as in the instant case.

At this juncture, it is noteworthy that the Commission has, on a previous occasion,

contradicted its position on this very issue before this Court. For example, in the case

of Peoples Bank vs. Ceylon Bank Employees Union RTI 01/2018, CA- journal minute

dated 21.11.2019 the Commission was made as a party (2nd Respondent) by the

petitioners. However, the Commission applied to the Court, asserting that it should not

be made a party to such an appeal, stating that the dispute is only between the appellant

and the 1st respondent. This application was allowed by his Lordship Justice Arjuna

Obeysekera, and the Commission was discharged. The similar objection was made by

the Commission in subsequent appeals (e.g. RTI-05-2021). Contrastingly, in the instant

application, the Commission has applied with an application with an opposing stance,

which has left this Court perplexed.

Analysis: Interpretation of the RTI Act

Overview

The Right to Information was introduced as a fundamental right of the citizens of Sri

Lanka, by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. It is a constitutionally guaranteed

right under Article 14A of the Constitution, embedded in the fundamental rights chapter

of the Constitution. The right to information is a fundamental right of all citizens of Sri

Lanka, as people are entitled to transparency, accountability, and good governance in a

country. However, it has to be borne in mind that, although the right to information is

recognized as a fundamental right by the Constitution and constitutionally guaranteed,

it is not an absolute right. Article 14 (2) of the Constitution stipulates the following:

No restrictions shall be placed on the right declared and recognized by this Article,

other than such restrictions prescribed by law as are necessary in a democratic

society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for

the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals and of the

reputation or the rights of others, privacy, prevention of contempt of court, protection

of parliamentary privilege, for preventing the disclosure of information

communicated in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the

judiciary.

The Constitution itself has recognized instances of derogation as expounded in Section

5 of the Act:

(a) the information relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no

relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted

invasion of the privacy of the individual []; (b) disclosure of such information (i)

would undermine the defence of the State or its territorial integrity or national

security; (ii) would be or is likely to be seriously prejudicial to Sri Lankas relations

with any State, or in relation to international agreements or obligations under

international law, where such information was given by or obtained in confidence;

(c) the disclosure of such information would cause serious prejudice to the economy

7

RTI-05-22 Page 7 of 12 02/11/2023 IJ-34-23

of Sri Lanka by disclosing prematurely decisions to change or continue government

economic or financial policies relating to- (i) exchange rates or the control of

overseas exchange transactions; (ii) the regulation of banking or credit; (iii) taxation;

(iv) the stability, control and adjustment of prices of goods and services, rents and

other costs and rates of wages, salaries and other income; or (v) the entering into

of overseas trade agreements; (d) information, including commercial confidence,

trade secrets or intellectual property, protected under the Intellectual Property Act,

No. 36 of 2003, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a

third party,[]; (e) the information could lead to the disclosure of any medical

records relating to any person, unless such person has consented in writing to such

disclosure; (f) the information consist of any communication, between a

professional and a public authority to whom such professional provides services,

which is not permitted to be disclosed under any written law, including any

communication between the Attorney General or any officer assisting the Attorney

General in the performance of his duties and a public authority; (g) the information

is required to be kept confidential by reason of the existence of a fiduciary

relationship; (h) the disclosure of such information would- (i) cause grave prejudice

to the prevention or detection of any crime or the apprehension or prosecution of

offenders; or (ii) expose the identity of a confidential source of information in

relation to law enforcement or national security, to be ascertained; (i) subject to the

provisions of section 29(2)(c), the information has been supplied in confidence to

the public authority[]; (j) the disclosure of such information would be in contempt

of court[]; (k) the disclosure of such information would infringe the privileges of

Parliament or of a Provincial Council as provided by Law; (l) disclosure of the

information would harm the integrity of an examination being conducted by the

Department of Examination or a Higher Educational Institution; (m) the information

is of a cabinet memorandum in relation to which a decision has not been taken; or

(n) the information relates to an election conducted by the Commissioner of

Elections which is required by the relevant election laws to be kept confidential.

The Act has provided an exhaustive list of instances where the right to information can

be forgone. It further affirms the fact that the right to information is not absolute. It is

8

RTI-05-22 Page 8 of 12 02/11/2023 IJ-34-23

pertinent to highlight that the RTI law expects independent, transparent, impartial, and

unbiased decisions from all the officers who hold custody of information. This, however,

does not mean that access to information can be granted without imposing any

limitations. Hence, there has to be an equilibrium between the two possible courses of

action.

Accordingly, the equilibrium between granting access to information and denying access

to information has to be maintained to safeguard the constitutionally guaranteed rights

of the citizens while upholding the spirit of the RTI Act. Therefore, the Information

Officer at the primary stage, the Designated Officer at the secondary stage, and the RTI

Commission at the tertiary stage are required to maintain a balance between the rights

of the public as well as the incentives of the Act. To strike such a balance, if at any

stage, access to information is denied, it is the duty of the Commission, the Information

Officer, and the Designated Officer to state the reasons why access to information has

been denied during the respective stage. A decision, at any of the stages, cannot be

biased towards any of the parties involved in the dispute, as the bedrock of the RTI law

is impartiality and transparency.

Having thus laid out the framework within which the Act was construed, this Court will

now consider the various submissions made by the parties.

Submissions by the parties

In analyzing the submissions made by the two parties, it is observed that the Counsel

for the intervenient petitioners have averred several reasons for their application to

intervene. One of the major reasons for intervention was to assist this Court in the

appeal process. However, it is the opinion of this Court that as the Commission is

required to state reasons for its decisions (as per Section 32 of the Act) the Commission

is not called upon a second time to defend its reasoning. Hence, the Commission is not

required to justify its reasoning a second time during the appeal process (they may be

called upon to do so during a Writ application, a point which will be discussed later in

this Order). In any event, this Court is empowered to call any records or documents

from the Commission, if necessary, as per Article 145 of the Constitution, hence the

9

RTI-05-22 Page 9 of 12 02/11/2023 IJ-34-23

Commission is not required to be made a party to the dispute in order to assist the

Court by providing necessary records or documents as averred by the Commission.

Moreover, the counsel for the intervenient petitioners has stated, that the Commission

seeks to intervene in the appeal process to ensure that, in the event of either party being

absent or unrepresented, the material facts of the case will be duly disclosed to the

court. In this regard, this Court is of the view that even if a party is absent or

unrepresented in the appeal process, the Commission is not expected to safeguard the

rights of such party, nor does this Court expect the Commission to defend the rights of

one party. This is in consideration of the fact that the Act expects the Commission to

maintain impartiality when the dispute is concerned. Further to this point, it would be

pertinent to add that the purpose of an appeal is to have an impartial and objective

review of the Commissions decision. Allowing the Commission to be a party could

introduce bias or a conflict of interest, making it challenging to ensure a fair and

independent review. Therefore, to ensure a seamless and unbiased review of the

Commissions decision by this Court as a higher forum tasked with providing an

objective review, the Commission is not required to be made a party to the appeal.

Moreover, the interpretation of the applicable provisions of the Act does not envision the

involvement of the Commission during the appeal process before this Court. According

to Section 34(1) of the Act, any party aggrieved by the decision of the Commission may

appeal to the Court of Appeal. Section 34 (1) stipulates that: (1) A citizen or public

authority who is aggrieved by the decision of the Commission made under section 32,

may appeal against such decision to the Court of Appeal within one month of the date on

which such decision was communicated to such citizen or public authority.

Thus, according to the procedure laid down in the Act, any party aggrieved by the

Commissions decision may make an appeal application to this Court. That is to say,

either the aggrieved Public Authority or the Appellant who requested the information

may appeal to the Court of Appeal. However, this process as envisioned under Section

34 of the Act does not require the Commission to be made a party to the dispute.

It is further noted by this Court that Section 11 of the Act has awarded the Commission

a legal personality that can sue and be sued in its corporate name. However, this does

10

RTI-05-22 Page 10 of 12 02/11/2023 IJ-34-23

not imply that it is mandatory to make the Commission a party to every appeal filed

against its order. Therefore, since an appeal filed under Section 34(1) of the Act does

not require or provide for the active participation of the Commission in an appeal

process, the Commission is not required to intervene in an appeal process. Moreover, if

such an application is allowed, it will subvert the general practice concerning appeal

mechanisms established under other areas of law such as Tax appeals and similar

appeals where neither the Tax Appeal Commission nor the such authority is named as

a party.

Consequently, this Court opines that, as per the prevailing legal framework, there exists

no mandate necessitating the Commission to be added as a party to the appellate

proceedings. Instead, the Commission may be added as a party for the sole purpose of

receiving notice of said appeal, without entitlement or obligation for active participation

in the appellate process, which is not mandatory.

At this juncture, this Court takes note of the nature of the application itself to decide

that the intervention of the Commission in this appeal process is unnecessary. In order

to elaborate this point, one could refer to the distinction between an appeal process and

the process involved in a writ application.

An appeal is a legal process where a higher court reviews a decision made by a lower

court or judicial body. This process is governed by statutes or laws that outline the

procedures for challenging a decision. In an appeal, the parties involved in the original

case (e.g., plaintiff and defendant) are typically the parties in the appeal. The higher

court reviews the case based on errors in law, procedure, or application of facts. Writ

jurisdiction, on the other hand, involves the ability of a higher court to issue writs, such

as mandamus, certiorari, habeas corpus, quo warranto, or prohibition. The purpose of

a writ is to ensure that justice is served and that the lower authority acts within the

bounds of its jurisdiction and follows the correct legal procedures.

The appeal primarily involves the parties from the original case. However, in writ

jurisdiction, the judicial institution becomes a party to the application, as the writ is

directly addressed to the institution or the individual exercising authority, seeking to

correct any procedural mistake or jurisdictional error. Further, in response to an appeal,

11

RTI-05-22 Page 11 of 12 02/11/2023 IJ-34-23

the lower court, as well as the appellant (the party responding to the appeal), can file

their respective briefs with the higher court. These briefs allow the lower court to explain

and defend their decision, providing additional rationale, legal interpretations, and

factual context for the conclusions reached in the original case. The higher court, during

the appeal process, considers these briefs, reviews the lower court's decision and

assesses the arguments presented by both parties. The purpose of this review is to

ensure that the lower court applied the law correctly, followed proper legal procedures,

and arrived at a just and sound conclusion based on the evidence and law presented

during the original case.

Having thus set out the distinct qualities of an appeal process when compared to a writ

application it is the considered view of this Court that in the case of the former, the

judicial institution that made the impugned decision may not necessarily be a party to

the appeal. Therefore, considering the duty of a judicial institution to remain impartial

upon delivering a decision and the duty to allow a higher forum to objectively review

such decision, it is further affirmed that the Commission is not required to defend or

justify its own decision consequent to such decision being appealed in a higher forum.

It is further observed by this Court that making the Commission a party to this appeal

process would lead to lax efficiency and failure to streamline the appeal process. It would

lead to inefficiencies, increased legal costs, and delays in the resolution of the case. The

focus should remain on the legal issues and arguments presented by the original

parties, without involving additional entities. Moreover, this would result in an

additional financial burden on the Commission and the parties. The responsibility for

defending the Commissions decision rests with the parties involved in the original

appeal to the Commission. Allowing the Commission to be a party would shift this

burden and responsibility, disrupting the natural allocation of roles in the legal process.

Furthermore, this Court takes note of the adversarial system followed in Sri Lanka. The

spirit of such a legal system lies in providing the parties involved in a dispute with a

platform to present their respective arguments before an impartial judicial institution.

Therefore, making the Commission a party would disrupt this adversarial system as the

Commissions role is to render a decision based on the arguments/documents presented

12

RTI-05-22 Page 12 of 12 02/11/2023 IJ-34-23

by the actual parties to the case. In summary, maintaining a clear separation between

the parties to the original case and the Commission in the appeal process helps uphold

the adversarial system, preserves the hierarchical structure of the judiciary, ensures an

objective review, promotes efficiency, and allocates responsibilities appropriately.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this Court finds that in appeals filed under Section 34(1) of the Act,

naming the commission as a respondent is not mandatory. Even if any party chooses to

involve the Commission as a party, it should be limited to providing notice of such an

appeal. The law does not mandate or grant the Commission the right to be added as a

party to file objections and defend its own decision.

Therefore, in the present application, where the Commission seeks to intervene and be

added as a party to file objections, it is the considered view of this Court that such an

application cannot be allowed.

Intervention application is dismissed.
