This is a revision application filed by the registered owner claimant appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the appellant) to revise and set aside the order dated

07.10.2015, delivered by the Provincial High Court of the Sabaragamuwa

Province holden in Rathnapura which ordered the confiscation of a lorry bearing

the registration number UP-LE-4552 which was employed in transporting

cannabis, thereby acting in contravention of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance as amended (hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance).

The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The accused, one Sarath Rathnayake,

who is the driver employed by the appellant has transported 45 Kilograms of

Cannabis in the aforementioned vehicle which is the subject matter of this appeal

and was charged with an offence under the Ordinance. The accused pleaded

guilty to the charges on the 25.08.2010 and upon conviction of the accused, the

vehicle was forfeited in line with Section 79 of the Ordinance. The instant appeal

is against the order of the learned High Court Judge which issued the

confiscation of the said vehicle.

In quoting the relevant law, Section 79 of the Act, as amended, can be reproduced

as follows:

(1) Where any person is convicted of an offence against this Ordinance or

any regulation made thereunder the court shall order that all or any articles

in respect of which the offence was committed and any boat, vessel, vehicle,

aircraft or airborne craft or equipment which has been used for the

conveyance of such article shall, by reason of such conviction, be forfeited

to the State. (2) Any property forfeited to the State under subsection (1) shall

(a) if no appeal has been preferred to the Court of Appeal against the

relevant conviction, vest absolutely in the State with effect from the date on

which the period prescribed for preferring an appeal against such conviction

expires;

4

CA-PHC-0158-15 Page 4 of 8 24/01/2023 IJ-02-23

(b) if an appeal has been preferred to the Court of Appeal against the

relevant conviction, vest absolutely in the State with effect from the date on

which such conviction is affirmed on appeal.

Literally, Section 79 automatically comes into operation in the event of an offence

being committed in contravention of the law promulgated in the Ordinance. In

this instant scenario, the application of Section 79 is triggered because the

vehicle in question has been used to transport cannabis which is an illegal and

an illicit activity, committed in contravention of the law, thereby the court is

empowered to forfeit the said vehicle according to the powers bestowed therein.

It is pertinent to note that Section 79 does not provide for the release of the vehicle

upon satisfaction of the Court of the owners innocence in the said offence. This

is contrary to the laws promulgated in the Forest Ordinance, Flora and Fauna

Act and the Animals Act where the release of a vehicle is enabled where the

criterion to prove innocence on the part of the owner of the vehicle is established.

Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance, as amended by the Forest (Amendment) Act

No.65 of 2009 provides that a vehicle owner has the burden of proving before a

court, on a balance of probability, that s/he has taken all the necessary

precautions to prevent the commission of any illegal activities by engaging

his/her vehicle. The Forest Ordinance following the amendment has cast a

burden on the owner of a vehicle to claim the vehicle in the event of a confiscation

by proving to the satisfaction of the court that when perusing the adduced

evidence, s/he has taken all the necessary precautions as a reasonable registered

owner of a vehicle to prevent the commission of any offences with the employment

of the vehicle.

Similarly, under Section 3A of the Animals Act, there is a burden cast upon the

registered owner of a vehicle to prove to the satisfaction of the court, on a balance

of probability, that s/he as the registered owner of a vehicle has taken all

necessary precautions to prevent any illegal activities from being committed with

the use of the vehicle or to prove that s/he had no knowledge of the said vehicle

being engaged in illegal activities. The difference between the aforementioned

burden cast by the Forest Ordinance and the Animals Act is that the latter

5

CA-PHC-0158-15 Page 5 of 8 24/01/2023 IJ-02-23

provides for a choice between either proving that necessary precautions were

taken or that there was no knowledge of the offence being committed. Similarly,

yet minutely different stance is adopted by the Fauna and Flora Protection Act

no. 22 of 2009, where under Section 54 of the Act, Section 64 of the principal

enactment is amended to hold that where an owner of a vehicle proves to the

court on a balance of probability that s/he has exercised all due diligence to

prevent the use of the vehicle in any offences, the burden casted therein shall be

dispensed.

However, section 79 of the Act does not cast such a burden upon the registered

owner of vehicle where the application of Section 79 is automatically triggered

wherever, any offence is committed with the use of the vehicle. Therefore, the

learned Deputy Solicitor General stance that the appellant has not taken the

necessary precautions to prevent the commission of an offence by using the

vehicle, does not have any legal grounding as such a burden is not casted on the

owner by the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Thus, the

contention of the learned D.S.G in this regard is not acceptable. This Court

decided in CA-PHC-119-18 C.A Minute dated 15.03 2022 In the absence of any

amending law to the Excise Ordinance, the principles enunciated by early case law

under the Excise Ordinance must be used as guidance. Importation of principles

from different laws must be discouraged. It has always been accepted as axiomatic

that judges administer justice according to the prevailing law of the land. As His

Lordship Justice Maartensz observed in Alice Kothalawala Vs. W.H. Perera and

another (1937)1 CLJ 58 p Justice must be done according to law. If hardship

results from the law in force the remedy must be affected by legislation. There

would be chaos if a judge was entitled to create a procedure to meet the exigencies

of every case in which he considers the law would work injustice.

Nonetheless, even though the law stipulated under Section 79 does not provide

for an opportunity to the registered owner a vehicle to establish on a balance of

probability that s/he is not a party to the offence and therefore by reason of his

innocence to have his/her vehicle released to the owner, Nonetheless, the law

still enables a party to establish his/her innocence on a balance of probability

before the court through the application of principles of Natural Justice.

6

CA-PHC-0158-15 Page 6 of 8 24/01/2023 IJ-02-23

It is settled law that in any vehicle inquiry, the principles of Natural Justice must

be applied to give the parties a fair opportunity to be heard and to show cause as

to why his/her vehicle should not be confiscated as every person has natural

rights over their property and such rights cannot be denied to a person without

giving him the opportunity to show cause against such order made. Even in

instances where such a stance is not couched within the applicable law, the

principles of natural justice do come into operation where a persons rights to

ones property is in question. This position of the law is further cemented by the

observations made by Justice Nagalingam, in Rasiah v Tambirajah 53 NLR

574, where it was held that:

It is one of the fundamentals of administration of justice that a person

should not be deprived either of his liberty or of his property without an

opportunity being given to him to show cause against such an order being

madeI think if the owner can show that the offence was committed without

his knowledge and without his participation in the slightest degree justice

would seem to demand that he should be restored his property

Therefore, the owner of a vehicle must be given an opportunity to prove on a

balance of probability to the satisfaction of the court that:

1. S/he is not the accused of the said offence.

2. Her/His ownership to the vehicle

3. S/he has in no way abetted, condoned, commissioned or directly or

indirectly involved in committing any illicit or illegal activities with the

employment of the vehicle.

4. S/he had no knowledge of the offence being committed or the employment

of the vehicle and its space for any illegal illicit activities.

As such, although no burden has been casted upon the registered owner of a

vehicle by the Act, the principles of Natural Justice come into operation to give

the parties an opportunity to prove his/her innocence, based on the natural

entitlements of a person to his or her property.

The primary contention of the appellant is that the learned High Court judge has

failed to consider the evidence which, as purported by the appellant, manifests

7

CA-PHC-0158-15 Page 7 of 8 24/01/2023 IJ-02-23

the appellants lack of involvement in the said offence. The appellant further

contends that she has taken all the necessary precautions in order to ensure that

the vehicle will not be employed in illegal or illicit activities and that she did not

bear any knowledge of the commission of the said offence as evinced through the

evidence submitted before the Court.

The aforementioned averments of the appellant resonate with Section 40 of the

Forest Ordinance, where the proviso to the Section enables the registered owner

of a vehicle to establish his innocence in the said offence by proving with the

adduced evidence, that s/he did not have any knowledge of the offence committed

and that s/he has taken all the necessary precautions to prevent the commission

of any offence.

Although as elaborated above, such a burden need not be dispensed as such is

not required by the law promulgated in Section 79. However, according to the

principles of Natural Justice the claim to her vehicle ownership and her

innocence in the event has to be proved on a balance of probability, to the

satisfaction of the court, to warrant a release of her vehicle.

In perusing the adduced evidence, the ownership of the vehicle is sufficiently

established as the appellant is the registered owner of the vehicle, however with

regards to her claims of lack of knowledge and little to no involvement in the

offence cannot be sufficiently proved in looking in to the accurate observations

made by the learned High Court Judge in his analysis of the evidence. The learned

High Court Judge has observed that the appellant, albeit, claims to have no

knowledge of the offence committed, when questioned on the use of the concealed

compartment of the lorry, has provided that the concealed space was used to

transport chicken and eggs though it was not a cooling compartment. The learned

High Court judge has thoroughly ruminated over this fact and has observed that

it manifests dishonesty on the part of the owner for the transportation of chicken

and eggs while transporting other goods like sand on the lorry strikes as an odd

combination and an impractical use for the compartment. Therefore, it was the

observation of the learned High Court judge that the appellants averments on

the said use for the compartment cannot be accepted before the court as it does

not show honesty on the part of the appellant.

8

CA-PHC-0158-15 Page 8 of 8 24/01/2023 IJ-02-23

This Court affirms the observation of the learned High Court Judge and in

furtherance to the above observation, states that the appellant, in any case has

not proved to the satisfaction of the court that she had no knowledge and had no

involvement in the said offence as she has not provided any reasonable

explanation to convince this court of her innocence. The nature and the

purported use of the concealed compartment suggests that the appellant should

have, as a reasonable owner of a vehicle, inquired more and be vigilant with

regards to the use of the concealed space of her lorry and as she has not acted

accordingly, this Court is not convinced of her innocence in the event. Therefore,

such a lackadaisical attitude coupled with her improbable explanation of the use

of the concealed compartment, fails to prove on a balance of probability, to the

satisfaction of the court that she indeed had no knowledge and no involvement

whatsoever in the said offence.

Therefore, this Court observes that the learned High Court Judge has correctly

ordered the confiscation of the vehicle based on an accurate analysis of the

evidence and this Court affirms the same. Accordingly, we see no reason to

interfere with the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 07.10.2015.

The application is hereby dismissed without costs.
