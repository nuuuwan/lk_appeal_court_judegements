The facts of the case briefly are as follows;

The Petitioner commenced a business under the name of Rasanjana Beer Shop from 1999. She

alleges that she had obtained an FL/22A license which is valid for a period of one year and had

been carrying on business till August 2014 after annually renewing her license. Thereafter she

had been informed of a public objection to the continuation of the business which prompted her

to seek permission to shift the premises. It is the contention of the Petitioner that the said request

to shift the business premises was done at the behest of the 3rd Respondent without any inquiry.

Subsequently, an inquiry was held which resulted in her license being suspended. This was due

to the Petitioner failing to find a new location, her liquor shop had been closed with effect from

31.07.14. Hence this application.

The complaint of the Petitioner.

The Petitioner alleges that the decision to suspend her license and the refusal of her application

to shift the business to a new place is unreasonable, unfair arbitrary, and ultra vires.

The Petitioner had sought the following reliefs from this Court,

4

f) Grant a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 3 rd

Respondent in the letter marked as P-5

b) Grant a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions of the 1st

Respondent in the letter marked as P-8A

c) Grant a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions of the 7th

Respondent in the letter marked as P-8B

d) Grant a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions of the 1st

Respondent in the letter marked as P-11B

e) Grant a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus on one or more or all of the 1st and 4th

Respondents to 8th Respondents directing them to allow the Petitioner to renew her license from

1st January 2015 to 31st December 2015 and either allow her to continue her business at the venue

at No. 81B, Dutuwewa or at the proposed venue at Ellawea Road, Kokawewa, Gatalewa.

It is common ground that the Petitioner was holding an Fl/22A liquor license which had to be

renewed annually. It is also common ground that the Petitioner had made an application to shift

the location of the business.

The Respondents raised several preliminary objections pertaining to the maintainability of this

application. They are as follows,

The Petitioner is guilty of suppression and misrepresentation of facts.

The Petitioner has acquiesced with the impugned decision and therefore cannot now be

heard to complain.

The entire application is misconceived in law.

Undue delay.

This Court will consider the said objections.

The Petitioner had originally obtained the license to operate the business for the year April 1999

to 31st December 1999 (P3). It is the contention of the Petitioner that she had continued with the

said business till the year 2014. However, the Petitioner submits that the 3rd Respondent had

5

informed her to shift her present business place due to public protests in the year 2012. It was

further submitted by the Petitioner, that for 13 long years the Petitioner had carried out the

business without any objection from the people of the Dutuwewa area. It was contended that she

had received 6 months time to shift her business by letter dated 10.01.2012 (P5). It was further

argued by the Petitioner, that there had been no hearing given to her before the decision in P5

had been reached. Thus, making the said decision bad in law.

It was the contention of the Petitioner, that she has continued with her business without any

disturbance up to the year 2014 and submitted that in the said year, a group of people had staged

a protest against her liquor shop, and submitted that the protest had been organized against the

Petitioner only after 13 years of opening her shop.

In response, the Respondents submitted to Court, that there had been several objections

presented by Ekabadda Swechcha Balamandalaya in the year 2011. Written objections had

been submitted to the District Secretary of Anuradhapura and to the Hon. President of Sri Lanka

(R1, R2). In the said complaints, it is stated that the school children had got used to consuming

beer and the parents are compelled to clean the school grounds of the empty beer cans. Further, a

public protest had been organized on the 4th of July 2011, against the Petitioners liquor shop.

The said protest had gathered a large number of people and had been reported in a daily

newspaper on 06th July 2011 (R3). As a result of the protest, the Divisional Secretary of

Galenbindunuwewa called for an inquiry in the year 2011(R4). The said letter had been

addressed to the objectors as well as to the Petitioner. The said report of the inquiry was marked

as R5. As per the report, an agent of the Petitioner had taken part in the inquiry. According to

the recommendations of the report, the inquiring officer had come to the finding that the protest

was a result of neglect and failure to give due consideration to the issues that had arisen as a

result of the existence of the beer shop for a long time. At the said inquiry, the permit holder had

given her consent to use her employees to clear the environment surrounding her shop by

collecting and disposing of empty beer bottles and cans. Thus, admitting that there had been

consumption of liquor in the vicinity of the shop.

6

However, as the Petitioner had been having the beer shop for years in the present location despite

the objection of the community, it had been recommended to shift the said business to a suitable

location. This resulted in the Petitioner receiving the letter dated 10.01.12 (P5), whereby the

Petitioner had been given 6 months to find an alternative location. This Court also observes, the

Petitioner has failed to demonstrate to this Court that she had objected to the decision marked in

P5 at the time it was made, as she has failed to demonstrate of such objection or of any

documentary proof of such an objection. The Petitioner had not challenged this decision and for

the first time has sought to challenge this decision in this application by seeking a writ of

certiorari to quash the said decision. It is observed by this Court, that the Petitioner had finally

sought to quash this decision only after a lapse of two years and three months. This clearly

demonstrates laches on the part of the Petitioner. Thus, in our view, prayer (f) of the Petitioner

has to fail due to undue delay.

The Petitioner had subsequently sent a letter dated 23.05.12 (R3) where it is apparent that,

subject to her being asked to shift the location of the beer shop, she had been given the license

only for a period of six months for the year 2012. By the said letter, the Petitioner had requested

for her to be given the license for the remaining six months of the year as she had failed to find a

suitable site for relocation. As contended by the Respondents, this letter demonstrates that the

Petitioner had acquiesced to the decision in P5 as she had attempted to find a suitable place for

relocation. This letter does not demonstrate that she had made the request for shifting the

premises under protest. This request of the Petitioner had been accommodated by the 1st

Respondent by letter dated 21.06.12 (R7) where her license had been extended till 30.09.12. As

per the documents tendered to this Court, it appears that the Petitioner had failed to relocate but

had been continuing with her business in the same location till the year 2013 despite the public

protest. This resulted in the Respondents sending the letter dated 27.06.13 (P6), whereby the 1st

Respondent had informed that the Petitioners permit would not be extended any further. The

Petitioner had failed to challenge this letter too. The sequence of these events clearly

demonstrates that the decision to request the Petitioner to shift her premises had not been taken

suddenly and arbitrarily as contemplated by the Petitioner. Due to the public protest, there had

been an inquiry, to which all relevant parties including the Petitioner had been summoned and

the Petitioners representative had been present. Further as stated earlier, the Petitioner without

7

challenging the decision to relocate had acquiesced to the decision and requested time to

relocate.

However, it appears that the Petitioner had carried on her business at the same location till the

year 2014 despite the ongoing protest as evident by the letters dated 07.06.14 (R8) and 10.06.14

(P7) which had resulted in another protest being staged by the public. This resulted in another

inquiry being held as evident by letter 18.6.14 (P7A) where all relevant stakeholders had been

summoned once again. The said inquiry had been held on 02.07.14 (R10). At the said inquiry,

the Petitioners statement had been recorded and in the said statement she had once again

voluntarily agreed to shift the said premises. Her statement reads as follows,

. 2014 31

.

.

.

.

. 31

.

2014.07.31

. .

.

The Petitioner has not challenged the authenticity or the circumstances of giving this statement.

Subsequent to this inquiry, the inquiring officer has submitted his report dated 03.07.14 (R11),

where he had observed,

(a) 2014.07.31

. 2014.07.31

.

24

.

05 .

23,25,26,27,28 .

(b)

.

Once again, the inquiring officer had recommended shifting the premises of the business. At the

end of the inquiry report, there is a handwritten endorsement by the Superintendent of Excise

where it says the Petitioner had agreed to shift the business premises before 31.07.14. The said

endorsement reads as follows;

2014.07.02 . ,

. 81/B, 40 - , ,

(..22 ) , 2014 .07.31

.

All these documents clearly establish that the Petitioner not only has acquiesced with the original

decision to relocate but had subsequently on her own made an application to shift her business

and relocate it to a suitable location. This is a clear contradiction to the arguments made,

whereby it was submitted that the Petitioner had been forced to relocate her premises without

giving her a hearing. In this instance, this Court finds that the Petitioner has after acquiescing the

decision to shift and subsequently giving an undertaking on her own to shift the premises, sought

to challenge the same decision she had agreed upon.

This Court also observes that the Petitioner had not submitted any material to demonstrate that

she had taken part in the inquiry under protest. The Petitioner has also not explained to the

satisfaction of this Court, as to her own undertaking to shift the premises to which the license

was issued. In the absence of such, this Court holds that Respondents objection on acquiescence

succeeds.

In this instance, we take the guidance of the courts decisions in the case of Collettes Limited V.

Bank of Ceylon (1984) 2 SLR 288, "If a man, either by words or by conduct has intimated

that he consents to an act which has been done, and that he will offer no opposition to it,

although it could not have been lawfully done without his consent, and he thereby induces

others to do that from which they otherwise might have abstained, he cannot question the

legality of the act he has so sanctioned, to the prejudice of those who have so given faith to his

words or to the fair inference to be drawn from his conduct . . . I am of the opinion that,

generally speaking, if a party having an interest to prevent an act being done has full notice of

its having been done, and acquiesces in it, so as to induce a reasonable belief that he consents

to it, and the position of others is altered by their giving credit to his sincerity, he has no more

right to challenge the act to their prejudice, than he would have had if it had been done by his

previous license" Per Lord Campbell, L.C. in Cairncross v. Lorimer. This passage was quoted

with approval by the Privy Council in Sarat Chunder Dey v. Gopal Chunder Laha.

10

In the case of Darley, Butler & Co v. Saheed NLR vol 12 pg 367 Waiver, like acquiescence,

pre-supposes that the person sought to be bound is fully cognizant of the facts when he does

the act by which he is to be affected.

It was the contention of the Respondents that as the public protest was gathering momentum, for

the preservation of peace, in agreement with all parties, the 1st Respondent had instructed the 7th

Respondent to allow the existing license given to the Petitioner to be allowed to be used only till

31.07.14 in the current premises and thereafter to close the said liquor store. Respondents further

contended that the said letter had been issued to preserve the peace with the consent of all

stakeholders as agreed at the inquiry held on 02.07.14 (P8A). The Divisional Secretary has

communicated this instruction he received to the Petitioner by the letter dated 21.07.14 (P8B).

As the suspension of the business had taken effect, the Petitioner on 2014. 10.30 had submitted a

fresh application to obtain a new license (P10A). It is pertinent to note that in the said

application, there is an entry that states, the Petitioner had voluntarily closed her business due to

a public protest and until it is shifted to another location.

The learned Counsel for the Respondents also brought to the attention of this Court, that as this is

an annual license, the Petitioners license which was suspended in 2015, is now expired as per

the Regulations. As per the submissions we observe, that the Petitioners existing license anyway

has expired and if the Petitioner wishes to obtain a license she will have to apply for a new

license.

Suppression of Facts

At this stage, this Court will consider the objection raised on suppression of material fact and

misrepresentation.

The Petitioner has failed to disclose to this Court, the existence of objections and the protest that

had taken place in the year 2011 until the Respondents submitted the same with documentary

evidence through their objections. In fact, the Petitioners main contention was that they had

carried on with this business till the year 2014 without any disturbance.

11

Para 10 of the Petitioners affidavit states as follows;

I state that for approximately more than 13 years I continued my business without any objection

from the people of Dutuwewa area and especially the religious community of the area. At the

argument, it was submitted that till she received the letter on 10th January 2012 (P5) there was no

public protest against her business.

In view of the documents R1, R2 & R3 this is a serious misrepresentation and suppression of

facts by the Petitioner. The Petitioners main contention before this Court is that she had been

asked to shift her premises of business without any public protest but at the behest of the

Divisional Secretary Galenbindunuwewa. For the reasons best known to the Petitioner, she had

suppressed a material fact, that there had been objections by the public against her beer shop and

that there have been demonstrations as reflected in R3. The Petitioner has failed to submit that

she had participated in the inquiry and also there had been decisions taken. In our view, this is a

serious suppression of material facts.

It is also pertinent to note that the Petitioners entire argument based on not giving a fair hearing

before asking to shift the premises fails, in view of non-disclosed facts namely the existence of

documents R1, R2, R3, and R11. Thus, in view of these documents, this Court agrees with the

Respondents objection on misrepresentation too.

In Biso Menika Vs Cyril De Alwis & others 1982 (1) SLR 368 it was held A person who

applies for the extra-ordinary remedy of writ must come with clean hands and must not

suppress any relevant facts from Court. He must refrain from making any misleading

statements to Court. The importance of coming to court with clean hands was recently stressed

in Orient Pearl Hotels vs Cey Nor-Foundation Limited & others CA Writ 226/2018 decided

on 02.08.2021 where it was held It is settled law that a party seeking prerogative relief should

come to court with clean hands. The expression is derived from one of equitys maxims He

who comes to Equity must come with clean hands.

In our judicial history, there are a plethora of judgments stating from Alphonsu Appuhami Vs.

Hettiarachchi 77 NLR 131, Dahanayaka and others vs. Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation

LTD and others (2005) 1 SLR 67, Fonseka Vs. Lt. General Jagath Jayasuriya (2011) 2 SLR

372 where our Courts have constantly held that if there was suppression, misrepresentation and

12

the lack of uberrima fides would warrant the dismissal of a writ application without hearing on

the merits of the case.

In Namunukula Plantation Limited vs. Minster of Land and Others SC Appeal No.

46/2008, decided on 13/03/2012 it was held as follows; if any party invoking the discretionary

jurisdiction of a Court of law is found wanting in the discharge of its duty to disclose all

material facts, or is shown to have attempted to pollute the pure stream of justice, the Court

not only has the right but a duty to deny relief to such person.

It is trite law that the Petitioner who seeks a remedy in equity should come to court with clean

hands. The failure would result in her own actions disqualifying her of the relief she is seeking

by way of prerogative writs. In view of the above finding, on suppression alone, this Court need

not go into the merits of this case.

Accordingly, for the aforesaid reasons, this Court is not inclined to grant the reliefs prayed by the

Petitioner and this application stands dismissed without costs. However, this determination will

not be a bar for the Petitioner to apply for a fresh license and for the 1st Respondent to give a

determination according to law.
