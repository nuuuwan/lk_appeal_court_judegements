JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing the offence

as mentioned below.

On or about the 15th January 2005 in Maithreegama the accused-Appellant

committed the murder of Dingiri Bandage Kusumawathie which is an offence

punishable under Section 296 of Penal Code.

As the Appellant opted for a jury trial, the trial commenced before a jury. The

prosecution had led thirteen witnesses and marked production P1-8 and

closed the case. The Learned High Court Judge having satisfied that evidence

presented by the prosecution warrant a case to answer, called for the defence

and explained the rights of the accused. Having selected the right to make a

statement from the dock, the Appellant had proceeded to deny the charge by

way of his dock statement.

After the summing up, the jury retired for deliberation and returned the

verdict of guilty to the charge of murder with a 6:1 majority decision. The

Learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant as charged and

sentenced him to death on 05/12/2016.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

3 | P a g e

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. At the hearing the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

In his solitary ground of appeal, the Appellant contends whether the DNA

evidence was sufficient to convict the Appellant for the charge of murder.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

In this case no direct evidence is available but the case rests on

circumstantial evidence, especially on the DNA evidence.

PW4 Soma Ranatunga was a neighbour of the deceased at the time of the

incident. On the day of the incident, the Appellant also was also a neighbour

of the deceased, had come to her house as usual and left in about ten

minutes time. After his departure, at about 7.00 p.m. the deceased had come

to PW4s house to give some fish curry which she had cooked. After some

time, she went back home. At about 10.00 p.m. she had heard cries similar

to a child from the direction of the deceaseds house. The witness, her

husband and her son came out to check who was crying. This witnesss

husband had called the Appellants father also to the scene. As the shouting

ceased, the Appellants parents had gone to inform this unusual happening

to the deceaseds daughter as she was living alone in her house. According

to her evidence the Appellant was not present at the scene at that time.

According to PW6 Wagirasena, one of the daughters of the deceased, when

she was at home on the date of the incident, at about 9.30 p.m. the

Appellants father had come and informed about the cries heard from the

deceaseds house. Immediately she had gone with the Appellants father to

check with her mother. When she went to her mothers house, she had seen

her deceased mother was lying on the bed. When she called her mother and

touched her body, she had realized that her mother had passed away

4 | P a g e

already. Other witnesses and village people also arrived there and the

message was sent to the police.

According to PW6, the Appellant was not in good terms with the deceased as

the deceased had told this witness that the Appellant had resisted her

decision to clean the rear side of the land.

Police officers from Galenbindunuwewa Police Station had arrived at the

scene of crime at about 3.00 a.m. and conducted the inquiry.

PW14 Damitha Perera was the Officer-in-Charge of Galenbindunuwewa

Police Station. He too arrived the scene and conducted investigation. A small

knife was recovered under the body of the deceased. As per the information

received, he arrested the Appellant at his resident at about 5.30 a.m. At the

time of the arrest, the Appellant was wearing a white coloured short sleeve

shirt and a pair of shorts. A blood like stain was found on the shirt of the

Appellant. This witness had noticed fresh cut injuries on the thumb finger of

left hand and on third finger of the right hand. The shirt and the short were

handed over to reserve police officer on duty on that day under production

No.45/05.

All the witnesses who had come to the scene of crime on that day said that

the Appellant was not to be seen there until he was arrested by the police at

5.30 a.m.

According to the JMO who held the post mortem, the deceased had died due

to constriction of neck due to manual strangulation. He further opined that

the few cut injuries which were found on the body which were not sufficient

to cause death, but they were suggestive of struggle with the assailant and

attempts of defence.

The Appellant had made a dock statement after the closure of the

prosecution case. According to him, hearing the cries of the deceaseds

daughter, he had gone to the deceaseds house which is situated very close

to his house. He went to the room where the deceased was lying and

5 | P a g e

examined the deceased whether she was dead or alive. After attending

necessary work at the deceaseds house, went home at around 2.30 a.m. as

he felt sleepy.

The Appellant had not put the stance he had taken in his dock statement to

any of the prosecution witnesses. All the witnesses had stated that he was

not at the scene until he was arrested by the police. According to the police

evidence, they had reached the place of crime at about 3.00 a.m.

The Appellant in his only ground of appeal contends that relying on the DNA

evidence has caused great prejudiced to him. He further contends that the

whole case for the prosecution based on DNA evidence which is at best can

only be considered as mere expert evidence and cannot be considered as

conclusive evidence especially in the absence of other probative evidence.

In this case, the white coloured short sleeve shirt of the Appellant and the

blood sample obtained from the deceaseds body had been sent for DNA

analysis. Upon a court order being issued, the Genetech Institution had

conducted the DNA test and submitted their findings to the court. According

to the report dated 23/09/2010 under reference No. GC981/01/03/2010,

the results of the DNA test established that the biological material contained

in the tested stains on the white colour short sleeve shirt marked as P1

originated from the individual whose biological material was on the gauze

swabs marked as P2.

PW15 who prepared the DNA report under the court order had given

comprehensive evidence as to the applicability and accuracy of a DNA report

in a criminal case. The said DNA report was marked as P4 by the

prosecution.

This witness was cross examined regarding the accuracy of the report by the

defence. In this case, the items subjected for DNA analysis had been handed

over to court on 27/01/2005. But the said productions were sent to

Genetech on 01/03/2010, after about five years. Answering to court PW15

6 | P a g e

had said that if correct procedure had followed the DNA could stay more than

five years on any production.

The use of DNA evidence in the criminal justice system has been regarded

by scholars as probably the greatest forensic advancement since the advent

of fingerprinting.

In The Attorney General v. M. N. Naufer alias Potta Naufer and Others

[2007] 2 SLR 144 the court held that:

An individuals genetic constitution is unique in so much as there are no

two individuals who have the same DNA. By analysing DNA of an

individual, it is possible to say that the chances of finding another person

with matching DNA is less than one in a trillion. This is analogous to

hand finger printing techniques and that is why DNA finger printing has

received the degree of acceptability which is similar to hand

fingerprinting in courts the world over.

DNA evidence has now been accepted by our courts as a science upon which

expert evidence could be led in terms of Section 45 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

Section 45 of the Evidence Ordinance states:

When the Court has to form an opinion as to foreign law, or of science, or

art, or as to identity or genuineness of handwriting or finger impressions,

palm impressions or foot impressions, the opinions upon that point of

persons specially skilled in such foreign law, science, or art, or in questions

as to identity or genuineness of handwriting or finger impressions, palm

impressions or foot impressions, are relevant facts.

How that expert evidence should be considered by a trial judge is discussed

in several decided cases in our criminal justice system.

7 | P a g e

In Mark Antony Fernando v. AG CA/84/97 decided on 08/10/1998 the

court held that:

the judge has to decide () whether there was a very great antecedent

probability of the injury resulting in death as opposed to a mere likelihood.

That function cannot be delegated to the expert. The judge is expected to

decide this issue assisted by the evidence of the expert but independently of

the opinion expressed by the expert.

PW15 Dr. Ruwan J. Illeperuma, an expert in DNA Technology elaborates in

his article titled DNA, THE BIOLOGICAL TOOL FOR CRIME

INVESTIGATION IN SRI LANKA as follows:

Because each persons DNA is different from that of every other

individual (except for identical twins) examining variations in genetic

material among human individuals, by DNA technology is the most

powerful method for accurate human identification. DNA can be

isolated from a number of biological samples, such as hair, saliva,

blood, bone, teeth etc. The technology currently being applied is so

sensitive that even a miniscule amount of bodily fluid or tissue can yield

accurate DNA information. Therefore, this technology has a wide

application in identifying perpetrators of crime and in confirming

familial relationships of humans. (..). The level of accuracy achievable

guarantees absolutely no risk of convicting the wrong person and

thereby establishing the innocence of those wrongly convicted.

Therefore, an expert in DNA analysis plays a vital role in criminal cases. As

in this case, their expert knowledge might help prosecuting authorities to

identify the person against whom criminal charges should be filed. Their

opinions are also very helpful to the court in properly adjudicating of the

case.

8 | P a g e

As the Learned High Court Judge had meticulously considered and

deliberated to the jury the acceptable evidence along with the DNA evidence

properly, I conclude that the ground of appeal also does not have any merit.

When analysing entirety of the evidence presented, the only irresistible and

inescapable conclusion that can be arrived with the proved items of

circumstantial evidence is that the Appellant had committed the murder of

the deceased.

Therefore, I conclude that the prosecution had proven the case against the

Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, I affirm the conviction and

sentence imposed on him by the Learned High Court Judge of

Anuradhapura.

Appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Anuradhapura along with the original case record.
