Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The issues involved in this case are identical to that of in Application bearing No.

CA/Writ/520/2021 and this Court delivering the order dated 09.12.2022 has already

refused the said Application No. CA/Writ/520/2021.

In 1995, the Petitioner of the instant Application has also toured to South Korea with the

Sri Lanka Mens National Volleyball team as a player and evaded returning to Sri Lanka.

As a result of such conduct, the Sri Lanka Volleyball Federation (Federation) by letter

dated 12.08.1998, marked P2, has suspended the Petitioner from taking part and/or

getting involved in any activities of the Federation for a period of 10 years from the date

of their return to Sri Lanka someday.

The said suspension was relaxed after by the Federation after some time.

By letter dated 25.04.2017, marked P6, the Petitioner was removed from the post of

Coach as he has acted in violation of Clause 4(s) of P5.

The Appeal against P6 submitted by the Petitioner was rejected on the basis that the

Appeal Committee was not empowered to examine the same in terms of the Sports

Regulations as it had been lodged against a decision taken almost 4 years ago.

impugned in CA Writ 520/2021. Therefore, based on the reasons given in the order dated

Application is refused.
