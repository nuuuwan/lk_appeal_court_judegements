No evidence had been led regarding the value of the jewelry and money that was robbed. According to the indictment it had been stated that the value of all that had been robbed was Rs. 578,300/- but, the prosecution had failed to prove the amount through evidence. Owing to this, it is apparent that the elements of the offence of robbery had not been established by the prosecution in order to secure the conviction under section 380 of the Penal Code since this charge under robbery requires proof of theft in this instance. Thus, failure on the part of the prosecution to specify, identify and reveal the subject matter of the alleged robbery yet again put the case of the prosecution at stake. It had been held by the High Court of India in Biswanath Satpathy vs The State; AIR 1967 Ori 46, that the onus is with the prosecution to establish the identification of the recovered money or to adduce evidence showing that the recovered money belonged to the complainant. Counsel for all three accused-appellants opined that the dock statements of the accused-appellants had been rejected without giving proper reasons for doing so. All accused-appellants had denied their involvement in the robbery and had stated in their dock statements that they knew nothing about a robbery and that they were arrested at a bus stand in Kurunegala.",

A \"Dock Identification\" is a valid form of identification. However, time and again courts have been mindful of the dangers of convicting an accused solely based on 'dock identification. On page 256 in Volume 1 \"The Law of Evidence\" by E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, in the context of \"dock identification\", it is observed, \"This practice is undesirable and unsafe and should be avoided, if possible\". Court of Appeal in Munirathne & Others vs. The State, 2001 (2) SLR 382 observed the undesirability of conviction based on dock identification and in K.M.Premachandra & others vs. The Attorney-General, C.A. 39-41/97, decided on 13.10.1996, to set aside the conviction of one accused whose conviction was based on a dock identification. In Roshan vs. The Attorney-General, 2011 (1) SLR 364 at 377, held, .. in the backdrop of an acknowledged disparity in the complexion and appearance of the accused at the trial stage, the assailant being a total stranger to the complainant who had a mere 04-hour visual contact with the assailant, the evidence of subsequent dock identification several years later would not",
