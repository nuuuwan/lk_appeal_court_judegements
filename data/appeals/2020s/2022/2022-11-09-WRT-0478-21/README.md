Decided on : 09.11.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner is an employee of the 1st Respondent Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).

As per the statutory provisions which were applicable at the time of filing of this

application, the Petitioner was due to retire on 26.11.2022 upon completing 60 years.

While serving as the Chief Human Resources Manager of SLPA, the Petitioner has been

transferred, by virtue of the letter dated 23.09.2021, marked P27, to Mahapola Ports and

Maritime Academy (Academy) to serve as the Chief Training Manager with effect from

23.09.2021, on exigencies of service.

In the instant application the Petitioner is seeking, inter alia, for mandates in the nature of

Writs of Certiorari to quash the decision of one or more or all the 1st to 10th Respondents

to transfer Petitioner to the said Academy and to appoint her to the post of Chief Training

Manager.

Human Resources Circular No. 297.

The Petitioners main contention is that the said transfer is contrary to the current

employee transfer policy of SLPA which is set out in Human Resources Circular No. 297

dated 23.03.2021, marked P25. In view of the said Circular the employees who are due

to retire upon reaching the age of 60 years will be exempted from transfers during the two

years leading up to such retirement. Therefore, the Petitioner asserts that she shouldnt

have been transferred since she was due to retire on 26.11.2022.

The contention of the 1st to 13th Respondents (Respondents) with regard to the said

Circular, marked P25, is that only the non-executive grade employees would be subjected

to the said Circular and not the Petitioner who falls within the category of an executive

grade employee. According to the Respondents, the Petitioner does not belong to the

specific classes of executives to which P25 applies and only Rule 30(II) of the Manual of

Page 5 of 10

Administrative Procedure (R16) applies to executive employees who are not subjected to

P25.

On a careful perusal of the first paragraph of the said Circular P25 which is in the nature

of a preamble, it clearly indicates that the said Circular is applicable only to the non-

executive employees. Anyhow, the body of the Circular refers to certain categories of

executive officers. Whilst the first paragraph of P25 sets out the background, the sub-

paragraph (iii) & (v) of item No. 02 of the Circular refer to certain non-executive

employees. The Respondents sought in argument to explain the classes/grades of so-called

executives of the SLPA who are subjected to P25. This provides the context for an

assessment of the applicability of the Circular and to examine which category of

employees are subjected to the Circular.

The Manual of Administrative Procedure, marked R16, stipulates provisions for the

transfer of employees of SLPA. The Clause 30(II) provides that the employees can be

transferred between Divisions of SLPA by the Manager-Human Resources with the

concurrence of the Heads of Divisions/Units. It specifically provides that the prior

approval of the Chairman is necessary when transferring employees of Executive Grade.

The Clause 30(III) recognizes a category called graded employees and it stipulates that

such graded employees can be transferred only with the prior approval of the Chairman.

Similarly, the sub paragraph (v) of the item 02 of P25 refers to the executive officers of

the Administration sector who are in the level of JLM/MLM2 (presumably the Junior

Level Management/Medium Level Management). The executive officers referred to in

sub paragraph (iii) under the said item 02 are not from the Administration sector but from

the Divisions of Finance, Supply Service, Supply and Security etc. The said sub paragraph

(v) exclusively referred to the executive officers in the level of JLM/MLM2 and

accordingly, it reflects the fact that out of the executive officers of the Administrative

sector, only the officers in the level of JLM/MLM2 are subjected to P25. This clears

the ambiguity on the applicability of the Circular P25 to the Petitioner as it is undisputed

that the post assigned to the Petitioner falls within the level of SLM-1. It appears that the

level SLM-1 is common to all Heads of Divisions including the Petitioner who was holding

the post of Chief Human Resources Manager.

Page 6 of 10

Within the above framework, the Petitioner undoubtedly cannot be benefited by the

provisions in P25 pursuant to the grace period of two years prior to retirement. Even if I

am to presume that the procedure adopted by the Respondents was irregular by them

infiltrating certain categories of executive officers also into P25 which is on the face of

the record dedicated to non-executive employees, I will be compelled to accept the

Respondents argument based on the expressed exclusion of the executives in the SLM

category of the Administrative sector in P25.

Transfers on Exigencies of Service.

The label of exigencies of service is often used by employers as a rampart to safeguard

their decisions to transfer employees as they wish. The Circular P25 as well as the

Manual of Administrative Procedure (R16) enshrined with the words exigencies of

service. The Circular P25 emphatically articulates that the criterion prescribed in P25

are not applicable for transfers based on exigencies of service. What is disclosed in Clause

30(I) of R16 is that the employees are being transferred generally on exigency of service.

The impugned transfer order reflected in letter marked P27 has been issued on exigencies

of service based on the recommendations made by the transfer committee on 22.09.2021.

It is important to note that if the Respondents will be successful with their perspective in

regard to the ground for transferring the Petitioner, the aforesaid issue whether P25 is

applicable to the Petitioner would not arise at all. Then the question that arises is whether

an appropriate procedure has been followed when the SLPA transferred the Petitioner on

exigency of service.

In this regard, I need to draw my attention to the criteria adopted by the Public Service

Commission of Sri Lanka in transferring public officers on exigencies of service although

relevant regulations are not directly applicable to this case. The rationale followed therein

is utilitarian in examining the exigency claimed by the Respondents. The Rule 218 of the

Procedural Rules of Public Service Commission of Sri Lanka (published in Gazette

Extraordinary No. 1589/30 dated 20.02.2009);

A Public Officer may be transferred on exigencies of service by the Appointing

Authority for any one of the following reasons:

(i) Where the services of an officer is no longer needed at his present station;

Page 7 of 10

(ii) Where an officer is needed for service in another station or that particular

officer himself is needed;

(iii) Where it is found, due to administrative reasons, that the retention of an

officer in his present station is not suitable

The Managing Director of SLPA affirming an affidavit has submitted to this Court that

the post of Chief Training Manager and Deputy Chief Training Manager of the Academy,

have been vacant; and as such in order to ensure the smooth and efficient functioning of

the Academy and in light of the said 2 vacancies which have arisen in senior management

positions, the Management was urgently required to fill the said vacancy of the post of

Chief Training Manager. The said Managing Director further states that having

considered the Petitioners long-standing service, capabilities, experiences and leadership

during her tenure at the SLPA and in recognition of the same and also following the

recommendations of the Transfer Committee, the Petitioners transfer to the post of Chief

Training Officer was approved with effect from 23.09.2021.

The Petitioner has not raised a strong opposition to disbelieve the above contention of the

Managing Director. The Respondents, according to the material submitted to this Court,

have taken into consideration the seniority and the experience of the Petitioner when

taking the decision to transfer her. The transfer has not been made on grounds such as

discipline or incompetence. The Petitioner is liable to being posted to any Division/Unit

as per the terms of the letter of appointment. Thus, I am of the view that the above reasons

given by the Respondents can be taken as sufficient grounds to justify the exigencies of

service.

The capability of the Petitioner to hold the existing post.

Additionally, the Petitioner set out another argument based on the Scheme of

Recruitment, marked P28 that she has not fulfilled basic requirements and was not

eligible to be appointed to the post of Chief Training Manager. As opposed to such

assertions, the Respondents submit that the Scheme of Recruitment to the post of Chief

Training Manager, marked P28, is applicable to external applicants and not to transfers

within the Divisions of SLPA.

The attention of this Court was drawn to the Scheme of Recruitment for Top level Management;

including inter alia Chairman, Vice Chairman, Managing Director, Additional Managing Director,

Page 8 of 10

Directors and Heads of Divisions, marked R24, which is the applicable Scheme of

Recruitment according to the view point of the Respondents. The R24 under sub-heading

NOTE declares;

Applications are not invited to fill the above senior position in the permanent cadre and it is

purely a discretion of the Board of Directors to select a capable person for that post within the

cadre. If the Board of Directors observes the capability, experience and leadership of in house

officer are insufficient, external recruitments could be considered in terms of approved S/R of

HOD first category. Canvassing for the post is a disqualification.

The Respondents reliance on the contents of R24 indicates that the Chief Training

Manager should be considered as a head of a Division. It is observed that the position the

Petitioner was holding immediately prior to the transfer as a head of a Division and also

the emoluments relating to the said post have not been changed or substituted due to the

impugned decision reflected in the letter P27.

There is a clear distinction between a transfer on exigencies of service and an appointment

to a post. The definition given to the term transfer in the definition clause in Chapter I of

the Establishments Code is apt here. According to such definition, transfer means, the

moving of an officer from one post to another post or from one station to another station

in the same service or in the same grade of the same Ministry or Department with no

change in salary.

It is observed that the Petitioners work place has been changed by the impugned transfer

order and she has been assigned with the title of Chief Training Manager. It seems that

no selection process has been followed in terms of a particular Scheme of Recruitment to

appoint the Petitioner to the said post but only a transfer order has been issued after a due

evaluation of the experience and the seniority of the Petitioner. When the SLPA takes

such decision based on the capability and experience of an officer, such decision cannot

be challenged collaterally in this application unless it is ex-facie ultra vires, unlawful or

arbitrary.

Even in the year 2017 the Petitioner has been transferred to the said Academy (vide P16)

to serve as the Deputy Chief Manager (Admin.). The Petitioner alleges that she was

suitable at that time to serve as a Deputy Chief Manager but currently she is not qualified

to serve as the Chief Training Manager at the Academy. This argument, to my mind,

Page 9 of 10

creates a reasonable puzzle on this point as to how the Petitioner will not be suitable to

hold the post of the head of the Division of the Academy after effecting the impugned

transfer on exigencies of service.

I am satisfied that the Petitioners status, emoluments and the seniority have not been

affected due to the impugned transfer. In other words, the Petitioners legal rights have not

been affected other than getting posted to a different place. Perhaps, the impugned transfer

is being challenged by the Petitioner on parallel issues although her basic rights have not

been affected. However, the jurisdiction of the Review Court can be invoked, if such

transfer orders are found in contravention with the transfer policy or the guidelines of the

public authority or sufficient grounds are available to establish a plea of mala fides.

It is the contention of the Petitioner that she was transferred due to external influences

and/ or collateral reason at the behest of the 14th Respondent since the Petitioner, on

several occasions, has refused requests made by/on behalf of the 14th Respondent to grant

appointments/promotions to certain persons connected to the 14th Respondent. Such

assertions of the Petitioner require careful consideration of this Court. Anyhow, the

Petitioner has conceded to release the 14th Respondent from these proceedings due to the

reason that no relief has been sought against the said 14th Respondent against whom the

Petitioner has raised the purported allegations. It is important to note that when the

relevant Minister (14th Respondent) has seized to hold office, a substitution has been

effected and as such it appears that there are no allegations on personal basis against the

14th Respondent. This, in my view, disables the Court from examining effectively any

violation of Rule of Law and failure in good governance on the part of the 14th Respondent.

This Court has consistently taken the view that the plea of mala fides should be

substantiated with adequate proof to the satisfaction of Court and merely raising a doubt

would not be sufficient. The assertions on mala fide should be specific, direct and precise

in order to sustain the plea of mala fides.

Conclusion. In view of the foregoing, I am of the view that the Petitioner has failed to establish that the

decision of the SLPA giving effect to the transfer order reflected in P27 is ultra vires,

unlawful or arbitrary. The Petitioner is not entitled to challenge the purported appointment

Page 10 of 10

to the post of Chief Training Manager in isolation, as it is, in my view, a position assigned

to the Petitioner as a result of the transfer carried out on exigencies of service.

For the reasons set out above there is no necessity for this Court to deal with the

appointment of the 13th Respondent to the post of Chief Human Resources Manager.

In the circumstances, I proceed to dismiss this application. I order no costs.
