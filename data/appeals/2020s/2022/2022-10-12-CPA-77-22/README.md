The Presidents Counsel supported the instant application on 07.09.2022 and

this Court reserved its order for notice.

The accused-petitioner (hereinafter the petitioner) was indicted on 29.06.2021 for

charges under the Bribery Act before the High Court of Colombo in Case No

HCB/115/2021. During the pendency of the trial, the petitioner raised a

preliminary objection to the legality of maintaining the action based on the

premise that the institution of action against the petitioner has violated the ratio

decidendi of Anoma S. Polwatte v L. Jayawickrama SC/Writ Application No.

01/2011 SC Minute dated 26.07.2018 and Nandasena Gotabhaya Rajapakse v

Director General of Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and

Corruption CA (Revision) APN No 29/2018 CA Minute dated 12.09.2019. On

21.02.2022, the learned High Court judge pronounced an order dismissing the

preliminary objections of the petitioner. Thereafter on 15.06.2022 petitioner

further asserted arguments to support his contention that the Attorney General

was precluded from being retained as the Advocate on behalf of the respondent

Commission. Subsequently, the petitioner made an application in the High Court

CA-CPA-77-22 Page 4 of 7 12/10/2022 IJ-43-22

seeking to disqualify the Hon. Attorney General from prosecuting the case filed

by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of bribery or Corruption (hereinafter

the CIABOC). On 15.06.2022 the High Court refused the petitioners application.

Aggrieved, the petitioner has preferred the instant application for revision on

18.08.2022 to set aside the order dated 15.06.2022 delivered by the learned High

Court judge. Furthermore, the petitioner is seeking an order preventing the

respondent from retaining the Hon. Attorney General for the task of prosecuting

in the High Court of Colombo in Case No HCB/115/2022.

When this matter came up for support, the Presidents Counsel for the petitioner

submitted that the Hon. Attorney General has no right to appear on behalf of the

respondent as per Section 13, 17 of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery or Corruption Act (hereinafter the Commission Act) and Section 24D of

the Commission of Inquiry Act No 3 of 2019. The Presidents Counsel relied on

the Hansard Report of the debate conducted on 04.10.1994 in the Parliament of

Sri Lanka when the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

Corruption Act, No 19 of 1994 was presented by the then Minister of Justice

Prof. G. L. Pieris to assert that the very purpose for which the Act was introduced

was to ensure that the CIABOC is empowered to carry out prosecutions

independent of the Attorney Generals Department. It was further contended that

the collaboration between the CIABOC and the Attorney Generals Department

in relation to prosecutions ought to be limited to either advice or opinion. The

learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the respondent

vehemently objected to the issuance of notice and asserted that Section 13(1) of

the Commission Act allows any Attorney-at-Law authorised by the CIABOC to

appear on their behalf and as such, there is no legal impediment for an officer of

the Attorney Generals Department to prosecute a case on behalf of the CIABOC.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General objected to the issuance of notice and

stated that the application was frivolous, filed in an attempt to subvert the due

administration of justice. Having considered the submissions of both parties this

Court reserved its order for notice.

CA-CPA-77-22 Page 5 of 7 12/10/2022 IJ-43-22

Hence, the primary contention to be determined is whether the petitioner has

established prima facie exceptional circumstances for this Court to issue formal

notice on the respondents.

At the outset, it is pertinent to note the distinction between examining

exceptionality during the notice stage and examining exceptionality during the

argument stage. This Court in Horathal Pedige Prishriya Ratna Vilochani v

Hon. Attorney General CA/PHC/90/18 CA Minute dated25.07.2022

extensively examined the judgements of Sarath Andarahennadi v Officer in

Charge, Police Station Sigiriya CA/PHC/APN/117/2017 CA Minute dated

27.03.2019 and Ingiriya Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd v

Kalubalage Dona Laitha Srimathi CA/PHC/123/16 CA Minute dated

17.05.2022, which dealt with a similar issue. And as such, this Court held as

follows:

Hence, an extrapolation of the Sarath Andarahennadi case (supra) and

Ingiriya case (supra) reveals that prior to issuing notices to a respondent,

an application invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court ought to set

out exceptional circumstances in the body of the petition. Whether the

averred circumstances satisfy the threshold expected by the Court should

be decided after notices are issued to the respondents, and both parties are

given an opportunity to make respective submissions.

However, this contention does not impose a blanket ban on the Court against

considering the averred exceptional circumstances at the support stage for

the purpose of issuing notices. Such a blanket ban would essentially limit

judicial discretion endowed within the revisionary jurisdiction. At the

support stage, the Court is required to make an assessment as to whether

the resources of the Court ought to be exhausted by proceeding to the next

stage by issuing notice to the respondents. That determination is at the

discretion of the judge and is made by ascertaining whether the purported

exceptional circumstances require further examination or not. If the Court

CA-CPA-77-22 Page 6 of 7 12/10/2022 IJ-43-22

determines that such an examination is not warranted, it can dismiss the

application in limine, thus preserving the Courts resources for a more

deserving application. This entire process is an act of judicial discretion,

which falls in line with the revisionary jurisdiction of both the Court of

Appeal and the Provincial High Courts as a petitioner cannot invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Court as of right. A blanket ban from even

referring to the exceptional circumstances at the support stage, on the other

hand, would amount to ousting the said discretion vested with the Court

acting in revision. The Courts can refer to the exceptional circumstances

averred during the support stages to the extent of examining whether a

prima facie case has been made out in the application so as to warrant

the issuance of notice on the respondents. (Emphasis added) .. Hence,

even when a petition purports exceptional circumstances, if the Court is able

to determine at the support stage itself (without having gone into the merits),

that a prima facie case does not exist (thereby rendering an examination of

the merits futile) then, such Court can dismiss the application in limine. This

reinforces the judicial discretion within the ambit of revisionary jurisdiction

of the Court.

Speaking on the burden cast on an applicant at the support stage, His Lordship

Justice Arjuna Obeysekara recently held the following in P. M. Ranasinghe v

Asselage Sujith Rupasinghe and Others SC Appeal No. 59/2021 SC Minute

dated 08.04.2022: In order to have notice issued on the Respondents, the burden

cast on the Appellant was to establish a prima facie sustainable case and for the

Court to be satisfied that there is a prima facie case to be looked into. In other

words, the Court was only required to be satisfied that the application before it

warrants a full investigation at a hearing with the participation of all parties.

Hence, this Court will determine the instant application with the backdrop of the

above reasoning.

The application of the petitioner for revision pivots on the interpretation of

Section 13 of the Commission Act and this Court notes that the said objection

CA-CPA-77-22 Page 7 of 7 12/10/2022 IJ-43-22

has not been previously canvassed before this Court in applications of this

nature. The impugned order in the instant case has referred to the Hansard

concerning the interpretation of Section 13 of the Commission Act and has

refused to uphold the objection of the petitioner. Having carefully considered the

submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner and the learned

Deputy Solicitor General, the material placed by the petitioner before this Court

and especially the nature of the objection in relation to the interpretation of

Section 13(1) of the Commission Act, this Court is satisfied of the existence of

prima facie exceptionality which warrants the issuance of formal notice on the

respondents.

Accordingly, notice issued.
