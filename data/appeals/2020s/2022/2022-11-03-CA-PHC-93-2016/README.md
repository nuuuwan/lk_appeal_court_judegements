Before: PRASANTHA DE SILVA, J. K.K.A.V. SWARNADHIPATHI, J. Counsel: Shayamal A Collure with Prabath S. Amarasinghe For the Petitioner-Appellant Sabrina Ahamad For the 1st to 7th Respondent-Respondents Date of argument: 21.02.2022 and by Written submissions. Date of Judgment: 20.10.2022 K.K.A.V. SWARNADHIPATHI, J.

JUDGMENT The Petitioner-Appellant, who will be referred to as the Appellant, filed this Petition against the

Judgment delivered on 25.04.2016 by the learned High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya in case No.

H.C.W. 09/2013.

The Appellant served Mayurapada Junior School, Narammala, Giriulla, from January 2007 to July

2009. By a letter marked as P21, he was transferred to Ingaradarula Madya Maha Vidyalaya in

Girulla. While serving in the new school, he was interdicted on charges of abusing female students

at the previous school. A charge sheet was served on him, and an inquiry was held. After the

conclusion of the disciplinary inquiry, an order was pronounced finding the Appellant guilty on

all four counts, thereby dismissing him from service (document annexed as P34).

The Appellant appealed to the 1st Respondent. The 1st Respondent had informed his officers about

taking necessary steps, and after considering the appeal, it was dismissed by the officers of the

first Respondent. Aggrieved by the said decision, the Appellant moved the jurisdiction of the High

Court, praying, among other relives, a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st

Respondent by dismissing the Appellant from the service.

After inquiry, the learned High Court Judge pronounced the Judgment with reasons dismissing the

Petition on the grounds of delay and futile. Aggrieved by the said Judgment, the Appellant moved

to this Court to set aside the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge and further pleaded relives

from the Court of Appeal.

Both parties filed Written submissions, and the Appellants counsel was heard. This Court will

have to decide whether there is enough ground to set aside the Judgment of the High Court.

I have considered all materials before this Court and the Judgment of the High Court. The learned

High Court Judge had observed that the order dated 19.03.2012 [document marked as P37] was

challenged a year later on 04.04.2013.

Page 4 of 6

The learned Judge had considered that the Appellant had consumed time by applying to the Human

Rights Commission and had to wait for certified copies, which had ended by August 2012. There

was no clear explanation for the delay after 31.08.2012.

In Issadeen Vs. Commissioner of National Housing and Others1 observed that there should be

proper justification given and explained in the delay in filing such belated application.

This shows that Sri Lankan Courts consider unexplained delay fatal when considering writ

jurisdiction. The learned High Court Judge correctly analyzed that loss of income or employment

cannot be considered justifiable when the essence of praying for the writ itself is losing

employment. The second legal ground considered by the learned High Court Judge is futility.

According to the Judgment, P37 was challenged in the High Court based on P34, which is the

order of finding the Appellant guilty and ordering suspension of the service since P34 remains

unchallenged even if the Appellant succeeds in proving his case based on P37, that order will be

an academic exercise only.

The learned High Court Judge had analyzed this position referring to the dicta of M.M.

Shamsudeen Vs the Minister of Defence and External Affairs (63 NLR 430). The issue of a Writ

of mandamus is within the discretion of the court and will not be issued if it will futile to do so.

Page 5 of 6

The learned High Court Judge cannot by law grant relief to enclose the order of letter P34. His

Judgment will in no way affect the order of P34. The Appellant had pointed out that there had been

instances where delays of seven months and sometimes even six years were considered reasonable

reasons to proceed.

When considering the cases mentioned above, there were reasonable reasons which the Court can

accept. In the instant case, the only reason was lack of money and loss of employment. The learned

Judge considered the reasons mentioned in the High Court Petition and was ready to excuse up to

31.08.2012. The Appellant had failed to give acceptable reasons from 31.08.2012 up to

04.04.2013. When considering the learned Judges discretion which should be affected very

carefully and in a manner which will not help those who sleep on their rights, eight months cannot

be considered a reasonable delay.

The Appellant should have moved the High Court regarding the first letter, P34, which informed

the Appellant of the decision of the disciplinary Committee, finding him guilty on all counts and

pronouncing the termination of service.

This shows negligence on the part of the Appellant. The Court can help only the vigilant.

Therefore, I see no reasons to set aside the Judgment entered by the learned High Court Judge of

Kuliyapitiya on 25.04.2016. Since that Judgment stands, other factors mentioned cannot be

considered by this Court.

Therefore, I affirm the learned High Court Judges order and dismiss the present application of the

Appellant. I make no order in respect of costs.

The appeal is dismissed.
