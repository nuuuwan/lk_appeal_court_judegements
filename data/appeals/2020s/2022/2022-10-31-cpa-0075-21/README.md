This is an application for revision filed on 08.11.2021 by the petitioner,

who is the mother of the suspect. The petitioner impugns the order dated

20.05.2021 of the learned High Court Judge of Panadura, which refused

to enlarge the suspect on bail. Therefore, the petitioner seeks to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court to set aside the above order.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The suspect was arrested on

13.08.2020, near the Police Station of Panadura South for the possession

CPA-75-21 Page 3 of 6 31/10/2022 IJ-46-22

of 10.250 grams of Heroin and was charged under Section 54(A) and

Section 54(B) of the Poisons, Opium and dangerous Drugs Ordinance, No.

17 of 1929, as amended by Act No 13 of 1984 (hereinafter the Act). The

petitioner, made an application before the High Court, to have the suspect

enlarged on bail under exceptional circumstances, as provided by Section

83(1) of the Act, pursuant to the above charge.

The law applicable to the instant application within the ambit of granting

bail, can be quoted below in the following manner, prior to an analysis of

the merits of the application. As such, Section 83(1) of the Act is

reproduced below:

(1) No person suspected or accused of an offence under Section 54A or

Section 54B of this Ordinance shall be released on bail, except by the

High Court in exceptional circumstances.

The petitioner pleads to have the suspect enlarged on bail by submitting

several averments before the High Court, in order to constitute exceptional

circumstances within the purview of the above-quoted law. The petitioner,

inter alia, avers the following to be the said exceptional circumstances:

1. The suspect is the sole breadwinner of the house, and her two

children are now rendered defenseless due to the mothers

indefinite period of incarceration.

2. The suspect suffers from a permanent ailment in her womb which

requires steady and regular medical attention, and if otherwise, the

suspects health is susceptible for aggravation.

3. The suspect has no previous convictions or any other pending

cases.

The learned High Court judge set out in the order dated 05.20.2021, that

the averments of the petitioner with regard to being the sole breadwinner

of the family and the health conditions of the suspect do not sufficiently

constitute exceptional circumstances within the ambit of the Act, for they

are mere circumstances in the ordinary course of life of a person. As such,

CPA-75-21 Page 4 of 6 31/10/2022 IJ-46-22

the High Court dismissed the application for bail on the grounds that the

petitioner has failed to establish exceptional circumstances required to

enlarge the suspect on bail. It must be noted that the term exceptional

circumstances is very subjective and cannot be given a firm description.

It depends and varies on the circumstances of each case. There is a series

of reported cases in relation to granting of bail, which has identified the

term exceptional circumstances to be depending on the circumstances of

each case.

The Counsel for the petitioner relies on two major grounds as exceptional

circumstances before this Court.

1. The vulnerable health condition of the Suspect.

2. The delay caused in the process of administration of Justice.

However, it is the considered view of this Court that the State Counsel at

the inquiry did not challenge the facts relating to the health condition of

the petitioner, rather, was of the position that such facts do not constitute

exceptional circumstances. This leaves room for further interpretation of

exceptional circumstances; therefore, this Court will proceed to consider

the contentions of the petitioner in order to determine whether exceptional

circumstances do exist to enlarge the suspect on bail.

The primary contention of the petitioner in the instant application, is that

the suspect is suffering from a permanent ailment in the womb requiring

constant medical attention, where the suspect must undergo regular

treatments and is subjected to medication regularly. This is corroborated

by the medical reports submitted by the petitioner. The Counsel for the

petitioner revealed to this Court that the suspect had been subjected to a

surgery where her womb and two ovaries have been removed, thus

asserting the precarious health condition of the suspect. The petitioner

further avers that the suspects medical needs and required sanitary

facilities would not be adequately met in prison due to the scarcity of

medicine, and the inability to access a regular supply of medicine needed

CPA-75-21 Page 5 of 6 31/10/2022 IJ-46-22

from outside. Counsel for the petitioner urged that this inconvenience of

obtaining medicine from outside, coupled with the degree of medical

attention, and sanitary facilities required by the suspect while in prison,

pose a predicament quite out of the ordinary, thus sufficing to constitute

exceptional circumstances.

The second ground urged by the petitioner is the delay in the process of

administration of justice. At this juncture, this Court also deems it

pertinent to note the delay rendered in serving an indictment for the

suspect, even after the release of the government analysts report on

20.02.2021. (According to the Government Analysts Report the pure

quantity of the illegal substance is 2.792 g.) This delay caused the suspect

to be in incarceration for a prolonged period of time, precisely more than

one and a half years, since the government analysts report has been

signed. At the inquiry, it was submitted by the State Counsel that the

indictment has been dispatched to the High Court, however, since it has

not been served even at the time of the instant application to this Court or

at the time of the inquiry, a significant delay is unmistakably apparent to

this Court. In the case Ahangama Hewage Yasaswathi v Officer In

Charge, Police Narcotic Bureau, Colombo CA (PHC) APN No. 170/2011

Minute dated 21.06.2012, it was stated that Learned State Counsel

submits that the indictment was sent to the relevant High Court today

morning. But the State Counsel has failed to produce a copy of the

indictment said to have been sent to the relevant High Court. Even if we

assume that the indictment has been sent to the relevant High Court today,

the State Counsel has taken more than one and half years to send out the

indictment after the Government Analysts Report was signed by the

Government Analyst. (Emphasis added)

The above reference is germane to the matter at hand, for in the instant

application too, the suspect has been in incarceration for a period of more

than one and half years since the release of the Government Analysts

Report. Such a circumstance coupled with the pressing health concerns

CPA-75-21 Page 6 of 6 31/10/2022 IJ-46-22

of the suspect cumulatively establish exceptional circumstances on the

part of the suspect, which are sufficient to enlarge the suspect on bail.

Hence this Court is inclined to exercise its revisionary powers and set aside

the order dated 20.05.2021 of the High Court of Panadura, and directs the

learned High Court Judge to enlarge the suspect on bail on suitable

conditions.

Application allowed.
