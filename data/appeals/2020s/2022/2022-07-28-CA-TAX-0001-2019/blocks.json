Further, Bindra7 analyses the mandatory and directory statutory provisions as follows; so a mandatory statute according to Crawford, may be defined as one whose provisions or requirements, if not complied with, will render proceedings to which it relates illegal and void, while a directory statute is one where non-compliance will not invalidate the proceedings to which it relates. It is further stated that on the other hand, where the conditions are imposed merely for administrative purpose and no specific penalty is imposed for breach or violation of such conditions, agreements in breach of them are valid. It is clear law that an act, forbidden in public interest, cannot be made lawful by paying penalty on violation, whereas as act which is lawful in itself cannot become unlawful merely because some collateral requirement, imposed for reasons of administrative convenience, has not been fulfilled.",

Hearing need (sic) to be in camera and Section 140 subsection 7, 8 & 9 provide for adducing evidence. As such in the context of this case and by perusing the applicable provision, it seems to be that the hearing contemplated is nothing but 'oral hearing'. One has to give a practical and a meaningful interpretation to the usual day to day functions or steps taken in a court of law or a statutory body involved in quasi-judicial functions, duty or obligation. If specific time limits are to be laid down the legislature need to say so in very clear unambiguous terms instead of leaving it to be interpreted in various ways. To give a restricted interpretation would be to impose unnecessary sanctions on the Board of Review. It would be different or invalid if the time period exceeded 2 years from the date of oral hearing. If that be so it is time barred (emphasis added).",

Later, Interglobe Technology Quotient Private Limited (the Original Operator) by Deed of Novation dated 1st March 2009 (at page 150 of the appeal brief) novated the agreement to the new operator ITQLPL, the Appellant, and assigned all of its rights, benefits and interests in the agreement to the Appellant. Thus, for the purposes of the agreement, the Appellant put itself in the position of the original operator, Interglobe Technology Quotient Private Limited.

ITQPL has agreed to pay the subscriber productivity incentives based on the number of segments transacted and upon failure of BOC Travels Private Limited to generate the target segments in two consecutive quarters, ITQPL has the right to, inter alia, recover the cost of investment38.",

Firstly, in contrast to Section 7 (1) (c) of the VAT Act, there is no requirement in Section 13 (dddd) above for the service to be consumed or utilised outside Sri Lanka. Secondly, in contrast to Section 7 (1) (b) (vi) of the VAT Act, there is no requirement in Section 13 (dddd) above for the service provider to be a company set up exclusively for the provision of client support services, which means that companies exempt under Section 13 (dddd) may provide a wide variety of services to both local and foreign clients, and have only those services it provides to foreign clients and which fulfils the other criteria set out in the above section be exempted from the applicable tax. This is clearly not the case with Section 7(1) (b) (vi) of the VAT Act, of which definition is much narrower. It has already been established that ITQLPL provides some, if not all, of its services to local subscribers.",
