He can reject accounts which he believes to be false and unreliable although there is no direct or reliable evidence to prove them incorrect.15 The sufficiency of the reason given for rejecting the accounts cannot be questioned; except in the course of an appeal against the assessment. The omission of a single item of receipt from the accounts is a sufficient reason for rejecting the account if the omission cannot be explained.
