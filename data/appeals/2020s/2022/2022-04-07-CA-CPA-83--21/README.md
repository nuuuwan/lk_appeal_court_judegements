Complainant Respondent

Before: Menaka Wijesundera J.

Neil Iddawala J.

Counsel: Geeth Karunarathna instructed by Thilini Karunarathna for the

Petitioner.

Priyani Abeygunawardena, SC for the state.

Argued on: 14.03.2022

Decided on: 07.04.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to revise the order dated 22.06.2021

of High Court of Panadura. The accused in this matter had been taken into

custody on 25.04.2018 for being in possession of heroin. The accused was

indicted for being in possession of Heroin gram 2.23 in the High Court of

Panadura in 2020 March. The indictment had been served on the accused

on 05.10.2020. It has been fixed for trial on the same day for the

12.11.2020. But, on that day it had gone down to the 29.01.2021 due to

the COVID situation. But, on that day the High Court judge had been on

leave and the matter had been re-fixed for 24.02.2021. But, on that day

the accused has not been produced by the remand officials and a bail

application has been made, and the bail application has been refused. The

Page 3 of 6

matter has been fixed for 22.04.2021, on that day the remand officials has

not produced the accused. The matter had been refixed for the 16.

06.2021. Thereafter, a motion had been filled on 21.06.2021 for bail to be

considered. On 22. 06.2021 the motion has been supported and bail has

been refused.

Therefore, the grievance of the counsel for the accused is that, the accused

had been in remand since 2018 and up to date without the trial being

taken up. The counsel for the accused further says that he has no previous

convictions but in 2017 before his arrest he has made a complaint to the

Human Rights Commission of his impending arrest. The counsel for the

accused also drew the attention of court to the JMOs report at page 111

which indicates injuries on the accused.

The state counsel appearing for the respondent stated, that the delay of

taking up the trial had been due to the COVID-19 pandemic situation in the

country. The counsel for the accused cited several judgements in favour of

him.

In this matter the accused has been indicted under the provisions of the

Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No.13 of 1984,

according to which if an accused or suspect is produced or charged under

Section 54 (a) and (b) of the Act the said accused or suspect can be

enlarged on bail only on exceptional grounds. The term exceptional has

not been defined in the act but several matters had been considered in

deciding the term exceptional such as,

1) The nature of the accusation 2) The culpability of the accused 3) The severity of the sentence of the convicted

Page 4 of 6

4) The health condition of the petitioner which would be aggravated

by the incineration

Therefore, what has been decided so far is that the exceptionality would

be decided by the facts of each case. This has been discussed in the case of

Carder v OIC Narcotics Bureau 2006 SLR 74 by Basnayake J.

The law pertaining to the instant matter has provided for the accused

person to be remanded until the conclusion of the trial if not for the

exceptional circumstances, but it is not meant to be used to keep the

accused persons in remand for uncertain lengthy periods violating the

basic right of a person for free movement enshrined in the Constitution.

Counsel for the accused strenuously urged the accused is in remand for

four years without the trial being taken up and not knowing when it will be

but this Court notes that the proceedings have been postponed due to

COVID pandemic situation which had been beyond the control of the Court

and the prosecution.

In the case of Attorney General v Ediriweera [S.C Appeal No. 100/2005]

(2006 B.L.R. 12) it was held that, Delay is always a relative term and the

question to be considered is not whether there was mere explicable

delay, as when there is a backlog of cases, but whether there has been

excessive or oppressive delay and this always depends on the facts and

circumstances of the case

According to Chapter III, Article 13(4) of the Constitution which says that,

No person shall be punished with death or imprisonment except by order

of a competent court, made I accordance with procedure established by

law. The arrest, holding in custody, detention or other deprivation of

Page 5 of 6

personal liberty of a person, pending investigation on trial, shall not

constitute punishment

Therefore, it has been enshrined in the Constitution itself that a person

under arrest should not be detained in custody depriving his personal

liberty, pending investigation or trial without a justifiable reason.

The same has been very lengthily discussed by the former Chief Justice

Sarath Silva in the judgment of Sumanadasa v Attorney General (Sri Lanka

law reports 2006 pg 202) where he has stated that fundamental rights

of petitioners guaranteed by the Article 13(2) has been infringed being

detained in custody merely upon being produced in courts and

incarcerated without a remedy until the conclusion of their trials.

Hence in the instant matter, although the case against the accused has

been postponed due to matters beyond the control of Court and

prosecution , the delay in adjudicating the charge against him makes it an

exceptional circumstance to allow the instant matter in view of the afore

mentioned decided cases.

As such, the instant application for revision is allowed and this Court

directs the learned High Court judge to enlarge the accused namely

Samaraweera Arachchige Hashan Rodrego on suitable conditions of bail.
