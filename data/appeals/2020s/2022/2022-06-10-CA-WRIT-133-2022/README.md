Decided on : 10.06.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioners are non-academic staff members of the 1st Respondent Buddhist and Pali

University of Sri Lanka (University), which is established by the Buddhist and Pali

University of Sri Lanka Act No.74 of 1981, as amended (Act). The said University is

independent of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the said Act provides for

its employees retirement age which is in dispute in the instant application.

The age of retirement of the holders of any posts other than that of a teacher is governed

by Section 23A of the said Act as amended by Act No. 37 of 1995. The said section 23A

reads;

23A. The holder of any post other than that of teacher may continue in office until

he completes his fifty-fifth year and shall thereafter be deemed to have voluntarily

retired from service;

Provided, however, that the holder of any such post may upon written request

made by him, be given by the Council of the University, extension of service for a

period of one year at a time until he completes his sixtieth year, and shall thereafter

be deemed to have retired.

Provided further that the holder of any such post may at any time be suspended, by

the Venerable Vice-Chancellor pending an inquiry by the Council of the University

for misconduct, inefficiency or dereliction of duty or be dismissed or compulsorily

retired, if found guilty after such inquiry, on a resolution adopted by the Council.

The 1st Petitioner was due for his retirement upon reaching 60 years of age on 18.04.2022

and the 2nd Petitioner on 05.06.2022. The 3rd Petitioner is 59 years of age and the 4th and

5th Petitioners are 58 and 44 years of age respectively. Accordingly, the University Council

has considered effecting the retirement of the 1st and 2nd Petitioners during the University

Council's 423rd meeting held on 24.02.2022. The Petitioners have filed this application

mainly against the said decision of the University.

Page 5 of 14

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner brings to the attention of this Court the Public

Enterprises Circular No.01/2013 dated 15.01.2013 marked 'P5' which dealt with the

retirement of the employees in the Public Enterprises, where it states as follows;

I. The optional age of retirement of employees in public enterprises is 55 years

of age, however, if any officer intends to serve beyond this limit, he/she may

continue to serve up to the compulsory age of retirement i.e. 60 years of age

without applying for an extension of service.

The Petitioners contention is that their compulsory retirement age was in par with others

who are similarly employed at Higher Educational Institutes in terms of the above Circular

marked P5 issued by the Ministry of Finance and Planning until it was rescinded in

January 2022 by the Public Enterprises Circular No.02/2021, dated 14.12.2021, marked

'P3'. The said Circular P3 became operative from 01.01.2022. According to the

Petitioners the said Circular P3 purportedly sets out inter alia the present National Policy

of the age of retirement of employees in the public sector, extending the compulsory

retirement age to 62 years.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioners submits that the Petitioner's retirement age should

be governed by the said Public Enterprises Circular, marked 'P3', which provides, inter alia,

the following:

I. The optional age of the retirement of employees of the Public Enterprise is

57 years of age, however, if any officer intends to serve beyond this limit,

he/she may continue to serve up to the compulsory age of retirement i.e. 62

years of age without applying for an extension of service, subject to the

paragraph III of this circular.

The UGC, on 21.12.2021, issued Circular No.11/2021 marked 'P7' to Vice Chancellors of

the Universities, Rectors of Campuses and Directors of Institutes under UGC, consequent

to its decision to implement the said Circular P3 issued on Retirement Age of the

Employees in Public Enterprises. It is to be noted that the said Circular P7 has no bearing

on the Buddhist and Pali University since the said University has been established by an

independent Act of Parliament as observed above.

The Petitioners further assert that the Cabinet has approved a draft Bill containing the legal

draftsmans number L.D.O. 1/2015 to amend the Buddhist and Pali University Act

Page 6 of 14

(marked 'P8'), which would purportedly give effect to the laws governing retirement age

of the holders of any post other than that of a teacher of the University. As per the

Petitioners, no steps have been taken to proceed with the said proposed amendment to the

Act due to purported administrative delays.

Moreover, the 2nd Respondent has referred to the Attorney General by the letter dated

10.01.2022, marked 'P10' on whether the amendment to retirement age by the Public

Enterprises Circular No.02/2021 (P3) and the Special Bill passed by Parliament on

12.10.2021 apply to the non-academic staff of the Buddhist and Pali University.

After the filing of the instant Application, the Attorney General responded to the 2nd

Respondent's said letter by the letter dated 21.04.2022, marked 'X3'. The Attorney General

has opined therein that the retirement age of the non-academic staff of the Buddhist and

Pali University is governed by Section 23A of the Buddhist and Pali University Act and

cannot be governed by the Public Enterprises Circular No.02/2021. The letter dated

01.10.2013 marked X2 is also another decision of the Attorney General whereby he has

expressed his opinion that the Circular dated 15.01.2013 marked P5 was irrelevant to the

operation of the said section 23A of the Act.

It is an admitted fact that the said section 23A of the Act has not been amended by the

Legislature although there had been a certain move to amend the said Act in the year 2015

as per the above P8. In deciding the age of retirement of the employees mentioned in the

said section 23A of the Act, the Attorney General has already determined that the

Circulars marked P3 & P5 have no relevance. However, the learned Counsel for the

Petitioners strenuously argues that the 1st Respondent University should give effect to the

State policy on retirement as enumerated in the latest Circular marked P3 and further,

one university in the nations university system cannot be permitted to treat its employees

differently or unequally in a manner discriminatory and violative of their fundamental

rights.

In light of the aforesaid, the moot point in this application is whether the retirement age

of the holders of posts other than that of teachers at the University should be governed by

the said Public Enterprises Circular marked P3 undermining the clear legislative

provisions in the said section 23A of the Act.

Judicial review vis-a`-vis Fundamental Rights Jurisdiction

The primary submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners on the above point are

that the Respondents have violated the concept of equality as well as equal protection of

law as enshrined in Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka

(Constitution) by not absorbing the said P3 Circular. It is important to bear in mind that

the Petitioners have filed the instant application under Article 140 of the Constitution and

not under its article 126 which deals with fundamental rights jurisdiction and its exercise.

The Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any

question relating to the infringement and imminent infringement by Executive or

Administrative action of any fundamental right or language right declared and recognized

by Chapter III or Chapter IV of the Constitution.

In Nagananda Kodithuwakku vs. Dinesh Gunawardane - Minister of Education and

others CA/Writ/45/2022 (decided on 03.02.2022), I have held that;

This is not an application filed under Article 126 of the Constitution. Judicial review is

about the decision-making process, not the decision itself. The role of this Court in judicial

review is supervisory. Therefore, it is not for this Court to consider whether the decision of the

public authority is right or wrong but the role of this Court is to consider whether the public

authority has exceeded their powers. The Court cannot be the judge of giving directions to a

Government, intervening to the role of ruling the country.

The Petitioners in the prayer of the Petition seek inter alia to issue in the nature of;

a) A writ of Mandamus compelling the University to give effect to the Circular

marked P3;

b) A writ of mandamus compelling 17th and 18th Respondents to give necessary

directions to the University to give effect to the said Circular marked P3; and c) A writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the University to withhold the benefit

of the provisions contained in Circular marked P3.

As I have observed in the said case of Nagananda Kodithuwakku, the question before

Court, in an application for judicial review, is whether a decision or an order is lawful,

that is, according to law. Further, under judicial review this Court, unless there is an

obvious error in law on the face of the record, will not overturn the decision on merits.

Page 8 of 14

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner referring to series of decided judgements asserts

that violation of Constitutional provisions dealing with equality under Article 12 has

been held to be a separate ground of review in an application under Article 140 of the

Constitution.

The first case that the learned Counsel strongly relies upon, in this regard, is the famous

Heather Mundy case1 which deals with public trust doctrine. The lands of the Petitioners

of the said case were likely to be affected as a result of the Southern Expressway. As per

the said judgement, the Appellants` main grievance was as follows;

The Appellants` principal grievance is that they were denied the right to be heard in regard

to the Final Trace - which the Judicial Committee confirmed. The fact that some of their

neighbours might have been heard, at some previous stage, does not excuse the denial of their

right to be heard, and that aspect the Court of Appeal failed to consider.

Mark Fernando J. in the said case has further held;

Further, this Court itself has long recognized and applied the "public trust" doctrine: that

powers vested in public authorities are not absolute or unfettered but are held in trust for the

public, to be exercised for the purposes for which they have been conferred, and that their

exercise is subject to judicial review by reference to those purposes2; and that doctrine extends

to national and natural resources3. Besides, executive power is also necessarily subject to the

fundamental rights in general, and to Article 12(1) in particular which guarantees equality

before the law and the equal protection of the law. For the purposes of the appeals now under

consideration, the "protection of the law" would include the right to notice and to be heard.

Administrative acts and decisions contrary to the "public trust" doctrine and/or

violative of fundamental rights would be in excess or abuse of power, and

therefore void or voidable.

1 Heather Therese Mundy vs. Central Environmental Authority, SC Appeal 58/2003 (SC Minutes of 20.01.2004) (Judgment by Mark Fernando J.) 2 See- De Silva vs. Atukorale, [1993] 1 Sri. L.R. 283, 296-297; Jayawardene vs. Wijayatilake, [2001] 1 Sri. L.R. 132, 149, 159; Bandara vs. Premachandra, [1994] 1 Sri. L.R. 301, 312 3 such as the air-waves, Fernando vs. SLBC, [1996] 1 Sri. L.R. 157, 172, and mineral deposits, Bulankulame vs. Secretary Ministry of Industrial Development, [2000] 3 Sri. L.R. 243, 256-257

Page 9 of 14

In view of the above dicta, it is no doubt that the doctrine of public trust should be taken

into consideration in judicial review applications, however, it is to determine whether the

impugned decision making process is lawful or not.

The traditional grounds of review adopted by our Courts are illegality, irrationality and

procedural impropriety etc. In various cases, the Courts have also accepted the principles

of proportionality and notion of legitimate expectation (procedural legitimate expectation

/substantive legitimate expectation). In the above Heather Mundy case, our Supreme

Court enhancing the scope of the writ jurisdiction held that the administrative acts and

decisions contrary to the public trust doctrine and/or violative of fundamental rights

would be in excess or abuse of power and therefore, void or voidable. The crucial point

here is whether the Supreme Court has unambiguously recognized the public trust doctrine

or any violation of fundamental rights as a direct ground of review in judicial review

applications.

In this regard, it is important to refer to Article 126(4) of the Constitution by which the

Supreme Court is bestowed with power to grant such relief or make such directions as it

may deem just and equitable in the circumstance in respect of any petition or reference

referred to in Articles 126(2) and 126(3) of the Constitution. However, by virtue of Article

140 of the Constitution, the Court of Appeal has been given the power and authority to

inspect and examine the records of any court of first instance or tribunal or other institution

and grant and issue writs of Certiorari etc., only subject to the provisions of the

Constitution and according to law. The writ jurisdiction of Court of Appeal is subject to

the provisions of the Constitution and it should be exercised according to law and

accordingly the Court of Appeal is not directly empowered to exercise its jurisdiction as it

may deem just and equitable. Thus, I cannot accept the proposition of the learned Counsel

for the Petitioners that the Court of Appeal is vested with wide discretion in granting reliefs

for the interest of justice which deem to be just and equitable/ shall deem fit.

Sisira De Abrew J. in Sri Lanka Telecom Limited vs. Human Rights Commission of Sri

Lanka, SC Appeal No. 215/12 (decided on 01.03.2017) has held that if a

recommendation of a public body affects the right of an individual, Superior Courts in the

exercise of their writ jurisdiction have the power to quash such recommendation by issuing

a writ of Certiorari.

Page 10 of 14

Not only in England but also in Sri Lanka & India, the scope of remedies in the

administrative law has been expanded with a considerable degree of imaginative creativity

of the judges. However, though much of the scope of judicial review has been expanded

through judicial creativity during past decades, I am of the view that such Superior Courts

were very careful not to mix-up the fundamental rights jurisdiction and the writ

jurisdiction.

By virtue of Article 126(3) of the Constitution, in the course of hearing in the Court of

Appeal into an application for judicial review, if it appears to Court that there is prima

facie evidence of infringement of fundamental rights, the Court of Appeal shall forthwith

refer such matter to the Supreme Court. Likewise, under Article 126(4), the Supreme

Court has power to refer back to the Court of Appeal, a fundamental rights application or

an application made to Court under Article 126(3) if in its opinion there is no infringement

of a fundamental right or a language right. This itself shows the clear demarcation of the

fundamental rights jurisdiction and the writ jurisdiction.

Therefore, I am of the view that the Public Trust Doctrine and/or violation of fundamental

rights or any other ground established through judicial creativity should be adopted in

judicial review applications only as a conduit to make a determination by Court subject

to the provisions of the Constitution and according to law. I find that the grounds for

review in writ applications are inextricably interwoven with the fundamental rights

recognized by law and however the adoption of such grounds should be carefully done by

Review Courts subject to above limitations based on the respective jurisdiction of the

Court. Therefore, I am compelled to focus my mind with the issues of the instant

application in those lines and not make any determination just on a mere assertion of an

infringement of fundamental rights of a person.

The effect of section 23A of the Act

My considered view is that no provision of an ordinary Circular issued by a Ministry could

override the provisions of an Act of Parliament, particularly the provisions of the section

23A of the Act unless an amendment to such Act is being duly brought in and passed by

the legislature. This position has to be examined with the wordings of the respective

Circular which determines the date of the retirement of an employee and the same should

Page 11 of 14

be interpreted by taking into consideration the actual intention of the legislature which

reflects in the relevant Statute passed by the Parliament. It is important to note that the

words; notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other law are not found in the

said Circular P3 and therefore, in any event, no provision in the said Circular is intended

to amend any other statutory provision of an Act of Parliament.

In Halwan and others vs. Rahaman and others (1993) 1 Sri. L.R. 201 (at p.212), Ananda

Grero J. has held that when there is a conflict between the provisions of a Statute and the

provisions of a regulation published in a Gazette, the former prevails over the latter.

The said section 23A of the Act clearly envisages that the voluntary retirement age of

employees other than the teachers is 55 years and extension of service for a period of one

year at a time can be granted until such employee completes his/her 60th year. It is

pertinent to note that no valid law has been passed by Parliament up to date overriding

the said provisions of section 23A.

Further, it is observed that the UGC Circular marked P7 has no relevancy in respect of

the University. It is pertinent to note that in terms of the section 47 of the Buddhist and

Pali University of Sri Lanka Act No.74 of 1981 (as amended), the provisions of the

Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978, shall not apply to or in relation to the Buddhist and Pali

University of Sri Lanka.

Similarly, the latest Circular marked P3 and the Circular marked P7, simply cannot

override the statutory provisions of the said Act. In the circumstances, I hold that any

decision of the University not to adopt the said Circular P3 in relation to the employees

who come under the said section 23A, in order to determine their retirement age, is lawful.

No mandamus can be issued against any authority compelling such authority to override

a statutory provision without an expressed intention of the Parliament. In terms of the

Article 4(a) of the Constitution of the Republic the legislative power of the People shall be

exercised by the Parliament and by the People at a Referendum and therefore, I take the

view that no mandamus can be issued against the Respondents as prayed for in the prayer

of the Petition. Moreover, it is observed that the grounds of review for a writ of Mandamus

are quite different according to the settled law in that regard.

In the circumstances, I take the view that the Petitioners have not made out an arguable

case or a prima facie case for this Court to issue notice. The learned Counsel for the

Page 12 of 14

Petitioners asserts that in terms of the Rules of the Court of Appeal and the law, there is

no premise for a Respondent to Object to Notice and however, I am not inclined to

agree with those submissions.

I have extensively discussed on the arguability principle mentioned above in Prof. D. G.

Harendra De Silva and others vs. Hon. Pavithra Wanniarachchi-Minister of Health,

Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine and others, CA/Writ/422/2020 (decided on

01.02.2022). As I have observed in the above case;

In order to determine the question of notice, it is important to consider the principles that

needs to be adopted by a judge who is granting permission (Permission Judge) in view of

satisfying himself that there is a proper basis for claiming judicial review. The arguability

principle can be considered as one such main principle.

The effect of Article 126(3)

In addition to the above arguments, the learned Counsel for the Petitioners argues that the

instant application should be referred to Supreme Court under Article 126(3) of the

Constitution on the basis that it appears that there is, prima facie, an infringement of

fundamental rights under Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. It is a significant

question as to why the Petitioners have opted this forum, i.e., the Court of Appeal, to file

the instant application when the Petitioners have pre-determined that there is an

infringement of fundamental rights of the Petitioners.

The submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners at the threshold stage of this

case and also the pleadings of the Petitioners envisage that the Petitioners constitutionally

guaranteed equal rights and equality before the law has been manifestly denied. The

Petitioners state in their written submissions (vide-paragraph 23) as well that, by not

absorbing the said P3 Circular by the Respondents in to the University non-academic

staff, the Respondents have violated the concept of equality as well as equal protection of

law as enshrined in Article 12 of the Constitution.

In terms of Article 126 of the Constitution where any person alleges that any fundamental

right or language right has been infringed, he or she may within one month thereof, in

accordance with such rules of the Court apply to the Supreme Court by way of a petition.

Page 13 of 14

In a nutshell, the Petitioners in view of their abovementioned pre-determination, should

have straight away sought the indulgence of the fundamental rights jurisdiction subject to

the rules of Court by way of filing an application in the Supreme Court. It is not

reasonable, in my view, to use the provisions of the said Article 126(3) merely to overcome

issues on time bar etc. and other governing rules in filling a fundamental rights application.

The Petitioners have not given reasons or an excuse as to why they have sought mandates

in the nature of writs of Mandamus and a writ of Certiorari from this Court when they

have pre-determined that the Respondents have violated the Fundamental rights of the

Petitioners.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioners relies upon the judgement in W. K. C. Perera vs.

Prof. Daya Edirisinghe (1995) 1 Sri. L.R. 148 and moves that this application be referred

to Supreme Court under Article 126(3) of the Constitution. On a careful perusal of the said

judgement, it appears that the Petitioner of the said case have lodged an appeal against the

order of the Court of Appeal dismissing an application for Certiorari and Mandamus and

nowhere in the said judgement does it envisage that an application has been made in the

Court of Appeal by the respective Petitioner under Article 126(3).

The rationale behind Article 126(3) of the Constitution is that the Court of Appeal will be

compelled to refer a writ application to Supreme Court, if it appears to the Court of Appeal

in the course of hearing before such Court that there is prima facie evidence of an

infringement or imminent infringement of provisions of Chapter III or Chapter IV (of the

Constitution) by a party to such application.

Therefore, it is imperative that the Court of Appeal on its own motion or on an application

by a party to a writ application, first should form an opinion satisfying that there is prima

facie evidence of an infringement of fundamental rights or language rights during the

course of the hearing. In other words, a Petitioner in a writ application who has pre-

determined such infringement of fundamental rights or language rights should not be able

to make an application under Article 126(3) at the threshold stage of the case. It is the

bounden duty of litigants to identify their own grievance when selecting the forum to

which he or she should recourse to. Anyhow, there cannot be any restriction for an

applicant for a writ to plead in the prayer of the Petition, to refer such matter to Supreme

Court on the grounds that if the Court is satisfied during the hearing that there is an

infringement of fundamental rights or language rights. In the circumstances, I am of the

Page 14 of 14

view that the Petitioner who has pre-determined that there is an infringement of

fundamental rights is not entitled to any remedy under the said Article 126(3). Besides, I

have already arrived at a conclusion above that the Petitioner has not satisfied the

minimum threshold requirement which warrants this Court to issue formal notice of this

application to the Respondents.

Hence, I proceed to refuse this application.
