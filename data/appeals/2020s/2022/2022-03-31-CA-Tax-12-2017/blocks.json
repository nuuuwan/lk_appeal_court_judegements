    "text": "The statute itself contains no sanction for a failure to communicate reasons. If it had the matter would be easy of decision. But the matter does not rest there. One has to make a further inquiry. If it appears that Parliament intended disobedience to render the Act invalid, the provision in question is described as mandatory, imperative or obligatory; if on the other hand compliance was not intended to govern the validity of what is done, the provision is said to be directory (Halsburys Laws of England, Ed 3 Vol. 36-page 434 S. 650). Absolute provisions must be obeyed absolutely whereas directory provisions may be fulfilled substantially (Vide- Woodward vs Sarson (1875) (L.R.10 cp 733 at 746). No universal rule can be laid down for determining whether a provision is mandatory or directory. It is the duty of Courts of Justice to try to get at the intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the Statute to be construed per Lord Campbell in Liverpool Borough Bank vs Turner (1860) (2 De CF. & J 502 at 508) Vita Food Products vs. Unus Shipping Co. (1939 A.C. 377 at 393). Each Statute must be considered separately and in determining whether a particular provision of it is mandatory or directory one must have regard to the general scheme to the other sections of the Statute. The Queen vs. Justices of the County of London County Council (1893) 2 Q.B. 476 at 479). It is also stated that considerations of convenience and justice must be considered. Pope vs. Clarke (1953) (2 A.E.R. 704 at 705). Then again, it is said that to discover the intention of the Legislature it is necessary to consider-(1) The Law as it stood before the Statute was passed. (2) The mischief if any, under the old law which the Statute sought to remedy and (3) the remedy itself. (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, Edition 12 page 160). These are all guidelines for determining whether Parliament intended that the failure to observe any provision of a Statute would render an act in question null and void. They are by no means easy of application and opinions are bound to differ. Indeed, some cases there may be where the dividing line between mandatory and directory is very thin. But the decision has to be made. I will therefore examine the Statute bearing in mind these guidelines.",

The real question in all these cases is this: A thing has been ordered by the legislature to be done. What is the consequence if it is not done? In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all voids. On the other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the legislature could have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters which must be strictly obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow must come to an end.",

The neglect of them may be penal, indeed, but it does not affect the validity of the act done in disregard of them. It has often been held, for instance, where an Act ordered a thing to be done by a public body or public officers and pointed out the specific time when it was to be done, then the Act was directory only and might be complied with after the prescribed time.

This principle has been applied to provisions for holding sessions at particular times and places (2 Hale, P. C., p. 50, Rex v. Leicester Justices (1827) 7 B & C. 6 and Parke B. in Gwynne v. Burnell (1835) 2 Bing. N.C. 7); to provisions as to rates (Reg. v. Inhabitants of Fordham (1839) 11 Ad. & E. 73 and Le Feuvre v. Miller (1857) 26 L.J.

Further, as has already been pointed out, the sales can hardly be said to occasion the export. The seller sells aviation sprit for the use of the aircraft, and the sale is not integrally connected with the taking out of aviation sprit. The sale is not even for the purpose of export, as explained above. It does not come within the course of export, which requires an even deeper relation. The sales, thus, do not come within Article 286 (1)(b).",

It must therefore be given its ordinary meaning, or perhaps I should say one of its ordinary meanings, to be selected according to context. Clearly if it is given one of its ordinary meanings the travelers may be said to have \"exported the goods themselves, for they carried them (if small enough) on to the plane personally, keeping them in their possession while the plane flew out of New Zealand. And no different result follows in the case of the larger packages which were put into the plane's hold, of which the passenger-purchasers doubtless must be deemed to have had possession at the time when they were taken out of the country. The above-mentioned second illustration that goods put on board a streamer bound for a foreign country, but jettisoned can still be said to have been exported, even though they do not reach their destination vividly explains this proposition in case of bunker fuel which is supplied for navigation. The legislation is plainly addressed to those persons, and to those alone, who increase the foreign exchange reserves of New Zealand, by sending goods abroad, or causing them to be sent abroad, receiving in return foreign exchange for which they are bound to account, and do accounting, to the Reserve Bank. It is clear that even if the travelers may be regarded as themselves \"exporting the goods, the word \"export where used in the section must also clearly be applicable to those, such as respondent company, who send the goods abroad, or cause them to be sent, with this result. Surely a dairy company \"exports butter, and a fruit cannery \"exports its manufactures, whether it ships the goods to its own order in another country, or sells here f.o.b. to a foreign person or corporation, provided simply that the transaction is one in which it causes goods to be sent abroad in exchange for foreign currency which it receives and for which it accounts. It is to be observed however that s 129B is solely concerned with the actions of vendors. In our opinion a vendor may export either by taking or by sending. There will be many cases where it can be said that the buyer exports by taking, as for example in the case of an ordinary contract.",
