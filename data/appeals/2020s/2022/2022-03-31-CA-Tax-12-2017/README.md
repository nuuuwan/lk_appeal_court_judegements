Introduction

[1] This is an appeal by the Appellant by way of a Case Stated against the

determination of the Tax Appeals Commission dated 07.03.2017 confirming

the determination made by the Respondent on 12.08.2013 and dismissing

the Appeal of the Appellant. The taxable period related to the appeal is the

year of assessment 2008/2009.

Factual Background

[2] The Appellant is a limited liability company incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, No. 17 of 1982 and the principal activity of the Appellant is the supply of marine bunker fuel and lubricants to local and foreign vessels. The Appellant submitted its return of income for the year of assessment 2008/2009 on the basis that the supply of bunker fuel to foreign vessels could be treated as an export, and applied for the concessionary tax rate on the profits of the business in terms of Sections 52 and 42 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended), as follows:

[3] The Assessor by letter dated 16.03.2011 rejected the return of income for the said year of assessment for the following reasons:

1. Sales of bunker fuel were made to the vessels within the harbors and

waters in Sri Lanka or within the territorial waters of Sri Lanka for the purpose of consumption of bunker fuel during the voyage of the vessels. Therefore, the bunker fuel has not been delivered to a specific destination outside Sri Lanka;

2. The Lanka Marine Services Ltd is a supplier in Sri Lanka. Hence, Lanka

Marine Services (Pvt) Ltd is involved in ship bunker trading business for the supply of bunker fuel to the vessels that call at the ports of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, Lanka Marine Services (Pvt) Ltd is a supplier of bunker fuel for the shipping industry and not an exporter of bunker fuel. Therefore, the company does not qualify for the tax rate applicable under Section 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006;

3. The concessionary tax rate under Section 42 is applicable to the

consignor or consignee only in respect of profits and income arising from re-exports of any petroleum, gas or petroleum products. But according to the terms of the agreement in relation to the supply of marine lubricants, Lanka Marine Services (Pvt) Ltds responsibility is to pump marine lubricants to the vessels calling at the ports of Sri Lanka for the usage of the same vessel.

[4] Accordingly, the Assessor refused to grant the concessionary tax rates,

stating that the supply of bunker fuel to foreign ships cannot be treated as

exports under Section 52 or it cannot be treated as re-export under Section

42 of the Inland Revenue Act. The Assessor adjusted tax computation for the

above mentioned year of assessment as follows:

[5] Notice of assessment was issued on 29.03.2011 in terms of Section 163

(3) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended), in respect of the

year of assessment 2008/2009 (pp. 60-61 of the Tax Appeals Commission

brief).

Appeal to the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue

[6] The Appellant appealed to the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) against the said assessment

and the Respondent by its determination dated 12.08.2013 confirmed the

assessment and dismissed the appeal (pp. 09-16 of the Tax Appeals

Commission brief). The Respondent held that the sale of bunker

fuel/lubricants to foreign vessels cannot be treated as exports or re-

exports and therefore, the concessionary tax rates under Sections 52 or 42

of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended), do not apply to the

Appellant.

Appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission

[7] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the Respondent, the

Appellant appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission and the Tax Appeals

Commission by its determination dated on 07.03.2017 confirmed the

determination made by the Respondent and dismissed the appeal. The Tax

Appeals Commission, after hearing the parties to the appeal by its

determination was pleased to reject all the contentions urged by the

Appellant and held that:

5

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

1. The appeal against the assessment was rejected by the Respondent

since the appeal was not received within the stipulated period of 30

days after the issue of the notice of assessment, but upon a request

made by the Appellant on 22.08.2011, it was accepted as a late appeal

with effect from 22.08.2011. The determination was made by the

Respondent on 12.08.2013 and accordingly, the determination made

by the Respondent is not time-barred under Section 165 (14) of the

Inland Revenue Act;

2. The word export including the meaning given in Dictionaries, shall

mean the sending of goods from one country to another country and

therefore, there has to be a destination point outside Sri Lanka to

constitute an export. The destination point referred to in the relevant

documents submitted by the Appellant does not indicate any

destination point outside Sri Lanka and on the contrary, the

documents indicate that the destination of goods was Sri Lanka;

3. Although the decisions of the Indian cases are not binding in Sri Lanka,

they are of persuasive value and provide guidelines for the

determination of the term export in Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006. The test that has been applied in the

Indian Supreme Court decision in Burmah Shell Oil Storage &

Distributing Company of India Ltd v. The Commercial Tax Officer and

Others AIR 1961 SC 315 is that the goods must have a foreign

destination where they can be said to be imported, and so long as it

does not satisfy this test, it cannot be said that the sale was in the

course of export;

4. The sale or supply of bunker fuel/lubricants to foreign vessels that call

at the port of Colombo, cannot be treated as exports or re-exports and

therefore, the Appellant is not entitled to the concessionary tax rates

under Sections 52 or 42 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as

amended).

Questions of Law for the Opinion of the Court of Appeal

[8] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the Tax Appeals

Commission, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal and formulated

6

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

the following questions of law in the Case Stated for the opinion of the

Court of Appeal.

(1) Is the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission time barred?

(2) Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law when it came to the

conclusion that the determination made by the Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue was not time barred under and in terms

of Section 165 (14) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as

amended)?

(3) Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law when it came to the

conclusion that the Appellant was not entitled to the concessionary

tax rate conferred by Section 42 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10

of 2006 (as amended)?

(4) In the alternative, did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law when

it came to the conclusion that the Appellant was not entitled to the

concessionary tax rate conferred by Section 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)?

(5) In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, did the Tax

Appeals Commission err in law when it came to the conclusion that

it did?

Analysis

Question of Law, No. 1

Is the determination made by the Tax Appeals Commission time barred?

[9] At the hearing, the learned Counsel for the Appellant, Dr. Shivaji Felix,

submitted that Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of

2011 as last amended by the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act,

No. 20 of 2013, stipulates that the Tax Appeals Commission shall make its

determination within two hundred and seventy days from the date of the

Commission commencing its sittings for the hearing of each appeal. He

submitted that the amendment of Section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 with retrospective effect on two occasions

7

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

and having an avoidance of doubt clause in Section 15 of the Tax Appeals

Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 makes it very clear that the

intention of Parliament is that Section 10 as amended, is a mandatory

provision of law which requires strict compliance.

[10] He further submitted that though the determination of the Tax Appeals

Commission states that the dates of hearing were 16.06.2016 and

10.11.2016, these dates of hearings are incorrect in view of the fact that

there had been prior hearings on 24.06.2014 and 07.08.2014 as indicated

at pages 49-50 and pages 193-194 of the record of proceedings. He further

submitted that the Appellant has further tendered written submissions

dated 22.07.2014 (pp. 161-182) and thereafter, the Appellant was

requested to be present to fix a new date for the hearing (pp. 191-192) and

thereafter, the date of the hearing was re-fixed for 28.05.2015 (p. 208). He

submitted that the subsequent hearings were held on 16.06.2016 (pp. 222-

223) and on 10.11.2016. Accordingly, Dr. Felix submitted that the

determination of the appeal has taken more than 270 days from the date

of the first oral hearing that took place on 24.06.2014 and therefore, the

appeal before the Tax Appeals Commission is time barred by operation of

law and the appeal must be deemed to have been allowed in view of the

fact that it stands abated.

[11] He drew our attention to the following statement made by His Lordship

Gooneratne J. in Mohideen v. Commissioner -General of Inland Revenue

(CA 2/2007 (20-15) Vol. XXI. BASL Law Journal, page 171 decided on

16.01.2014, referring to the statutory time bar applicable to the Board of

Review in making its determination under the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38

of 2000 at p. 176:

If specific time limits are to be laid down, the legislature need to say so in very clear and unambiguous terms instead of leaving it to be interpreted in various ways. To give a restricted interpretation would be to impose unnecessary sanctions on the Board of Review. It would be different or invalid if the time period exceeded two years from the date of oral hearing. If that be so, it is time barred. [emphasis added]

8

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

[12] Dr. Shivaji Felix submitted that the judgments of the Court of Appeal in

A.H. Mohideen v. Commissioner -General of Inland Revenue (supra) is a

binding precedent as the statement of Gooneratne J. was part of the ratio

of the judgment and to consider it by His Lordship Janak de Silva J. as

constituting an obiter dicta statement by the subsequent judgments of this

Court in Stafford Motor Company Limited v. The Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue, CA /Tax/17/2017, decided on 15.03.2019, Kegalle

Plantations PLC v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, CA/Tax

09/2017 decided on 04.09.2014 and CIC Agri Business (private) Limited v.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, CA/Tax 42/2014 decided on

29.05.2021 was demonstrably wrong.

[13] On the other hand, the learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the Court of Appeal in Mohideen v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra), considered the question of the actual date of hearing intended by Parliament in the second proviso to Section 140 (10) of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003, for the purpose of the time limit of the appeal decided by the Board of Review. She submitted that the Court held that the hearing means the date of the actual oral hearing, which constitutes ratio decidendi. She submitted that the said statement was only a passing observation (obiter dicta) and not on points it decided (ratio decidendi).

[14] His Lordship Janak de Silva J, referring to Mohideen v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra), held in Stafford Motor Company Limited v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) that the statement made by His Lordship Gooneratne J. was an obiter dicta statement at p. 6 as follows:

We are of the view that the statement in Mohideens case (supra) that the determination of the Board of Review is invalid if not made within the statutory time period is obiter dicta. Accordingly, we are of the view that the determination of the TAC in the instant case is not time barred. In Kegalle Plantations PLC v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue [CA (TAX) 09/2017, C.A.M. 04.09.2018] we arrived at a similar conclusion.

[15] In Kegalle Plantations PLC v. The Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra) and CIC Agri Business (Private) Limited v. The

9

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra), His Lordship Janak de Silva J. arrived at a similar conclusion.

Statutory Provisions for Determination of Appeals by the Tax Appeals

Commission

[16] The time limit for the determination of appeals by the Tax Appeals

Commission was originally contained in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011, which stipulated that the Tax Appeals

Commission shall make the determination within a period of one hundred

and eighty days from the date of the commencement of the hearing of the

appeal. It reads as follows:

The Commission shall hear all appeals received by it and make its decision in respect thereof, within one hundred and eighty days from the date of the commencement of the hearing of the appeal.

[17] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act was amended by Section

7 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012, which

stipulated that the determination of the Commission shall be made within

two hundred and seventy days. In terms of Section 13 of the said Act, the

amendment was to have retrospective effect and was deemed to have

come into force from the date of the Principal Act (i.e. 31.01.2011).

[18] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act was further amended

by Section 7 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of

2013, which stipulates that the determination of the Commission shall be

made within two hundred and seventy days from the date of the

commencement of its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal. In

terms of Section 14 of the said Act, the amendment was to have

retrospective effect and was deemed to have come into force with effect

from 01.04.2011.

[19] Section 15 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of

2013 further provides an avoidance of doubt clause as follows:

For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared, that the Commission shall have the power in accordance with the provisions of the principal enactment as amended by this Act, to hear and determine

10

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

any appeal that was deemed transferred to the Commission under section 10 of the principal enactment, notwithstanding the expiry of the twelve months granted for its determination by that section prior to its amendment by this Act.

[20] Accordingly, Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of

2011 as last amended by the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act,

No. 20 of 2013 now provides as follows:

The Commission shall hear all appeals received by it and make its determination in respect thereof, within two hundred and seventy days from the date of the commencement of its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal:

Provided that, all appeals pending before the respective Board or Boards of Review in terms of the provisions of the respective enactments specified in Column I of Schedule I, or Schedule II to this Act, notwithstanding the fact that such provisions are applicable to different taxable periods as specified therein shall with effect from the date of coming into operation of the provision of this Act be deemed to stand transferred to the Commission, and the Commission shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other written law make its determination in respect thereof, within twenty four months from the date on which the Commission shall commence its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal.

Mandatory vs. directory

[21] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Act stipulates that the Tax Appeals

Commission shall make its determination within 270 days from the date of

the commencement of its sittings for the hearing of the appeal.

Superficially, the effects of non-compliance of a provision are dealt with in

terms of the mandatory-directory classification. Generally, in case of a

mandatory provision, the act done in breach thereof is void, whereas, in

case of a directory provision, the act does not become void, although some

other consequences may follow (P.M. Bakshi, Interpretation of Statutes,

First Ed, 2008422).

[22] Although one of the arguments advanced by Dr. Shivaji Felix was that

the word "shall used in Section 10 is normally to be interpreted as

connoting a mandatory provision, meaning that what is thereby enjoined is

11

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

not merely desired (directory) to be done but must be done (mandatory)

and the effect of such breach of a mandatory provision, which has the

consequence of the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission

rendering invalid. But, the use of the word shall does not always mean

that the provision is obligatory or mandatory as it depends upon the

context in which the word shall occurs and the other circumstances as

echoed by the Indian Supreme Court case of The Collector of Monghyr v.

Keshan Prasad Goenka, AIR 1962 SC 1694 at p. 1701) in the following words:

It is needless to add that the employment of the auxiliary verb " shall" is inconclusive and similarly the mere absence of the imperative is not conclusive either. The question whether any requirement is mandatory or directory has to be decided, not merely on the basis of any specific provision which, for instance, sets out the consequence of the omission to observe the requirement, but on the purpose for which the requirement has been enacted, particularly in the context of the (1) [1958] S.C.R. 533, other provisions of the Act and the general scheme thereof. It would, inter alia, depend on whether the requirement is insisted on as a protection for the safeguarding of the right of liberty of a person or of property which the action might involve.

[23] Thus, an enactment in form mandatory might in substance be directory

and that the use of the word shall does not conclude the matter (Hari

Vishnu Kamath v Ahmad Ishaque AIR 1955 SC 233). It is not in dispute that

Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act does not say what will

happen if the Tax Appeals Commission fails to make the determination

within the time limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission

Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as amended).

[24] Dr. Shivaji Felix, referring to in the five-judge decision of D.M.S.

Fernando and another v. A.M. Ismail (1982) IV Reports of Sri Lanka Tax

Cases 184, 193 submitted that penal consequences need not be laid down

in order for a provision to be held mandatory and that in such case, the

Court has to consider the natural consequences that would follow where

Parliament had not prescribed a sanction for breach of a mandatory

provision. He referred to the proposition of law that was lucidly explained

by Samarakoon C.J, at pp.184, 190 wherein His Lordship stated as follows:

12

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

The statute itself contains no sanction for a failure to communicate reasons. If it had the matter would be easy of decision. But the matter does not rest there. One has to make a further inquiry. If it appears that Parliament intended disobedience to render the Act invalid, the provision in question is described as mandatory, imperative or obligatory; if on the other hand compliance was not intended to govern the validity of what is done, the provision is said to be directory (Halsburys Laws of England, Ed 3 Vol. 36-page 434 S. 650). Absolute provisions must be obeyed absolutely whereas directory provisions may be fulfilled substantially (Vide- Woodward vs Sarson (1875) (L.R.10 cp 733 at 746). No universal rule can be laid down for determining whether a provision is mandatory or directory. It is the duty of Courts of Justice to try to get at the intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the Statute to be construed per Lord Campbell in Liverpool Borough Bank vs Turner (1860) (2 De CF. & J 502 at 508) Vita Food Products vs. Unus Shipping Co. (1939 A.C. 377 at 393). Each Statute must be considered separately and in determining whether a particular provision of it is mandatory or directory one must have regard to the general scheme to the other sections of the Statute. The Queen vs. Justices of the County of London County Council (1893) 2 Q.B. 476 at 479). It is also stated that considerations of convenience and justice must be considered. Pope vs. Clarke (1953) (2 A.E.R. 704 at 705). Then again, it is said that to discover the intention of the Legislature it is necessary to consider-(1) The Law as it stood before the Statute was passed. (2) The mischief if any, under the old law which the Statute sought to remedy and (3) the remedy itself. (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, Edition 12 page 160). These are all guidelines for determining whether Parliament intended that the failure to observe any provision of a Statute would render an act in question null and void. They are by no means easy of application and opinions are bound to differ. Indeed, some cases there may be where the dividing line between mandatory and directory is very thin. But the decision has to be made. I will therefore examine the Statute bearing in mind these guidelines.

[25] I agree with Dr. Shivaji Felix that the absence of any provision does not

necessarily follow that the statutory provision is intended by the

legislature to be disregarded or ignored. Where the sanction for not

obeying them in every particular statute is not prescribed, the court must

judicially determine them to ascertain whether the legislature intended

that the failure to observe any provision of a Statute would render an act

13

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

null and void or leave it intact (see also, N.S. Bindras Interpretation of

Statute, 10th Ed. p. 1013).

Legislative Intent

[26] The question as to whether a statute is mandatory or directory is a

question which has to be adjudged in the light of the intention of the

Legislature as disclosed by the object, purpose and scope of the statute. If

the statute is mandatory, the act or thing done not in the manner or form

prescribed can have no effect or validity, and if it is directory, a penalty

may be incurred for non-compliance, but the act or thing done is regarded

as good (P.M. Bakshi, Interpretation of Statutes, p. 430 & Mohanlal

Ganpatram v. Shri Sayaji Jubliee Cotton and Jute Mills Co. Ltd AIR 1966 Guj.

96). In State of U.P., v. Baburam Upadhya, reported in AIR 1961 SC 751, the

Supreme Court of India said that when a statute uses the word shall,

prima facie, it is mandatory, but the Court may ascertain the real intention

of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute.

[27] Crawford on Statutory Construction (Ed. 1940, Art. 261, p. 516) sets

out the following passage from an American case approvingly as follows:

"The question as to whether a statute is mandatory or directory depends upon the intent of the legislature and not upon the language in which the intent is clothed. The meaning and intention of the legislature must govern, and these are to be ascertained, not only from the phraseology of the provision, but also by considering its nature, its design, and the consequences which would follow from construing it the one way or the other".

[28] According to Sutherland, Statutory Construction, Third Ed. Vol. III, p.

77:

The difference between mandatory and directory statutes is one of effect only. The question generally arises in a case involving a determination of rights as affected by the violation of, or omission to adhere to statutory directions. This determination involves a decision of whether or not the violation or omission is such as to render invalid Acts or proceedings to the statute, or rights, powers, privileges claimed thereunder. If the violation or omission is invalidating, the statute is mandatory, if not, it is directory.

14

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

[29] Then the question is this: What is the fundamental test that is to be

applied in determining whether or not the failure to obey the time bar

provision in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act was intended

by the legislature to be mandatory or directory? The question whether the

non-compliance with a statutory provision can be classified as mandatory

rendering the proceedings invalid or directory leaving it intact depends, in

my view, on the consideration of whether the consequences of the non-

compliance were intended by the legislature to be mandatory or directory.

This proposition was echoed by Lord Woolf MR (as he then was) in R v.

Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Jeyeanthan [2000] 1 WLR

354 , who stated that it is "much more important to focus on the

consequences of the non-compliance". He elaborated this proposition

in the following words at p. 360:

In the majority of cases, whether the requirement is categorized as directory or mandatory, the tribunal before whom the defect is properly raised has the task of determining what are to be the consequences of failing to comply with the requirement in the context of all the facts and circumstances of the case in which the issue arises.

[30] Here, it is also desirable to remember the words of Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone L.C. in his speech in London and Clydeside Estates Ltd. v. Aberdeen District Council [1980] 1 W.L.R. 182 , 188190. He stated at p. 36:

"The contention was that in the categorization of statutory requirements into mandatory and directory, there was a subdivision of the category directory into two classes composed (i) of those directory requirements substantial compliance with which satisfied the requirement to the point at which a minor defect of trivial irregularity could be ignored by the court and (ii) those requirements so purely regulatory in character that failure to comply could in no circumstances affect the validity of what was done.

When Parliament lays down a statutory requirement for the exercise of legal authority it expects its authority to be obeyed down to the minutest detail. But what the courts have to decide in a particular case is the legal consequence of non-compliance on the rights of the

15

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

subject viewed in the light of a concrete state of facts and a continuing chain of events.

[31] In Howard and Others v. Bodington (1877) 2 PD 203, the Court of Arches considered the question whether the consequences of a failure to comply with a statutory requirement are mandatory or directory. Lord Penzance stated at pp. 211-212:

Now the distinction between matters that are directory and matters that are imperative is well known to us all in the common language of the courts at Westminster. I am not sure that it is the most fortunate language that could have been adopted to express the idea that it is intended to convey; but still, that is the recognised language, and I propose to adhere to it. The real question in all these cases is this: A thing has been ordered by the legislature to be done. What is the consequence if it is not done? In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all voids. On the other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the legislature could have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters which must be strictly obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow must come to an end.

[32] In the absence of any express provision, the intention of the legislature

is to be ascertained by weighing the consequences of holding a statute to

be directory or mandatory having regard to the importance of the provision

in relation to the general object intended to be secured by the Act (Caldow

v. Pixcell (1877) 1 CPD 52, 566) & Dharendra Kriisna v. Nihar Ganguly (AIR

1943 Cal. 266). As held in Attorney General's Reference (No 3 of 1999), the

emphasis ought to be on the consequences of non-compliance, and

16

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

asking the question whether Parliament can fairly be taken to have

intended total invalidity.

[33] Now the question is, to which category does Section 10 in this case

belong? The question as to whether Section 10 is mandatory or directory

depends on the intent of the legislature and not upon its language,

irrespective of the fact that Section 10 is couched in language which refers

to the word shall. The intention of the legislature must be ascertained not

only from the phraseology of Section 10, but also by considering its

purpose, its design and more importantly, the consequences which would

follow from construing it one way of another.

[34] Now the question is, what is the consequence of the failure to adhere

to the time limit specified by Section 10 that has been intended by the

legislature to be categorized as mandatory or directory. That is how I would

approach this question, which is ultimately a question of statutory

construction of Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of

2011 (as amended). Accordingly, one has to identify the tests to be applied

in deciding whether a provision that has been disregarded is mandatory or

directory, and then apply them to the statute which stipulates the

determination shall be made within the time limit specified therein, but

makes no reference to any penal consequences.

Consequence of non-compliance with a Statutory Provision

Purpose of the section in the context of the statute

[35] In considering a procedural requirement from this angle, a court is

likely to construe it as mandatory if it seems to be of particular importance

in the context of the enactment, or if it is one of a series of detailed steps,

perhaps in legislation which has created a novel jurisdiction, (Warwick v.

White (1722) Bunb. 106; 145 E.R. 612) or if non-compliance might have

entailed penal consequences for one of the parties (State of Jammu and

Kashmir v. Abdul Ghani (1979) Ker LJ 46). Where the disobedience of a

provision is made penal, it can safely be said that such provision was

intended by the legislature to be mandatory (Seth Banarsi Das v. The Cane

Commissioner & Another, AIR 1955 All 86).

[36] As noted, the fact that no penal consequence is stated in a statute,

however, is only one factor to be considered towards a directory

17

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

construction and there are other factors to be considered in determining

whether a provision of a Statute is mandatory or not. As noted, one of the

factors in determining whether the consequence of non-compliance

provision was intended by the legislature to be mandatory or directory is

to consider the broad purpose and object of the statute as Lord Penzance

stated in Howard v. Bodington (supra) at 211 as follows:

I believe, as far as any rule is concerned, you cannot safely go further than that in each case you must look into the subject-matter: consider the importance of the provision that has been disregarded, and the relation of that provision to the general object intended to be secured by the Act; and upon a review of the case in that aspect decide whether the matter is what is called imperative or only directory.

[37] The legislature is a purposive act, and judges should construe statutes

to execute that legislative purpose, intent and context (Robert A. Katzmann,

Judging Statutes 31 (2014) by focusing on the legislative process, taking into

account the problem that the legislature was trying to solve (Henry M. Hart,

Jr. & Albert M. Sacks, The legal Process: Basic Problems in the Making and

Application of Law 1182 (William N. Eskridge, Jr. & Phillip P. Frickey Eds.,

(1994). We must thus, ascertain what the legislature was trying to achieve

by amending the Tax Appeals Commission Act, twice as far as the time bar

is concerned.

[38] A legislative intention to amend Section 10 with retrospective

operation does not necessarily or conclusively mean that the failure to

make the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission within the time

limit specified in Section 10 is mandatory. If such drastic consequence was

really intended by the legislature, it would have made appropriate

provisions in express terms in Section 10 to the effect that the appeal shall

be deemed to have been allowed where the Tax Appeals Commission fails

to adhere to the time limit specified in Section 10 of the TAC Act.

[39] There are guidelines in tax statutes which stipulate that the failure to

observe any time limit provision would render the appeal null and void or

that the appeal shall be deemed to have been allowed. For example,

Section 165 (14) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended),

provides that an appeal preferred to the Commissioner-General shall be

18

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

agreed to or determined by the Commissioner-General within a period of

two years from the date on which such petition of appeal is received.... The

same Section specifically stipulates that where such appeal is not agreed

to or determined within such period, the appeal shall be deemed to have

been allowed and tax charged accordingly.

[40] Although the Tax Appeals Commission Act was amended by Parliament

twice and increased the period within which the appeal shall be determined

by the Commission from 200 days to 270 days with retrospective effect, the

legislature in its wisdom did not specify any penal consequence or any

other consequence of non-compliance of the time bar specified in Section

10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act. Had the legislature intended that

the non-compliance with Section 10 to be mandatory, it could have easily

included a provision with negative words requiring that an act shall be done

in no other manner or at no other time than that designated in the Section

or a provision for a penal consequence or other consequence of non-

compliance. This proposition was echoed by FOTH, C. J. in Paul v. City of

Manhattan (1973) 212 Kan 381as follows:

The language of the enactment itself may provide some guidance. Thus we said in Shriver v. Board of County Commissioners, 189 Kan. 548, 370 P. 2d 124, Generally speaking, statutory provisions directing the mode of proceeding by public officers and intended to secure order, system and dispatch in proceedings, and by a disregard of which the rights of parties cannot be injuriously affected, are not regarded as mandatory, unless accompanied by negative words importing that the acts required shall not be done in any other manner or time than that designated. (p. 556.Emphasis added). A critical feature of mandatory legislation is often a provision for the consequences of non-compliance. This element was noticed by early legal commentators, for in Bank v. Lyman, supra, we find this observation (p. 413).

[41] Bindras Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Ed. referring to the decision of

Paul v. The city of Manhattan (supra), states that factors which would

indicate that the provisions of a Statute or Ordinance are mandatory are:

(1) the presence of negative words requiring that an act shall be done in no

other manner or at no other time than that designated; or (2) a provision

for a penalty or other consequence of non-compliance (p. 433). The

19

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

legislature in its wisdom has placed time limit for the speedy disposal of

appeals filed before the Commissioner-General and the overall legislative

intention sought to be attained by the Inland Revenue Act in Section 165

(14) was to ensure that an appeal before the Commissioner-General of

Inland Revenue is disposed of within a period of 2 years from the date on

which the Petition of Appeal is received. As the Commissioner-General is an

interested party against another interested party (tax payer) in the tax

collection, it shall determine the appeal within 2 years from the receipt of

the Petition of Appeal and if not, the appeal shall be deemed to have been

allowed and tax charged accordingly, so as to safeguard the rights of the

taxpayer

[42] The object sought to be attained by Section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act has been designed primarily to expedite the appeal

process filed before the Tax Appeals Commission, which was established

by an Act of Parliament. The Members of the Commission shall comprise a

retired Judge of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal and those who

have gained wide knowledge and eminence in the field of Taxation.

[43] It was the contention of Dr. Shivaji Felix that where the Tax Appeals

Commission has failed to comply with the time limit specified in Section 10,

the Court could declare that the appeal made to the Tax Appeals

Commission is deemed to have been allowed to give effect to the

mandatory nature of Section 10. I am unable to agree with the contention

of Dr. Shivaji Felix. It is settled law that the Courts cannot usurp legislative

function under the disguise of interpretation and rewrite, recast, reframe

and redesign the Tax Appeals Commission Act, because this is exclusively

in the domain of the legislature.

[44] This proposition was lucidly explained by Lord Simonds in Magor and

St Mellons Rural District Council v. Newport Corporaion [1951] 2 All ER 839,

HL. Referring to the speech of Lord Denning MR, Lord Simonds said at page

841: It appears to me to be a naked usurpation of the legislative function

under the thin disguise of interpretation, Lord Simonds further stated at

841:

The duty of the court is to interpret the words that the legislature has used; those words may be ambiguous, but, even if they are, the power

20

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

and the duty of the court to travel outside them on a voyage of discovery are strictly limited. If a gap is disclosed, the remedy lies in an amending Act and not in a usurpation of the legislative function under the thin disguise of interpretation.

[45] The same proposition was echoed by Arijit Pasayat, J. in the Indian

Supreme Court case of Padmasundara Rao and Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu

and Ors. AIR (2002) SC 1334, at paragraph 14, as follows:

14. While interpreting a provision the Court only interprets the law and cannot legislate it. If a provision of law is misused and subjected to the abuse of process of law, it is for the legislature to amend, modify or repeal it, if deemed necessary.

[46] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 granted

time to the Tax Appeals Commission to hear all appeals within one hundred

and eighty days from the date of the commencement of the hearing of the

appeal. The Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012

extended the said time period from one hundred and eighty days to two

hundred and seventy days from the date of the commencement of the

hearing of the appeal. The Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No.

20 of 2013 however, reduced the time limit granted to the Tax Appeals

Commission to conclude the appeal by enacting that the time specified in

Section 10 shall commence from the date of the commencement of its

sittings for hearing the appeal.

[47] The legislature has, from time to time, extended and reduced the time

period within which the appeal shall be determined by the Tax Appeals

Commission, but it intentionally and purposely refrained from imposing

any consequence for the failure on the part of the Tax Appeals Commission

to adhere to the time limit specified in Section 10.

[48] On the other hand, the proviso to Section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 granted time for the Commission to make

its determination in respect of appeal transferred to the Commission from

the Board of Review within a period of hundred and eighty days (180) from

the date of such transfer, notwithstanding anything contained in any other

written law. The Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012

extended the said time period from hundred and eighty days to twelve

21

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

months of the date on which the Commission shall commence its sittings.

(Vide-Section 7 of the Act, No. 4 of 2012). The Tax Appeals Commission

(Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 extended the said time period to twenty-

four months from the date on which the Commission shall commence its

sittings for the hearing of each such appeal.

[49] It is crystal clear that these procedural time limit rules in respect of

appeals received by the Tax Appeals Commission or appeals transferred

from the Board of Review to the Commission have been devised by the

legislature to facilitate the appeal process by increasing and reducing the

time period within which such appeals shall be concluded. The provision

for the determination of an appeal by the Tax Appeals Commission within

a period of 270 days from the commencement of its sittings for the hearing

of an appeal has been designed with a view to regulating the duties of the

Tax Appeals Commission by specifying a time limit for its performance as

specified in Section 10 of the Act.

[50] So that the legislature, in its wisdom has made provision in Section 10

to the effect that the appeal shall be disposed of speedily within a period

of 270 days from the date of the commencement of the sittings for the

hearing of the appeal. But the legislature imposed no drastic and painful

penal consequence or other consequence of non-compliance, including

prohibitory or negative words in Section 10, rendering the determination

of the appeal null and void for non-compliance of the time limit specified in

Section 10. In my view, they are not intended to make the parties suffer

from the failure of the Commission to make the determination within the

time limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act.

[51] Any procedural retrospective operation of a provision, in my view,

cannot take away the rights of parties who have no control over those

entrusted with the duty of making determination within the time limit

specified in Section 10. The retrospective operation of Section 10 without

any penal or other consequence of non-compliance, by itself, cannot be

treated as a factor in determining that the legislature intended that the

failure to adhere to the time limit specified in Section 10 is mandatory.

Consequences of non-compliance of a statute by those entrusted with public duty

22

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

[52] One of the important factors that is necessary for determining whether

a provision is mandatory or directory is to find as to who breached the time

limit specified in Section 10-whether it was breached by one of the parties

to the action or by those entrusted with the performance of a public duty.

Also coming under this head are cases where the Court will take into

account the practical inconveniences or impossibilities of holding a time

limit requirement to be mandatory where the public duty is performed by

a public body. If the statutory provision relates to the performance of a

public duty, the Court is obliged to consider whether any consequence of

such breach would work serious public inconvenience, or injustice to the

parties who have no control over those entrusted with such public duty.

[53] Apart from the absence of reference to penal sanction and other

consequences of non-compliance of Section 10, the impossibility of

adhering to the time limit provision is also a factor in influencing the court

to construe the time limit provision is not mandatory, but as directory only.

In the present case, Dr. Felix referred us the ORs prior hearings on

24.06.2014 and 07.08.2014 and the written submissions filed by the

Appellant on 22.07.2014 to substantiate his argument that the oral hearing

commenced on 24.06.2014 and not on 16.06.2016 as stated in the

determination made by the Tax Appeals Commission.

[54] I shall now proceed to consider the question whether the delay in

making the determination was purely due to practical reasons in

appointing members to the Commission after the term of the previous

Commission lapsed. A perusal of the record reveals the following matters:

1. The Appellant being dissatisfied with the determination made by the

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue appealed to the Tax Appeals

Commission on 02.10.2013 (p. 40). As the Secretary to the Commission

has to fix a date, time and place for the hearing of the appeal, giving

42 days notice thereof to the parties, the Secretary informed the

Chairman of the Tax Appeals Commission, to fix a date, time and

nominate panel members for hearing of the appeal after 10.12.2013

(p. 42);

2. The Chairman of the Tax Appeals Commission directed that the appeal

be fixed for hearing on 24.06.2014 and the Panel Members were

23

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

assigned on 22.01.2014 (p. 42). Upon the nomination of the Panel

being made by the Chairman of the Commission, the Secretary, by

letters dated 24.01.2014 informed Attorneys Mrs. Manel Dharmadasa

and Mrs. P. Nadarasa as well as the parties that the hearing of the

appeal has been fixed on 24.06.2014 (pp. 43-47).

3. On 24.06.2014 the first hearing took place in the presence of the

Chairman, Justice Udalagama and two other Members, Mr. Junnaid

and Mr. Swarnajothi, and the next hearing was fixed for 07.08.2014 (p.

50). The second hearing was held on 07.08.2014 presided by Justice

Udalagama with Members being Mr. Junaid and Mr. Swarnajothi and

the Commission reserved the determination without any date being

fixed (P. 194);

4. As no determination had been made by the Commission, and the

Secretary, by letter dated 01.04.2015 informed the parties that the

matter will be called on 21.05.2015 to fix a new date for hearing (pp.

191-192, 208209).

5. On 28.05.2015, the matter was called by the Commission presided by

Justice Udalagama and Members, Mr. Junaid and Mr. Swarnajothi

being present, and the next hearing was fixed for 20.10.2015 (p. 212)

but the hearing was postponed as the Commissioner Mr. Junaid was

indisposed. The next hearing date was not fixed, but the parties were

informed that the next date of hearing will be notified to the parties

(p. 215-216);

6. As there was a vacancy in the Commission, the Secretary by letter

dated 08.04.2016 informed the parties that the Ministry of Finance had

appointed a member for the vacant position of the Commission and

the appeal will be taken up for hearing on 28.04.2016 (pp 219-220);

7. On 28.04.2016, the matter was called before the new Chairmen of the

Commission, Justice H. Yapa and the new Member Justice Sunil

Rajapaksha, and the matter was fixed for hearing on 16.06.2016 (p.

221);

24

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

8. On 16.06.2016, the appeal was taken up before the new Commission

and the parties were directed to file written submissions on or before

29.07.2016, and the next hearing was fixed for 20.09.2016 (p. 223);

9. The appeal fixed for further hearing on 20.09.2016 was postponed and

refixed for hearing on 10.11.2016 as indicated in the letter of the

Secretary dated 27.07.2016 (pp. 226-227). On 10.11.2016, the new

Commission reserved the determination (p. 267) and thereafter, the

determination was made on 07.03.2017.

[55] If the time limit is calculated from the date of the new commission

commencing its hearing on 16.06.2016, the determination has been made

within a period of 8 months and 22 days, which is less than 270 days. It is

not in dispute that every member of the Commission, including its

Chairman is appointed by the Minister to whom the subject of Finance is

assigned and such Member shall hold office for a specific period of time (S.

2(4)).

[56] It is undisputed that after a vacancy occurred due to the non-

availability of Mr. Junaid, a new member was appointed to the Tax Appeals

Commission, and after the term of office of the previous Chairman lapsed,

a new Commission with a new Chairman was appointed by the Ministry of

Finance. It is absolutely clear that though the hearing of the appeal

commenced on 24.06.2014, the Tax Appeals Commission could not

practically conduct its hearings due the vacancy occurred, and the term of

the previous commission expired and thus, no further hearing could be

held until the new Members of the Commission were appointed to hear the

appeal.

[57] It was thus, practically impossible for the Commission to make the

determination within a period of 270 days when a Member was unable to

perform his duty due to health reasons and the period of the previous

commission expired. Upon the appointment of the members, the new

Commission commenced hearings on 16.06.2016 and 10.11.2016 and

made the determination on 07.03.2017. I do not think under such

circumstances that it was practically possible for the new Commission to

conclude its hearings within 270 days from the date of the initial hearing

25

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

commenced on 24.06.2014 under the previous Commission whose period

expired before the determination was made.

[58] The Tax Appeals Commission Act has imposed a duty on the Tax

Appeals Commission to make the determination within the time limit

specified in Section 10 but the parties had no control over those entrusted

with the task of making the determination within the time limit specified in

Section 10. Should the parties who have no control over those entrusted

with the task of making the determination be made to suffer for any failure

or delay on the part of the Tax Appeals Commission in not making its

determination within the time limit specified in Section 10? I do not think

that the legislature intended that the time limit specified in Section 10 is

mandatory where it is impossible for the Commission to make its

determination within such period due to practical reasons or where the

parties had no control over those entrusted with the task of making the

determination within the time limit specified in Section 10.

[59] Maxwell, Interpretation of Statute, 11th Ed. at page 369 referring to the

ascertaining the intention of the legislature in relation to the interpretation

of limitation provision states:

On the other hand, where the prescriptions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and where the invalidation of acts done in neglect of them would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty without promoting the essential aims of the Legislature, such prescriptions seem to be generally understood as mere instructions for the guidance and government of those on whom the duty is imposed, or, in other words, as directory only. The neglect of them may be penal, indeed, but it does not affect the validity of the act done in disregard of them. It has often been held, for instance, where an Act ordered a thing to be done by a public body or public officers and pointed out the specific time when it was to be done, then the Act was directory only and might be complied with after the prescribed time. [emphasis added]

[60] Where the statute imposes a public duty on persons and to treat, as

void, acts done without compliance with the statute would cause serious

inconvenience to persons who have no control over those entrusted with

this duty, then the practice is to hold the provision to be directory only so

26

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

as not to affect the validity of such action taken in breach of such duty

(Montreal Street Rly. Co. v. Normandin (1917) AC 170, 175). Lord Sir Arthur

Channell echoed this proposition in that case at p. 176 as follows:

When the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and the case is such that to hold null and void acts done in neglect of this duty would work serious general inconvenience, or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty, and at the same time would not promote the main object of the Legislature, it has been the practice to hold such provisions to be directory only, the neglect of them, though punishable, not affecting the validity of the acts done. This principle has been applied to provisions for holding sessions at particular times and places (2 Hale, P. C., p. 50, Rex v. Leicester Justices (1827) 7 B & C. 6 and Parke B. in Gwynne v. Burnell (1835) 2 Bing. N.C. 7); to provisions as to rates (Reg. v. Inhabitants of Fordham (1839) 11 Ad. & E. 73 and Le Feuvre v. Miller (1857) 26 L.J. (M.C.) 175); to provisions of the Ballot Act (Woodward v. Sarsons (1875) L.R. 10 C.P. 733 and Phillips v. Goff (1886) 17 Q.B.D. 805); and two justices acting without having taken the prescribed oath, whose acts are not held invalid (Margate Pier Co. v. Hannam (1819) 3 B. & Al. 266).

[61] This proposition is further confirmed by Sutherlands Statutory

Construction, Third Ed. Vol. 3. at p. 102 as follows:

A statute specifying a time within which a public officer is to perform an official act regarding the rights and duties of others is directory unless the nature of the act to be performed, or the phraseology of the statute, is such that the designation of time must be considered a limitation of the power of the Officer. At p. 107 it is pointed out that a statutory direction to private individuals should generally be considered as mandatory and that the rule is just the opposite to that which obtains with respect to public officers. Again, at p. 109, it is pointed out that often the question as to whether a mandatory may be directory construction should be given to a statutory provision may be determined by an expression in the statute itself of the result that shall follow the non-compliance with the provision....

[62] If we hold that literal compliance with the time limit specified in

Section 10 is mandatory, disregarding the fact that neglect was performed

by those who are entrusted with the duty, we will be disregarding the

practical impossibility of the Commission and inconvenience of holding

proceedings and making a determination strictly within the time limit

27

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

specified in Section 10. In the present case, the duty to make the

determination within the time limit specified in Section 10 is statutorily

entrusted to the members of the Tax Appeals Commission in terms of the

provisions of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as

amended), and the parties had no control whatsoever, over the Tax

Appeals Commission.

[63] As Lord Sir Arthur Channell put it correctly, it would cause the greatest

injustice to both parties who had no control over those entrusted with the

duty of making the determination, if we hold that neglect to observe the

time limit specified in Section 10 of the statute renders the determination

made by the Commission ipso facto null and void.

[64] In my view, every limitation period within which an act must be done,

is not necessarily a prescription of the period of limitation with painful and

drastic consequences. The parties who have no control of those entrusted

with a statutory duty and no fault of them should not be made to suffer

and lose their rights for the failure to adhere to the time limitation

specified in a provision.

[65] The answer to this question is further provided by Sharvananda J. (as

he then was) in Nagalingam v. Lakshman de Mel (78 NLR 231), which is not

a fundamental right case. The question before His Lordship was whether

the provisions of Section 2 (2) (c) of the Termination of Employment of

Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No. 45 of 1971 are mandatory or

directory. His Lordship Sharvananda J. (as he then was) stated at page 237:

The object of the provision relating to the time limit in section 2(2)(c) is to discourage bureaucratic delay. That provision is an injunction on the Commissioner to give his decision within the 3 months and not to keep parties in suspense. Both the employer and the employee should, without undue delay, know the fate of the application made by the employer. But the delay should not render null and void the proceedings and prejudicially affect the parties, as the parties have no control over the proceedings. It could not have been intended that the delay should cause a loss of the jurisdiction that the Commissioner had, to give an effective order of approval or refusal. In my view, a failure to comply literally with the aforesaid provision does not affect the efficacy or finality of the Commissioners order made thereunder. Had it been

28

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

the intention of Parliament to avoid such orders, nothing would have been simpler than to have so stipulated.

[66] If we interpret the legislative intent of Section 10 from its mere

phraseology, without considering the nature, purpose, the design, the

absence of consequences of non-compliance and practical impossibility,

which would follow from construing it one way or the other, it will tend to

defeat the overall object, design, the purpose and spirit of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act. If we hold that the determination of the Commission is

null and void, it will cause serious injustice to parties who have no control

over those entrusted with the duty of discharging functions under the Tax

Appeals Commission Act.

[67] For those reasons, I hold that having considered the facts and he

circumstances and legal principles, the failure to adhere to the time limit

specified in Section 10 was not intended by the legislature to be

mandatory with painful and drastic consequences of rendering such

determination null and void. The directory interpretation of Section 10 is

consistent with the object, purpose and design of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act, which is reflected in the intention of the legislature.

[68] The principle laid down by Gooneratne J. in Mohideen v.

Commissioner General Inland Revenue (supra) was that the hearing for

the purpose of time limit of 2 years specified in the second proviso to

Section 140 (10) of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003

commences from the date of the oral hearing and no more. That was the

principle upon which the case was decided by His Lordship Gooneratne J.

which represents the reason and spirit of the decision, and that part alone

is the principle which forms the only authoritative element of a precedent

in Mohideen v. Commissioner General Inland Revenue (supra).

[69] In Mohideen v. Commissioner General Inland Revenue (supra), after

having fully endorsed the proposition of law that the hearing

contemplated in the said time bar provision is nothing but oral hearing

and thus, the time bar of 2 years ought to be calculated from the date of

the oral hearing, His Lordship as a passing remark stated says It would

be different or invalid if the time period exceeded 2 years from the date

of oral hearing. If that be so, it is time barred (p. 176);

29

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

[70] That part of the statement enunciated by His Lordship Gooneratne J.

is a passing observation, in the form of an assumption or hypothesis

unaccompanied by the principle upon which the case was decided in

favour of the Respondent, is manifestly obiter and not the ratio having a

binding authority. Justice Jank de Silva, in Staford Motors v.

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra), Kegalle Plantations

PLC v. The Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (CA/Tax 09/2017

decided on 04.09.2014) and CIC Agri Business (Private) Limited v. The

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (CA/Tax 42/2014 decided on

29.05.2021), arrived at a similar conclusion.

[71] We took the same view in our judgment in Mr. S.P. Muttiah v. The

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,CA/TAX/46/2019 decided on

26.06.2021 and Amadeus Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v. CGIR (C.A Tax 4/19 decided on

30.07.2021. In Mr. S.P. Muttiah v. The Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (supra), we further held that the directory interpretation of

Section 10 is consistent with the object, purpose and design of the Tax

Appeals Commission Act, which is reflected in the intention of the

legislature and that if a gap is disclosed in the Legislature, the remedy lies

is an amending Act and not in a usurpation of the legislative function

under the thin disguise of interpretation.

[72] I hold that having considered the facts and he circumstances and

legal principles, the failure to adhere to the time limit specified in Section

10 was not intended by the legislature to be mandatory with painful and

drastic consequences of rendering such determination null and void. For

those reasons, I hold that the determination of the Tax Appeals

Commission in the present case is not time barred and thus, I answer the

Question of Law No. 1 in favour of the Respondent.

Question of Law No. 2

Time bar of the Determination made by the Commissioner-General

of Inland Revenue under Section 165 (14) of the Inland Revenue Act,

No. 10 no of 2006 (as amended)

[73] It was the Appellants position that as the notice of assessment dated

29.03.2011 was received by the Appellant on 20.07.2011, the Appellant

was prevented from making an appeal in time and hence, the Appellant

30

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

made an appeal on 25.07.2011, but the appeal was treated by the

Respondent as a late appeal by decision of the Respondent dated

29.08.2011.

[74] Dr. Felix submitted that the question whether the appeal was timely

or late is not relevant for the purpose of determining the date of the

appeal and thus, upon the Appellant providing reasonable cause for the

delay in submitting the appeal, the appeal was accepted as a late appeal.

He submitted that the admission of the appeal as a late appeal does not

have the effect of postponing the date of receipt of the appeal in terms of

Section 165 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.

[75] He strenuously argued that when an appeal is admitted as a late

appeal, the date of the appeal is not decided on the date on which the

decision is made to admit the appeal as a late appeal, but it relates back

to the day on which the appeal was received by the Respondent or the

date of the acknowledgement provided, that this is done within 30 days

from the date of receipt of the appeal. On that basis, he argued that the

Appellants letter dated 22.08.2011 or the decision made by the

Respondent on 29.08.2011 to admit the appeal cannot be regarded as the

date of the petition of appeal as it does not set out the grounds of appeal.

[76] He submitted that the appeal dated 25.07.2011 was received by the

Respondent on 26.07.2011 and that date shall be regarded as the date of

appeal, and as the determination was made by the Respondent on

12.08.2013, the two year time bar for the determination of the appeal

ended on 25.07.2013. He submitted, therefore, that the appeal is out of

time under Section 165 (14) of the Inland Revenue Act (as amended). He

relied on the decision of this Court in Union Strad v. Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue (2013) CA Writ Application No. 255/2010 (Writ)

in support of his argument.

[77] The learned Deputy Solicitor-General has submitted in the written

submissions filed on behalf of the Respondent that letter of

acknowledgement only refers to the Appellants appeal made on

22.08.2011 and not the purported appeal on 25.07.2011 and therefore,

the determination made on 12.08.2013 by the Respondent is not time

barred under Section 165 (14) of the Inland Revenue Act.

31

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

[78] Section 165 (1) confers on the assessed a right of appeal against the

assessment or the amount of any valuation made under the Inland

Revenue Act to the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue, and such

appeal may be filed within 30 days after the date of the notice of

assessment or valuation. The relevant provisions of Section 165 (1)

relating to the Appeals to the Commissioner-General are reproduced for

clarity as follows:

(1) Any person who is aggrieved by the amount of an assessment made under this Act or by the amount of any valuation for the purposes of this Act may, within a period of thirty days after the date of the notice of assessment, appeal to the Commissioner-General against such assessment or valuation:

Provided that the Commissioner-General, upon being satisfied that owing to absence from Sri Lanka, sickness or other reasonable cause, the appellant was prevented from appealing within such period, shall grant an extension of time for preferring the appeal.

(2) Every appeal shall be preferred by a petition in writing addressed to the Commissioner-General and shall state precisely the grounds of such appeal.

(6) The receipt of every appeal shall be acknowledged within thirty days of its receipt and where so acknowledged, the date of the letter of acknowledgement shall for the purpose of this section, be deemed to be the date of receipt of such appeal. Where, however the receipt of any appeal is not so acknowledged, such appeal shall be deemed to have been received by the Commissioner-General on the day on which it is delivered to the Commissioner-General.

(7) On receipt of a valid petition of appeal, the Commissioner-General may cause further inquiry to be made by an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner, other than the Assessor or Assistant Commissioner who made such assessment against which the appeal is preferred, and if in the course of such inquiry an agreement is reached as to the matters specified in the petition of appeal, the necessary adjustment of the assessment shall be made.

[79] In terms of Section 165 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act, the date of receipt

of appeal by the Commissioner-General shall be regarded as follows:

32

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

(a) If the receipt of the appeal is acknowledged within 30 days of its

receipt, the date of acknowledgement of the appeal shall be the

date of receipt of appeal;

(b) If the receipt of the appeal is not so acknowledged, the appeal

shall be deemed to have been received by the Commissioner-

General on the date on which the appeal is delivered to the

Commissioner-General.

[80] It is not in dispute that the notice of assessment is dated 29.03.2011.

The Appellant has claimed that it received the notice of assessment on

20.07.2011. It is not in dispute that the Appellant submitted the appeal in

question on 25.07.2011, after the lapse of 4 months from the date of the

notice of assessment (pp. 155-156 of the brief) and the appeal in question

was received by the Respondent on 26.07.2011 (p. 156).

[81] As noted, the Appellant has not filed the appeal within a period of 30

days after the date of the notice of assessment as required by Section 165

(1) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006. The Respondent by letter

dated 10.08.2011 informed the Appellant that his letter dated 25.07.2011

was received on 26.07.2011 but it does constitute a valid appeal as it was

not received within 30 days from the date of the notice of assessment in

terms of Section 165 of the Inland Revenue Act (p. 71).

Extension of time for preferring the appeal

[82] The proviso to Section 165 (1) permits the Respondent to grant an

extension of time for preferring the appeal upon being satisfied that

owing to absence from Sri Lanka, sickness or other reasonable cause, the

Appellant was prevented from appealing within such period. The Appellant

has stated in the letter dated 22.08.2011 that the Respondent requested

the Appellant to indicate as to whether there is reasonable grounds on

which the appeal submitted could be admitted as a later appeal (P. 151).

Accordingly, the Appellant by letter dated 22.08.2011 requested the

Respondent to accept the appeal as a valid appeal in terms of the proviso

to Section 165 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act (p150-151). The relevant parts

of the said letter read as follows:

33

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

Having regard to all the above factors, please be kind enough to accept the appeal lodged against the notice of assessment as a valid in terms of the proviso to section 165 (1) of the Inland revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

[83] Upon the said request being made by the Appellant on 22.08.2011 (pp.

150-151) to accept the appeal under the said proviso, the Respondent after

several discussions, on 29.08.2011 treated the appeal made by letter

dated 22.08.2011 as a late appeal (see- the minutes made by the

Commissioner-General on letter dated 29.08.2011). The Respondent by

letter dated 04.05.2012 (p. 146) acknowledged the receipt of the appeal

made by letter dated 22.08.2011 against the assessment. The Respondent

determined that the date of the acknowledgment shall be 29.08.2011 which

was the date on which the late appeal was accepted by the Respondent

upon the request made by the Appellant by letter dated 22.08.2011.

[84] The said letter of acknowledgement dated 04.05.2012 reads as follows:

I hereby acknowledged the receipt of your appeal made by the

letter of 22.08.2011 against the Income tax/economic service charge

assessment issued for the year of assessment 2008/9.

Kindly note that under section 165 (6) of the Inland revenue Act, No. 10

of 2006, the date of receipt of your appeal, shall be the date of this letter

of acknowledgement, which is 29.08.2011 and the period of 2 years

within which your appeal shall be agreed or determined will end on

28.08.2013.

[85] The Appellant argues that once the late appeal is accepted by the

Respondent, the date of appeal shall be deemed to have been received by

the Respondent on 25.07.2011 in the absence of any acknowledgement

within a period of 30 days of its receipt. The Appellant relied on the decision

in Union Strand v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra) in support.

[86] The facts of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Union Strand v.

Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra) and the ratio of the said decision

relied on by the Appellant are not identical with the facts of the present

case. In that case, the appeal was filed on the 26th of February 2008 and an

acknowledgement of the receipt of the same was endorsed by the seal of

34

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

the Respondent on 29th February 2008. The said appeal was rejected by the

Respondent, informing the Petitioner that the said appeal was not received

within 30 days of the notice of assessment and therefore, it does not

constitute a valid appeal. The Petitioner stated that the appeal was in fact

lodged within 30 days and the said motive of assessment, even though

contains the date of 28th December 2007 was in fact delivered on

31.01.2008 by registered post. The Respondent after verifying this fact, sent

an acknowledgement of the appeal under Section 136 (13) informing the

Petitioner that they acknowledge the receipt of the appeal dated

28.03.2008, and it will be determined within 27th March 2010, but in fact

the said acknowledgment of the appeal was not in terms of Section 136 (6).

[87] In this context, His Lordship Sriskandaraja, J. stated at pp 4:

The appeal, was in fact, tendered to the Commissioner-General on 29th

February 2008, and the rejection of this appeal is by a mistake of fact by

the Respondent under the pretext of forwarding the assessment to the

Petitioner on 28th December 2007, but t in fact the said assessment was

received by the Petitioner on 31st January 2008, this fact was admitted

by the Respondent after verifying from the Postmaster General. In

these circumstances, the Petitioners appeal dated 26th February 2008,

which was lodged on the 29th February 2008 constitutes a valid appeal

and therefore, the time period to determine the said appeal

commenced from the 29th February 2008 and within 2 years the said

appeal has to be determined.

[88] In Union Strand v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra), the

Commissioner-General had admittedly made a mistake in rejecting the

appeal under the pretext of forwarding the assessment to the Petitioner on

28.12.2007 but in fact, the assessment was sent on 31.01.2008. In these

circumstances, the Court of Appeal held that the Petitioners appeal dated

26.02.2008, which was lodged on the 29th February 2008 constituted a valid

appeal and therefore, the time period to determine the said appeal

commenced from the 29th February 2008 and within 2 years the said appeal

has to be determined.

[89] In the present case, the application for accepting the appeal as the late

appeal was made by the Appellant on 22.08.2011 and the extension of the

35

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

time as permitted by the proviso to Section 165 (1) was granted by the

Respondent on 29.08.2011 and it was accepted as a late appeal with

effect from 22.08.2011. Unlike in Union Strand v. Commissioner of Inland

Revenue (supra), the Respondent in the present case, continued to

maintain the position that the notice of assessment was posted to the

Appellant under registered cover on 30.03.2011 and produced the

registered letter containing the address of the Appellant with the registered

number No. 2344 which refers to the date of the postage (30.03.2011). The

Deputy Commissioner (Data) has certified on 18.07.2011 (p. 63) that the

notice of assessment was posted under registered cover to the Appellant

and in proof thereof, produced the registered postal letter and the

registered postal No. 2344 as follows:

ks'fld' - 10 wxYh

by; ;' oekau ;eme,a l< nj ;yjqre lsrSu i|yd ,shd mosx ;eme,a f,aLkfha msgm;la f iu wuqKd we;' by; ;'oe' g wod, ,shd mosx ;eme,a wxlh 2344 f'

[90] In this background, apart from the mere assertion of the Appellant,

there is nothing to indicate that the rejection of the appeal by the

Respondent was caused by a mistake of facts on the part of the Respondent

or the delay in submitting the appeal was caused by the actions of the

Respondent in not sending the notice of assessment to the Appellant on

time.

[91] As noted, the proviso to Section 165 (1) permitted the Respondent to

grant an extension of time for preferring an appeal against the said

assessment. Extension of time in the proviso means that the time granted

by the Inland Revenue Act to file an appeal within a period of 30 days after

the date of the notice of assessment extnded beyond the stipulated time

of 30 days after the date of the notice of assessment. It is an extension of

36

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

the period or date allowed for the completion of an appeal beyond the

stipulated period of 30 days after the date of the notice of assessment

when the appeal has been filed out of time under Section 165 (1).

[92] The natural meaning of the phrase "extension of time" is a reference

to the period allowed for the works being made longer from the stipulated

completion date, and not the creation of a separate period of delay. The

natural meaning and the general position that extensions of time will only

be granted for a period which reflects the actual delay caused by not

completing a relevant event (here the filing of the appeal) on a due date.

The wording (extension of time) used in the proviso is sufficiently clear to

displace the position that the when the invalid appeal of the Appellant

made on 25.07.2011 is accepted, the date shall be treated as the date of

the appeal (25.07.2011) which was invalidated by delay in terms of Section

165 (1).

[93] In terms of Chapter XXIII of the Inland Revenue Act, an appeal made

against the notice of assessment can be either validly acknowledged or

rejected for the failure to file it within time. In the present case, the appeal

was rejected and the same was communicated to the Appellant within 30

days from the date of the receipt of the belated appeal.

[94] The Respondent did not treat the appeal as a valid appeal on the

ground that the appeal was rejected on a mistake of fact on the part of

the Respondent, but after lengthy discussions, the Respondent granted an

extension of time to receive the appeal with effect from 22.08.2011. The

process of granting an extension in the circumstances naturally took time,

as the Respondent did not admit any mistake on its part in not sending the

notice of assessment to the Appellant or that the appeal was rejected due

to its fault. The Appellant himself sought clarifications and documentations

from the Respondent with regard to the notice of assessment (pp. 64,

63,67,69, 74, 73). After several discussions, the Respondent decided on

29.08.2011 to grant an extension of time and accept the late appeal with

effect from 22.08.2011.

[95] Once an extension is granted under the proviso, upon the application

of the Appellant by letter dated 22.08.2011, the period of extension should

run from the date on which the valid appeal shall be filed and complete

37

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

when the request to accept the appeal was allowed by the Respondent with

effect from 22.08.2011. The acknowledgment was sent on 04.05.2012

acknowledging the appeal as a late appeal with effect from 22.08.2011. The

Appellant never challenged the decision of the Respondent to treat the

appeal with effect from 22.08.2011 by way of judicial review, but proceeded

to act on that basis and participated in the entire appeal procedure before

the Respondent. Instead, the Appellant sought to challenge the time bar of

the determination of the Respondent for the first time before the Tax

Appeals Commission and thereafter, in the case stated. Having failed to file

the appeal on time and obtained an extension of time to accept the belated

appeal as a late appeal and further participated in the proceedings before

the Respondent, the Appellant is now estopped from taking a belated

defense of time bar in this case stated.

[96] On the other hand, the appeal which was invalidated due to the failure

to file it within time became validated upon the extension is granted by the

Respondent on 29.08.2011 by which the appeal was accepted with effect

from 22.08.2011. In the circumstances, the appeal shall be deemed to have

been received by the Respondent on the day of which the receipt of the

appeal was validly accepted by the Respondent on 22.08.2011 having

granted an extension of time upon the application of the Appellant by letter

dated 22.08.2011. Accordingly, the appeal which was invalidated on

25.07.2011 became validated in the present case, only after the extension

of time was granted by the Respondent with effect from 22.08.2011.

[97] The determination was made by the Respondent on 12.08.2013. The

determination was made within a period of 2 years from the date on which

the appeal was validly received by the Respondent on 22.08.2011. For those

reasons, the decision in Union Strand v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue

(supra) will not apply to the facts of this case. For those reasons, I hold that

the appeal is not time barred under Section 165 (14) of the Inland Revenue

Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

Question of Law Nos. 3 and 4

Is the Appellant entitled to the Concessionary Tax Rate conferred by Sections 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006?

38

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

[98] At the hearing of the Appeal, Dr. Felix submitted that the Appellant

being a supplier of bunker fuel to ships is engaged in exporting bunker fuel

to a buyer abroad within the contemplation of Section 42 of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended) and therefore, it is entitled to

the concessionary rate of tax conferred by Section 42 of the Inland Revenue

Act. He further submitted that, in the alternative, the Appellant is entitled

to the concessionary rate of tax conferred by Section 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act. He further submitted that although the term export is not

defined in the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended), the

question of whether the Appellant qualifies for the concessionary tax rates

under Sections 42 of 52 of the Inland Revenue Act would have to be decided

by resorting to other definitions of export in other statutes.

[99] He submitted that the supply of bunker fuel qualifies as an export

when Appellant satisfies the test of act of taking out of Sri Lanka as

specified in Section 22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of

1969, which is further confirmed by Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance.

He referred to the definition of the term export set out in several

Dictionaries and judicial authorities and submitted that the Appellant has

established that the bunker fuel had been taken out of the Sri Lankan

territorial waters, and the moment the bunker fuel is taken out of Sri Lanka,

the act of exportation is complete and thus, the Appellant must be deemed

to be an exporter.

[100] He strenuously argued that the real test is whether or not the goods

were taken out of Sri Lanka and once the act of taking out of Sri Lanka is

established, the final destination of the goods, and the intent of the person

to dispose or leave such goods in a particular destination becomes

irrelevant. On the basis, Dr. Felix, submitted that the supply of bunker fuel

to a foreign going ship constitutes an export and therefore, the Appellant

is eligible for the concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 and 52 of the

Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

[101] On the other hand, the learned Additional Solicitor General submitted

that the Appellants transactions do not constitute exports under any of

the four legal standards or tests that are recognized as characteristics of an

export such as (i) there should be an act of taking out of Sri Lanka; (ii) the

goods must reach a final destination outside Sri Lanka; (iii) the transaction

39

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

must involve an export from one country, and an import into another

country; and (iv) the transaction should possess the characteristics of an

international sale of goods transaction.

[102] She submitted that the Appellant neither took the goods outside Sri

Lanka, nor caused the foreign vessel to take the goods outside Sri Lanka

with a final destination outside Sri Lanka as the contracts entered by the

Appellant do not provide for a terminus outside the territorial waters of Sri

Lanka. She submitted that as far as the Appellant was concerned, the

terminus was within Sri Lanka, and the transaction between the Appellant

and the vessel owners/charterers was a local transaction that took place

within the territorial waters of Sri Lanka and thus, the final destination was

not outside Sri Lanka. She further submitted that in any event, the

Appellant had no control over the ships journeys; and thus, it is manifest

that the goods have remained within the territorial waters of Sri Lanka,

indefinitely.

[103] Referring to the test of international sale of goods transaction, she

argued that the Appellant has failed to produce a single document such as

a Bill of Lading, Marine Insurance, invoices and letters of credit, and that

the Appellants documents do not support that its transaction could be

catheterized as international sale of goods transaction. She argued,

therefore, that the supply of bunker fuel was no export within the meaning

of Section 42 or qualified export within the meaning of Section 52 of the

Inland Revenue Act.

[104] The Tax Appeals Commission in holding that the bunker fuel supplied

by the Appellant to ships travelling from Sri Lanka cannot constitute an

export in the absence of a foreign destination, relied on the test adopted

by Hidayatullah J. in the Indian Supreme Court case in Burmah-Shell Oil

Storage & Distribution Company Ltd v. Commercial Taxing Office and

Others [1961]1SCR 902. That was a case relating to the sale and delivery of

aviation spirits to Aircrafts proceeding abroad and belonging to several

companies. The question arose was whether the sale and delivery of

aviation spirits to Aircrafts constitutes an export.

[105] In Burmah-Shell Oil Storage & Distribution Company Ltd v.

Commercial Taxing Office and Others [supa), the Indian Supreme Court

held that in the context and setting in which the expression export out of

40

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

the territory of India occurs in Part XII of the Constitution, it was not

sufficient that goods were merely moved out of the territory of India, but

that it was further necessary that the goods should be intended to be

transported to a destination beyond India, so that aviation spirit sold to an

aircraft for enabling it to fly out of the country was not exported out of

the country. Referring to the word export, Hidayatullah J., further stated

that (i) the test is that the goods must have a foreign destination where they

can be said to be imported; (ii) the crucial fact is the sending of the goods

to a foreign destination where they would be received as imports; and (iii)

the two notions of export and import, thus, go in pairs.... and as long as it

does not satisfy this test, it cannot be said that the sale was in the course

of export. .. Under such circumstances, Hidayatulla J. stated at paragraph

37:

Applying these several tests to the cases on hand, it is quite plaint that aviation sprit loaded on board an aircraft for consumption, though taken out of the country, is not exported since it has no destination where it can be said to be imported, and so long as it does not satisfy this test, it cannot be said that the sale was in the course of export. Further, as has already been pointed out, the sales can hardly be said to occasion the export. The seller sells aviation sprit for the use of the aircraft, and the sale is not integrally connected with the taking out of aviation sprit. The sale is not even for the purpose of export, as explained above. It does not come within the course of export, which requires an even deeper relation. The sales, thus, do not come within Article 286 (1)(b).

[106] It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that

the concept of export in India as reflected in the Indian authorizes is based

on different principles such as the existence of two termini and the

intention of their being landed in a different port. He submitted that the

real test is whether or not the bunker fuel was taken out of the Sri Lankan

territorial waters and therefore, the Indian authorities are irrelevant for the

purpose of deciding the concessionary tax rate under Sections 42 and 52

of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

[107] It is true that the decision in Burmah-Shell Oil Storage & Distribution

Company Ltd v. Commercial Taxing Office and Others (supra) is based on

constitutional provisions of the Indian Constitution, [Article 286 (1) (b)] and

Section 5 of the CENTRAL SALES TAX ACT to define the word export and

41

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

such principles are not binding on the Courts of Sri Lanka. Hence, this Court

is called upon to decide the question of whether the supply of bunker fuel

to ships constitutes an export under Section 42 or Section 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006, independent of the Indian authorities in

particular, the case of Burmah-Shell Oil Storage & Distribution Company

Ltd v Commercial Taxing Office and Others (supra).

Statutory Provisions

[108] Before embarking upon the rival contentions of the parties, I may

proceed to notice the relevant statutory provisions which have a bearing

on the issue. Section 42 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as

amended), which sets out the rate of income tax on profits and income

arising in Sri Lanka to the consignor or consignee from certain exports. It

provides as follows:

42 (1) The profits and income, for the year of assessment on April 1, 2006, arising in Sri Lanka to a consignor or consignee, from the export of

(a) any precious stones or metals not mined in Sri Lanka;

(b) any petroleum, gas or petroleum products; or

(c) such other products as may be approved by the Minister for the purposes of this paragraph, having regard to the foreign exchange benefits that are likely to accrue to the country from the export of such products, being goods brought to Sri Lanka on a consignment basis, and re-exported without subjecting such goods to any process of manufacture, shall be liable to income tax at the appropriate rate specified in the Fifth Schedule to this Act.

(2) The profits and income for any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2007, but prior to April 1, 2011 arising in Sri Lanka to any consignor or consignee from the export of any goods brought to Sri Lanka on a consignment basis and re-exported without subjecting such goods to any process of manufacture, shall be liable to income tax at the appropriate rate specified in the Fifth Schedule to this Act.

[109] Section 52 of the of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 as amended, which sets out the rate of income tax on qualified export profits

42

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

and income of a company which carries on any specified undertaking as follows:

52-Where any company commenced prior to November 10, 1993, to carry on any specified undertaking and the taxable income of that company for any year of assessment includes any qualified export profits and income from such specified undertaking, such part of such taxable income as consists of such qualified export profits and income, shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, be chargeable with income tax at the appropriate rate specified in the Fifth Schedule to this Act.

Exporting and importing are two sides of the same coin; both supply

customers with products manufactured outside the country.

[110] Section 60 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 interprets the terms export turnover, qualified export profits and income and specified undertaking for the purpose Chapter IX as follows:

60. For the purposes of this Chapter

(a) export turnover in relation to any specified undertaking means the total amount receivable, whether, received or not, by that undertaking from the export of goods or commodities or from the provision of any service referred to sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (c), but does not include

(I) any amount receivable, whether received or not, from the export of gems or jeweler or from the sale of any capital assets;

(ii) any amount receivable, whether received or not-from the export of black tea not in packet or package form and each packet or package weighing not more than one kilogram, crepe rubber, and, sheet rubber, scrap rubber, latex or fresh coconuts; or

(iii) any profits and income not being profits and income within the meaning of paragraph (a) of section 3;

(b) qualified export profits and income in relation to any person, means the sum which bears to the profits and income within the meaning of paragraph (a) of section 3, after excluding there from any profits and income from the sale of gems and jeweler and any profits and income from the sale of capital assets, for that year of assessment from any specified undertaking carried on by such person, ascertained in accordance with the provisions of this Act, the same proportion as the

43

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

export turnover of that undertaking for that year of assessment bears to the total turnover of that undertaking for that year of assessment;

(c) specified undertaking means any undertaking which is engaged in

(I) the export of non-traditional goods manufactured, produced or

purchased by such undertaking; or

(ii) the performance of any service of ship repair, ship breaking repair

and refurbishment of marine cargo containers, provision of computer software, computer programmers, computer systems or recording computer data, or such other services as may be specified by the Minister by Notice published in the Gazette, for payment in foreign currency; and

(d) Total turnover in relation to any specified undertaking means the total amount receivable, whether received or not, by that undertaking from any trade or business carried on by that undertaking, but does not include any amount receivable, whether received or not, from the sale of capital assets, gems or jeweler or any profits and income not being profits and income within the meaning of paragraph (a) of section 3.

For the purposes of this section the expression non- traditional goods means goods other than black tea not in packet or package form and each packet or package weighing not more than one kilogram, crepe rubber, sheet rubber, scrap rubber, latex or fresh coconuts or any other produce referred to in section 16, but include organic tea in bulk.

Rates specified in the Fifth Schedule

[111] The Fifth Schedule specifies the rates for the application of Sections 42 and 52 as follows:

Fifth Schedule

The following rates shall be applicable notwithstanding the rates

specified in the First, Second and Third Schedules.

6. The rate of income tax on profits and income arising before April 1, 2011, to any consignor or consignee from entrepot trade involving precious stones, metals not mined in Sri Lanka or any petroleum, gas or petroleum products or such other approved products (section 42) 10 per centum

44

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

18. The rate of income tax on qualified export profits and income of a company, which commenced to carry on any specified undertaking prior to April 1, 2015, for-

(a) any year of assessment commencing prior to April 1, 2011 15 per centum

(b) any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2011 (Section 52)

12 per centum

[112] To be eligible for the concessionary tax rate under Section 42 of the

Inland Revenue Act, as specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue

Act, No. 10 of 2006, the Appellant must satisfy that:

I. it has brought goods into Sri Lanka on a consignment basis; and

II. it is re-exporting such goods without subjecting it to any process of

manufacture;

[113] The term re-export is the process of exporting goods that

were previously imported into a country in the same state as previously

imported (Cambridge English Dictionary). At the hearing, both Counsel

made submissions on the question as to whether the activity of the

Appellant constitutes an export within the meaning of Sections 42 or

qualified export within the meaning of Section 52 of the Inland Revenue

Act. The fundamental question that arises for consideration is whether or

not, the supply of bunker fuel to ships by the Appellant constitutes an

export within the meaning of Sections 42 of the Inland Revenue Act, No.

10 of 2006.

[114] On the other hand, the Appellant contends that it being a specified

undertaking earned a qualified export profits and income from such

undertaking and therefore, the Appellant being a qualified exporter falls

within the meaning of Section 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006

(as amended). The fundamental question that arises for consideration is

whether or not, the profits and income of the Appellant being a specified

undertaking were derived from the export of bunker fuel to be treated as a

qualified export profits and income within the meaning of Section 52 of

the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

45

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

Issue

[115] Accordingly, this case stated raises an interesting, but intricate the

fundamental question whether or not the supply of bunker fuel to vessels

constitutes an export within the meaning of Section 42 or 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended) to be eligible for the

concessionary rate of tax specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

Definition of the term export

[116] As the Inland Revenue Act does not provide a statutory definition to

the term export, this Court has to decide what is envisaged by the term

export for the purpose of Sections 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act,

No. 10 of 2006. It has now become necessary to construe the scope of the

term export by using its ordinary or literal meanings in common parlance

as understood in its natural and grammatic manner in the context in which

it occurs for the application of Sections 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue

Act, no 10 of 2006 as amended.

[117] Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edition, page 28), deals

with the concept of literal construction in the following words:

The first and most elementary rule of construction is that if it is to be assumed that the words and phrases of technical legislation are used in their technical meaning if they have acquired one, and otherwise in their ordinary meaning, and the second is that the phrases and sentences are to be construed according to the rules of grammar. 'The length and detail of modern legislation, wrote Lord Evershed M.R., 'has undoubtedly reinforced the claim of literal construction as the only safe rule.' If there is nothing to modify, alter or qualify the language which the statute contains, it must be construed in the ordinary and natural meaning of the words and sentences. The safer and more correct course of dealing with a question of construction is to take the words themselves and arrive if possible at their meaning without, in the first instance, reference to cases.

[118] In Craies on Statute Law (7th Edition, page 65), it is stated that:

Where the language of an Act is clear and explicit, we must give effect to it, whatever may be the consequences, for in that case the words of the statute speak the intention of the legislature.

46

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

[119] In M.N. Dastur and Co. Ltd. and Ors. vs. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.

(28.02.2005 - CALHC), it was stated that

Words used in a statute dealing with matters relating to the general public are presumed to have been used in their popular rather than narrow, legal or technical sense. The doctrine of Loquitur ut vulgus, i.e., according to the common understanding and acceptance of the terms, is to be applied in construing the words used in statute dealing with matters relating to the public in general. If an Act is directed to dealings with matters affecting everybody generally, the words used, have the meaning attached to them in the common and ordinary use of language.

[120] Lord Easter, in Unwin v. Hanson (1891) 2 QB 115 (CA) has further

explained the manner in which the words used in statutes dealing with

matters relating to the public in general are construed at page 119 as

follows:

Now when we have to consider the construction of words such as this occurring in Acts of Parliament, we must treat the question thus: If the Act is directed to dealing with matters affecting everybody generally, the words used have the meaning attached to them in the common and ordinary use of language. If the Act is one passed with reference to a particular trade, business, or transaction, and words are used which everybody conversant with that trade, business, or transaction, knows and understands to have a particular meaning in it, then the words are to be construed as having that particular meaning, though it may differ from the common or ordinary meaning of the words.

[121] In the Blacks Law Dictionary, Revised Edition, the term export is

defined in the following manner:

EXPORT, v. To carry or to send abroad. Tennessee Oil Co. v. McCanless, 178 Tenn: 683, 157 S.W. 2d 267, 271, 272. To send, take, or carry an article of trade or commerce out of the country. To transport merchandise from one country to another in the course of trade. To carry out or convey goods by sea. State v. Turner, 5 Har., Del., 501....

"Export," in its primary sense, means to carry or send out of a place, and in secondary sense means to carry from one state or country. McKesson & Robbins v. Collins, 18 Cal.App.2d 648, 64 P.2d 469, 470.

[122] The definition of export from the Oxford Advanced American

Dictionary is the selling and transporting of goods to another country. In

47

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

Cambridge Advance Learners Dictionary defines the term exportation as

the process of sending goods to another country for sale. In the Merriam-

Webster Online Dictionary, the term export means to carry or send

(something, such as a commodity) to some other place (such as another

country). Accordingly, the Dictionary meaning of the word export of

goods as normally understood is sending goods from one country to

another country for sale.

[123] However, the meaning of a word in a statute may also be affected

by its context, which may consist of surrounding sections, the whole Act

or the scheme or purpose of the legislation and the exceptions or

deduction granted thereunder. Thus, one has to construe the scope of

the term export in the context in which it occurs in Sections 42 and 52

of the Inland Revenue Act, having regard to the nature of the goods that

are to be exported, namely, the bunker fuel being a petroleum product

which is not manufactured in Sri Lanka but, used for the navigation of

vessels, and the purpose for which such exports are qualified for

concessionary tax rates under the Inland Revenue Act.

Imports & Exports (Control) Act

[124] The Appellant, however argues that as the Inland Revenue Act does

not define the term export, nor does it specify the criteria that must be

affirmatively satisfied in order that a supply may be classified as an export,

recourse must be had to the general principles of law applicable for the

purposes of determining what constitutes an export. This Court is now

required to find out what is meant by the phrase " export" for the purpose

of the Section 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, and whether the mere

supply of bunker fuel to a ship constitutes an export under Sections 42 or

52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.

[125] The Appellant relies on the definition of the term exportation given

in the Stroud Judicial Dictionary, Vo. II 1903 referring to the decision in A.G.

v Pougett 2 Price, 381) and Stockton Ry v. Barrett, 11 Cl. & F. 590) in support

of his contention that the word export for the purpose of the Inland

Revenue Act, is not restricted to an exportation to foreign countries, but

may mean a carrying out of the Port The Stroud Judicial Dictionary, Vo. II

1903 defines the term exportation referring to the decision in A.G. v

Pougett 2 Price, 381, as follows:

48

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

Unless a vessel has proceeded out of the limits of the Port with her cargo, it is not such an Exportation of the goods as will protect the cargo from duties subsequently imposed on the Exportation of goods of the same nature; although the vessel is not only freighted and afloat but has gone through all the formalities of Clearance, & at the Custom House and has paid the Exportation Dues.

[126] In A.G. v Pougett (supra), the question was whether the goods laden

on board the ship, having broken ground in the Themes, and not having left

the port of London may be said to have been exported. It was held that the

goods shipped could not be considered as exported until the ship had

cleared the limits of the ports as follows:

It is significant to know that this action was decided under the Tyne Coal Dues Act 1872 and the Court held that There is nothing in the language of the Act (the Tyne Coal Dues Act 1872) to show that the word exported was used in any other than its ordinary sense, namely, carried out of the port ..We feel bound to hold that coals carried away from the port, not on a temporary excursion, as in a tug or pleasure boat, which intends to return with more or less of the coals on board, and which may be regarded as always constructively within the port, but taken away for the purpose of being wholly consumed beyond this limits of the port, are coals exported within the meaning of the Act. (Muller v Baldwin (1874) L.R. 9 O.B 457, per cur., at p. 461).

[127] It is significant to note that A.G. v Pougett (supra) was not an income

tax or custom case, but a decision under the Tyne Coals Act which has now

been abolished. There was clear evidence in that case that the coals had

been taken away for the purpose of being wholly consumed beyond the

limits of the port and thus, the coals were held to be exported

[128] In Stockton Ry v. Barrett, 8 E.R. 1225 (House of Lords), the action was

for money had and received, originally brought in the Court of Common

Pleas, to recover three sums of money, which the plaintiff there, Charles

Barrett, alleged had been unlawfully received by the defendants as tolls on

the carriage of certain coals carried on the line of the Stockton and

Darlington Railway, of which they were the proprietors.

[129] It was held that the words shipped for Exportation are not,

necessarily, restricted to an exportation to foreign countries, but may mean

Exportation in its evident sense, i.e., a carrying out of Port, and thus, include

49

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

carrying commodities from one port to another, within the Kingdom and

that the words "the port of Stockton-upon-Tees aforesaid," meant the

whole port of that name, and was not restricted to the port of the town of

Stockton-upon-Tees;

[130] That action was, however, decided under the Railway Act, which

empowered the proprietors to levy on all coals carried along any part of

their line, such sum as they should direct, " not exceeding the sum of 4d.

per ton per mile." It then went on thus: " And for all coal, which shall be

shipped on board any vessel, etc. in the port of Stockton-upon-Tees

aforesaid, for the purpose of exportation, such sum as the said proprietors

shall appoint, not exceeding the sum of one-halfpenny per ton per mile: "

[131] As noted, the cases relied on by the Appellant relate to the statutory

interpretation given to the term exportation in different statutes, which

are unrelated to tax statutes, and such decisions cannot, in my view, be

used to determine the question as to whether the supply of bunker fuel to

a ship for its navigation or use during its voyage constitutes an export for

the purpose of the concessionary tax rates conferred by Sections 42 or 52

of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.

[132] The Appellant, however, relied on the Imports and Exports (Control)

Act, No. 1 of 1969, and the Customs Ordinance in support of its position

that the supply of bunker fuel constitutes an export having regard to the

definition of the term export in the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No.

1 of 1969. For this aspect of the case, it is appropriate to take note of Section

22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, no. 1 of 1969, which provides

for levy of tax. The term export is defined in Section 22 of the Imports &

Exports (Control) Act, 1969 as follows:

export with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions when used in relation to any goods, means the carrying and taking out of Sri Lanka, or causing to be carried or taken out of Sri Lanka, whether by sea or by air of such goods

[133] Accordingly, the statutory definition of the term export refers to the

actual carrying and taking out of Sri Lanka or causing to be carried out of

Sri Lanka of the goods in question by sea or by air of such goods. The

learned counsel for the Appellant relied heavily on the definition of "export"

in Section 22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act and it was argued

50

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

that since the definition does not refer to the requirement of destination,

the same applies to the concessionary tax rate under the Inland Revenue

Act. On this basis the Appellant argues that the Imports and Exports

(Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969 would indicate the statutory criteria applicable

for determining whether or not a person is an exporter for the purpose of

the Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.

[134] The question that arises for determination is whether the definition

of the term export in the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, is the

determinative factor in deciding that the bunker fuel had been exported

within the meaning of Sections 42 or Section 52 of the Inland Revenue Act,

No. 10 of 2006.

Customs Ordinance

[135] The Appellant further argues that the concept of export defined in

Section 22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act is further confirmed by

Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance, which indicates the point of time

when an export is deemed to have taken place and an exportation of any

goods is made and completed shall be deemed to have had effect when the

goods had been shipped on board the ship in which they had been

exported. Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance provides as follows:

If upon the first levying or repealing of any duty, or upon the first permitting or prohibiting of any importation or exportation whether inwards, outwards, or coastwise in Sri Lanka, it shall - become necessary to determine the precise time at which an importation or exportation of any goods made and completed shall be deemed to have had effect, such time, in respect of importation, shall be deemed to be the time at which the ship importing such goods had actually come within the limits of the port at which such ship shall in due course be reported and such goods be discharged; and such time, in. respect of exportation, shall be deemed to be the time at which the goods had been shipped on board the ship in which they had been exported; and if such question shall arise upon the arrival or departure of any ship, in respect of any charge or allowance upon such ship, exclusive' of any cargo, the time of such arrival shall be deemed to be the time at which the report of such ship shall have been or ought to have been made; and the time of such departure shall be deemed to be the time of the last clearance of such ship with the Director-General for the voyage upon which she had departed.

51

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

[136] That means that an importation starts from one point and ends at

another. It starts when the goods cross the customs barrier in a foreign

country (exporting country) and ends when they cross the limits of the port

in Sri Lanka (importing Country). In the case of exportation, the time of

exportation under section 16 shall be deemed to be the time at which the

goods had been shipped on board the ship, in which the goods had been

exported, and it starts when the goods cross the customs limits of the port

of one country (exporting country) and delivered to the ship on board in

which such goods are exported to another country (importing country).

[137] In terms of this Section, the precise time at which exportation of any

goods shall be deemed to be the time at which the goods had been shipped

on board the ship in which they had been exported. Accordingly, the

Appellant argues that the statutory criteria applicable for determining

whether or not a person is an exporter, the destination is not a requirement

to be fulfilled under the law of Sri Lanka.

[138] The argument of the Appellant is that Section 22 of the Imports and

Exports (Control) Act read with Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance refer

to goods being taken out of the country rather than the goods necessarily

being delivered to another country. Accordingly, it was argued on behalf of

the Appellant referring to Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance that as the

time of the export of goods occurs when the goods have been put on the

ship, which constitutes an export notwithstanding the fact that the ship is

within Sri Lankan territorial waters at the time of the delivery of the bunker

fuel. He further argued that the consumption, utilization or sale of the

bunker fuel occurs once the vessel leaves the Colombo Port into the

international waters and thus, the goods are taken out of the country.

[139] On the other hand, Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance applies to

the definition of time of importation or exportation of prohibited or

restricted goods and goods illegally imported for the purpose of levying or

repealing of any duty under the Customs Ordinance. This Section has to be

read with Section 3 of the Protection of Government Revenue (Special

provisions) Act, No. 1 of 2006, according to which the date of importation

or exportation ...shall be the date of delivery to the Director General of

Customs of the bill of entry. Section 3 of the Protection of Government

Revenue (Special provisions) Act reads as follows:

52

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any of the laws specified in Part II of the Schedule hereto, for the purpose of levying or charging any tax, duty, surcharge, levy or other charge on the importation or exportation of goods into or from Sri Lanka, the date of importation or exportation, as the case may be, shall be the date of delivery to the Director-General of Customs, of the bill of entry relating to the goods on which such tax, duty, surcharge, levy or other charge is levied or charged.

[140] The Schedule includes, inter alia, the Customs Ordinance (Cap. 235),

as last amended by Act, No. 2 of 2003. For the purpose of levying or

charging any tax, duty, surcharge, levy or other charge on the importation

or exportation of goods into or from Sri Lanka, the date of importation or

exportation, as the case may be, under the Protection of Government

Revenue (Special provisions) Act shall be the date of delivery to the

Director-General of Customs, of the bill of entry relating to the goods on

which such tax, duty, surcharge, levy or other charge is levied or charged.

[141] As noted, for the purpose of the protection of government revenue

and prevention of any loss of revenue to the Government, the date of

importation or exportation of goods, the date of delivery is limited to the

levying or charging any tax, duty, surcharge, levy or other charge under the

Customs Ordinance. The principles for the charging of income tax under

the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 are not applicable.

[142] Accordingly, for the purpose of levying or repealing of any customs

duty upon the first permitting or prohibiting of any importation or

exportation of prohibited/restricted goods and goods illegally imported,

the time of importation shall be the time at which the ship importing such

goods had actually come within the limits of the port at which such ship

shall be reported and such goods be discharged. In case of exportation of

prohibited/restricted goods and goods illegally exported, the time of

exportation shall be the time at which the goods had been shipped on

board the ship.

[143] To constitute an export under Section 22 of the Import and Export

(Control) Act, the goods must be either taken out of the territory of Sri Lanka

or caused to be taken out of Sri Lanka, by sea or air of such goods. This

means that the mere delivery of the bunker fuel into the tanks of the ship

is insufficient to constitute an export unless such fuel had been either

53

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

actually taken out of Sri Lanka or caused to be taken out of Sri Lanka on a

ship bound for a place out of Sri Lanka.

[144] The Imports and Exports (Control) Act is intended to provide for the

control of the importation and exportation of goods and regulation of the

standards of exportable goods. The provisions of the Imports and Exports

(Control) Act shall be, however, read and construed with the Customs

Ordinance as set out in Section 21 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act.

In terms of Section 21 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, the

provisions of the Act shall be construed with the Customs Ordinance and

for the purpose of the application of the Customs Ordinance-

(a). goods the importation of which is prohibited by this Act or by regulation made under this Act shall be deemed to be goods the importation of which is prohibited by that Ordinance;

(b) goods the exportation of which is prohibited by this Act or by regulation made under this Act shall be deemed to be goods the exportation of which is prohibited by that Ordinance;

(c) goods the importation of which is restricted by this Act or by regulation made under this Act shall be deemed to be goods the importation of which is restricted by that Ordinance;

(d) goods the exportation of which is restricted by this Act or by regulation made under this Act shall be deemed to be goods the exportation of which is restricted by that Ordinance.

[145] As noted, Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance, which applies to the

definition of time of importation or exportation for prohibited or restricted

goods and goods illegally imported for the purpose of levying or repealing

of any duty under the Customs Ordinance and thus, it cannot be strictly

applied for the purpose of interpreting the term export and levying

income tax under the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

[146] The provisions of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act shall be read

and construed with the Customs Ordinance and thus, the goods either

prohibited or restricted by the provisions of the Imports and Exports

(Control) Act shall be deemed to be the goods prohibited or restricted by

the Customs Ordinance. In the result, the definition of export in section 22

of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act cannot be strictly applied to the

54

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

interpretation of the term export for the concessionary tax rate under

Sections 42 and 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

Customs Clearance

[147] The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Appellant has a special customs entry passed when it issued marine bunker fuel to foreign ships which are paid in foreign currency and such custom clearance and payment made in foreign currency shall be regarded as evidence that the supply of bunker fuel was an export transaction outside Sri Lanka in terms of the provisions of the Protection of Government Revenue (Special Provisions) Act No. 1 of 2006. The Appellant also relies on the Indian decision in CIT v. Silver and Arts Palace (2003) 259 ITR 684 to argue that the customs clearance is evidence that characterizes the transaction as an export. It is the position of the Appellant that once the goods are kept in the customs clearance station, then, the goods shall be deemed to have been in the export stream.

[148] The said case related to the refusal of the deduction claimed by the assessed under Section 80HHC of The Income- Tax Act, 1995 placing reliance on Explanation (aa) to Section 80HHC(4A) of the Act. The said Section provides that "'export out of India' shall not include any transaction by way of sale or otherwise, in a shop, emporium or any other establishment situate in India, not involving clearance at any customs station as defined in the Customs Act, 1962 (52 of 1962)." There was no despite in that case that transactions of counter sales effected by the respondent involved customs clearance within the meaning of Explanation (aa) to Section 80HHC(4A) of the Act, and further that the sales were in convertible foreign exchange.

[149] If the above interpretation applies to the export in question as projected by Dr. Felix in the written submissions filed on behalf of the Appellant, then, it would mean that irrespective of the condition in Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, the delivery of goods shall be after customs clearance, i.e., after goods have cleared all local customs and all other legal formalities and are kept ready for delivery to the ships tanks, the Appellant would qualify for the concessionary tax rates specified in the Fifth Schedule to the Inland Revenue Act.

[150] In my opinion, the concept sought to put in service in CIT v. Silver and Arts Palace (supra) cannot be applied to the facts of this case and therefore, the submission of customs clearance per se does not constitute an

55

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

Appellant an exporter of the bunker fuel under Sections 42 of 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended).

Use of Foreign Currency

[151] The learned Counsel for the Appellant citing the Exchange Control Act,

No. 24 of 1953, as amended, submitted that the fact that the Appellant is

permitted by the Central Bank to accept foreign currency payments for

supplies of marine bunker fuel to ships travelling in international waters

supports the position of the Appellant that the sales undertaken by the

Appellant are not local sales but are in fact exports. He submitted that it is

an offence to accept foreign currency for a local sale and therefore, this

transaction should be construed to be an export.

[152] On the other hand, the Central Bank has powers to permit any person

under Section 7 of the Exchange Control Act, to make any payment to, or

for the credit of a person resident outside Sri Lanka or make any payment

to or for the credit of a person resident in Sri Lanka. In my view the mere

fact that the sale of bunker fuel was paid for in foreign currency does not

necessarily render it an export within the meaning of Sections 42 or 52 of

the Inland Revenue Acts

License under the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act, No. 28 of 1961

[153] The Appellant argues that the Appellant possesses a license under

Section 5B of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act, No. 28 of 1961 to

import, export, sell, supply or distribute marine gas, oil and furnace oil

(Vide- paragraph 43 of the written submissions tendered on behalf of the

Appellant on 18.10.2019). In my view, the Appellant, on a license granted by

the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation under Section 5B of the Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation Act, No. 28 of 1961 does not necessarily mean that

the supply of bunker fuel shall be treated as an export within the meaning

of Sections license 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

Central Bank Annual Reports

[154] The Appellant relies heavily on the Annual Reports of the Central Bank

for the year 2011 in table 3.4 on page 63, which, the Appellant claims

distinguishes between exports and local sales and table 3.4 which lists the

Appellant as a source for both imports and export data. The Appellant

56

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

submits that the Report supports his contention that the supply of bunker

fuel has been recognized as an export by the Central Bank. In my view, the

table 3.4 does not support the contention that the it distinguishes between

exports and local sales or that the Central Bank has recognized the

Appellant as an exporter within the meaning of any statute as claimed by

the Appellant.

[155] The document (R1) issued by the Central Bank stated that for

statistical compilation and economic analysis, bunker fuel and marine fuel

selling to foreign ships and aircraft is an export following internationally

accepted practices for economic data compilation. It, however, states that

this classification is not used for any other purpose as the classification is

not made in terms of any law or for the purpose of any law. Accordingly,

this document does not help the Appellant.

[156] The Appellant relies on the New Zeeland Court of Appeal case in

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. International Importing Limited (1972)

NZLR 1095 in support its position that the word export is complete when

(I) taking the goods out of the country and (ii) sending them or causing them

to be sent out. The question in the said case was whether, for the purposes

of Section 129B of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954, the goods sold by a

"duty free shop operated by respondent company, to travelers departing

overseas, and the subsequent carriage of those goods beyond New

Zealand by the purchasers, constituted the "export of those goods by the

company, entitling it to the deduction given for income tax purposes by s

129B. Section129B of the said Act reads as follows:

"Export goods means goods exported from New Zealand by a taxpayer, being goods (a) Which were sold or disposed of by the taxpayer; and (b) Of which the taxpayer was the owner at the time of the sale or disposal but does not include

(c) Goods exported by way of gift: (d) Goods taken or sent out of New Zealand with the intention that they will at some later time be brought or sent back to New Zealand: (e) Goods imported into New Zealand and subsequently exported from New Zealand after being processed, packed, graded, or sorted in New

57

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

Zealand or incorporated with another product in New Zealand, if the

consideration receivable for the sale or disposal of the goods so exported is less than fifteen percent greater than the cost of all imported goods included in the goods so exported, such cost being the landed cost of those imported goods (exclusive of New Zealand customs duty) at the time when they were imported into New Zealand: (f) Goods imported into New Zealand and subsequently exported from New Zealand in the same form without processing, packing, grading, or sorting thereof in New Zealand: (g) Goods exported to the Cook Islands (including Niue) or to the Tokelau Islands:

(h) Animals, animal products and by-products (including dairy produce, meat, meat products, wool, and their respective by-products), newsprint, and minerals: Provided that the Governor-General may from time to time, by Order in Council, exclude any such goods or any specified class or classes of such goods from the operation of this paragraph: (i) Any other goods specified by the Governor-General from time to time by Order in Council:

[157] The vital question in that case was whether goods which were sold by

the respondent (and of which it was admittedly the owner at the time of such sales) were exported from New Zealand by the respondent within the opening words of the foregoing definition. The finding of the Commissioner was challenged on one question only, namely his finding that the goods sold to departing travelers in the respondent's duty-free shops were exported by the respondent.

[158] The transactions were sales of goods of which respondent was the owner at the time of sale. The goods were taken out of the country as a direct result of the sale, and as one intended by both vendor and purchaser. And these were sales and the immediate result of which was an increase in

foreign currency reserves, and (1) taking the goods out of the country, and (2) sending them or causing them to be sent outthe choice between them depends on the answer to the question: What operation is it that the Section is obviously designed to subsidize? Turner J, at pp 1097 stated:

58

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

The section contains no definition of "export nor can it be contended that this word is a term of art. It must therefore be given its ordinary meaning, or perhaps I should say one of its ordinary meanings, to be selected according to context. Clearly if it is given one of its ordinary meanings the travelers may be said to have "exported the goods themselves, for they carried them (if small enough) on to the plane personally, keeping them in their possession while the plane flew out of New Zealand. And no different result follows in the case of the larger packages which were put into the plane's hold, of which the passenger-purchasers doubtless must be deemed to have had possession at the time when they were taken out of the country. The above-mentioned second illustration that goods put on board a streamer bound for a foreign country, but jettisoned can still be said to have been exported, even though they do not reach their destination vividly explains this proposition in case of bunker fuel which is supplied for navigation. The legislation is plainly addressed to those persons, and to those alone, who increase the foreign exchange reserves of New Zealand, by sending goods abroad, or causing them to be sent abroad, receiving in return foreign exchange for which they are bound to account, and do accounting, to the Reserve Bank. It is clear that even if the travelers may be regarded as themselves "exporting the goods, the word "export where used in the section must also clearly be applicable to those, such as respondent company, who send the goods abroad, or cause them to be sent, with this result. Surely a dairy company "exports butter, and a fruit cannery "exports its manufactures, whether it ships the goods to its own order in another country, or sells here f.o.b. to a foreign person or corporation, provided simply that the transaction is one in which it causes goods to be sent abroad in exchange for foreign currency which it receives and for which it accounts. It is to be observed however that s 129B is solely concerned with the actions of vendors. In our opinion a vendor may export either by taking or by sending. There will be many cases where it can be said that the buyer exports by taking, as for example in the case of an ordinary contract.

[159] Thus, Turner J., stated that the question whether the respondent or the passengers, who is to be regarded, for the purposes of s 129B, as

having "exported the goods which it sold to the travelers. Referring to the meanings of the word (1) taking the goods out of the country, and (2) sending them or causing them to be sent outthe choice between them depends on the answer to the question: What operation was it that the section is obviously designed to subsidize? On this approach to the matter,

59

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

it seemed clear to subsidize Turner J. that it is respondent's operation which

was meant to receive the reward offered by the statute.

[160] The facts of the New Zeeland judgment and the legal principles discussed under Section 129B of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 are completely different in the present case for the following reasons:

1. The Respondent in that case owned and operated a duty-free shop at

the "Christchurch International Duty-Free Shops and the passengers were allowed to purchase goods from a duty-free shop situated in the departure lounge of the airport to be taken out of New Zealand. The

question that was decided was whether or not it was the respondent or the passengers who is to be regarded, for the purposes of s 129B, as having "exported the goods which it sold to the travelers. In the present case, the issue was whether or not the supply of bunker fuel to a ship constitutes an export for the purpose of the concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

2. The New Zeeland Act provides that to constitute an export goods, the

goods exported by a taxpayer from New Zeeland shall be goods exported which were sold or disposed of by the taxpayer; and of which the taxpayer was the owner at the time of the sale or disposal.

Section 129B of the New Zeeland Act is not so worded as to require the taxpayer to be the owner of the goods at the time of export. The Section only requires that he should be the owner of the goods at the time of sale. There is no similar requirement in the Inland Revenue Act of Sri Lanka.

3. The New Zeeland decision is also based on the operation mode of the

taxpayer as the owner of the goods. In order to purchase the goods from the duty-free shop, the customer has to produce his boarding pass to the aircraft and his flight number to the duty-free shop owned by the Respondent. The goods, in the open bags were handed to the

passenger at the call to board the aircraft by the employees of the respondent on production of their copy of the sales docket in the clear area at the airport and in the presence of Customs Officers. There are no such conditions to be fulfilled for the charging of income tax under the Inland Revenue Act.

60

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

4. As a matter of fact, and degree, the whole nature of the respondent's

specialized business and the circumstances under which it is conducted, taken together with the actual part played by the respondent in bringing about the removal from New Zealand of goods sold by it to departing passengers, proved that the respondent exported the goods in question by sending them out of New Zealand. There the duty-free sale occurred inside the departure lounge of the airport after the passengers were cleared for immigration and already stamped as having left the country by the customs officer that was strong evidence to establish that the passengers had already left the country. In the circumstances, the

Court treated the goods to be export goods within the meaning of section 129B of the New Zeeland Act.

[161] Under such circumstances, the Court came to the conclusion that the whole nature of the respondent's specialized business and the circumstances under which it is conducted, taken together with the actual part played by the respondent in bringing about the removal from New Zealand of goods sold by it to departing passengers, justify the view that the respondent exported the goods by sending them out of New Zeeland. in my view the New Zealand case will not support the stand taken by the Appellant in the instant case and it cannot be regarded as a precedent for the case in hand.

[162] The Canadian case of R v.Wuulf (1970) 1 CCC (2d) 281 relied on by the

Appellant is a criminal case for attempting to export out of Canada to the

USA silver coins of Canada without a permit and the issue arose about the

definition of the word export under the statute. It was held that the word

export was simply take outside of Canada. The definition of the term

export for the purpose of criminal liability of attempting to export goods

under a criminal statute cannot be used to define the term export for the

purpose of defining the term export under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act.

[163] In R. v. Smith (Donald) (1973) Q.B. 924, the defendant was charged

with being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the

prohibition against the importation of cannabis imposed by the Dangerous

Drugs Act 1965 , contrary to Section 304 (b) of the Customs and Excise Act

1952, and with being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the

61

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

prohibition against the exportation of cannabis imposed by the Act of 1965,

contrary to Section 56 (2) of the Act of 1952.

[164] In that case, packets containing cannabis addressed to a person in

Bermuda were put on board an aircraft in Kenya, which was bound for

Heathrow Airport in the United Kingdom. At Heathrow, the packets were

unloaded and without leaving the customs area were put on board a

second aircraft bound for Bermuda. The cannabis was discovered when the

packets arrived in Bermuda. The question was whether the prohibited

goods retained within the customs area were imported into the United

Kingdom. It was held that although the cannabis had merely been

transferred from one aircraft to another, the cannabis had been imported

into the country when the aircraft from Kenya landed at Heathrow and had

been exported when placed on board the aircraft bound for Bermuda (post,

p. 935G-H).

[165] In A.G. v. Kumarasinghe (1995) 2 Sri LR. 1, the accused, a Sri Lankan

passport holder was indicted for having imported into Sri Lanka, 40 pieces

of Gold valued at Rs. 2 million without a valid permit issued by the Central

Bank. After arriving in Sri Lanka on an Air Lanka flight, he had been at the

Transit Lounge with the pieces of gold to proceed to Male. The High Court

of Negombo acquitted the accused. Referring to R. Smith (supra), it was

held that (i) Importation is not defined in the Exchange Control Act, but

recourse could be had to Section 22 of the Imports and Exports (Control)

Act 1 of 1969; and (ii) the moment the accused-respondent landed in Sri

Lankan soil with gold, the act of importation was complete, if he failed to

produce the requisite permit for possession of that gold. Accordingly, it was

held that he has contravened the provisions of Section 21(1).

[166] In all three criminal cases, the accused was considered to be an

exporter on the basis that he was himself involved physically importing

prohibited goods into a foreign country without a permit in violation of a

criminal statute either under the Customs Act or Imports and Exports Act.

Here, the issue is whether or not the supply of the bunker fuel to a ship that

visits a port of Sri Lanka can constitute an export for the purpose of

concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

[167] The other argument of the Appellant was that as the consumption of

bunker fuel occurs mid-voyage in international waters of another country,

62

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

the question of Bill of Lading or Insurance Contract does not arise and thus,

the mere fact that the goods do not arise at a foreign port does not

preclude the goods from being considered an export. The argument of the

Appellant was that the mere supply of bunker fuel to a foreign ship and

utilization of such bunker fuel in the international waters constitutes an

export within the meaning of Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Acts

Although the argument is attractive, I am afraid that I do not find any merit

in the same.

[168] The charging provision in Section 2 is the prime purpose of the Inland

Revenue Act and it shall control the profits and income that is chargeable

with income tax subject to the provisions of the said Act. As noted, the

charging Section is not controlled by the measure of tax levied under the

provisions of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act or the Customs

Ordinance. The relevant statutory provisions with regard to levy of customs

duties are found in the Customs Ordinance and the relevant statutory

provisions with regard to the imposition of income tax are found in the

Inland Revenue Act.

[169] The principles of charging the income tax and the principles of

customs are distinct, different and independent of each other. The income

tax is charged on profits or income of a person which falls within the scope

of Section 2 of the Inland Revenue Act and the rate of income tax varies

subject to the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act. Customs Duty is a tax

imposed on imports and exports of goods under the Customs Ordinance

when they are transported across international borders and the rate of

Customs duty varies subject to the provisions of the Customs Ordinance.

[170] When the provisions of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act are read

and construed with the Customs Ordinance, the goods either prohibited or

restricted by the provisions of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act shall

be deemed to be the goods prohibited or restricted by the Customs

Ordinance. The Customs Ordinance takes care of levy of import of goods

or export of goods and thus, the taxable event for levy of custom duty and

entry tax are different and distinct. The pith and substance" and "aspect"

of custom levy, as regards both imports and exports in terms of restrictions,

prohibition and permissibility are different and distinct from the charging

of income tax under the Inland Revenue Act.

63

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

[171] The learned counsel for the Appellant submits that the definition of

"export" as defined in Section 22 of the Imports and Exports (Control) Act

does not include "place of destination but only Taking out of Sri Lanka or

causing to be carried or taken out of Sri Lanka and, therefore, the concept

of destination on the supply of bunker fuel to a ship is clearly beyond the

ambit of Inland Revenue Act. In my view, Section 22 of the Imports and

Exports (Control) Act or the Customs Ordinance has no overriding effect

over the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act and the imposition of income

tax under the provisions of the said Acts are based on different principles

and the fulfilment of different conditions.

[172] If the Legislature intended to apply the same term export for the

purpose of Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, the Legislature

could have easily used the same meaning as defined in Section 22 of the

Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No. 1 of 1969. Thus, the argument of the

Appellant that since the place of destination is not specifically mentioned

in the definition of "export" in Section 22 of the 42 or Imports and Exports

(Control) Act, it will give rise to the inference that Legislature intended not

make the concept of destination as a requirement of export for the

purposes of Section 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act is without

substance.

[173] This case is not concerned about the imposition of levy under the

Imports and Exports (Control) Act or the Customs Ordinance, and we are

dealing with the imposition of income tax and the concessionary tax rates

specified in the Fifth Schedule to the said Act. This Court is not inclined to

apply the principles of the imposition of levy under the Imports and Exports

(Control) Act or the Customs Ordinance to a case of export under Sections

42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

[174] It is only from the language of the statute that the intention of the

Legislature (Inland Revenue Act) must be gathered, for the Legislature

means no more and no less than what it says. It is not permissible for the

court to speculate as to what the Legislature (here the Inland Revenue Act)

must have intended and then to twist or bend the language of a different

statute (the Customs Ordinance and the Imports and Exports (Control) Act

to make it accord with the presumed intention of the Legislature (see-

64

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

Polestar Electronic (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Additional Commissioner, Sales Tax, 1978]

41 STC 409 (SC).

[175] Of course, equitable construction may be admissible in relation to

other statutes, but such an interpretation is not permitted to a charging or

taxing provision of a statute (see-Murarilal Mahabir Prasad v. B.R. Vad

[1976] 37 STC 77 (SC), which has laid down the tax is altogether different

from the recovery of the tax/duty under the Imports and Exports (Control)

Act and the Customs Ordinance

UN Report

[176] The Appellant relied on the United Nations Department of Economic

and Social Affairs-International Merchandise Trade Statistics: Concept and

Definitions (IMTS 2010) to substantiate its position that that the supply of

bunker fuel to ships travelling in international waters constitutes an export.

Paragraph 1.32 at page 18 of the Report on Bunkers, stores, ballast and

damage reads as follows:

1.32. Bunkers, stores, ballast and damage that are supplied:

1. to foreign vessels or aircraft in the economic territory of the

compiling country; or 2. by national vessels or aircraft to foreign vessels or aircraft outside

the economic territory of the compiling country; or 3. are landed in foreign ports from national vessels or aircraft;

are in the scope of IMTS 2010 for exports.

[177] Paragraph 1.42 which relates to goods recommended for exclusion

reads:

1.42. Goods simply being transported include goods under in transit or in transshipment customs procedures but are not limited to them. ...Irrespective of the custom procedure applied when goods cross the compiling countrys border, if it is known that their destination is a third country, the goods should be treated as simply being transported through the country and excluded. However, goods that are not under in transit or transshipment customs procedure and change ownership after entering the economic territory of a country should be recoded as imports and re-exports if they leave the country in the state as imported....

65

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

[178] Firstly, the publication contains guidelines or recommendations and

therefore, Sri Lanka is not obliged to adhere to them. Secondly, these

guidelines or recommendations cannot change the principles of income tax

specified in the Inland Revenue Act of Sri Lanka. Thirdly, the guidelines first

classify the bunker fuel supplied to foreign vessels within the economic

territory as exports. They also classify the bunker fuel supplied by national

vessels to foreign vessels outside the economic territory as exports. Thirdly,

they classify the bunker fuel supplied to vessels that are landed in foreign

ports.

[179] It is my view, that the classification is based on the nationality of the

vessel which is not the basis on which the concept of export is decided in

the Inland Revenue Act of Sri Lanka. Fourthly, paragraph 1.42 states that

when goods are taken out of the territory of a country, the goods should be

treated as simply being transported to a third country where the destination

of a foreign country is known. It seems that the guidelines themselves,

recognize that where the destination is known, the goods may be said to

have been transported to a foreign country. For those reasons, I am of the

view that the UN Report will not support the contention of the Appellant in

the present case.

[180] In my view the mere supply or stores of bunker fuel in the ships tanks

for consumption on board a ship cannot possibly be a deemed export, and

such consumption by a foreign going ship cannot ever be considered as a

supply occasioning the export of bunker fuel unless there is documentary

evidence that manifest an indication that the ship that is consuming bunker

fuel for navigation on the high seas is intended to a foreign destination

point. Such documentary evidence in my view would exclude the possibility

that such goods are not meant for supply of local consumption, which does

not signify an export within the meaning of Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act.

Destination Principle.

[181] If the present transaction of the Appellant involves goods being moved

from one jurisdiction to another, the destination principle applies and under

the destination principle, the element of export is satisfied when the foreign

66

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

destination point is intended and indicated in the relevant documents

submitted by the Appellant.

[182] The mere delivery of the bunker fuel outside the customs barrier to

the vessel cannot be regarded as having taken place out of the territory of

Sri Lanka to constitute an export unless goods are taken out of Sri Lanka to

another foreign point and the element of taking out of the territory of Sri

Lanka to a destination point of another country become an integral part of

the transaction, to constitute an export under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act. A following illustrations given by Hidayatullah., J. In Burmah

Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Company case (supra) will explain this

proposition vividly. Goods cannot be said to be exported if they are ordered

by the health authorities to be destroyed by dumping them in the sea, and

for that purpose are taken out of the territories of India and beyond the

territorial wastes and dumped in the open sea (paragraph 36). Another

illustration is where goods put on board a streamer bound for a foreign

country, but jettisoned can still be said to have been exported, even

though they do not reach their destination (supra).

[183] The objective of granting the concessionary tax rates under Sections

42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act as regards the supply of bunker fuel to

foreign going ships for navigation is to attract foreign going ships to Sri

Lankan ports and promote bunkering industry. So that foreign going ships

will visit the Ports of Sri Lanka and receive bunker fuel for navigation on the

high seas in the course of its journey to the next foreign destination Port

and the suppliers will be benefited from the concessionary tax rates under

Section 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

[184] The term 'export' in Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act

signifies etymologically 'to take out of Sri Lanka into the territory of another

country, and therefore, means to take out of Sri Lanka, goods to a territory

of another country. Now the term "export " for the purpose the taking

bunker fuel out of Sri Lanka means taking out of Sri Lanka to any place

(destination point) in the high seas outside the territorial waters of Sri Lanka.

In this sense, any "place" beyond the territorial waters of Sri Lanka would be

a place outside the country. The test is that the sending of the bunker fuel

out of the country is satisfied when the bunker fuel, which is directly

delivered to the operator /owner of the foreign going vessel for navigation

67

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

on the high seas has a foreign destination point. The resulting position is

that the ownership of the bunker fuel will be transferred to the

owner/operator of the vessel by the supplier from a taxable activity and the

vessel will use those bunker fuels for navigation on the high seas intended

for a foreign destination point out of the Sri Lankan territorial waters (the

next foreign port). In short, to earn the exemption or concessionary tax rate,

the goods must have a foreign destination point where they can be said to

be taken out of Sri Lanka to constitute an export under Sections 42 or 52 of

the Inland Revenue Act.

[185] At the hearing, the learned Additional Solicitor-General submitted that

in order for a transaction to qualify as export, there should be a recipient for

such goods in another jurisdiction as an importer and as there was no

corresponding importer in another country to physically receive the goods,

the transition in the present case does not constitute an export. Bunker fuel

supplied to a foreign going vessel for navigation occasions an export and

eligible for the concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland

Revenue Act if it is delivered by the supplier directly to a foreign going vessel

and received by its owner/operator for navigation on the high seas out of

Sri Lanka, with evidence of a foreign destination point.

[186] I do not think that given the nature of the goods being the bunker fuel,

which is supplied to the operator/owner of the ship for navigation on the

high seas for the next foreign destination point, the requirement in

traditional export of cargo where the goods are exported to a specified

recipient in another foreign jurisdiction is necessary to constitute an export

under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act. The above-mentioned

second illustration that goods put on board a streamer bound for a foreign

country, but jettisoned can still be said to have been exported, even

though they do not reach their destination vividly explains this proposition

in case of bunker fuel which is supplied for navigation. Another illustration

is where goods shipped from Colombo intended for delivery in Bombay

proceeded on a voyage, leaving the Sri Lankan territorial waters, but

developed engine trouble and returned and ran aground in the Sri Lankan

territorial waters at Hambantota Port. In this illustration, the ship intended

to deliver the goods at Bombay Port (destination point) and moved out of

the Sri Lankan territorial waters and the export was complete when the

goods were taken beyond the territorial waters of Sri Lanka with the

68

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

intention of delivering at Bombay Port. The fact that the ship was brought

back to Sri Lanka did not affect as the goods sold were intended to be taken

to that foreign destination point, namely, the Bombay Port.

[187] I hold that the concessionary tax rates under Sections 42 or 52 of the

Inland Revenue Act in the present case applies to the bunker fuel directly

supplied to the operator or owner of the foreign going vessel to be used for

navigation on the high seas (out of the territorial waters of Sri Lanka) and

intended to a destination point of another country. This finding is limited to

this case and it shall not in any way be construed as an application to other

goods in respect of which concessionary tax rates are claimed under

Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act.

[188] How can the Appellant satisfy that that the ship carrying bunker fuel

for navigation was taken out of the Sri Lankan territorial waters? It must be

shown that the supply of bunker fuel was delivered to the foreign going

ships tanks by the Appellant to be used for navigation on the high seas with

a foreign destination point of another country.

[189] To benefit from the concessionary tax rates under Section 42 or 52 of

the Inland Revenue Act, as regards the supply of bunker fuel, the Appellant

is required to satisfy the following documents:

1. Purchase orders for the receiver (customer) of the bunker fuel

indicating the name of the vessel, date of departure and next

destination from Sri Lanka;

2. Purchase order indicating written instructions for the receiver

(customer) to deliver the bunker fuel to the vessel;

3. Sales invoice to the receiver of bunker fuel;

4. Bunker delivery note endorsed by the Master/Chief Engineer/ such

responsible officer of the vessel; and

5. Evidence of payment from the receiver (customer).

[190] In the instant case earn the, there is nothing to indicate that the bunker

fuel supplied by the Appellant to a ship was bound to a foreign destination

point out of Sri Lanka as there is no evidence whatsoever, such as the

Bunker Note indicating that the destination of the ship was any foreign place

outside Sri Lanka. On the other hand, the destination point referred to in

69

CA TAX 0012 2017 TAC IT 042 - 2013

relation to marine gas oil in the cusdec documents state that the country of

destination is Sri Lanka (p. 195 of the TAC brief).

[191] For those reasons enumerated in this judgment, I hold that the supply

of bunker fuel by the Appellant in the present case, does not constitute an

export within the meaning of Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act

and therefore, the Appellant is not entitled to claim the concessionary tax

rates under Sections 42 or 52 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as

amended).
