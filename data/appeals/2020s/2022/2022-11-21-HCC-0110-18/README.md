Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) preferred this

appeal on the basis of being aggrieved of his conviction and the sentence by the

learned High Court Judge of Gampaha.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Gampaha for causing the

death of one Kudadurage Simon alias Dahiria on 2nd November 2003 and thereby

committing the offence of murder, punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal

Code.

After trial without a jury, High Court Judge of Gampaha by his judgement dated

26-07-2018, found the appellant guilty as charged and he was sentenced to

death accordingly.

Facts in Brief

PW-01 Hema Rohini was the only eye witness to this incident. At the time

relevant to this incident, she and her husband were running a small boutique in

their village. On the day of the incident, namely, 2nd November 2003, at around

6.30 7.00 in the evening, she had been alone in her boutique. The deceased,

who was well-known to her had come to the boutique in order to purchase some

cigarettes. In the meantime, the appellant who is also well-known to her has

Page 3 of 8

come scolding the deceased which has led to a verbal altercation between them.

It has been her evidence that after scolding the deceased, the appellant took out

a knife and stabbed the deceased. At that point, she has closed her eyes due to

fear. When she opened her eyes, she has seen the deceased fallen inside the shop

and after hearing her cries, the villagers who gathered has taken the deceased

to the hospital. Later she has come to know that the injured had passed away.

In her evidence as well as under cross-examination, she had been very

categorical that it was the appellant who came to the shop and started scolding

the deceased and thereafter stabbed him. When cross-examined on behalf of the

appellant, a question has been asked whether she knew that the appellant was

suffering from a mental ailment for which she has replied that she has heard

such a thing but was unaware whether it was so.

The postmortem report had been an admitted document. It is clear from the

report that the deceased had 12 injuries, out of which ten are cut injuries, while

the other two being stab wounds. The postmortem report also has confirmed that

the death was due to the mentioned injuries suffered by the deceased.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case and when the appellant was called for

his defence, he has made a dock statement. In his dock statement he has

narrated at length about the mental health problems he had and has claimed

that the deceased misled him by offering various divine cures for his ailment.

Explaining the incident, he has stated that since he realized that the deceased

could not cure him, he told him not to come again, but on the day in question,

he came to meet him which resulted in a verbal altercation. He has claimed that

during the altercation, the deceased took out a photograph of his wife where he

has torn off the portion which he and his child was also featured and threatened

to take his wife away from him and take over his property. He has claimed that

at which point he felt dizzy and he did not know what happened afterwards.

The appellant has called Consultant Psychiatrist Dr. Gamage Gamini Jayanath

to give evidence on behalf of him. According to his evidence, the appellant has

Page 4 of 8

attended hospital clinics since 2001 and has taken medication for the mental

ailment called depression. It was his evidence that the ailment suffered by the

appellant was a mild depression that can be controlled through medication.

According to the hospital records, the appellant has taken treatment on August

2003 from the hospital clinic and his next visit to the clinic had been on the 30th

of December 2003. However, he has been categorical that although the appellant

has missed some of the clinics which he should have attended, he has not shown

any mental condition to suggest that he was suffering from depression when he

attended the clinic in December. He has expressed the opinion that his mental

condition has stayed stable during the period where he has not attended the

clinic.

The appellant has also called an official from the Magistrate Court of Gampaha

where the relevant non-summary case inquiry file No. NS-473 has been

produced. A photograph of a female which was available among the productions

produced for the purposes of the non-summary inquiry has been marked as V-

X on behalf of the appellant.

In his judgement, the learned High Court Judge has clearly considered the two

defences that appears to have been taken by the appellant. It has been

considered whether there was material to find that the appellant was suffering

from a mental ailment at the time of this incident and whether that has led to a

grave and sudden provocation leading to the stabbing of the deceased by the

appellant.

The learned High Court Judge has found that there was no basis to come to such

a conclusion and accordingly, the appellant was found guilty of murder.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following two grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

Page 5 of 8

1. Rejection of the plea of grave and sudden provocation is factually

untenable.

2. Evidence on record warrant the benefit of the grave and sudden

provocation to the accused appellant.

It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the appellant

had not denied the incident and the evidence of PW-01, the only eye witness

clearly suggests that there was a provocation for the appellant to act in the

manner the witness stated in her evidence. It was her position that the appellant

has well explained the provocation and the mental faculty in his dock statement,

which should have been considered in favour of the appellant.

It was also her position that the evidence clearly suggests that there was no

preplan by the appellant when this incident occurred, which also should have

been considered by the learned High Court Judge and the conviction should have

been in terms of section 297 of the Penal code on the basis of grave and sudden

provocation.

The learned DSG was of the view that the eyewitness account of the incident by

PW-01 provides no basis to consider the actions of the deceased was a result of

a grave and sudden provocation of him by the deceased. He also points out that

the appellant has failed to set up a defence on such a basis, nor has he claimed

that he was suffering from a mental ailment at that time until he has referred to

such an ailment in his dock statement. However, he points to the fact that the

learned High Court Judge has well considered both these scenarios, although

they do not go in hand in hand.

The learned DSG also separately pointed out the evidence of PW-01 where she

has been every categorical as to the part played by the appellant which shows

no provocation by the deceased towards the appellant, for him to claim the

benefit of exception 1 of section 294 of the Penal Code.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

It is well settled law that there is a duty upon a Trial Judge to consider whether

there is evidence before the Court to suggest a sudden fight or a grave and

sudden provocation or any other exception in terms of the exceptions provided

in section 294 of the Penal Code, even if an accused person did not rely on such

an exception for his defence.

In the case of The King Vs. Albert Appuhamy 41 NLR 505, the Court of

Criminal Appeal held;

Failure on the part of a prisoner or his Counsel to take up a certain line

of defence does not relieve a Judge of the responsibility of putting to the

jury such defence if it arises on the evidence.

In the case of Gamini Vs. Attorney General (2011) 1 SLR 236, it was held as

follows;

1. Though the accused appellant in his defence did not take up the

defence of grave and sudden provocation, the Trial Judge must consider

such a plea in favour of the appellant if it emanates from the evidence

of the prosecution.

2. Failure on the part of the petitioner or his Counsel to take up a certain

line of defence does not relieve a Judge of the responsibility of putting

to the jury such defence if it arises on the evidence.

However, it needs to be noted that this is not a case where the learned High

Court Judge has failed to consider evidence to find out whether there is a basis

for him to act under section 297 of the Penal Code where the appellant can be

convicted for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

Although the appellant has not directly taken up this position, it appears from

his dock statement that his position had been that the deceased came looking

for him and provoked him and after that he did not know what happened.

Although the learned Counsel contended that the appellant has not denied the

Page 7 of 8

incident where the deceased received cut and stab wounds, in fact he has not

taken up such a position at the trial. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge

has clearly considered whether the evidence available establishes such a fact.

The learned High Court Judge has also considered whether the actions of the

deceased were a result of any mental ailment suffered by him. He has come to a

definite finding that there was no evidence to show that the appellant was

suffering from a mental condition when this incident occurred as the Consultant

Psychiatrist summoned by the appellant himself has opined that it cannot be so.

As the appellant has claimed provocation which appears to be on the basis that

the deceased provoked him, the learned High Court Judge has correctly

considered the relevant exception 1 to section 294 of the Penal Code which reads

as follows.

Exception 1. Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst

deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden

provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the

provocation, or causes the death of any other person by mistake or

accident.

The above exception is subject to the following provisos: -

Firstly- that the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by

the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person.

Secondly- that the provocation is not given by anything done in

obedience to the law, or by a public servant, in the lawful exercise of

the powers of such public servant.

Thirdly- that the provocation is not given by anything done in the

lawful exercise of the right of private defence.

Explanation- whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough

to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.

In her arguments before this Court, although the learned Counsel for the

appellant attempted to portray that the incident spoken of by the appellant in

his dock statement and the evidence of the PW-01 refers to one and the same

incident, I find no basis to agree with such a contention. As pointed out correctly

by the learned DSG, the evidence of PW-01 which was never challenged, shows

abundant proof that it was the appellant who confronted the deceased by

abusing him, and thereafter attacking him. The evidence shows that the

deceased was never the aggressor. The evidence also shows that the appellant

has come prepared because he used the knife carried by him to attack the

deceased. According to the postmortem report, the deceased had received 12

injuries out of which ten are cut wounds while the other two are stab wounds.

This goes on to establish that the deceased has acted with the intention of

causing bodily injury to the deceased causing his death.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no reasons to interfere with the

conviction and the sentence of the appellant by the learned High Court Judge.

The appeal therefore is dismissed as it is devoid of any merit. The conviction and

the sentence affirmed.
