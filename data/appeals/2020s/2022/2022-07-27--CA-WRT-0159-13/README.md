Before: M. T. Mohammed Laffar, J.

Counsel:

Amarasiri Panditharatna with Laknath Peris for the Petitioner.

Ms. Amasara Gajadeera SC for the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

Written submissions tendered on:

16.07.2020, 22.01.2019, 11.12.2018 by the Petitioner.

07.01.2019 by the 1(a) and 2(a) Respondents.

Argued on: 15.03.2022

Decided on: 27.07.2022

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner seeks a writ of Certiorari to quash the Quit Notice marked as P-19 issued

by the 2nd Respondent in terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act, No. 7 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as the Act). The position of the Petitioner is

that the land which the Quit Notice relates is not a State land, but it is a private land

belongs to him. According to the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner, that land

is a divided lot (lot C) in the partition action bearing No. P-3931 in the District Court

of Kandy. By the final decree entered in that action, lot C has been allocated to the

mother of the Petitioner, Kekulawala Radallage Emily. In order to establish that fact

the Petitioner has tendered the Land Registry extracts marked as P-3. Said Emily and

her husband, Mendis lived in the house on the land since 1953 and the Petitioner and

his three sisters lived with them from their infancy. After the demise of the mother,

siblings of the Petitioner transferred their rights of the property to the Petitioner by deed

of transfer No.3072 dated 02.07. 2010 marked as P-1 upon which the Petitioner claims

title to the land which the Quit Notice applies.

Even though, the Petitioner has failed to tender the final decree entered in the partition

action to the Court, it has been tendered by the Respondents marked as 1R1. It is evident

that lot C had been allocated in the final decree to the school premises but not to the

mother of the Petitioner, Emily. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted to the

Court that the Petitioners mother had conducted a weaving school in the premises and

for that reason it has been stated in the final decree marked as 1R1 that lot C has been

allocated to the school premises. For the satisfaction of Court that Emily had

conducted a weaving school in the building situated on the land and the Petitioner, his

parents and siblings occupied that building, the Petitioner has tendered to Court the

death notice of Mendis (marked as P-4), extracts of the Electoral Registers (marked as

P-5) and a certificate issued by the Grama Niladhari of the area confirming the

residency of the Petitioner (marked as P-6) etc. In any event a government school

known as Rahula College is situated in the vicinity of the land which the Quit Notice

applies and the position of the learned State Counsel appearing for the Respondents is

that the school is situated next to the land which the Quit Notice relates whereas the

position of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner is that the school is situated

about 300 or 350 meters away from the property which the Quit Notice applies.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner further submitted to the Court that the final

decree marked as 1R1 had subsequently been amended and Emily's name had been

entered therein as the allotee of lot C deleting the words school premises.

Nevertheless, no amended final decree has been tendered to Court into that effect.

Emilys name appears in the Land Registry extracts (marked as P-3). Nevertheless, the

finality and conclusiveness effect attach to the final decrees entered in partition actions

and not to the extracts maintaining in the Land Registries. Therefore, the Court cannot

be satisfied that the vendors in P-1 upon which the Petitioner gets title to the disputed

land had title to the land and hence, the Petitioner is the owner of the land.

Be that as it may, as repeatedly held by this Court, when the major facts are in dispute

writ courts will decline to exercise its writ jurisdiction.1

A.S. CHOUDRI in his book on the Law of Writs and Fundamental Rights (2nd Ed.),

Vol.2, (at page 449) states thus:

"Where facts are in dispute and in order to get at the truth, it is necessary that the

questions should be canvassed in a suit where parties would have ample opportunity of

examining their witnesses and the Court would be better able to judge which version is

correct, a writ will not issue."

Referring the above stated authority, in the case of Thajudeen Vs. Sri Lanka Tea Board

and Another2 Ranasinghe J with Seneviratne J agreeing held:

That the remedy by way of an application for a Writ is not a proper substitute for a

remedy by way of a suit, specially where facts are in dispute and in order to get at the

truth, it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a suit where the parties

would have ample opportunity examining their witnesses and the Court would be better

able to judge which version is correct, has been laid down in the Indian cases of: Ghosh

v. Damodar Valley Corporation3, Porraju v. General Manager B. N. Rly4 (at page

474).

Since the major facts in the instant action like whether the land in dispute was allocated

in the final partition decree to the mother of the Petitioner or to the Rahula College, the

final decree was amended subsequently inserting the name of the mother of the

1 A.R.H. Mohideen and 10 others Vs Colombo Municipal Council and 4 others (C.A. Writ Application No:

466/2020), Rupasinghe Arachchige Dona Kusumawathie and 4 others Vs W. M. B. Weerasekara,

Commissioner General of Agrarian Development and 9 others (C.A. Writ Application No: 0553/2019).

4 A.I.R. 1952 Cal. 610.

Petitioner as the allotee of Lot C, the vendors in P-1 had rights to transfer the disputed

land to the Petitioner, the mother of the Petitioner conducted a weaving school in the

premises and for that reason it has been stated in the final decree marked as 1R1 that

lot C has been allocated to the school premises are seriously in dispute. Under such

circumstances, I am not inclined to issue a writ of Certiorari to quash the Quit Notice

marked as P-19. Therefore, I dismiss the Application. The Petitioner should pay Rs.

50,000 to each 1st and 2nd Respondents as costs of this application.

Application dismissed with costs.
