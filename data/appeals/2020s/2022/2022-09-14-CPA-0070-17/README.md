This is a revision application filed by the State canvassing an order dated

27.06.2016 delivered by the High Court of Anuradhapura in Case No RA

39/2015, which set aside a conviction and sentence delivered under the

Antiquities Act No 09 of 1940 as amended Act No 24 of 1998 (hereinafter

the Ordinance) in the Magistrates Court of Anuradhapura. Proceedings of

the matter commenced in 2017, and on 27.07.2022, the case came up

for argument before this Court. On the day, a Deputy Solicitor General

was present on behalf of the petitioner while the respondent was

unrepresented. A perusal of the Journal Entries notes that the

respondent was previously represented on several occasions, and a

Statement of Objections was filed on 04.04.2022. Hence, this Court

reserved its judgment, allowing both parties to file written submissions

CA-PHC-APN-70-17 Page 3 of 10 14/09/2022 IJ-36-22

before 10.08.2022. The respondent filed their written submissions on

09.10.2022

The factual background of the instant application is as follows. The 3rd

accused respondent (hereinafter the respondent) and four others were

arrested and charged before the Magistrates Court of Anuradhapura in

Case No 51459, under Section 15(1)(a) of the Ordinance. The respondent,

a labourer of the Department of Archeology, and four others were found

carrying out an unauthorized excavation close to the bund of the ancient

tank named Karambawewa situated in Katukeliyana, Anuradhapura. All

except the respondent has fled the site upon detection. The information

reported to the Magistrate details that the excavation was carried out

targeting a rock that had emerged from within the tank. Tent material

has been used to conceal the excavation site from passersby. The facts

reported by the police list the items recovered from the site, which

included several crowbars weighing between 2 8 pounds, multiple

pickaxes and other similar tools. A report has been issued by the

Department of Archeology pertaining to the excavated site, which

records, inter alia, the following:

The respondent and 1st and 4th accused pleaded guilty to charges of

conducting an excavation without an authorized permit with the

intention of finding antiquities near the bund of the Karambewewa tank,

which constitutes offences under Sections 6 read with Section 15(1)(a) of

the Ordinance and Increase of Fines Act No 12 of 2005. Accordingly, a

sentence of 1-year imprisonment suspended for ten years and a fine of

Rs. 50,000/- were imposed (vide page 38 of the Brief). The respondent

paid off the fine in instalments and made the final payment on

15.12.2014 (vide page 40 of the Brief).

Aggrieved by the sentence, the respondent filed a revision application to

the High Court. In the said petition, the respondent avers that he has

lost his employment as a government servant due to the fine imposed

upon conviction (Vide Page 7 of the Brief). In the petition filed before the

High Court, the respondent avers that the Charge Sheet filed before the

Magistrate is illegal (Vide Page 7 of the Brief). In support of the said

submission, the respondent has averred that as no antiquities were

found near the excavation site and neither were any antiquities harmed

during the excavation process, charges cannot be framed under Section

15(1)(a) of the Ordinance. During oral submissions, the counsel for the

respondent has contended that the plea of guilty by the respondent

cannot be justified due to the defective Charge Sheet (vide page 47 of the

Brief).

On 27.06.2016, the learned High Court judge acquitted the respondent

from all charges. In the said order, the learned High Court judge notes

that the State Counsel representing the complainant (hereinafter the

petitioner) has not objected to the relief prayed for by the respondent and

CA-PHC-APN-70-17 Page 5 of 10 14/09/2022 IJ-36-22

assents to the revision of the conviction and sentence by the Magistrate

dated 15.12.2014. The impugned order refers to the Archeology Report

and notes that no antiquities were found near the site and that no

antiquities were harmed due to the excavation (vide Page 56 of the Brief).

The learned High Court judge observes the following vide Page 56 of the

Brief:

51459

2014.02.17

.

Aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner has filed the instant

application seeking to revise the order dated 27.06.2016. The petitioner

claims the impugned order to be illegal as the learned High Court judge

has erred in law by insisting on the discovery of antiquities/ harm

caused to antiquities as a requirement under Section 6 read with Section

15(1)(a) of the Ordinance. Petitioner relies on Section 6 of the Ordinance

in support of this contention, stating that the only requirement under the

Ordinance is the establishment that the excavation was done to discover

antiquities. The counsel contended that the learned High Court judge

has failed to make an independent assessment on the application of

Section 15 of the Ordinance, as amended, and has acted in

contravention of the law.

The Charge sheet filed against the respondent refers to Section 6 and

Section 15(1)(a) of the Ordinance. Section 6 provides the following:

CA-PHC-APN-70-17 Page 6 of 10 14/09/2022 IJ-36-22

Section 15(1)(a) of the Ordinance (as amended by Increase of Fines Act No 12 of

2005) provides for offences relating to the discovery of antiquities and stipulates

that every person who excavates in contravention of the provisions of Section 6;

shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction after summary trial before a

Magistrate be liable to a fine not less than fifty thousand rupees and not

exceeding two hundred and fifty thousand rupees or to imprisonment of either

description for a term not exceeding one year.. A plain reading of the applicable

law reveals that there is no requirement for the existence of antiquities as an

element of the offence contained in Section 6 read with Section 15(1)(a) of the

Ordinance. One cannot read into the law an element that the legislature did not

envision. The actus reus stipulated in Section 6 is an unlicensed excavation,

which has been undisputed in the instant case, and the mens rea is the

purpose of discovering antiquitiesthe instant application pivots on the latter

element. In the respondents written submissions, it is averred that as the

excavated site is a non-archaeological site, the intention of the respondent to

excavate cannot mature into a purpose of discovering antiquities (Vide

Paragraph 2). However, the respondent in his written submissions does not

provide any indication as to why the respondent deemed the site to be non-

archaeological. This assessment seems to be based on the excavation findings

after the fact. The unambiguous language utilised by the legislature in framing

Section 6 of the Ordinance manifests that the existence of antiquities or the

lack thereof is immaterial to constitute an offence under the Ordinance. Section

CA-PHC-APN-70-17 Page 7 of 10 14/09/2022 IJ-36-22

6 must be read in consonance with the rest of the Ordinance. Had the

legislature intended to import the recognition as an archaeological site within

Section 6, the legislature would have referred to Sections 24 or 33 of the

Ordinance. The former refers to prohibited areas in the vicinity of certain

monuments designated by regulations, and the latter archaeological reserves as

specified by Gazette notifications. Instead, a blanket recognition has been

against unlicensed excavations, either on private land or otherwise, for the

purpose of discovering antiquities. Hence, going by the precise, unambiguous

wording of Section 6 of the Ordinance, the existence or otherwise of antiquities

in the excavation site is immaterial for a conviction under Section15(1)(a) of the

Ordinance. No distinction has been made in Section 6 of the Ordinance between

archaeological sites and non-archaeological sites, but rather the legislature

has focused on the mental element of the person conducting the excavation,

i.e., purpose. In assessing what constitutes the purpose, one must note that

the inability to achieve the result of the purpose does not vitiate the purpose

itself. Hence, the question that needs to be answered is whether the respondent

has excavated for the purpose of discovering antiquities.

The respondent in his written submissions has failed to provide any reasons as

to why the respondent intended to excavate the site in the first place, if not for

the purpose of discovering antiquities. In any event, the purpose of the

excavation can be ascertained from the facts and circumstances of the case.

The respondent is a labourer at the Department of Archaeology. This is

indicative of the respondents knowledge of the gravity of conducting an

unlicensed excavation for the purpose of discovering antiquities. Unlike an

ordinary person, the respondent ought to know that antiquities cannot be

restored once damaged or otherwise removed. The respondent has pleaded

guilty to the charges levelled against him under the Ordinance, and it is hard to

assume that he was unaware of the nature and gravity of the offence he has

been charged with. Moreover, the respondent has paid off the fine imposed

upon him by the Magistrate. Added to this knowledge, the location of the

excavation, which is in close proximity to an ancient tank, the premeditation as

CA-PHC-APN-70-17 Page 8 of 10 14/09/2022 IJ-36-22

evinced by the list of tools utilised, and the absence of any other plausible

reason for the excavation conducted point to the fact that the respondent has

excavated for the sole purpose of discovering antiquities near or around the

ancient tank. Being an employee of the Department of Archaeology, the

respondent cannot plead ignorance or otherwise contend that he participated in

an offence without knowledge. The respondent carries a duty of care to ensure

that areas with a strong likelihood of carrying antiquities are protected. Thus, it

is the considered view of this Court that the purpose for which the respondent

has conducted the excavation is for the discovery of antiquities.

The learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself by insisting on the

existence of antiquities when examining the offences, the respondent has been

charged with. It appears that the learned High Court Judge has misdirected

himself as to the applicable law by insisting on the existence of antiquities,

weighed in the acquiescence of the State Counsel representing the petitioner to

invoke the revisionary jurisdiction. This is a grave irregularity that cannot be

condoned. The revisionary jurisdiction cannot be invoked by consent, and it can

only be permitted in the event there is illegality, impropriety or irregularity in an

order which has caused a miscarriage of justice. Hence, it is the duty of the

judge acting in revision to examine the facts and law before him, independent of

the consent or otherwise of the opposing party.

At this juncture, it is pertinent to comment on the role played by the State

Counsel representing the petitioner before the High Court. The State Counsel

has consented to the revision application; beyond that, the Case Brief records

no other submissions supporting such consent. However, proceedings dated

09.09.2015 notes a brief submission by a State Counsel for the petitioner

objecting to the revision application, noting that as the respondent is an

employer of the Department of Archaeology, he carries a higher standard of

duty under the Ordinance to abide by the law as opposed to a layperson.

However, this line of argument has drastically changed as evinced by the

impugned order whereby the learned High Court judge has stated that the State

Counsel has consented to the revision application. A State Counsel cannot

CA-PHC-APN-70-17 Page 9 of 10 14/09/2022 IJ-36-22

mechanically consent to an application and expect their duty to end. Whilst a

presiding judge must conduct a genuine evaluation of the matter before him,

this does not alleviate the burden on a State Counsel to make an appraisal of

the applicable law. In doing so, Legal Officers of the State foster public interest

by acting in the interest of the State as opposed to any individual attachment.

Hence, their role is not to defend errant public officials at any cost but rather to

assist the judiciary in dispensing justice. Supreme Court (Conduct of and

Etiquettes for Attorney-at Law) Rule 52 provides that it shall be the duty of an

Attorney-at-Law appearing for the prosecution to bring to the notice of the court

any matter which if withheld may lead to a miscarriage of justice. A State

Counsel owes the same duty to the court, as indeed counsel appearing in all

matters, to quote all relevant statutory provisions and cases whether for or

against the prosecution. Even judges should administer justice according to the

law of the land. Ultimately it is the sacred and utmost duty of a judge to follow

this accepted norm when he/she administers the law.

Considering the above evaluation, this Court is of the opinion that the learned

High Court Judges order dated 27.06.2016 is irregular and contrary to law.

Hence, this Court hereby revises and sets aside the order of acquittal imposed

against the respondent by the learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura in

Case No. RA 39/2015 dated 27.06.2016.

Having set aside the impugned order, it is necessary to examine the order of

conviction and sentence imposed by the Magistrate on 17.02.2014. Upon a

guilty plea by the accused, the Magistrate passed a conviction on 17.02.2014

(Vide page 37 of the Brief). After that, the Magistrate imposed a fine of Rs.

50,000/- and a term of 1-year imprisonment suspended for ten years. This

Court notes that Section 15(1)(a) of the Ordinance stipulates that upon

conviction, a person will be liable to a fine not less than fifty thousand rupees

and not exceeding two hundred and fifty thousand rupees or to imprisonment of

either description for a term not exceeding one year.. Therefore, this Court

resolves that the Magistrate has erred in law by imposing both a fine and a term

of imprisonment upon the accused, including the respondent. In consideration

CA-PHC-APN-70-17 Page 10 of 10 14/09/2022 IJ-36-22

of the said error, this Court hereby varies the sentence imposed by the

Magistrates Court of Anuradhapura in Case No 51459 dated 17.02.2014 and

disposes of the term of imprisonment imposed. This Court notes that the

respondent has already paid off the fine imposed.

Subject to the above variance, the conviction and sentence imposed by the

learned Magistrate is affirmed.

Application allowed.
