Act No 18 of 1966.

(4) At the same time and at the same transaction causing injuries to one

punishable in terms of section 4(2) of the Offensive Weapons Act No

18 of 1966.

After trial, the appellant was found guilty as charged and was sentenced to

death on the 1st count. He was sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment

on each of the other four counts to be served concurrently, and was also

imposed a fine of rupees 10000/- on each of the said counts. In default three

months imprisonment on each of the counts was ordered.

Facts in brief: -

The only eyewitness in the case Punchadevage Sunethra (PW-02) was sleeping

in the inner living area of her home along with her two Children and her sister.

Their mother was sleeping in the outer living area of the house. As they were

preparing the house for a visit by a prospective husband for her younger sister,

they have gone to sleep late in the night around midnight. The outer living area

of the house was about 10 feet away from where she was sleeping. About five

minutes after she went to sleep, she has heard the sound of one of the front

windows being opened and some noise within the house. Upon hearing the

sound, she has switched on the light near the window and has seen two

persons running away from the window. She has seen a dark, tall and fat

person whom she has identified as the appellant and another whom she could

not identify. She has stated that she did not open the window, but saw the two

Page 4 of 10

persons running away when she looked outside from the closed window, which

was a tinted one.

It had been her evidence that after hearing the sound of the opening of a

window, she saw some ball shaped thing rolling in towards them and it was

that which prompted her to switch on the light. No sooner, she switched on the

light, the thing which was thrown in has exploded, which resulted in causing

injuries to all the inmates of the house including the deceased, her mother.

She Has given evidence stating that she told her husband that it was the

appellant who ran away from the window in the same night at the hospital, and

gave her statement to police only on the 17th as she was hospitalized and was

not in a position to make a statement until then.

It had been the position taken by the defence that as her sister had an affair

with a person who works in the Army the appellant's name was given to the

police only on suspicion. She has denied that her sister had an affair with

anybody and it was her stand that she gave the name of the appellant to the

police because she saw him running away from the house. In her evidence she

has stated that the appellant was not a person who had any association with

her or her family members, and although she knew his name, she has only

seen him in the area where they live.

According to the evidence of PW-08, who was the investigating police officer,

the first information as to the crime has been provided by the husband of PW-

02. He was not in a position to record the statements of the injured since they

were receiving treatment at the hospital, he has arrested the appellant on the

14th of February at 6.15 hours on an information received. This goes on to

establish the fact that the arrest of the appellant has been prior to the

recording of the statement of the only eyewitness PW-02 and may be on the

information provided by the husband of hers. The husband of the eyewitness

Page 5 of 10

PW-02, who was the PW-01 named in the indictment, has not been called as a

witness at the trial.

Grounds of Appeal: -

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant

formulated the following two main grounds for the consideration of the Court.

(1) The learned High Court Judge failed to give adequate consideration to

the fact that whether there was evidence to prove beyond reasonable

doubt, the identity of the appellant.

(2) The learned High Court Judge has considered several inaccurate facts

as evidence, when there was no such evidence, which has resulted in

a miscarriage of justice towards the appellant.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

Both the grounds of appeal will be considered together as they are interrelated.

It appears that the learned High Court Judge has gone on the basis that PW-02

was able to identify the appellant when the bomb was thrown into the house,

which was factually wrong. Her evidence has been that after hearing the sound

of the opening of a front window, and after hearing something being rolled on

the floor, she switched on the light and saw two persons running away from

the window. It is clear from the evidence of PW-02 that her identification has

been mainly on the body features of one of the persons she saw running away

from the window and not because she saw the face of the appellant. It is

obvious that there was no way for her to see the faces of those who ran away as

a person who looks at someone who is running away from that person can only

expect to see the person from his behind under normal circumstances. The

evidence of PW-02 provides no inference that can be drawn in order to

conclude that the witness may have seen the face of the appellant and

identified him.

Page 6 of 10

In her evidence, the PW-02, who was the only witness who is supposed to have

seen the appellant has not said that she saw the persons coming near the

window and running away after throwing the bomb into the house.

Therefore, I find that the following conclusions reached by the learned High

Court Judge in the judgment were factually wrong as pointed out correctly by

the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant.

(c) (At

(d)

. (At page 11 of the judgment and at page

193 of the appeal brief)

(e)

(At page 11 of the judgment and page 193 of

the appeal brief)

It is clear from the above conclusions reached by the learned High Court Judge

that the evidence has been considered on the basis that there was a clear

identification of the appellant, before the bomb was thrown into the house,

when it was thrown and while running away. I find that this was a total

misdirection as to the evidence made available in this case.

Page 7 of 10

It was clear from the evidence of the only eyewitness that she has seen two

persons running away only after the bomb was thrown into the house. She has

been alerted and got up from her sleep and switched on the light only after

hearing the opening of a window and feeling that something been rolling on the

floor of the house. It was her evidence that she saw two persons running away

from the window and she saw a dark, tall, fat person, whom she was able to

identify as the appellant.

I am of the view that had the learned High Court Judge addressed her mind

correctly to the evidence of PW-02, what the learned Judge should have

considered was whether the identity of the appellant has been sufficiently

established under the circumstances, for which no consideration has been

given in the judgment. I am unable to agree with the contention of the learned

Senior State Counsel (SSC) for the respondent that sufficient attention has

been given by the learned High Court Judge in the judgment with regard to the

identification of the appellant by the witness.

It is clear from the evidence of PW-02 that the appellant was not a person well

known to her, although she has seen him walking on the road and knew his

name. The evidence establishes the fact that PW-02 may have taken at least a

few seconds from the time she heard the opening of a window and hearing the

sound of something being rolled on the floor to get up from where she was

sleeping and to reach the light switch, switch it on and to look outside. It needs

to be noted that any reasonably prudent persons instinctive reaction would be

to get away as much as possible from a place where a bomb was thrown by him

with the intent of causing injury to others, if not, since he would also be in all

probabilities get injured in the process.

In my view it was therefore necessary for the learned trial judge to consider

whether there was evidence as to the distance from where the appellant was

alleged to have seen and identified, as stated by the witness. The availability of

the light, and whether it was possible for the light to extend to such a distance

Page 8 of 10

for the witness to make a positive identification, was another factor that should

have been considered.

In the judgment of Regina Vs. Turnbul and Another (1997) QB 224, it was

held:

Where the case against an accused depends wholly on the correctness of

the identity of the accused, the judge should warn the jury of the special

need to for caution before relying on the correctness of the identification by

the witness.

The judge should tell the jury that;

Caution is required to avoid the risk of injustice.

A witness who is honest may be wrong even if they are

convinced, they are right.

A witness who is convincing may still be wrong.

More than one witness may be wrong.

A witness who recognizes the defendant, even when the

witness knows the defendant well, may be wrong.

Some of the circumstances a judge should direct the jury to examine in

order to find out whether a correct identification has been made include;

The length of time the accused was observed by the witness;

The distance the witness from the accused;

The state of the light;

The length of time elapsed between the original observation

and the subsequent identification to the police.

Page 9 of 10

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his book The Law of Evidence Volume 1 at

page 663 discusses the mistaken identity in the following manner.

A fundamental requisite in a criminal case is to establish the identity of

the accused as the guilty party. The text-books abound with instances of

what were supposed to be clear identifications which proved to be

fallacious and defective. These include the case where an honest witness

was deceived by the broad glare of sunlight, (R. Vs. Wood and Brown

[Ann-Reg. 1784])

Much of the value of direct evidence of identification will depend on the

personal appearance of the subject of identification. Many persons cannot

be easily distinguished from others. The liability mistake is greater where

the questionable identity is a matter of deduction and inference and the

expression of an opinion than where it is the subject of direct evidence.

(Wills, op. cit., 7th edition., pp 197-200)

I find that in this action there was no evidence to consider those possibilities

beyond reasonable doubt to conclude that it was the appellant who ran away

from the scene of the crime. I find that the learned High Court Judges

conclusions in that regard had been reached without a basis and on wrong

assumptions as to the facts.

Another factor that attracted the attention of this Court is the failure of the

prosecution to call the husband of PW-02 who was the listed PW-01 in the

indictment. According to the evidence of PW-02, it was to him she informed

first, that she identified the appellant. It was her evidence that as she was

hospitalized, she gave her statement to the police only of the 17th, about four

days after the incident. However, according to the evidence of the main

investigating officer, PW-08, the appellant had been arrested on a tip off on the

14th morning. If that was so, there must be evidence to establish on what basis

the appellant was arrested without recording a statement of the only

eyewitness. In my view without such an explanation the alleged identification of

Page 10 of 10

the appellant by PW-02 becomes highly unreliable to act on that alone,

because, by the time the statement was recorded the appellant was under

arrest. Under the circumstances, it may also be possible that the PW-02s

identification of the appellant may have been influenced by the fact of the

appellant being in the custody of the police. The only way to eliminate such a

doubt would have been to call the PW-01 to give evidence and establish that

his wife informed him the identity of the person who came and it was he who

informed it to the police in his first information. I find that this failure was a

fatal error by the prosecution that goes into the root of the credibility of the

only eyewitness of the case.

It is well established law that an accused has nothing to prove in a criminal

case and it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable

doubt. Hence, however much poor the case put forward by the defence is, it is

not a reason to consider that fact in favour of the prosecution and the

prosecutions duty of proving the case beyond reasonable doubt remains the

same.

For the aforementioned reasons, I find that this is a conviction that cannot be

allowed to stand as it is not safe to convict the appellant based on the

testimony of the sole eyewitness who gave evidence in the matter as to the

identification of the appellant.

Therefore, I set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed on the

appellant. The appellant is acquitted from the charges preferred against him.

Appeal allowed.
