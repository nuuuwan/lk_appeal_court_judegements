MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to set aside the sentence

pronounced on the accused namely Parana Manage Sidath Bidula dated

02.04.2019.

The accused in this matter has been indicted under Section 364 and 365

of the Penal Code and the accused had pleaded guilty to the two

charges. The accused had been sentenced to for the first charge five

years imprisonment and with a fine. Second charge fifteen years

imprisonment, fine and compensation to the victim. The two sentences

to operate consecutively.

The accused had not filed this petition; instead, it is the substituted

petitioner who has filed the application of revision. The prayer to the

petition does not content the conviction, but only the sentence. The

counsel appearing for the respondents have taken up preliminary

objections as follows.

1) The delay in filing the petition 2) The substituted petitioner has no locus standi to file the

petitioner and even he has the right he has not explained as to how he was aggrieved 3) The accused has the right of appeal, but he has not exercised

the same The impugned sentencing of the accused had taken place on 02.04.2019

and the instant application for the revision has been filed on 12.09.2020

which is after one year and five months.

It is a well-founded principle that if a revision application is filled, the

party filling the same must do so without delay. In the case of

Page 4 of 11

Ellangakoon v OIC Eppawala Police Station and another (2007) 1 SLR

398, it has been held that the impugned order is ordered 16/03/2006

while the petition has been filled on 24/07/2006, entailing an

unexplained delay of four months and eight days/ in the absence of

explanation to the contrary this delay be considered unreasonable.

In a case decided by this bench, CA/PHC/APN/21/2021 this court has

decided that delay is considered to be a fatal error if its not explained

to the satisfaction of Court, and it has been held by this bench in the

case of CA/PHC/APN/78/2021. This Court notes that counsel for the

petitioner could not explain as to why the delay in filing the instant

application.

The counsel for the respondents raised the objection that the

substituted petitioner does not have the locus standi to file the instant

application.

As per Merriam-Webster (since 1828) Dictionary, locus standi is

defined as a right to appear in a court or before anybody on a given

question: a right to be heard. Furthermore Sathe, Public Participation

and Judicial Process elaborated the definition of the locus standi as,

Locus Stand rule is based on good policy. The principle is that court

time as well as energy should not be wasted on hypothetical or

abstract questions or on a professional trial or a busy institution.

Moreover, United Nations and the Rule of Law: Access to Justice

declares that Access to justice is a principle of the rule of law.

Without access to justice, people will not be able to raise their voices

and exercise their rights. Therefore, fair, and equitable justice must be

ensured for all members without discrimination.

Page 5 of 11

In the case of Somnipathy v Weerasinghe (1980) 2 SLR 121, the

interpretation of the locus standi or the standing to sue, found reads

that even the spouse of a victim has no standing to file a fundamental

rights petition on behalf of the victim. In long overdue, Sriyani Silva v

Iddamalgoda, Officer in Charge, Police Station, Payagala and Others

(2003) SLR 14, the Courts position on the locus standi is observed

considerably changed, when the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka

pronounces that anyone having a legitimate interest could

prosecutein terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution. In this case,

the detainee, Jagath Kumara (petitioners husband) died while being

held at the Remand Prison. S. Bandaranayake J, with S.N. Silva J

agreeing, stated that The golden rule of plain, literal and grammatical

construction has to be read subject to the qualification that the

language of the statute is not always that which a grammarian would

use. Moreover, Bandaranayaka J brought to light the preposterous

situation that can lead to a mischief if it is contended that the right

[for remedy] would become ineffective due to the intervention of

death.

Later in the cases such as Sugathapala Mendis and Others v Chandrika

Kumarathunga and Others (2008)2 SLR339, 391(Waters Edge case),

the scope of locus standi was further consolidated, bringing in the

concepts of public interest and public trust. In the case of

Gunasekara Hamini v Don Baron D.C. Colombo, 13,125, the Court

considered that, a donation by a minor unassisted by a guardian is

null and void. On the death of the minor's father, the mother does not

become the guardian except by the Court appointing her under

Page 6 of 11

Chapter 40 of the Civil Procedure Code. Such a donation cannot be

ratified subsequently, when the minor comes of age.

As per the case of Sello Hamy v Rapheal 1 SCR. 73, it was generally

stated that a conveyance by an infant was not void but voidable, but

Clarence, J., points out that the defendant, who then attacked the deed,

had no locus standi to do so. Because he in no sense represented the

minor, and he expressly abstains from finding whether the grantor was

or was not a minor, because such a finding would have no bearing on

the decision of the case. Besides, that was the case of a sale which

might or might not be beneficial to the minor making it. A donation

certainly cannot possibly be beneficial to the donor. There is no doubt

on the authorities that the first plaintiff could have obtained restitutio

in integrum if she had applied in time, but that remedy is now barred.

In the case of Helena Hamline et al v Nonahamy et al 60 DC Colombo ,

33,943, under the Roman-Dutch law a married woman has

no locus standi in judicio, but where, rightly or wrongly, a wife is

brought in, as a separate party, to a case along with the husband, and

judgment is entered in favor of both, she has all the rights and

privileges of a joint judgment-creditor, and it is not open to the

husband to enter into a compromise with the judgment-debtor or

receive payments from him to her prejudice.

In the case of Deshpande v S (1971) 13 JILI 153, highlights two key

issues underlying the concept of locus standi. The plaintiff must have

some grievance. That is, another persons grievance cannot be

prosecuted. But this does not apply to Habeas Corpus or Quo Warranto

writ orders. This is due to public freedom and public attention to state

Page 7 of 11

property. There is no room for purely academic disputes to come

before the court. That is, we should focus only on the grievances and

attachments that are relevant to the person concerned.

In another case of M.C. Mehta v Union of India (AIR 1988 SC 1115), a

petition filed by a third person for protecting the lives of people who

drink from the river Ganga was considered in the interest of public

therefore entertained by the court. The court further directed the

concerned authorities to take measures for tackling the pollution of the

river.

In the case of Parmanand Katara v Union of India (AIR 1989 SC 2039), a

petition filed by an advocate for the removal of prior technicalities of

criminal procedure before treatment of the patient in case of a road or

other accident was entertained by the court and appropriate directions

were issued to the medical establishments.

In the case of Dattaraj Nathuji Thawarev State of Maharashtra

AIR2005 SC 540,relaxation of the principle of locus standi has

significantly helped in protection of fundamental rights of citizens

effectively which otherwise would have been extremely difficult.

In the case of CA (PHC) APN 144/2016 HC (Rev) 76/2016, it was

determined by the Court that the intervenient petitioners must show

that they have a sufficient interest in the matters to which the

revision application relates to. It is respectfully submitted that in the

first place, the Intervenient-Petitioners must show that they have

locus standi to make this revision application to this court with

regards to the issue of locus standi.Accordingly, in the same case, the

judgement was supported by the following cases,

Page 8 of 11

In the case of Sonali Fernando v AG CA (PHC) APN 144/07, His Lordship

A.W.A Salam J, held that, In law locus standi is generally understood

to be right to bring an action to be heard in court, or to address the

court on a matter before it.

In the case of E.G. Roshan Fernando v AG CA(PHC) APN 101/13 His

Lordship Dehideniya J, in answering the question of who has the right

to bring an action held as follows, Who has this right to bring an

action or who the right to address the court? The answer is the person

who was harmed or aggrieved by the decision of the court.

Additionally, in the aforesaid case, His Lordship Dehideniya J , discussed

the obiter dictum of Lord Denning in R v Paddington Valuation Office

(1996) 1 QB 380 at 401 on locus standi which cited in A.R Perera and

Others v Central Freight Bureau of Sri Lanka and another (2006) 1 SLR

83 which reads as; The Court would not listen , of course to a mere

busybody who was interfering in things which did not concern him.

But it will listen to anyone whose interests are affected by what has

been done.

The third ground of objection raised by the counsel for respondent is

that the accused has failed to exercise his right of appeal and he has

failed to explain the same.

The difference between revision and appeal was explained in CA (PHC)

APN 17/2006 decided by three judges of the Court of Appeal explained

Revision and Appeals thus, Needless to state that in an application for

revision, what is expected to be ascertained is whether there are real

legal grounds for impugning the decision of the High Court in the field

of law relating to revisionary powers and not whether the impugned

Page 9 of 11

decision is right or wrong. Hence such an application the question of a

rehearing or the revaluation of evidence in order to arrive at the right

decision does not arise.

In Nissanka v The State 2001 Vol. 3, page no.78, it was held, the power

of revision can be exercised for any of the following purposes via;

1) To satisfy the Appellate Court as to the legality of any sentence/

order 2) To satisfy the Appellate Court as to the propriety of any

sentence/order 3) To satisfy the Appellate Court as to the regularity of the

proceedings of such Court 4) Revisionary jurisdiction is not fettered by the fact that the

accused appellant has not availed of the right of appeal within the specified time. Per Kulatillake J, if it appears that the trial judge has applied the law

in arriving at his conclusions the Court of Appeal would not interfere

with simply because he has failed to set out the law that he has

applied in express terms.

The counsel for the respondent has further stated that the accused has

not expressly pleaded exceptional circumstances in the petition. In the

case of Amin v Rashid 3 CLW 8, Abraham CJ has observed that, It has

been said in this court often that revision. Is an exceptional

proceeding and in the petition if no reason is given why this method

of rectification has been sort. I can see no reason why the petitioner

should expect us to exercise our revisionary powers in his favor

It has been held in the case of bank of Ceylon v Kalil and Others (2004)

1 SLR 284 states that, to exercise revisionary jurisdiction, the order

Page 10 of 11

challenged must have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly

erroneous which is beyond an error or defect or irregularity which

shocked the conscious of the Court.

Therefore, it is very obvious that a petitioner has failed to aver an

exceptional circumstance which shocks the conscious of the court in the

impugned judgement. Furthermore, the undue delay in filing the

petition the so called substituted petitioner has failed to explain.

According to the above mentioned a judgement, the substituted

petitioner has failed to state as to how he has been aggrieved by the

impugned sentenced imposed by the High Court.

Therefore, in view of the above mentioned preliminary objections

raised by the respondents, it is only fair and just and legal as per the law

cited above to dismiss the instant application for revision without going

into the merits of the case. But, even if this Court goes in to the merits

of the case, this Court notes that the accused had been 43 years of age

and the victim had been only 11 years of age at the time of the offence,

and the victim had been in the habit of frequenting the house of the

accused in order to play with his daughter who was of the same age.

Hence the accused had in fact committed this grave offence to which he

has pleaded guilty on a child who was of the same age as his own. The

medico- legal report substantiates the injuries of the victim. Therefore,

as the substituted petitioner has only canvassed the sentenced imposed

on the accused, this court sees no reason to revise the same because it

is neither illegal nor does it shocks the conscious of this Court.

Hence the instant revision application is dismissed.
