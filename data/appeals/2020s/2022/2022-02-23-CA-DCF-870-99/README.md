JUDGMENT

Plaintiff-Respondent filed the case at the District Court of Kalutara, claiming from the

Defendant-Appellant for loss of income and reputation. Plaintiff-Respondent was running a

Cinema in Kalutara, and the Defendant-Appellant as the Film Corporation provided films to run

in the cinema. The Respondents theatre was an A grade theatre, and it was the Appellant who

decided which grade should be given to a theatre. The Appellant allocated the film

Singhayangeth Singhaya to be filmed at the Respondents theatre from the 4th of December

1992.

In January of the following year, the Respondent had received a letter dated 11th of January 1993

from the Producer of the film regarding an assault on the representatives of the film by the

Manager of the film hall. An inquiry was held by the Appellant and removed the film from the

theatre. The aforesaid inquiry was first fixed, only giving three days for the Respondent to which

the Respondent had objected and requested 14 days to face the inquiry. The Appellant had not

given any time for the Respondent and had held the inquiry ex-parte on the 18th of January 1993

as directed by the letter dated 15th of January 1993. On the 18th of January 1993, an officer was

sent by the Appellant to remove the film running in the theatre. Also had not provided any other

film to be broadcasted at the cinema.

The Respondent filed the case at the District Court of Kalutara. After the Answer, the trial began

on 28 issues. On behalf of both parties, evidence was led, and the learned District Judge delivered

his Judgment on the 7th of September 1999 in favour of Plaintiff. Being aggrieved by the said

Judgment, the Respondent appealed to this Court.

At the Appeal, the Appellant argued that even though the Respondent had based his case on the

basis that Plaintiffs reputation had suffered, there was no evidence to that effect. Pointing out

portions of the evidence, the Appellant argued that the Managing Director and Plaintiff are two

Page 3 of 4

different legal personalities. Therefore, the learned District Judges conclusion is not agreeable

with the law. The Managing Directors evidence that he had to face disrepute, and even his

family members had a low opinion of him cannot be considered as disrepute to Plaintiff.

Plaintiff is a legal entity, but one must understand it cannot give evidence. The evidence of the

Managing Director of the company is given not only on his behalf but also on behalf of the

company. He became the voice of the company. The learned District Judge had analysed the

evidence as an individual and as a representative of the Plaintiff company.

In the Judgment, the learned District Judge had observed and placed on record that the Plaintiff

is a limited liability company. Therefore, the evidence of the witness is treated as evidence of

the Plaintiff on that ground the argument of the Appellant fails.

Another argument of the Appellant is has the learned District Judge misdirected himself on the

evidence of proof of damages allegedly suffered by the Respondent?

The Appellant contends that loss of income is special damage that has to be specifically pleaded

and proved. The documents marked as [P17], [P18], and [P19], which were auditors reports

marked subject to proof, were not proved. Therefore, those documents cannot be considered.

Perusing the Judgment, there is no reference to the documents marked as [P17], [P18], and [P19]

in the Judgment. Therefore, I am compelled to accept that those documents had no bearing on

the Judgment. The learned District Judge had mentioned that evidence was not led regarding

those documents.

Issue No.11 is an issue on which damages were mentioned, and in the Plaint, the Plaintiff had

claimed damages. If the Appellant intended to raise an issue on loss of income, they should have

done so. What was not argued cannot be taken for someones advantage. In this context, loss of

income had been discussed in the form of closing of the theatre for many days. There is ample

evidence of the income of the theatre while running. Therefore, what the learned District Judge

had discussed regarding loss of income rejects the argument of the Appellant.

The learned District Judge also considered the arbitrary actions of the Appellant. After the ex-

parte inquiry on the 18th of January 1993, an officer was sent to remove the film. Only after that,

the Appellant had held an inquiry again. On the 18th of January, when the officer visited the

theatre, 2.30 film was screening, and around forty people were waiting for 6.30 film to be

screened. Suddenly, when the film was removed, on an ex-parte inquiry, was the reputation of

the Plaintiff suffered or not was discussed by the learned District Judge.

The Judgment speaks of income not only from the film but also from the car park and the canteen.

The learned District Judge had come to a conclusion regarding loss of income on a sound footing.

Especially the fact that the theatre was kept closed for 27 days because the Appellant failed to

supply another film was also considered. Without a proper inquiry, the arbitrary actions cannot

be rectified by a second inquiry held in February.

Therefore, I am of the view that the arguments placed by the Appellant are not strong enough to

set aside the Judgment of the learned District Judge of Kalutara. The learned District Judge had

evaluated evidence very carefully in concluding the Judgment. Therefore, I dismiss the Appeal

with taxed costs.
