The light that was in the compound had been on. After switching the light on in the sitting room, he had come out of the house. Then he had seen the first accused who was known to him holding a gun with another person. The other person also had been holding a gun. At the identification parade that was held, he has identified the other person who was with the appellant as the second accused. Upon seeing them, PW1 has asked (page 73 of the brief). Then the first accused has said . . According to PW1, the first accused has referred to as to his brother, the deceased in the case. Then he had seen his brother, the deceased, coming from the rear of his house. It was his evidence that there is an entrance to the deceaseds house from the rear of his house. When the deceased came, PW1 had held on to the deceased to prevent him from coming. However, the deceased has gone further towards the appellant. Then the appellant had fired a shot at the deceaseds leg with the gun he was holding. Upon receiving the gunshot, the deceased had fallen. Then the appellant has said . .

Thereafter both the appellant and the second accused had left the place together. PW1 had taken the injured (deceased) to the hospital, however the deceased had succumbed to his injuries. PW2, the wife of the PW1, has also given evidence.

Even if one assumes that there had been such an assault on the brother of the appellant as uttered by the appellant, there is no evidence as to when such assault has taken place to prove that the provocation was so sudden that the appellant did not have time for the sudden heat of passion to cool. Hence, there is no evidence for the appellant to get the benefit of exception 1 of section 294 of the Penal Code to lessen the offence of murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. On the above premise, I find that the grounds of appeal urged on behalf of the appellant are devoid of merit. Hence, the conviction and the sentence imposed on the appellant by the learned High Court Judge is affirmed.",
