The accused-appellants were indicted in the High Court of Kandy for having

committed the murder of Ramiah Selvanayagam, an offence punishable in

terms of section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

After the trial, the learned High Court Judge of Kandy found the appellants

guilty as charged and sentenced them to death. Being aggrieved by the said

conviction and the sentence, the appellant appealed to this court.

The grounds of appeal relied on by the first appellant are as follows:

3

1. Whether the learned Trial Judge was correct in his estimation with

regard to the credibility of the eyewitness.

2. Whether the learned High Court Judge failed to evaluate common

intention principles.

3. Whether the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

implication of section 27 statement in law.

The grounds of appeal set out by the 2nd appellant are as follows:

1. The learned Trial Judge was flawed by coming to a positive and

premature conclusion that the prosecution had proved the case beyond

reasonable doubt prior to evaluating the defence.

2. The learned Trial Judge has failed to address his judicial mind with

regard to the veracity of the version as deposed by the sole eyewitness.

3. Without prejudice to afore-formulated grounds of appeal, evidence led at

the trial, warrant the consideration of the exception of sudden fight

and/or grave and sudden provocation.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows:

As per the evidence of the prosecution, the deceased came home after work at

about 9.30 p.m. on the 13th of June 2006. Then he went to have a bath and

came back home. His daughter (PW1) gave his dinner and the water in an

aluminum jug. After he finished having his dinner, the deceased went out to

wash his hands. PW1 heard the jug falling. When PW1 came out to see what

had happened, she saw the two accused persons attacking her father with

knives. The evidence reveals that there had been an electric bulb lighting

outside the house at the time of the incident. The position of PW1 was that

when she came and called out father, the appellants ran away. She saw the

4

knives in the hands of the first accused but did not see what was in the hands

of the second appellant. The deceased was not in a position to speak; all he

could say was daughter. PW1 raised cries when she saw blood all over the

body of the deceased. PW1 testified that she had known the appellants for

seven years before the incident happened, as they lived in the same

neighborhood.

The conviction of the appellant for the murder revolves around the evidence of

PW1, the sole eyewitness.

Both appellants submitted that acting on the sole eyewitnesss evidence was

not safe. The appellants contended that the evidence of PW1 was not

trustworthy and not corroborated. This is the main contention against the

conviction.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent drawing

attention to section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance, and a well-recognized

principle is that the evidence has to be weighed and not counted. It is

contended that the evidence of PW1 is cogent and trustworthy.

Further, the learned Counsel for the appellant pointed out that the Counsel

who appeared for the first appellant at the trial sought to draw attention to an

omission in the evidence of PW1. (On page 83)

The statement of PW1 was recorded by the police on the 14th of June 2006, at

2.15 a.m. The statement of PW1 was recorded within four hours of the

incident. There was no omission or contradiction marked against the evidence

led by PW1. The learned High Court Judge observed that it was not an

omission. After a careful perusal, I found that, what was sought to draw

attention as an omission, was actually not an omission. Counsel for the

second appellant submitted that PW1 had not stated to the police that the

second accused had cut her father. However, the following portion is also

5

there in the statement of PW1

. She also stated as

.

.

Therefore, it cannot be said that there was an omission in the evidence of

PW1. As observed by the learned High Court Judge, there was no

contradiction or omission found in the evidence of PW1. As the police recorded

PW1s statement without delay, it cannot be said that PW1, who was only 20

years old at the time of the incident, had time to fabricate a story against the

two appellants. Besides, there were three other people at the house who came

out as PW1 raised cries, and testified that they had not seen the appellants. If

they were to concoct a story, they could have also stated that they had seen the

appellants attacking the deceased. I find no reason or legal basis for the

learned High Court Judge to reject the evidence of PW1.

The main contention against the conviction is that the evidence led by the sole

eyewitness is not credible. At this point, it is worth examining the law that is

being followed in dealing with credibility of the solitary eyewitness.

Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance provides; No particular number of the

witnesses shall, in any case, be required for proof of any fact.

Sir John Woodroffe and Syed Amir Ali (Law of Evidence 20th edition, Vol. 4

page 5171) says that,

It is true that there is no rule of law that uncorroborated testimony of one

witness cannot be accepted. If there is any such rule, it is the rule of prudence,

and whether the rule should be adopted or not, will depend on the circumstances

of each case. Whether the general rule should be adopted or not depend on the

circumstances of each case. As a general rule a court can and may act on the

testimony of a single witness though uncorroborated. Unless corroboration is

6

insisted upon by a statute, the court should not insist on corroboration except in

the cases where nature of testimony of single witness itself requires

corroboration. One credible witness outweighs any number of other witnesses. In

an appropriate case, conviction can be founded on solitary testimony of a

witness but court must be satisfied that the evidence of the witness, which it is

asked to accept, is wholly true. In a murder case, conviction can be based on the

testimony of sole eyewitness. The test is whether the evidence has a ring of

truth, is cogent, credible and trustworthy or otherwise.

Hence, a conviction may be based on the sole testimony of a single witness, if

believed and if the testimony is found to be credible and trustworthy.

It is the Trial Judge who has the opportunity to see the demeanor and

deportment to assess the credibility of a witness. In the case of Fradd v Brown

& Company Ltd. (20 NLR Page 282) the Privy Council held:

It is rare that a decision of a Judge so express, so explicit, upon a point of fact

purely, is over-ruled by a Court of Appeal, because Courts of Appeal recognize

the priceless advantage which a Judge of first instance has in matters of that

kind, as contrasted with any Judge of a Court of Appeal, who can only learn

from paper or from narrative of those who were present. It is very rare that, in

questions of veracity so direct and so specific as these, a Court of Appeal will

over-rule a Judge of first instance.

In the instant case, the learned High Court Judge has carefully analyzed the

evidence of the eyewitness PW1, and found it to be credible and capable of

being acted upon.

I find no reason to accept the argument that the evidence of PW1 should not

have been relied on. That argument cannot be sustained.

The next point is that PW1 could not have identified the person who attacked

her father, as it happened in the night. The police observed the place on the

7

same night. The position of PW1 that there was a light outside the house, was

corroborated by the police evidence. The appellants were living in close

proximity to the deceaseds house. PW1 had been known to the two appellants

for seven years before the incident. The incident happened a few feet away

from the house of the deceased, almost at the threshold of the house.

Therefore, there was no difficulty for PW1 to recognize the appellants. There

were no questions put to PW1 in the cross-examination, based on the fact that

PW1 could not recognize the appellants at that time. Therefore, I reject this

contention.

Upon careful consideration of the evidence of PW1 with the medical evidence,

this court has no reason to interfere with the decision of the learned High

Court Judge to act upon the evidence of PW1. The evidence of the doctor

corroborates with the evidence of PW1. All injuries were deep-cut injuries.

Such injuries could have been caused by the knife produced as P1, which was

recovered consequent to the statement made by the first appellant. The

injuries were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The

medical evidence is that the deceased would die in 10 to 15 minutes after

sustaining the injuries. The deceased had already died when he was taken to

the hospital.

As both appellants had cut the deceased together, it is manifestly clear that

both of them had the common murderous intention to kill the deceased.

Therefore, the contention that the learned Trial Judge has not considered the

provisions in section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance is not tenable.

The argument that the learned High Court had come to a positive and

premature conclusion that the prosecution has proved the case beyond

reasonable doubt before evaluating the defence, cannot be sustained. A Judge

commences writing the judgment after reading all the evidence, considering the

applicable legal principles, making up his mind, and coming to the final

8

conclusion of the case. Therefore, whether the art of narrating the events in

chronological order or otherwise is irrelevant.

The last point argued was that there was a sudden fight or a grave and sudden

provocation. There was no evidence to show that such an incident happened

at the scene. The defence suggested to PW1 that her father had caused

injuries to the wife and the sister of the first accused. A careful perusal of the

evidence of PW1 revealed that she never admitted that there was a fight. No

such incident was reported to the police. As per the police officers who gave

evidence, there had not been such an incident reported to the police. Even the

dock statement of the appellants does not reveal that there was a fight.

In the above circumstances, we see no reason to interfere with the judgment of

the learned High Court Judge. We affirm the conviction and the sentence

imposed upon the appellants. Therefore, the appeal of the appellants are

dismissed.
