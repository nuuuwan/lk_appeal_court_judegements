According to the Appellant, the letter dated 28th November 2011 issued under Section 163 (3) of the IR Act is signed by two persons namely Mr. M.M.R.R. Mellawa, Assessor and Ms. Manjula Gunathunga, Deputy Commissioner. The Deputy Commissioner Ms. Manjula Gunathunga has put her signature on the same date 28th November 2011, on the first page and the Assessor Mr. M.M.R.R. Mellawa has put his signature on the second page, at the place where the author of the letter has to sign. Hence, although it is not specifically stated as such, it appears to me that the Deputy Commissioner Ms. Manjula Gunathunga, being the senior officer, would have put her signature in the front page authorizing the act of her subordinate officer Mr. M.M.R.R. Mellawa, an Assessor. On the above premise the Appellant submitted that the two persons who had examined the tax return and refused to accept the tax return are Ms. Manjula Gunathunga, Deputy Commissioner and Mr. M.M.R.R. Mellawa, Assessor. I do concede that the return would have been examined by the above two officers. Yet, in my view the author of the letter is the Assessor, Mr. M.M.R.R. Mellawa. Admittedly, the Notice of Assessment dated 30th March 20121 which was issued to the Appellant is signed by the Assessor Mr. M.L.J.G. Chandrasiri. The Appellant argued that the person making the assessment and giving reasons for not accepting the return should be one and the same person. The Appellant made the above submission on the basis that the assessment process is not completed until the Notice of Assessment is sent to the Assessee. The Appellant relied on the judgment of the divisional bench of the Supreme Court in the case of D.M.S. Fernando and another v. A.M. Ismail2 wherein His Lordship Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon having considered Section 93 (2) of Inland Revenue Act No. 4 of 1963, as amended by Amendment Act No. 17 of 1972 and 30 of 1978 held as follows3; It empowers the Assessor to do one of two things. He may accept the return in which event he makes the assessment accordingly. Or else he may not accept the return. In such an event he is obliged to do two things:",

There is nothing in the provision which indicates that the estimation of assessable income, wealth and gifts must be postponed for some time long after the non-acceptance. Even if one transposes the words and communicate to such persons in writing the reasons for not accepting the return to the first line of the section after the word return and before the word estimate it will not make it a condition precedent. One has still to read more words into it to have the effect of postponing the rest of the exercise to sometime later. This would be doing violence to the section. The section imposes a duty but does not impose a time limit within which it should be done. To my mind the section merely states that if the Assessor does not accept a return he may assess on an estimate. His exercise is not complete till he has also communicated his reasons for not accepting the return. In effect he also justifies his act of assessing on an estimate. The plain meaning of the section is clear. (Emphasis added)",

It was intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly unfair assessments which many Assessors had been making as a protective measure. An unfortunate practice had developed where some Assessors, due to pressure of work and other reasons, tended to delay looking at a return till the last moment and then without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a grossly exaggerated assessment. The law, I think, enabled the department to make recoveries pending any appeal on such assessments. The overall effect of this unhappy practice was to pressurise the tax payer to such an extent that he was placed virtually at the mercy of the tax authorities. The new law was a measure intended to do away with this practice. Under the amendment when an Assessor does not accept a return, it must mean that at the relevant point of time he has brought his mind to bear on the return and has come to a decision rejecting the return. Consequent to this rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the assessee. The provisions for the giving of reasons and the written communication of the reasons, contained in the amendment is to ensure that in fact the new procedure would be followed. More particularly the communication of the reason at the relevant time is",

While tax laws must be interpreted strictly, I do not believe that such strict interpretations are warranted where there is neither advantage nor disadvantage to either party. If such a strict interpretation is given, as suggested by the Appellant, the Appellant would not be able to state his case on the ten questions of law submitted to this Court. The reason being Section 11A of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011, as amended, reads that either party may make an application requiring the Commission to state the case on a question of law for the opinion of the Court of Appeal. If the above Section is interpreted strictly, the Appellant could only be able to submit a case stated on a single question of law, and any case where more than one question of law is stated could be dismissed. However, this is not the practice of this Court. I therefore, hold that the assessment is not invalid merely because two different Assessors have issued the letter of intimation and the Notice of Assessment.",

Whether the assessment is time barred. The principal argument advanced by the Appellant is that the assessment made in the instant case is time barred. The Appellants contention is that no assessment had been made on/by the 28th November 20116. According to the Appellant, an assessment can be made only on the Notice of Assessment7. However, the Appellant has taken conflicting positions on the aforementioned issue in his written submissions, in order to support different arguments. In order to substantiate the argument that the Respondent, CGIR, violated Section 165 (7) of the IR Act by appointing the same Assessor who made the assessment to cause further inquiry into the appeal; quite contrary to the position that an assessment can be made only on the Notice of Assessment, the Appellant expressly acknowledged8 that it is the Assessor, Mr. M.M.R.R. Mellawa who issued the assessment contained in the letter dated 28th November 2011, communicating the reasons for not accepting the return (commonly called as the letter of intimation). There again, the Appellant contradicted the above position subsequently by saying that the letter dated 28th November 2011 is neither a communication of reasons for non-acceptance of the return of income nor an assessment9.",

    "text": "Act11. I do agree with the Appellant. Indeed, it is a letter issued under Section 163 (3) of the IR Act. The proviso of Section 163 (3) provides that where an Assessor does not accept the return and makes an assessment, he shall communicate his reasons in writing for not accepting the return, to the Assessee. Accordingly, the language of Section 163 (3) does not suggest that the letter of intimation should be treated as an assessment. The phrase in making an assessment in the opening paragraph of Section 163 (3) and the phrases if he (the Assessor) does not accept the return made by that person (the Assessee), estimate the amount of the assessable income of such person and assess him accordingly of Section 163 (3) (b) and phrase in the proviso () where an Assessor () does not accept a return () and makes an assessment (), he shall communicate () in writing his reasons for not accepting the return demonstrate that the assessment should precede the letter of intimation. The intimation letter contains an estimated amount of the assessable income together with a calculation of the tax liability. It is true that the letter of intimation states that the assessment will be issued in due course. Yet, there is a clear distinction between making and issuing an assessment. An assessment already made can be issued at a later stage. Therefore, in my view the letter of intimation satisfies that an assessment had been made by the Assessor in terms of Section 163 of the IR Act. I wish to emphasise that I do not concede that the assessment had been made or communicated to the Assessee by the letter of intimation. The making of an assessment is a matter for the Assessor in his own judgment. The notification of the assessment to the Assesee has to be done by giving the Notice of Assessment under Section 164 of the IR Act. Of course, needless to say that an Assessor should not be allowed to say that he made the assessment and kept it in his drawer. He should communicate it to the taxpayer. Incorporating the assessment into the intimation letter certainly establishes the authenticity of the assessment.",

    "text": "In the case of C & E Commissioners v. Ley Rififi Ltd40 it was held that the assessment of the amount due and the notification of it to the taxpayer are distinct operations and this is important if an assessment is received after the expiry of the time limit for assessment. To determine if an assessment has been made within the relevant time limit, should establish the date when it was assessed and not when the assessment was notified. It was also observed that to establish when an assessment was made, the internal records must be inspected. I do concede that that the procedure in England was different, where the assessment is made when the Inspector of Taxes authorized to make the assessment sign the certificate in the assessment book. That is because under the Taxes Management Act, 1970 the Inspector of Taxes was obliged to maintain an assessment book. However, there is no such requirement under the IR Act No.10 of 2006. Yet, as I have already analysed above, even under the IR Act No. 10 of 2006, the time bar is on making the assessment and not on sending the Notice of Assessment. Hence, it is important for the Respondent to satisfy the Court that an assessment has been made prior to the deadline. To ascertain the above fact, the Court to may have to refer to internal records or any other available documents which manifest in uncertain terms that an assessment had been made. In my view, the letter communicating the reasons for not accepting the return (letter of intimation) satisfies that the assessment had been made on or before the 28th November 2011.",

    "text": "The Appellant also made submissions as to whether the deadline for making the assessment should be 31st March 2012 or 30th November 201241. It was also submitted that the Appellant has a vested right to have his assessment made by 31st March 201242. The above flows from the question of whether the amendment made by Amendment Act No. 22 of 2011 to the time limit prescribed in Section 163(5) of the IR Act applies to the year of assessment 2009/2010. The Respondent, relying on the judgement of this Court in the case of Seylan Bank v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue43, argued that the Amendment Act No. 22 of 2011 should apply to the instant case. However, as at present, the aforementioned judgement had been overruled on appeal by the Supreme Court, in Seylan Bank PLC v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue44. Moreover, since this Court has already held that the assessment had been made on or before the 28th November 2011, consideration of the two above issues will not arise in the instant case. Has the Assessor given adequate and intelligible reasons for the rejection of the return? The next argument of the Appellant is that the letter of intimation does not contain reasons for not accepting the return. The Appellants submissions were that the letter contain only the conclusion of the Assessor that the service of electrical construction work does not come under the purview of undertaking for construction work under Section 45 of the IR Act.",

According to Section 165 (6) of the IR Act, every appeal has to be acknowledged within thirty days of its receipt. In the case at hand the appeal had been acknowledged by the Assessor, Mr. M.M.R.R. Mellawa. Mr. M.R.R. Mellawa is the assessor who also issued the letter of intimation dated 28th November 2011. In the letter of acknowledgement, it is stated that he had been directed by the CGIR in terms of Section 165 (7) of the IR Act, to make further inquiry into the appeal. However, according to the appeal report dated 18th April 2013, filed on record64 the Assessor who caused further inquiry into the appeal was Mr. R.D.K.S. Senake and not Mr. M.M.R.R. Mellawa. The said Assessor Mr. R.D.K.S. Senake forwarded the appeal for the hearing by CGIR since the parties could not reach an agreement in terms of Section 165 (7) of the IR Act and the said decision of the Assessor was endorsed to by the Deputy Commissioner Mr. Darmadasa Rangalle.",

    "text": "Another argument advanced by the Appellant was that Respondent, CGIR has not given any determination on the question as to whether the nature of Appellants undertaking is within the meaning of Section 45 (2) (c) of the IR Act. The eighth question of law flows from above. The basis of Appellants argument is that the statement made by the CGIR at page 6 of his determination65 to the effect that the Appellant has accepted the fact that the business activity of the Appellant company does not fall within the meaning of undertaking for construction of building as defined in Section 45 (2) (c) of the IR Act by keeping silence in respect of the second ground of the petition of appeal (sic) is factually incorrect. The above matter had been raised by the Appellant in its appeal to the TAC66. The TAC has considered the above issue and determined that the electrical installation work of the Appellant does not fall within the meaning of Section 45 of the IR Act. Therefore, the question to be determined by this Court is not whether the above statement of the CGIR is factually correct or incorrect. It is important to note that the Appellant has not raised the question before the TAC that the CGIR has failed to make a determination on the above issue. The task of this Court is to see whether the TAC erred in making its determination. Be that as it may, the Appellants argument is that in terms of Section 165 (14) of the IR Act, every petition of appeal referred under the Section should be agreed to or determined by the CGIR. It is true that in this instance parties have not reached at an agreement. Yet, may be on an erroneous footing, the CGIR has determined that the Appellant, by keeping silent in respect of the second ground of appeal, has accepted the fact that the business activity of the Appellant company does not fall within the meaning of undertaking for construction of buildings as defined in Section 45 (2) (c) of the IR Act.",
