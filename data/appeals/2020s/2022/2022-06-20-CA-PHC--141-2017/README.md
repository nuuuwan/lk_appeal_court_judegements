K.K.A.V. SWARANADHIPATHI, J.

JUDGMENT

The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent [hereinafter referred to as the Respondent] filed an action

in the Magistrate Court of Kalutara under Case No.33456 for a demolition order, among other

relives against the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter referred to as the Appellant]. The

said action was filed in Section 28(A)(3) of the Urban Development Authority Act No.41 of 1978

as amended by Act No.4 of 1982 and Act 44 of 1984.

After notice, the Appellant appeared before the Magistrate Court and filed her objections. Taking

a preliminary objection, the Appellant took up the position that he is not the legal owner of the

property.

The other objections were that as she had not done any illegal construction and the Respondent

had failed to give any details of such construction, the Respondent cannot get an order under

Section relied upon by them. After hearing both sides, the learned Magistrate delivered his order

dated 27.03.2015. By that order, the learned Magistrate permitted to demolish the unauthorized

construction done by the Appellant.

Aggrieved by this order, the Appellant had filed case No.37/2015 Writ in the High Court of

Kalutara praying to quash the order of the learned Magistrate dated 27.03.2015.

With the party's consent, the learned High Court Judge fixed the matter for argument by written

submissions. The order of the High Court of Kalutara in case No.37/2015 was delivered on

16.01.2017, dismissing the application of the Appellant. Aggrieved by this decision, the

Appellants have invoked this court's jurisdiction.

When the matter was taken up for argument, the parties agreed to abide by the decision on written

submissions already filed. Filing his written submissions, the Appellant supported his case stating

that Section 28(A)(3) of the Act No.41 of 1978 requires the notice to be sent to the person who

builds and not to the person who occupies. Therefore, before getting an order under this Section,

the Respondents must satisfy the court that the Appellant was the person who built the

unauthorized construction. Even though this argument was formulated from the beginning of the

action, the Respondent failed to prove the point.

As proof of her tenancy, she had produced rent receipts. Therefore, proving that she had made

improvements as a tenant is vital in exercising an administrative function. They argued that there

is no legal authority to issue a writ against the Urban Development Authority.

The Appellant argued that as the person who had done the purported unlawful construction, the

learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the Respondent's application. As the

13th amendment to the constitution had listed powers of the Provincial Councils, Article 154(P)4

provides the power to High Court to issue Writs.

Planning and approval for building permits are within the powers of Urban Councils; a writ can

be issued by Municipal Councils, which comes under Provisional Council Section 28A of the

Urban Development Authority Act No.41 of 1978, as amended by Act No.4 of 1982, reads as

follows: -

The Appellant argued that can the 28A notice is issued to her as a tenant

Page 4 of 5

28(A)(1) speaks of a person executing or executing. It does not speak of the ownership of the

premises. Therefore, the notice can be issued to a tenant.

When one receives the notice, he must prove that he has a valid permit. (Urban Development

Authority Vs. H.W. Kulasiri (CA Revision Application 2226/2003 decided that "The existence of

a permit is the only valid answer to the application under Section 28(A)(3). "

When perusing the Magistrate's court proceedings, the Appellant had not shown any valid permit.

When the only remedy is a valid permit not forwarded to court, the act refers to what a Magistrate

can do "Magistrate to make a mandatory order authorizing the authority to demolish or after the

building or work".

When the Magistrate is satisfied that the person was served with notice and had failed to take

steps in terms of the notice and had not produced a valid permit, there is no other order than

issuing the demolition order prayed by the Respondent.

Therefore, the learned High Court Judge had not found any reason to reverse the order of the

learned Magistrate. The learned High Court Judge had observed that the Appellant had not

forwarded any valid permit. According to the High Court Judge, an order of this nature should be

given at an early opportunity, but it had taken three years in this case.

Respondents had argued that the Appellant had not come with clean hands to pray for the

intervention of this court.

Namunukula Plantation Limited Vs. Minister of Lands and Others S.C. Appeal No.46/2008 held,

"If any party invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of a Court of law is found wanting in the

discharge of its duty to disclose all material facts, or is shown to have attempted to pollute the

pure stream of justice, the court not only has the right but a duty to deny relief to such person".

As pointed out by the Respondents, Clause 7 of the Affidavit of the Appellant dated 14.11.2014

states that she did not receive a notice, and the Respondents had not followed the proper steps.

Page 5 of 5

She had referred to paragraph 4 in paragraph 7 of the affidavit. Paragraph 4 speaks of her not

being the owner, which has no bearing on not receiving a notice.

When perusing the case record, documents [PX4] produced by the Respondents of this case at the

Magistrate court along with counter objection dated 21.01.2015 [PX4], a document sent by the

Appellant to the Respondent on 04.03.2013 indicates that she had been running a business for

eight years at the premises and had not construct any unauthorized construction. She had referred

to a letter dated 21.02.2013 and No.13/61/8260(C). The Respondent marked a true copy of this

document as [P2], which is the notice the Appellant had denied receiving. This shows that she

had not constructed her pleadings truthfully. A person must come with clean hands to seek justice.

For the reasons set above, I see no reason to disturb the order of the learned Magistrate of Kalutara

in case NO.33456 dated 27.03.2015 and the order of the learned High Court Judge of Kalutara in

case NO.37/15 dated 16.02.2017.

Therefore, I dismiss the appeal subject to the taxed cost of Rs.10,000/-.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

PRESANTHA DE SILVA, J.

I agree.
