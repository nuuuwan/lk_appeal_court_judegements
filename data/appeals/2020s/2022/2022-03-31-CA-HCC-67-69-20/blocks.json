As per the contentions of the aggrieved party, this evidence was correctly analysed in the judgment by the learned High Court Judge. It was further reiterated that, the learned High Court Judge had correctly stated in the judgment that the 2nd accused-appellant had failed to explain why he had come to the junction to refuel the cab at around 12 to 1.00 at night and the learned High Court Judge had rightly concluded that, there is no evidence to show that the UNP party members had damaged the cut-outs displayed at the 3rd accused-appellant's office. For the respondent it was further argued that the 3rd accused-appellant should have informed that to the OIC. But the 3rd accused-appellant without making any complaint to the police had arrived at the scene with people carrying illegal firearms and done mischief to the banners and cut-outs of the opposition political party.",
