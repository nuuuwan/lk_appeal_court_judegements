The Assessor rejected the claim of the Appellant and made assessments for the aforementioned thirteen taxable quarters. Consequently, the reasons in writing for not accepting the return were communicated to the Appellant company1 viz. only insurance brokerage received in respect of local produces is exempt from NBT and the rest of the Appellants turnover through insurance brokerage services is liable to NBT. Thereafter, the Appellant was issued with Notices of Assessment. The Appellant confronted the above position of the CGIR and claimed that the entire brokerage income earned by an insurance broker is exempt from NBT.",

But the delay should not render null and void the proceedings and prejudicially affect the parties, as the parties have no control over the proceedings. It could not have been intended that the delay should cause a loss of the jurisdiction that the Commissioner had, to give an effective order of approval or refuse. In my view, a failure to comply literally with the aforesaid provision does not affect the efficacy or finality of the Commissioners order made thereunder. Had it been the intention of Parliament to avoid such orders, nothing would have been simpler than to have so stipulated (Emphasis added).",

    "text": "Having argued extensively, as above, that the time limit specified for the TAC is mandatory, the learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that when the two-hundred-and-seventy-day time limit is exceeded, TAC no longer possesses jurisdiction to proceed to hear the appeal and therefore, the appeal stands abated. The Appellant further argued that this would result in a situation where the tax is no longer recoverable since an appeal before the TAC stands abated and the Commission is no longer possessed of jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal. The practical consequence would be that the appeal is as good as allowed and the benefit of this will accrue to the taxpayer11. It was also submitted by the Appellant that if the time bar applicable for the determination of an appeal by the TAC is upheld by this Court, it does not restore the original assessment that was confirmed by the CGIR. That assessment will only be restored if the assessment is confirmed by the TAC. If the TAC is prevented from hearing the appeal because it is time barred it would result in the appeal before the Commission being regarded as abated. This would have the practical effect of being as good as the appeal being allowed12.",

If specific time limits are to be laid down the legislature need to say so in very clear unambiguous terms instead of leaving it to be interpreted in various ways.

In other words, if these two sentences were taken out of the judgement, there would be no change whatsoever either to the line of reasoning in Mohideen, or to the outcome.

According to the Appellant, the time bar for making an assessment is 20th January 2014, two years from the date of filing of the return28. Yet, the Appellant contended that no legitimate assessment can be made without serving a valid Notice of Assessment and therefore, the taxpayer must be served with the Notice of Assessment prior to the expiry of the deadline. Accordingly, it was argued that service of the Notice of Assessment is a necessary prerequisite for the validity of an assessment29. According to the Appellant, the Notice of Assessment was received on the 7th February 2014, well after the timeframe30. The Respondent did not challenge the above fact but, contended that the relevant date for the time bar is the date on which the assessment is made. Nevertheless, the Appellants contention is that the aforesaid position is untenable in law and unsupported by judicial precedents31. In support of the above contention of the Appellant relied on the two decisions of another division of this Court in the cases of ACL Cables PLC v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue32 (hereinafter referred to as ACL Cables) and John Keells Holdings PLC v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue33 (hereinafter referred to as John Keells) the cases that would be considered hereunder in this judgment.",

The intimation letter contains an estimated amount of the assessable income together with a calculation of the tax liability. It is true that the letter of intimation states that the assessment will be issued in due course. Yet, there is a clear distinction between making and issuing an assessment. An assessment already made can be issued at a later stage. Therefore, in my view the letter of intimation satisfies that an assessment had been made by the Assessor in terms of Section 163 of the IR Act. I wish to emphasise that I do not concede that the assessment had been made or communicated to the Assessee by the letter of intimation. The making of an assessment is a matter for the Assessor in his own judgment. The notification of the assessment to the Assesee has to be done by giving the Notice of Assessment under Section 164 of the IR Act. Of course, needless to say that an Assessor should not be allowed to say that he made the assessment and kept it in his drawer. He should communicate it to the taxpayer. Incorporating the assessment into the intimation letter certainly establishes the authenticity of the assessment.",

According to the proviso of Section 193 (2) the notice referred to in Section 163 (1) is the same Notice of Assessment and not an ordinary notice. Consequently, the learned Counsel for the Appellant argued that the statutory power to make an assessment is coupled with the statutory duty to send the Notice of Assessment and therefore, the Notice of Assessment also should be sent forthwith, at or around the time the assessment is made. The learned Counsel for the Appellant contended that a demand for payment forthwith cannot be made with a delayed Notice of Assessment. At a glance it appears that there is some merit in the said argument. Yet, on a careful consideration, it is clear that all that should be done is to require such person to pay forthwith, upon receipt of the Notice of Assessment.

    "text": "In the case of C & E Commissioners v. Ley Rififi Ltd62 it was held that the assessment of the amount due and the notification of it to the taxpayer are distinct operations and this is important if an assessment is received after the expiry of the time limit for assessment. To determine if an assessment has been made within the relevant time limit, should establish the date when it was assessed and not when the assessment was notified. It was also observed that to establish when an assessment was made, the internal records must be inspected. I do concede that that the procedure in England was different, where the assessment is made when the Inspector of Taxes authorized to make the assessment sign the certificate in the assessment book. That is because under the Taxes Management Act, 1970 the Inspector of Taxes was obliged to maintain an assessment book. However, there is no such requirement under the IR Act No.10 of 2006. Yet, as I have already analysed above, even under the IR Act No. 10 of 2006, the time bar is on making the assessment and not on sending the Notice of Assessment. Hence, it is important for the Respondent to satisfy the Court that an assessment has been made prior to the deadline. To ascertain the above fact, the Court may have to refer to internal records or any other available documents which manifest in uncertain terms that an assessment had been made. In my view, the letter communicating the reasons for not accepting the return (letter of intimation) satisfies that the assessment had been made on or before the 7th November 2013, well within two years even from the date of filing the return.",

Based on the above premise, the Appellant argued that the several assessments that are the subject matter of this appeal are time barred. Although the Appellant referred to several assessments, the appeal to the TAC was limited to the three assessments bearing No. 7123212 (1106), 7123214 (1112) and 7123215 (1203)69 out of which the TAC allowed the appeal in respect of assessment No. 7123212 (1106).

The learned Counsel cited the following extract from Lord Woolf, sir Jeffrey Jowell, Catherine Donnelly and Ivan Hare (eds), in De Smiths Judicial Review70 which reads thus; The Carltona principle may be expressly excluded by legislation, but whether it may in addition be excluded by statutory implication remains uncertain. Two situations should be distinguished. Where a power of delegation is expressly conferred by Parliament on a minister, it may compel the inference that Parliament intended to restrict the devolution of power to the statutory method, thus impliedly excluding the Carltona",

To make the example of the present case, no doubt there have been thousands of requisitions in this country by individual ministries. It cannot be supposed that this regulation meant that in each case, the minister in person should direct his mind to the matter. The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case. Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister. The minister is responsible. It is he who must answer before Parliament for anything that his officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an official of such junior standing that he could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that in Parliament. The whole system of departmental organisation and administration is based on the view that ministers, being responsible to Parliament, will see that important duties are committed to experienced officials. If they do not do that, Parliament is the place where complaint must be made against them\". [Emphasis added].",

In particular, Court will be slow to impose such requirements unless there is unequivocal language in the IR Act. It is true that the appeal has to be submitted to the respondent. However, that does not mean that the acknowledgement to be made by the respondent. Similar approach has been taken by our Courts in applying the Carltona principle in relation to administrative functions to be performed by Ministers (M.S.Perera v. Forest Department and another [(1982) 1 Sri. L.R. 187] amd Kuruppu v. Keerthir Rajapakse, Conservator of Forests [(1982) 1 Sri. L.R. 163]. The question of acknowledgement of an appeal arises out of Section 165 (6) of the Act. The Section stipulates the period within which an appeal should be acknowledged and also provides that where it was not so acknowledged the consequence would be that the appeal deem to have been acknowledged on the day it was delivered to the CGIR. However, it is important to observe that nowhere in Section 165 (6) it is stated that the acknowledgement should be done by the CGIR himself, whereas proviso to Section 165 (1), 165 (4) and Sections 165 (7), 165 (8), 165 (9), 165 (10), 165 (11), 165 (12), 165 (13), 165 (14) and 165 (15) specifically enacts the function of the CGIR.",

Accordingly, the words, local produce should only apply to commission agents. The learned Counsel for the Respondent submitted that just as there may not be brokers and insurance agents solely for local produce, there may not be auctioneers solely for local produce. I am in favour of the aforementioned argument of the learned Counsel for the Respondent. It is true that there will be no brokers, insurance agents, auctioneers or commission agents for local products alone. However, it is common knowledge that insurance companies have different types of insurance schemes in their insurance activities. Some companies have coverage for crops that may include a special coverage for local produce. Similarly, an auctioneer, broker or commission agent, among many other services they provide, may also deal with local produce. In such a case, the turnover of the services supplied for any local product would be exempt from the NBT.",

If the interpretation of the learned Counsel for the Appellant is accepted, the entire turnover of an auctioneer, broker and insurance agent will be exempt from NBT and only the turnover of a commission agent from local produce would be exempted. I see no valid reason for the Legislature to grant such an exemption for the specified categories, other than to promote transactions relating to local products. Furthermore, according to the English text, a commission agent will be entitled to the exemption and, according to the Sinhalese text, an auctioneer will be entitled to the exemption. In my view, such an absurd interpretation would never have been the intention of the Legislature. It is therefore my opinion that the aforementioned argument is unfounded.",

Fiscally it may assume varying shapes, especially in a growing economy. For instance, tax holding to new units, concessional rate of tax to goods or persons for limited period or with specific objective etc. That is why its construction, unlike charging provision, is like an exception and on normal principle of construction or interpretation of statutes, it is construed strictly either because of legislative intention or on economic justification of inequitable burden or progressive approach of fiscal provisions intended to augment State revenue.",
