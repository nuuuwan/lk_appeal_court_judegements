MENAKA WIJESUDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to set aside the order of the learned High

Court Judge of Chillaw on the refusal to allow the defense to send the document

marked P1 by the prosecution for examination by the Examiner of Questioned

Documents.

The position of the petitioner is that the prosecution has charged the petitioner

under section 389 of the Penal Code and the prosecution has marked a

document marked as P1 which is supposed to have been drafted by the

petitioner. The position of the prosecution is that the said document contains 13

paragraphs whereas the position of the petitioner is that the document the

petitioner prepared contains only 11 paragraphs and the 12th and the 13th

paragraphs have been introduced by the complainant to implicate the

petitioner.

As such the petitioner has made an application to send the alleged document to

the Examiner of Questioned Documents (hereinafter referred to as the EQD) in

order to ascertain the truth. But the learned High Court Judge has refused on the

basis that the application should have been made at the time the complainant

was being cross examined. The petitioner concedes that there was a delay on

the part of the petitioner; nevertheless the instant application is made in the

interest of justice.

The sate counsel appearing for the respondents stated that the petitioner being

a lawyer and her husband being in the police force should have had the foresight

to make the application at the very beginning and accused the petitioner of

being high handed in submitting a photocopy of a marked document in Court

without the permission of Court to be examined by the EQD.

The Counsel for the petitioner conceded the delay but justified the delay in

citing the case of Gadakanda vs. Attorney General 2005 3 Sri L R 293, where it

had been held that,

(1) our law recognizes two direct methods of proving the handwriting of a

person:

(i) By an admission of the person who wrote it;

(ii) By the evidence of some witness who saw it written.

(2) There are also three other modes of proof by opinion namely-

(i) By the evidence of a handwriting expert (section 45)

(ii) By the evidence of a witness acquainted with the handwriting of the

person who is said to have written the writing in question (Section

47)

(iii) Opinions formed by Court on Comparison made by itself (Section 73)

(3) The High Court Judge was right in referring the disputed writing to the

EQD for examination and report. Whatever opinion the EQD may express, it

is for the Judge to decide the author of the disputed writings.

In the instant matter it is the petitioner who has made the application to send

the document marked as P1 to the EQD in order to ascertain whether paragraph

12 and 13 has been interpolated.

The position of the prosecution is that the complainant signed empty papers and

alleges that the interpolation was done by the police when the documents were

handed over to the police.

Therefore both parties admit that paragraph 12 and 13 looks different to the

other paragraphs in the document, hence the importance of the EQDs evidence

would be to ascertain as to when the interpolation has taken place. The

evidence of the lay witnesses does not reveal it, the petitioner had cross

examined the prosecution witnesses to establish the difference in the

paragraphs in the document marked P1.

In the above quoted case of Gadakanda vs. AG the Justices of the said case had

referred to section 73 of the Evidence Ordinance which according to their

Lordships entitles the Court to use expert evidence to assist itself for a proper

conclusion in the interest of justice.

Hence in the interest of justice this Court is of the opinion that the said

document should have been sent to the EQD and an expert opinion should have

been sought. The delay it may have caused will be compensated in the due

administration of justice to the accused, because an accused person until proven

guilty is presumed to be innocent and every citizen is entitled for a fair trial,

therefore it is the duty of the trial judge to ensure the same, and it is said that

justice hurried is justice denied.

Hence in view of the material stated above the instant application for revision

is allowed and the impugned order of the trial judge is hereby set aside.

I agree.
