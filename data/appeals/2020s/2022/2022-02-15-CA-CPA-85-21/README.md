Before Menaka Wijesundera J.

Counsel Udaya Bandara for the petitioner.

Argued On 20/01/2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to revise the order of the

learned High Court Judge of Kandy dated 18.2.2020.

In the instant application the first and the second petitioners are the husband

and wife. The two petitioners were indicted for several charges of raping a

minor of 14 years of age, the second petitioner who is the sister of the victim

had been charged for aiding and abetting to commit the principle offence of

rape of a minor

Both the petitioners have pleaded guilty to the indictment and the first

petitioner had been sentenced for 20 years imprisonment with fine and

compensation and the 2nd petitioner had been sentenced to 10 years of

imprisonment.

The facts of the case is that the victim and the 2nd petitioner had been sisters

and the victim had been left in the care of the 2nd petitioner and she had been

after delivery of a child and she had invited the sister to engage in sexual

intercourse with the first petitioner, and she had facilitated the activities and

finally the victim had been pregnant.

In the instant matter although the alleged order had been pronounced in the

year 2020 February the instant application has been filed in 2021 March.

Hence there is a delay of one year.

It is a well-founded principle of law that a party filling a revision application

must satisfy Court that there are exceptional circumstances which shocks the

conscious of Court, to invoke the powers of revision of Court because revision is

a discretionary power and not a right vested by a statute. This has been well

founded and established in our legal decisions of the Superior Courts.

But another well founded principle is that the party filling the application of

revision must be before Court without any delay. Delay has been considered to

be a fatal error if the petitioner fails to explain to the satisfaction of Court the

reasons for the delay. This has been discussed in our previously concluded

matters in our legal history and by the present bench also in the matter of CA

/PHC/APN78/2021 and it was decided that the delay needs to be explained

sufficiently to the satisfaction of the presiding Judges.

In the instant matter the reason for delay has been explained to be due to the

Covid-19 pandemic.

But what the petitioners have failed to be mindful is that although the

pandemic broke out in 2020 March there were sporadic periods from 2020

March to 2021 March where the country functioned normally. Therefore the

petitioners had ample opportunities to have obtained legal assistance. But the

petitioners have failed to do so.

Therefore it is the well-considered view of this Court that the petitioners have

not explained the delay sufficiently and as such this Court sees no reason to

issue notice in this matter for the respondents.

Hence the instant application for revision is dismissed in limine.
