WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Embilipitiya

for committing the offence of Murder of Geeganage Piyarathne on or

about 13.04.2006, an offence punishable under section 296 of the

Penal Code. After the trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the

appellant and imposed death sentence by his judgment dated

20.07.2021. This appeal is preferred against the said conviction and

sentence.

According to the prosecution, an altercation occurred in front of the

accused-appellant's house on the day before the Sinhala-Hindu new

year in 2006, around 9.00 p.m.. Geeganage Piyarathne died as a result

of cranio-cerebral injuries sustained following a gunshot.

3

The appellant was seen armed with a gun at the place of the incident,

according to evidence. A bomb explosion also occurred shortly after the

firing. As a result of the explosion, three prosecution witnesses, PW-1,

PW-2, and PW-3, were injured.

After the prosecution case, the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred

to as the appellant) opted to testify under oath and also called his

sister to give evidence on his behalf. The appellant took the defence of

alibi that he was at his sister's house on the night of the alleged

incident.

Both parties have tendered their written submissions, prior to the

hearing. At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the

appellant and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent

made oral submissions. Although five grounds of appeal have been set

out in the written submissions tendered on behalf of the appellant, the

learned Counsel for the appellant confined his arguments to the

following three grounds at the hearing of the appeal.

I. The learned High Court Judge rejected the defence of alibi on

illegal and factually incorrect grounds.

II. The learned High Court Judge has relied on testimony not given

in arriving at the finding of guilt.

III. The learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence

in its totality with specific regard to the contradictions both inter

se and per se of the witnesses.

The learned counsel for the appellant pointed out certain inter se and

per se contradictions and contended that the prosecution witnesses are

not credible. Also, he advanced an argument to demonstrate that the

identification of the accused-appellant is doubtful.

4

The learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) for the respondent

conceded that there was a bomb explosion and it has been done by

someone other than the appellant. Also, the learned DSG admitted that

there was an altercation between two groups at that time. However, he

contended that when the entire evidence is considered, it can be

concluded that the appellant shot the deceased because the appellant

was the only person carrying a gun at the time and the judicial medical

officer's opinion was that the deceased died as a result of a gunshot

injury.

Before considering the defence of alibi, I wish to consider the case

presented by the prosecution. The judicial medical officer (JMO)

expressed his opinion that the deceased died as a result of a gunshot

injury. According to the postmortem report, it was a single gunshot.

Undisputedly, no one has seen the appellant shooting the deceased.

Also, no weapon has been recovered. However, the prosecution

presented evidence to establish the fact that the appellant was present

with a gun in hand when the incident occurred.

PW-1, PW-2, and PW-3 were injured as a result of the bomb explosion

that occurred immediately after the gunshot was fired. The Government

Analysts report marked P-6, states that it is a hand grenade. However,

it has not been revealed who exploded this hand grenade. When

considering the incident of shooting, according to the JMO, he observed

cranio-cerebral injuries on the body of the deceased following a

discharge of a single gunshot. PW-3 stated that he saw the appellant

armed with a gun. PW-4, his wife, has also stated the same. However,

PW-1 has not stated that the appellant carried a gun. PW-1 has stated

that he heard two gunshots and saw the appellant at the scene with

three others carrying a club or a long pipe ( ).

PW-2 stated that he looked at the appellants house and yard but did

not see the appellant at the time of the incident. According to him, the

appellant was not even to be seen at the place of the incident.

5

Therefore, the prosecution relies on PW-3s evidence in establishing the

charge in the absence of any eyewitness to the incident of the shooting.

According to the JMO, death occurred as a result of injury No-9, which

was caused by firing from a very close distance. The JMO expressed his

opinion that it should be a distance like two feet (pages 331 and 332 of

the appeal brief). Hence, it is apparent that the person who shot the

deceased should have been in very close proximity to him.

According to the testimony of PW-3, he had seen the appellant within a

distance of 20 feet. Further, he stated when he moved two or three feet,

he heard a gunshot, and shortly afterward, he heard a big sound. It is

vital to be noted that when PW-3 was asked what was the appellant

doing with the gun in hand, PW-3 said he was doing nothing.

: ?

: . .

(Page 150 of the appeal brief)

When the gunshot was heard, PW-3 was very close to the appellant. The

distance between them was 20 feet or less. If the appellant fired at that

time, undoubtedly, PW-3 could see him firing. But PW-3 has never

stated that he saw the appellant firing. Instead, as mentioned above, he

stated that although the appellant carried a gun, he was doing nothing.

In addition, when PW-3 stated that he could not even say from which

direction the gunshot was heard (pages 154 and 169 of the appeal brief),

the inference that could be drawn from that evidence is that the firing

had taken place somewhere else, but not in the place where the

appellant was.

There is another important factor to be considered. PW-3 has never

stated that he saw the deceased when he saw the appellant and heard

6

the gunshot. If the deceased was shot from a very close distance like

two feet as per the JMOs expert opinion, it is amply clear that the

deceased and the shooter were somewhere, other than the place where

PW-3 was. Also, it should not be forgotten that the hand grenade had

also been exploded by a person who could not be traced. The aforesaid

prosecution evidence strongly invites to come to the conclusion that the

appellant could not be the person who shot at the deceased.

In Emperor V. Browning - (1917) 18 Cr.L.J. 482, it was held that the

jury must decide whether the facts proved exclude the possibility that

the act was done by some other person, and if they have doubts, the

prisoner must have the benefits of those doubts.

Also, in Don Sunny V. Attorney General (Amarapala murder case)

(1998) 2 Sri L.R. 1, it was held that the prosecution must prove that

no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of committing

the offence.

In addition, it is vital to be noted that in the case of The Queen V. M.G.

Sumanasena 66 NLR 350, it was held that In a criminal case,

suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt. Nor does the proof of

any number of suspicious circumstances relieve the prosecution of its

burden of proving the case against the accused beyond reasonable

doubt and compel the accused to give or call evidence.

In the case at hand, not only has the prosecution not excluded the

possibility that a third person committed the offence, but also

demonstrated by their own evidence, especially by the evidence of

PW-3, that the appellant could not have committed the offence. Hence,

I hold that the charge of murder against the accused-appellant has not

been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

7

Therefore, I hold that the learned High Court Judges decision to convict

the appellant for the offence of murder is bad in law. Accordingly, I set

aside the judgment dated 20.07.2021, the conviction, and the sentence

imposed on the appellant. The appellant is acquitted of the charge

against him.

The appeal is allowed.
