Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner was elected a member of the Kinniya Pradeshiya Sabha in the Trincomalee

District at the Local Government Elections held in 2018 and was elected as the Chairman of

the said Pradeshiya Sabha by its members. The Petitioner was required to submit a budget for

the succeeding year i.e., year 2022 in terms of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act No. 15 of 1987, as

amended (the Act). The issues emanating in this application revolves around the said budget.

In this application, the Petitioner seeks inter alia for orders in the nature of writs quashing the

order and/or decision in the Gazette notification bearing No.2261/6 declaring the Petitioner

is deemed to have been resigned from the office of the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha and

the decision in the Gazette notification bearing No. 2261/21 calling for a meeting to appoint

a new Chairman. The Petitioner also seeks for orders compelling 1st to 7th Respondents to

accept and acknowledge that the budget submitted by the Petitioner for Kinniya Pradeshiya

Sabha (Pradeshiya Sabha) as it has been duly passed at the special meeting held on

24.12.2021.

The sequence of salient events relevant to this application

The sequence of relevant events derived from the pleadings are laid down in the following

manner due to the special circumstances of this case.

Date Events

16.11.2021 6th Respondent Secretary of the Pradeshiya Sabha gave notice to

the members of the Kinniya Pradeshiya Sabha (Members) of a

Special Meeting to discuss the budget for the year 2022 ('the

budget').

Page 5 of 13

19.11.2021 A special meeting was held with the attendance of 11 members,

including the Petitioner.

The Petitioner asked the members to submit their views and

proposals for the budget. Five proposals were made and adopted

unanimously.

Following the meeting, the draft budget was circulated to the

members of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

09.12.2021 The 47th Session Meeting of the Pradeshiya Sabha was held.

The budget was tabled affording an opportunity for the Members

of the Pradeshiya Sabha to tender their views. No such views were

made.

A vote was taken. Despite the many disruptions to the meeting, 7

members voted for and 6 voted against the budget. 1 member was

absent and 2 members abstained.

It was suggested for re-poll due to the disruptions suffered.

15.12.2021

The 2nd Respondent then stated that the vote on the budget was not

duly executed. Thus, the Governor held the vote to be null and void

(Vide - 'P5') and further, the budget must be re-voted in the presence

of the Assistant Commissioner of Local Government, Trincomalee

or his representative, in the public auditorium.

20.12.2021 The 6th Respondent gave notice to the Members of a Special

Meeting for the budget on 24.12.2021.

24.12.2021

03.01.2022

The same budget was presented to the Council.

A vote was taken up. 7 members voted for and 8 voted against the

budget.

The Gazette Notification bearing No. 2261/6 was issued declaring

that the Petitioner is deemed to have resigned from the office of the

Chairman, effective from 01.01.2022 and accordingly, the office of

the Chairman has become vacant.

Page 6 of 13

20.01.2022

The 2nd Respondent summoned a meeting to appoint a new

Chairman. Though the Petitioner was absent, 9 out of the 16

Members were present at the said meeting. Mr. Janaf A.S.

Mohomed Naseer was elected to the post of Chairman. No steps

have been taken so far to declare the election of the new Chairman

by way of a Gazette notification.

The concise argument of the Petitioner.

i. The Budget was duly presented and passed; there were no amendments and/or

modifications; It was presented a second time consequent to a directive by the 1st & 2nd

Respondents. Therefore, the proviso to section 169 must be read in conjunction with the

main part of section 169 and by plain reading it sets out that the budget of the Pradeshiya

Sabha is deemed to be duly adopted irrespective of the fact whether it has been approved

or not by its Members;

ii. 1st & 2nd Respondents acting ultra vires called on the Petitioner to re-submit the budget to

the Council;

iii. The budget was presented twice and there was not a single modification, amendment or

rejection of any items of the budget;

iv. In terms of section 168 of the Act, the budget should be "adopted" and the section 169

comes into operation only if the Pradeshiya Sabha rejects/modifies all or any of the items

of the budget;

v. The words "passed" and "adopted" are encapsulated in the provisions of section 169 and

there are two different meaning to those two words; Accordingly, the matter of 'passing'

the budget in terms of the proviso to section 169 comes into operation only when the

Chairman does not agree to the modification, rejections and/ or additions and otherwise

the budget is deemed to have been 'adopted' in terms of the first portion of section 169;

vi. The premise that a 'Pradeshiya Sabha must "pass" its budget' goes against the provisions

of section 169 of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act;

vii. The Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha is required to re-submit the budget for further

consideration only when the Chairman rejects modification or additions proposed by the

Members.

Page 7 of 13

viii. When there is no amendment or alternative proposal by the Members, the Petitioner

cannot be deemed to have resigned from his post; Members who objected to the budget

did not propose alternatives, evincing mala fides on their part since those members sought

to use the budget to remove the Petitioner from office.

ix. Only the section 185(1) of the Act provides the situations in which the Chairman could be

removed from office, therefore, there is no other manner in which the 1st and 2nd

Respondents can act and publish an order removing the Petitioner from his post.

The contention of the Respondents

The learned Counsel who represented several Respondents advanced the same arguments

made in Madampage Nanda Wijeratne Silva vs Marshall of the Air force Roshan

Goonetileke, Governor-Western Province & others (CA/Writ/649/21 decided on

28.02.2022) in the instant application as well.

The Respondents argued that, the questions relating to this application have already been

resolved by his Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere with the agreement of his Lordship

Justice Mayadunne Corea in four separate cases in this Court, i.e., Wellawattage Sarath

Peiris vs. Katunayake Seeduwa Urban Council, Seeduwa & others (CA/Writ/24/2021

decided on 10.06.2021), Manodara Aacharige Chaminda Sugath vs. Anuradha

Yahampath, Governor, Eastern Province & others (CA/Writ/51/2021 decided on

10.06.2021), H.M. Lalantha Sumith Seneviratne vs. Pradeshiya Sabhawa of

Padiyathalawa & others (CA/Writ/57/2021 decided on 10.06.2021) and A.P.

Ranasinghe Bandara, Chairman vs. Anuradha Yahampath, Governor of Eastern Province

& others (CA/Writ/61/2021 decided on 10.06.2021). Accordingly, Respondents moved

that these applications be dismissed in limine without issuing formal notice on the

Respondents.

In the circumstances, as I mentioned in CA/Writ/649/2021, it is necessary to ascertain

whether the Petitioner has submitted a case which is suitable for full investigation and a

hearing after issuing notice on all the Respondents. In the backdrop of the above orders made

Page 8 of 13

by this Court and upon the circumstances, the Court should be satisfied that there is a prima

facie case that ought to be resolved after full argument.

The arguments advanced by the Senior State Counsel (SSC)

The learned SSC appearing for the 1st to 4th Respondents illustrated three alternative

situations, which will follow the submission of a budget to the Local Authority by a

Chairman. The three such situations and their respective outcomes have been mentioned in

my previous order in CA/Writ/649/2021.

Accordingly, the Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha has absolute autonomy over the budget for

the first two years of the tenure of the Local Authority, but from the third year the position

changes. Therefore, the applicable provision in the instant application is the proviso to section

169, as the first two years have lapsed since the commencement of the term of the office of

the Council.

The learned SSC rejecting the arguments of the Petitioner reiterated the fact that the

Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha is required to re-submit a budget for the approval of the

Members when the same has been defeated. The concept of a budget being deemed to have

been passed cannot be accepted and in every case the budget has to be actually passed by a

majority vote and if the Chairman does not take steps to submit an alternative budget, the

Chairman will be deemed to have resigned from his post.

Further, the learned SSC referring to His Lordship Justice Obeyesekere's observation in

CA/Writ/51/2021 submitted that the publication of the Gazette was not an exercise of power

of the Governor and it is only an intimation of a factual position that the office of the

Chairman has fallen vacant by operation of law.

Previous orders of this Court on the issue

His Lordship Justice Obeyesekere has observed in CA/Writ/51/2021 (decided on

10.06.2021) that once a budget is submitted to the Council & debated and thereafter whatever

the modifications or additions that a Chairman may agree to during or after such debate, the

budget must be submitted by the Chairman to the Council for its decision. The Court has

further held that this is mandatory and is confirmed by the use of the word 'decision' in the

Page 9 of 13

proviso to Section 178A of the Urban Council Ordinance and in terms of its section 26(2) a

decision would mean a "vote".

His Lordship Justice Obeyesekere has further held that the Chairman agreeing to any

modifications or additions that may be proposed by one or more or even all members does

not suffice in order to claim the budget has been passed.

His Lordship Justice Obeyesekere has taken a similar viewpoint in CA/Writ/24/2021

(decided on 10.06.2021), CA/Writ/57/2021 (decided on 10.06.2021) and

CA/Writ/61/2021 (decided on 10.06.2021).

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the cases

CA/Writ/57/2021 and CA/Writ/61/2021 of this Court, mentioned above, should be

distinguished from the instant application.

i. The facts of the case bearing No. CA/Writ/57/2021 show that the Chairman of

the Pradeshiya Sabha has not assented to the amendments proposed to the budget

and incorporated same to the proposed budget.

ii. The facts of the case bearing No. CA/Writ/61/2021 show that although

amendments were proposed to the budget they were not presented to the Council.

iii. There were no amendments proposed in the instant application.

The scope of Section 168 & 169 of the Act

The vital question in this case is whether the Petitioner is entitled to declare the budget which

was defeated when it was submitted the second time, as duly adopted/passed under section

169 of the Act on the alleged footing that there wasnt a single modification or amendment

proposed by the Members.

The above question has been exhaustively addressed by His Lordship Justice Obeyesekere in

CA/Writ/61/2021, (along with the 3 other similar cases bearing numbers

CA/Writ/24/2021, CA/Writ/57/2021 and CA/Writ/51/2021), as elaborated in my

previous order in the case bearing No. CA/Writ/649/2021 (decided on 28.02.2022).

Page 10 of 13

I am of the view that the debating, the discussions and voting is a paramount feature in a

democratic representative body such as the Pradeshiya Sabha. I need to reiterate the following

passage in my order CA/Writ/649/2021 (decided on 28.02.2022).

"The above preamble specifically reflects the representative political will of the constituents. In

other words, members of the Pradeshiya Sabha represent their constituents in the Pradeshiya

Sabha and act as their agents. Accordingly, democracy and good governance eventually follow

with the functioning of the Pradeshiya Sabhas. That is the rationale behind the provisions of

Section 14 (1) of the Act. Therefore, taking a vote in the house of the Pradeshiya Sabha is to

protect the said democracy and good governance and as a whole the rule of law of the country."

As per my previous Order in the case bearing No. CA/Writ/649/2021, I take the view that

the deeming provision should be carefully interpreted in the above lines of the basic principles

of democracy and good governance without curtailing the consent or the division of the

members of the Pradeshiya Sabha. I hold that the reasoning given by me to arrive at the

conclusion in the said case is applicable in relation to the questions in the instant application

also.

The precedent set by His Lordship Justice Obeysekere in the aforesaid four cases can be

directly adopted in the instant application as well in resolving the questions raised here. For

the reasons given by His Lordship Justice Obeysekere, now it is a well-established precedent

that a Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha is not entitled to declare the budget which was

defeated any time after two years, as duly adopted under section 169 of the Act based on the

alleged reason that there had been no amendments/modifications/rejections proposed to the

budget.

Furthermore, I am not inclined to accept the proposition of the learned Presidents Counsel

for the Petitioner that the word adopt has a distinct meaning from the word pass. I take

the view that one cannot distinguish the words "adopted" and passed embodied in section

169 of the Act to circumvent the real effect of the said section. The Sinhala text of the section

168 (2) is as follows:

Page 11 of 13

, , ,

. (Emphasis added)

Even though the English text of the section 168 (2) referred to word adopt as well as the

word passed, the Sinhala text of section 168 & 169 uses only one word and that is

. I am of the view that the said word is equivalent to the impression of

the word pass which requires the majority votes of the Council. In terms of section 18 of

the Local Government Special Provision Act No. 21 of 2012 by which the proviso to section

169 has been introduced stipulates that when there is an inconsistency between the Sinhala

and Tamil text of the Act, the Sinhala text shall prevail.

Further, I have observed in the case bearing No. CA/Writ/649/2021 (at page 17) as follows:

" No question arises, if the budget is passed at the first instance. If it is defeated, the deeming

provisions in the proviso to section 169 will come in to limelight after the first two years, only if

the budget is defeated for the second time irrespective of the fact that the Chairman has accepted

the amendments. This is because the proviso to section 169 is also subjected to mandatory

provisions laid down in section 168 (2) as discussed in above case CA/Writ/61/2021. Another

important ingredient to give due effect to the proviso of section 169 and 1st portion of the said

section is the stipulated time period i.e., two weeks."

Relief

It is important to draw my attention to the Petition (marked 'P7(a))' dated 28.12.2021 filed by

the Petitioner and withdrawn subsequently. The Petitioner alleges in paragraph 10 of the said

petition as follows;

"Without prejudice to the grave concerns the Petitioner had and continues to have with regard to

the vires and legality of the aforesaid direction, the Petitioner in good faith called for a new

reading on the budget and notice was accordingly sent to the 8th to the 22nd Respondents by the

Page 12 of 13

6th Respondent calling for a meeting of the 5th Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha on 24 December

2021"

Moreover, I find the similar averments in paragraph 10 of the instant application as well. The

paragraph 12 (a) to 12 (d) of the Petition of the Petitioner are as follows:

a. "Accordingly, the Petitioner presented the very same budget annexed as "P3(b)" herein

above at the said meeting of the 5th Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha held on 24th December

2021."

b. "During the reading of the budget there were no amendments proposed by any member of the

Pradeshiya Sabha."

c. "The Petitioner accordingly, accepted the said Budget as the duly approved Budget of the 5th

Respondent in terms of the Law."

d. "However, certain members moved for a division and a vote on the said Budget and when the

vote was taken the members voted as 7 voting for and 8 members voting against."

In the above background now, I advert to the reliefs sought by the Petitioner in this

application.

The 2nd Respondent by his letter dated 15.12.2021 (marked 'P5(i)') has informed the Petitioner

that the voting taken place on 09.12.2021 had been null and void as the voting process was

not properly implemented and also due to the fact that the decision on voting had not been

pronounced to the Council accurately. In the same letter the 2nd Respondent has given

instructions to the Petitioner to repeat the budget 2022 and take a vote in the presence of the

3rd Respondent. It is obvious with the contents of the aforesaid paragraphs of the Petition that

the Petitioner without challenging the said direction has acquiesced with the decision of the

1st Respondent and/or he 2nd Respondent and has taken steps to re-submit the budget to the

Council. It is apparent that the Petitioner has opted not to challenge the legality of the decision

of the 1st Respondent who directed to re-submit the budget on the grounds given by the 1st

Respondent.

Therefore, by perusing the documents submitted by the Petitioner, I find the submission of

the budget on 24.12.2021 is none other than a re-submission of the budget which comes well

within the purview of the proviso to section 169 of the Act. On 24.12.2021 upon the said re-

Page 13 of 13

submission of the budget, the Petitioner has failed to secure the majority votes and therefore,

the Petitioner shall be deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman.

In this regard it is very much important to draw the attention to the following paragraphs in

the said CA/Writ/61/2021 (at pages 7 & 8);

e) In the first two years however, even if the budget is not passed, by operation of law, the

budget submitted by the Chairman is the duly adopted budget of the Pradeshiya Sabha

vide Section 169;

f) After the first two years, the Chairman must have the budget passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha,

for which he has been provided two opportunities vide the proviso to Section 169;

g) After the first two years, the failure on the part of the Chairman to have the budget passed on

either of the two occasions afforded to him would attract the consequences set out in the

proviso to Section 169 i.e., the Chairman is deemed to have resigned from office.

Thus, I am of the view that the 1st Respondent Governor has given due effect to the provisions

of sections 14, 168 and 169 of the Act and lawfully decided that Petitioner was deemed to

have resigned from his post of Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

Therefore, based on the arguability principles that should be adopted in respect of matters

relating to issuance of notice in a juridical review application, I arrive at the conclusion that

there is no arguable case for this Court to issue formal notice on the Respondents in this

application. Therefore, I proceed to refuse this application.
