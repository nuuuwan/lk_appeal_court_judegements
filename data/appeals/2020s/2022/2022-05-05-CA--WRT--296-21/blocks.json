Since the transfers got delayed in 2021 maximum benefit has been afforded to the Applicants by extending the date of Board of Certification until 31 of December. The Respondents claim is that the first Notification P4 has been published without amendment due to a mistake and therefore said Notification P4 had been amended by the subsequent Notification P7 issued on 05.04.2021, 10 days before the closing date of the applications for transfers. The only amendment that appears in the Notification P7 when compared with the Notification P4 is that has specified that it the applicants who had obtained the Board Certification by 31.12.2021 may only apply for the Annual Transfers. However, it is observed that the Board Certification of the Petitioner has been approved only on 11.02.2021 (P2).

Some have difficulty in finding a post, hence their board certification may get delayed by one or two years. Some prefer to work abroad for two years. If the date they return to Sri Lanka is taken as the date of appointment, persons in the same batch will have different dates of appointment and they would miss batches. Therefore, the date they are supposed to face the MD Part II exam and passed, is taken as the date of appointment as a Specialist Medical Officer and therefore the appointment is backdated. Hence, the Respondents contention is that the rationale behind backdating the appointment is to avoid any person from missing their batch so that it shall be of no effect to the seniority of such Medical Officers.

    "text": "Hence, I am of the view that the Petitioner was board certified by the 31.12.2020 (on the closing date of application i.e., 21.04.2021) for the reason that the requirement of possessing of a board certificate physically by 31.12.2020 as claimed by the Respondents, is not clearly reflected in the Notifications P4 or P7 Further it appears that there is no bar for PGIM in law to award the Board Certification retrospectively. On the reasons stated above I issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari and Writ of mandamus as prayed in the prayers (c) and (d) to the petition. I order no cost.",
