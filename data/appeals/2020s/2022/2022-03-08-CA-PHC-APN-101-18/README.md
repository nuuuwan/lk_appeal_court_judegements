This is a revision application filed on 03.10.2018 against an order of the High

Court, Kandy dated 05.06.2018 which dismissed a preliminary objection raised

by the Accused-Respondent-Petitioners (hereinafter petitioners) at the appeal

stage.

The impugned order deals with an objection which contended that the appeal

filed by the Attorney General against the order of the Magistrate Court dated

30.12.2015 in Case No 12670 was improperly constituted, praying for the same

to be dismissed. In overruling the said objection, the impugned order of the High

Court dated 05.06.2018 directs both parties to proceed with the appeal before

High Court. Aggrieved by the said overruling, the present revision application has

been filed.

Petitioners are 1st and 2nd accused in case No 12670 filed in Magistrate Court of

Kandy under two separate charge sheets for fraudulently consuming electricity

in violation of Section 67(C) of the Electricity Act No 19 of 1950. After the two

charge sheets were read, the petitioners pleaded not guilty, and the learned

Magistrate discharged the petitioners on 05.05.2014 due to the lackadaisical

nature of the complainant.

The case was reopened on 27.10.2014. The trial proceeded in absentia, and the

prosecution closed their case. However, the accused were later represented and

pointed to an error in the charge sheet and requested that the accused be

discharged under Sec 186 of Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter CPC).

Ultimately, the learned Magistrate discharged both petitioners on 30.12.2015 on

the basis that the charges against the accused could not be maintained. Against

such discharge, State filed an appeal on 01.02.2016 in the High Court of Kandy,

and an amended petition amending the caption was filed on 07.07.2016.

On 19.06.2017, the preliminary objection pertinent to the instant application was

raised, which was subsequently overruled by the learned High Court Judge on

05.06.2018 by the impugned order.

CA-PHC-APN-101-2018 Page 5 of 10 08/03/2022 IJ-10-22

Having listened to the submissions by both parties, the following issues will be

analysed in order to ascertain whether the impugned order may be intervened

with under the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

1. Is the order of the Magistrate Court dated 30.12.2015 a discharge or an

acquittal?

2. Is the appeal filed against the said Magistrate Court order in the High

Court on 01.02.2016 properly constituted?

With regard to the first issue, the following part of the order of the Magistrate

Court is reproduced:

,

01 , 02

. (Page 476 of Appeal Brief)

Even though the learned Magistrate has used the terminology

(discharge), the words employed by the Magistrate are identical to the Sinhala

text of the proviso to section 186 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter

CPC) which speak of acquittal:

, .

(Emphasis added)

In the instant matter, the prosecution has closed their case, and the learned

Magistrate has recorded reasons that further proceedings in the case will not

result in the conviction of the accused. In doing so, the Magistrate has utiltised

the discretion vested on him under the proviso to Section186 of the CPC where

the learned Magistrate has referred to a discharge when he has acquitted the

accused.

CA-PHC-APN-101-2018 Page 6 of 10 08/03/2022 IJ-10-22

In Dyson v Khan 31 NLR 136, it was held that: Where in summary trial the

Magistrate at the close of the case for the prosecution made order discharging the

accused, as the evidence failed to establish the charge. Held that the order was

tantamount to an acquittal under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Hence, in answering the first above, this Court holds that the order of the

Magistrate dated 30.12.2015 is tantamount to an acquittal.

When considering the second issue, the primary submission of the Presidents

Counsel for the petitioner was that the appeal filed on 01.02.2016 was improperly

constituted as the Attorney General was not named as a party. While admitting

that the complainant was represented by a State Counsel of the Attorney

Generals Department, the Presidents Counsel insisted that the Attorney General

was not a party to the appeal. Thereafter, the Presidents Counsel referred to

Section 318 of the CPC, contending that the appeal filed on 01.02.2016 was

without written sanction of the Attorney General as stipulated under the said

section.

This argument was canvassed before the High Court as well, at which instance

the learned High Court Judge rejected the application of Section 318 in the

instant matter on the basis that the Magistrate order dated 30.12.2015 was a

discharge and that Section 318 would only apply if the order was an acquittal.

This Court cannot accept this reasoning. As previously examined, the said order

dated 30.12.2015 is tantamount to an acquittal. Hence, this Court will now

ascertain whether Section 318 of the CPC is applicable.

For this purpose, one must first refer to Section 320 of the CPC, which provides

Right of Appeal. The said section stipulates two instances. Subsection (1)

provides for any person to prefer an appeal against an order of Magistrate in a

criminal matter, and Subsection (2) provides the Attorney General may prefer

an appeal from the same. It is only in instances falling under Subsection (1) which

are subjected to Section 138 of the CPC:

(1) Subject to the provisions of sections 317, 318 and 319 any person who

shall be dissatisfied with any judgment or final order pronounced by any

Magistrate's Court in a criminal case or matter to which he is a party may

CA-PHC-APN-101-2018 Page 7 of 10 08/03/2022 IJ-10-22

prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against such judgment for any error

in law, or in fact

Subsection (2), where the Attorney General prefers an appeal, such applications

are only subjected to Section 317 of the CPC:

(2) Subject to the relevant provision of section 317 the Attorney-General

may prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against any judgment or final

order pronounced by a Magistrate's Court in any criminal case or matter,

and where he so appeals, or where he sanctions an appeal, the time within

which' the petition of appeal must be preferred shall be twenty-eight days.

As such, it is pertinent to glean whether the instant appeal falls under Section

320(1) or Section 320(2) of the CPC. For this purpose, this Court will examine

whether the appeal filed on 01.02.2016 was filed by the Attorney General or by

the complainant on their own accord. At this juncture, this Court will refer to the

order of the learned High Court Judge dated 19.06.2017, which deals with the

same issue. The said order embarks on an examination of Section 320(1) of the

CPC in contrast to Section 320(2), to hold that the instant appeal was filed under

the distinct powers vested with the Attorney General under Section 320(2) of the

CPC. The order further holds that the appeal falls within the purview of Section

186 of the CPC, thereby entitling the Attorney General to file a petition of appeal

under Section 320(2) provisions within 28 days. Regarding Section 320(1) the

learned High Court Judge observes the following at Page 602 of the Appeal Brief:

.

Hence, the order discerns that the Attorney General has resorted to filing the

appeal under Section 320(2), which empowers the Attorney General to file an

appeal against a judgment/final order of the Magistrate, despite the Attorney

General not being named as a party to the Magistrate Court action.

...

. (Page 603 of the Appeal Brief)

In buttressing this observation, the learned High Court further refers to the State

Counsel who made submissions on behalf of the Attorney General in the course

of the appeal. As such, reference is made to the petition. The signature placed at

the end of the petition does not contain the words Complainant-Appellant but

rather the name of the State Counsel appearing on behalf of the Attorney General.

This Court agrees with the analysis of the learned High Court Judge. The

discretion vested on the Attorney General in advising or otherwise deciding on

the institution of criminal proceedings is clearly set out in the CPC. In this regard,

Sections 360, 393 (2), (4), 401, of the CPC and 114 (d) of Evidence Ordinance can

be referred to. When a State Counsel appears in their official capacity as

representatives of the Attorney General, it is a presumption that such person is

acting under the direction of the Attorney General unless strong evidence to the

contrary is presented. No such evidence was presented. The Presidents Counsel

merely relied on the caption of the appeal, which the record shows, was amended

subsequently on 07.07.2016 to include the Attorney General as a party. This

amendment was done in open courts and no objections were raised by the

petitioner.

The contention of the Presidents Counsel for the petitioner was that the

respondents had filed a fresh appeal by such amendment, by which the action is

time-barred. On this point, the analysis of the learned High Court Judge can be

relied on. The learned High Court Judge examines whether the filing of an appeal

is prescribed as falling outside the time bar of 28 days from the delivery of the

Magistrate Court order dated 30.12.2015. Observing that the appeal petition was

filed on 01.02.2016, the impugned order holds the petition was filed within 27

days and is thus not prescribed. In the order, the learned High Court Judge deals

with the effect of the amended petition whereby the Attorney General was added

as a party. It refers to the contention of the petitioner that the calculation of the

prescription should begin at such date of amendment i.e., 07.07.2016 (6 months

since the delivery of the Magistrate Court order). The learned High Court Judge

CA-PHC-APN-101-2018 Page 9 of 10 08/03/2022 IJ-10-22

rejects this contention. In this regard the following portion of the order of the

High Court is reproduced.

Brief)

We agree with this reasoning. For the purpose of reckoning the period of

prescription, the appeal must be taken to have been instituted on the date of the

original petition and not upon the amendment of the caption of the petition. The

petitioner was not misled prior to the said amendment as he was well aware the

appeal was lodged against an acquittal of the petitioners where the Ceylon

Electricity Board has lodged a complaint for violations under the Electricity Act

No 19 of 1950. Neither did the nature of the said appeal change by virtue of the

amended caption. There was no doubt that the Attorney General was

representing the interests of Ceylon Electricity Board as was evinced by the

signature of the State Counsel and his physical appearance therein. Echoing the

words of Chief Justice Abrahams in Velupillai v Chairman U. C. Jaffna 39 NLR

464, this is a court of law and not an academy of law, and its operations should

not be trammeled by technical and frivolous objections.

CA-PHC-APN-101-2018 Page 10 of 10 08/03/2022 IJ-10-22

Therefore, it is the considered view of this Court that the appeal filed against the

order of the Magistrate dated 30.12.2015 has been properly constituted. Hence,

we see no reason to interfere with the dismissal of the preliminary objection by

the High Court in its order dated 05.06.2018. Therefore, this Court directs the

expeditious conclusion of the inquiry pending before the High Court which has

been put on hold due to this revision application.

Application dismissed.
