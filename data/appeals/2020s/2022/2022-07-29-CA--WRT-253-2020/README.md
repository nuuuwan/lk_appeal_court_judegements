B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Petitioners, by Petition, dated 24th August 2020, invoking the writ jurisdiction

of this Court in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution, seek, inter alia, a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision or determination of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports in

their letter to the Nuwara Eliya Motor Racing Club marked P18, a Writ of Mandamus

directing the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports through the 7th to 30th Respondents to register

the Nuwara Eliya Motor Racing Club as an affiliate Member Club of the Sri Lanka

Automobile Sports as from the date of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports communication

marked P8 with voting rights from 09th March 2016, and a Writ of Mandamus directing

the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports through the 7th to 30th Respondents to issue Nuwara

Eliya Motor Racing Club with a Certificate of Registration as per Clause 7(xix) of the 2016

Regulations marked P4. The Petitioners informed Court on the date of argument as

well as in their written submissions that they are only pursuing prayers (c), (d), and (e)

in the Petition.

The dispute primarily revolves around the question of whether the Nuwara Eliya

Motor Racing Club (hereinafter referred to as the NEMRC) is eligible to be registered

as an affiliate Member Club of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports (hereinafter referred to

as SLAS). SLAS is the controlling body for Automobile (Motor) Sports in Sri Lanka,

established under the Sports Law No. 25 of 1973, as amended. SLAS is also governed by

the National Associations of Sports Regulations, No. 1 of 2016 made by the Minister of

Sports under Section 41 read with Section 31 of the Sports Law. The Petitioners contend

that the Nuwara Eliya Racing Club has satisfied the criteria to become an affiliate Club

Page 7 of 17

having been issued a communication marked P8 by the Secretary of Sri Lanka

Automobile Sports certifying the same.

As narrated in the Petition, NEMRC is a Motor Racing Club in Sri Lanka, formed

in the year 1997. It has conducted several meets and races over the years. It has a

membership of 180 members. NEMRC by letter dated 27th June 2013 (marked P2(b))

applied to become an affiliate Member Club of SLAS, furnishing the details of their

eligibility to be qualified in accordance with Rule 4(1) of the SLAS Constitution. Rule 4(i)

titled, Membership and Voting Rights reads:

The Association shall consist of legally and duly constituted Clubs or Associations,

which have Motor sports as one of the primary objectives with a minimum paid up

membership of 50 and have been in existence for at least one year. Such member Clubs

and Associations shall have voting rights as detailed under Rule 8 conferred upon thein

by the Executive council after the satisfactory completion of a further probationary period

of 12 months from the date of their admission. If the Executive Council should refuse to

confer voting rights at the end of such probationary period, such Club or Association shall

immediately cease to be a member. However, on fulfilling the requirements subsequently,

as per clause 23 herein such Club shall be eligible for re-application and re- Consideration

for membership.

The President of the SLAS Interim Committee by letter dated 16th August 2013

(marked P5) required the NEMRC to forward a copy of the Minutes of the last AGM

with the names of the Office bearers and Council members and confirmation of a paid-up

membership of a minimum of 50 members. In addition, the NEMRC was required to

conduct two SLAS authorised events with Clubs affiliated with SLAS within a calendar

year. The Petitioners state that NEMRC fulfilled these requirements. They conducted two

meets; the Nuwara Eliya Road Races and the Walawe Super Cross in conjunction with

the Sri Lanka Motor Cycle Club. (The fact that these two meets have been conducted and

SLAS was aware of the same is evident on a perusal of the document titled Sri Lanka

Automobile Sports Annual Report for the year 2014/2015 which is attached to the letter

sent by the Secretary of SLAS to all Member Clubs dated 06th March 2015 marked

P7(g). On page 2 of the same, it is stated that Nuwara Eliya Motor Sports Club ran

their two meets in conjunction with SLMCC.)

Page 8 of 17

Despite submitting the same, SLAS had not confirmed NEMRCs status as an

affiliate Member Club. In a letter dated 08th December 2014 (marked P6), the Secretary

of NEMRC wrote to the President of SLAS requesting to grant affiliation as a Member

Club with full voting rights as they have met all the necessary criteria. The Petitioners

state that following this letter, SLAS included NEMRC in all its official communications,

circulars, and correspondences. By a communication dated 09th March 2015 (marked P8)

the Secretary of SLAS wrote to the Secretary of NEMRC thus:

This is to certify that the Nuwara Eliya Racing Club is affiliated to Sri Lanka Automobile

Sports which is the Governing body of the Automobile Sports in Sri Lanka.

Forwarded for your information and necessary action please [emphasis added]

Relying on this communication NEMRC nominated five of its members to attend

the SLAS Annual General Meeting held on 27th March 2015. This is because in terms of

Rule 8 of the SLAS Constitution each Member Club can nominate five of its members to

attend and vote at any General Meeting of SLAS. (Nonetheless, the said five

representatives of NEMRC who participated could not vote since in terms of Rule 4 voting

rights are conferred only on the completion of the 12-month probationary period from the

date of its admission).

The 7th to 30th Respondents took office as the Executive Council of SLAS following

the Annual General Meeting held on 29th March 2016. The Petitioners claim that since

the time of their taking office on 29th March 2016, NEMRC has been unjustifiably

prevented from exercising its rights as an affiliate Member Club and that without any

valid reason they have treated the affiliation of NEMRC as having been cancelled or

suspended with effect from 29th March 2016, without any inquiry. In this regard, our

attention was drawn to Regulation 7(xx) of the National Associations of Sports

Regulations 2016 which state that every National Association of Sports (in this case

SLAS) shall have the power to:

Cancel or suspend the registration of affiliates, clubs or other organisations on the

disciplinary ground or breach of the provisions of the Constitution of the National Association of

Sports after a due and proper inquiry held in accordance with the law.

The officials of NEMRC then met and appealed to the Sports Minister. Following

an inquiry, the National Selection Committee, which was conferred powers by the

Page 9 of 17

Minister to resolve grievances and disputes pertaining to any National Association of

Sports, by letter dated 10th November 2018 (marked P17) wrote to SLAS recommending

that NEMRC be registered as an affiliate Member Club of SLAS as NEMRC had fulfilled

the requirements stipulated in the Constitution of SLAS.

Nevertheless, the Petitioners state that, despite subsequent requests of NEMRC

to register it, the final of such requests on 12th February 2019 (marked P19), it is yet to

be registered as an affiliate Member Club and is thus before this Court.

The 7A to 33A Respondents (the caption of the instant application has been

amended to include the 7A to 33A Respondents to reflect the change in the membership

of the Executive Council following the Annual General Meeting held on 31st August 2020)

contend that the document marked P8 relied on by the Petitioners was one signed by

the Secretary of SLAS. However, because of the judgment of this Court in CA WRT

Application No. 315/2014 delivered on 31.03.2016, the election of the office bearers to the

Executive Council of SLAS at the election held on 27th August 2014 has been declared

ultra vires.

It must be noted that the judgment of this Court was delivered on 31st March 2016.

It declared the elections held on 27th August 2014 ultra vires on the basis that the decision

of the then Director General of Sports Development to hold an election for the Executive

Council of SLAS was ultra vires. It was found that the Director General had exceeded his

powers in terms of the Sports Law and its Regulations in doing so.

We do not think that it is just and fair for the Respondents to resile from their

representation made to NEMRC on 09th March 2015 (P8). The communication, which is

admitted by the Respondents to be signed by the Secretary, states the fact of NEMRCs

recognition as an affiliate Member Club. It is not contended that the signature of the

Secretary is forged or that the document is fraudulent or any other contention to that

effect. The fact that the decision evidenced therein had been made has not been denied.

The Respondents did not contend that there was no such decision. There is no material

submitted to this Court to show whether this decision was taken by the previous

Executive Committee or the Executive Committee that was elected after the unlawful

election. Nonetheless, the decision so made had been communicated.

Page 10 of 17

Yet quite conveniently the Respondents using the decision of this Court to their

advantage try to resile from an assurance represented by them solely on the basis that

the Secretary had no authority. This is disingenuous conduct. The fact that the Secretary

had no authority, because of the unlawful election, to issue the letter P8 was contended

by the Respondents for the first time before this Court. This has not been informed before

to NEMRC or the National Selection Committee.

In this regard, the representation in the communication marked P8 is clear,

precise, and unambiguous to generate a substantive legitimate expectation that the

applicant club had obtained affiliation status. It is unfair for the Respondents to dash

such an expectation.

It must also be noted that when the five members of the NEMRC participated at

the Annual General Meeting on 27th March 2015, consequent to receiving the P8

communication, the document titled Attendance Register which was submitted by the

Respondents substantiates the fact that they participated as Members. In terms of Rule

8(iii) of the SLAS Constitution, Member Clubs may nominate up to five of their members

who will be eligible to attend any General Meeting of the Association. However, although

they may participate, they cannot vote until they have completed the one-year

probationary period. Rule 4 states that such Member Clubs and Associations shall have

voting rights as detailed under Rule 8 conferred upon them by the Executive council after

the satisfactory completion of a further probationary period of 12 months from the date of

their admission. [emphasis added] If the Council refuses to confer voting rights at the

end of the probationary period, that Club or Association shall immediately cease to be a

member.

It must be noted that in their Statement of Objections the Respondents note (in

paragraph 22) that NEMRC was permitted to attend the Annual General Meeting of the

SLAS held on 27th March 2015 on the assumption that NEMRC would comply with the

requisites to secure an affiliation. In the absence of any evidence to show that the

Respondents made this basis on which NEMRC was allowed to participate known to

NEMRC, we cannot accept this contention.

Page 11 of 17

As per Rule 4 of the SLAS Constitution, the Executive Council appears to have the

discretion to decide whether to confer voting rights on a new Member Club that has

completed one years probation.

It is trite that there is neither unfettered nor untrammeled discretion. That

discretion conferred must be exercised correctly and to suit the purposes for which it was

conferred. This Court cannot substitute its views for that of the body exercising that

discretion merely because such body arrived at a conclusion different from that which this

Court prefers. Nevertheless, this Court can in the performance of its supervisory functions

inquire on what basis such discretion was exercised, that is to review the exercise of that

discretion on the ordinary principles of judicial review. To assess whether discretion has

been properly exercised the reasons for such a course of action must be evaluated. As was

suggested in the landmark judgment of Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and

Food [1968] A.C. 997, if a prima facie case of unlawfulness was established by the

applicant, then in the absence of reasons the court could infer that the power was

exercised outside of the legislative purpose. A position echoed by his Lordship Fernando

J. in Wijepala v. Jayawardane SC 89/95 SCM 30.06.95 (cited in Hapuarachichi v.

Commissioner of Elections [2009] 1 SLR 1):

However, when this Court is requested to review such a decision if the Petitioner

succeeds in making out a prima facie case, then the failure to give reasons becomes

crucial. If reasons are not disclosed, the inference may have to be drawn that this is

because in fact there were no reasonsand so also, if reasons are [now] suggested, they

were in fact not the reasons, which actually influenced the decision in the first place.

[emphasis added]

The Respondents state that NEMRC has not fulfilled the requisite criteria, in

terms of Rule 4 of the SLAS Constitution, to be registered as an affiliate Member Club

and that NEMRC has failed to pay the subscription payable by an applicant seeking

affiliation and, on this basis, it was not made an affiliate Member Club.

However, there does not appear to be any document to show that such reasons

have been communicated to NEMRC. Although the Executive Council can refuse entry of

a Member Club that has completed probation, in the instant case, no documents dated on

or about the time that probationary period came to an end (that is in 2016) to show that

such has been informed to the Member Club or any Minutes of the Council Meetings in

Page 12 of 17

which such a decision was taken to refuse voting rights, and the consequent cessation of

membership.

The Respondents rely on a document dated 09th November 2018 (marked P18) in

which they have required NEMRC to comply with the provisions of the SLAS

Constitution. This letter quoted verbatim reads:

Reference your letter dated 25th September 2018 was tabled to the Council

Meeting held on 3rd October 2018.

Council noted that you have not furnished required information and credentials to

consider your request even though stated by you. There is no evidence of completed

application made previously nor to this Council from July 2017.

However, this Council request you to kindly forward your application along with

the other required details for consideration of your application. Your objective details of

paid up memberships proof of your existence proposal indicating the planned future

activities race meets of your club and the details of the equipment you possess or plan to

invest on and the time frames.

After consideration of your application you are require to pay joining fee of Rs.

500,000/-.

Thus, it is seen that since the probationary period of NEMRC ended in 2016, it was

only by this letter dated 09th November 2018 that the reasons for NEMRCs non-affiliation

were proffered. Even still, no reference is made to the end of the probationary period, or

a decision of the Council taken at that time not to confer voting rights. Hence, as per the

documents before this Court, it appears that till such time NEMRCs affiliation lay in a

state of limbo. This offends ones ordinary sense of justice.

It is worth reiterating that one reason there exists a duty to give reasons is that

the party against whom the adverse decision is made can be informed of the fault or

shortcoming of his that resulted in the decision being made in that way. The person can

then rectify such shortcomings or address a misapprehension, especially if the decision is

made on a wrong assumption. In the instant case, it was only in 2018 that NEMRC was

told that it had not complied with the SLAS Constitution.

Page 13 of 17

As noted above, in the meantime, NEMRC had appealed to the Minister of Sports

to intervene in this matter. Following this, the National Selection Committee by letter

dated 10th November 2018 (marked P17) wrote to SLAS recommending that NEMRC be

registered as an affiliate Member Club of SLAS as NEMRC has fulfilled the requirements

stipulated in the Constitution of SLAS.

The Respondents state that SLAS responded to the National Selection

Committees recommendation by the letter marked X5 dated 09th November 2018 which

reads:

We refer to your letter dated 10th November 2018 with regard to the above.

Vide our letter dated 25th October 2018 to NEMRC, have requested to furnish information

per SLAS regulations.

We observed in Open Court that this response letter is dated 09th November 2018.

Thus, SLAS predicted the receival of a letter from the National Selection Committee even

before the Committee wrote to SLAS. This raises a doubt about whether this is merely a

typographic error or something more.

The letter marked X5 does not on the face of it refer to the letter marked P18

by which SLAS wrote to NEMRC stating that it had not furnished the required

information and credentials and that there had been no evidence of an application made

previously or to this Council from July 2017. It instead refers to a letter dated 25th

October 2018, which is not before us. The letter marked X5 then appears to be a

fabrication.

Further, the letter X5 which is purportedly a response to the National Selection

Committees letter marked P17 ought to have informed the National Selection

Committee, as per SLASs document marked P18 sent to NEMRC, that NEMRC had not

previously made an application to be registered as an affiliate Member Club. It is seen

then that SLAS informed NEMRC that it had no evidence of a previous application, yet

in its response to the National Selection Committee, it stated that it requested NEMRC

Page 14 of 17

to furnish information, without mentioning that NEMRC had not made an application for

affiliation before.

SLAS has not taken any action consequent to receiving the letter dated 12th

February 2019 (marked P19) written to the Secretary of SLAS by the Chief Coordinator

of NEMRC pleading its case to be registered as an affiliate Member Club despite the

recommendation of the National Selection Committee. Thus, showing there has been a

refusal to confer affiliation.

The SLAS stipulates in the document marked P18 that the application must be

accompanied by details mentioned in P18 quoted above and a payment of Rs. 500,000/-

joining fee to be paid. The requirements, including the payments, are based on those the

Executive Council had agreed upon at a meeting of the Council held on the 25th of October

2017 (marked X6) to be applicable for new affiliations. It would be unfair to

retrospectively impose such conditions decided in 2017 on a Club that has been accepted

in 2015.

Thus, the conduct of SLAS in delaying the affiliation of NEMRC appears arbitrary.

The standard of unreasonableness was explained in the landmark judgment of

Associated Provincial Picture Houses v. Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1KB 223 by Lord

Greene M.R. as:

Something so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that lay within the

powers of the authority

Subsequent cases attempted to reformulate this standard as it was held to be too

rigorous. For example, in Secretary of State for Education v. Tameside Metropolitan

Borough Council [1977] AC 1014 it was held:

In public law, unreasonable as descriptive of the way in which a public authority

has purported to exercise a discretion vested in it by statute has become a term of legal

art. To fall within this expression it must be conduct which no sensible acting with due

appreciation of its responsibilities would have decided to adopt.

Page 15 of 17

Lord Cooke in the House of Lords in R v. Chief Constable of Sussex ex parte

International Traders Ferry Ltd [1999] 1 All ER 129, referring to Wednesbury (supra)

and Tameside (supra) held:

The simple test used throughout was whether the decision in question was one

which a reasonable authority could reach.

In Podimahatmaya v. The Land Reform Commission [1990] 2 SLR 416, his

Lordship Palakidnar J. held:

This Court can interfere where there is manifest unreasonableness in an

administrative act. The test is whether the administrative authority has acted within the

rules of reason and justice.

In Meril v. Dayananda De Silva [2001] 2 SLR 11 his Lordship Gunawardana J.

held:

It is well known that if a decision is not based on rational grounds, then review

by the Courts is sustainable.

The conduct of the Respondents to NEMRCs application to become an affiliate

Member Club to a reasonable person appears to be unreasonable. Accordingly, NEMRCs

right to vote in the last two elections has been violated.

At the argument stage, the statement found in paragraph 16(a) of the Statement

of Objections of the 7A to 33A Respondents which states that the documents marked

P7(a) to P7(g) are copies of general correspondence sent by the SLAS to its membership

[emphasis added] and further, in 16(b), There is no proof that the said letters [P(7)(a) to

P7(g)] have been received by the NEMRC in view of the fact that it is clearly seen that the

said letters are not specifically addressed to the NEMRC was brought to light. Yet, this

Court on a perusal of the said documents observed that document marked P7(e) is a

letter dated 09th March 2015 specifically addressed to the Secretary of NEMRC. This

raises the question of whether the statement in paragraph 16, that P7(e) (which is

Page 16 of 17

included in the documents P7(a) to P7(g)) which was sent to its membership was a

Freudian slip admitting NEMRCs membership. The Respondent could not answer this.

It is clear, that from 2015 NEMRC had obtained membership. When NEMRC has

presented documents to make a prima facie case that it had satisfied the steps to become

an affiliate Member Club, with the recommendation of the National Selection Committee,

the absence of reasons till 2018 leads us to draw an inference that there were no good

reasons for the Councils failure to confer voting rights. There appears to be an arbitrary

exercise of discretion.

For this reason and the reason that the conduct of SLAS appears suspect,

especially since it appears to be delaying the process of affiliation and it has not taken

any steps consequent to such recommendation made by the National Selection Committee

to hasten the affiliation process despite numerous requests by NEMRC to do so. It should

be noted that it is after NEMRCs appeal to the Minister, that the National Selection

Committee intervened. They have recommended NEMRCs membership. That

recommendation seems to have been ignored. Neither has that recommendation been

canvassed.

When there appears to be an arbitrary exercise of discretion, an abuse of powers,

by a controlling body of a sport at a national level, governed by the national Laws and

Regulations relating to Sports and thus integrated into a system of statutory regulation,

performing a public function by the regulation of that sport, unduly preventing the

admission of an applicant as a member of such body, for no justifiable reason this Court

can exercise its supervisory functions to guard against such abuse.

In the above circumstances, the Petitioner has satisfied this Court that SLAS has

acted arbitrarily in refusing NEMRCs affiliation. Thus, we grant the relief prayed for in

Page 17 of 17

prayer (d) and require that the NEMRC be registered with voting rights from 09th March

2016.
