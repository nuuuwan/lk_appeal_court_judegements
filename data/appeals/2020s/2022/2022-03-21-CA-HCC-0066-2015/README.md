Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence of him by the

learned High Court Judge of Kandy, where he was sentenced to death.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Kandy on two counts of

possession and trafficking of 79.84 grams of diacetylmorphine commonly

known as Heroin on 9th September 2010, punishable in terms of sections 54(d)

and 54(b) of the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended

by Act No 13 of 1984.

After trial, the appellant was found guilty for the possession of Heroin, which

was the first count against him and sentenced as above. He was acquitted of

the charge of trafficking of heroin, which was the 2nd count preferred against

him.

At the hearing of the appeal, although several other grounds of appeal have

been urged in the written submissions, the learned Counsel for the appellant

urged the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

Page 3 of 16

(1) The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the contradictions

inter se and per se of the witnesses for the prosecution, which are

contradictions that goes into the root of the case.

(2) The dock statement of the appellant was not considered in its correct

perspective.

(3) The improbability of the prosecution version of events was not

considered correctly.

(4) The learned High Court Judges judgment is not in conformity with

section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, hence, not a valid

judgment.

Facts in brief: -

On an information provided by an informant, Inspector of Police Rangajeewa

(PW-01) of the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) along with other officers who

accompanied him lay in wait near the front entrance of the Queens Hotel in

Kandy. The information he received was that a Nepalese national is bringing a

white heroin parcel to a place near the Queens Hotel between 14.00 hours and

16.00 hours and the informant can show him to the police.

After instructing the other officers to wait in the vehicle nearby, PW-01 along

with PW-02 and the informant waited nearly thirty minutes in front of the

Queens Hotel expecting the arrival of the suspect. After identifying the suspect

who came from the lake side of the road and crossed the road towards the

Queens Hotel side, he was stopped. At that time, he was wearing a white-

coloured short sleeved shirt and a gray-coloured trouser and was holding a

black bag under his armpit. After identifying who he is and upon inspection of

the bag he was carrying, the PW-01 has found a large number of capsules like

white-coloured balls.

Upon further inspecting the balls he has discovered an off white-coloured

powder inside, which he identified as heroin through his long years of

experience as an officer well acquainted with narcotics.

Page 4 of 16

Later, the appellant was identified and arrested at around 1530 hours and

taken to the hotel where he was staying in Kandy. No other substances were

found in the room where he was staying. PW-01 has counted 60 capsules in

the possession of the appellant. After the inspection of the hotel room, the

police party led by PW-01 has returned to PNB in Colombo with the appellant

while having the heroin found under his possession. Upon weighing at the

PNB, it has been found that the total weight of the substance was 386 grams

and 450 milligrams.

PW-02 was the officer who accompanied PW-01 at the time the appellant was

arrested and he has well explained what happened at the time and the

procedure followed by the PW-01.

PW-04 was the Assistant Government Analyst who tested the off white-coloured

substance received through the Court. Marking the Report of the Government

Analyst dated 29-04-2011 in that regard as P-41, She has confirmed that the

substance tested had a pure heroin quantity of 79.84 grams.

After leading the evidence of the manager of the hotel (PW-09) where the

appellant was staying in Kandy and the relevant witnesses to prove the chain

of custody of the productions, the prosecutions case has been closed.

When the appellant was asked to present his defence, he has chosen to make a

dock statement and had opted not to give evidence under oath or to call any

witnesses on behalf of him.

Making his dock statement in English he has stated that he came to Kandy as

a Buddhist pilgrim and was arrested at the Kandy City Centre shopping

complex, taken to the hotel where he was staying and thereafter brought to

Colombo. After keeping him for two days in Colombo he was again taken to

Kandy and brought back to Colombo where he was forced to sign a blank white

coloured paper. He has alleged that he was not allowed to meet a lawyer or to

communicate with anybody through the phone while in the police custody until

Page 5 of 16

he was produced in Court. He has denied that he had in his possession any

illegal substance nor he brought any such thing into the country and has

claimed that he is a victim and not guilty of the charges levelled against him.

1st, 2nd, and the 3rd Grounds of Appeal: -

As the above three grounds of appeal are interrelated, I will now proceed to

consider them together.

The learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the following segments of

evidence of PW-01 and PW-02 are contradictory;

(a) As to the time of arrest, PW-01 in his evidence has stated that the

arrest was made at around 1530 hours and according to PW-02 the

arrest was made at around 1500 hours. It was also pointed out that

PW-02 has also stated that they went near the Queens hotel entrance

at around 1330 hours and waited about half an hour before the

arrest was made (At page 110 of the appeal brief). Which was a major

contradiction as to the time of arrest.

(b) PW-01 has never said in his evidence that he carried a knife used to

pierce one of the capsules among his instruments taken for the raid,

then how can he possess such a knife unless it was untrue.

(c) According to the evidence, the other members of the police team who

accompanied them have taken 30 minutes to reach the place of arrest

once they were informed to come from the place where they were

stationed. If the purpose of their presence was to give assistance if

needed, this evidence was highly improbable.

(d) Police witnesses said that the productions were sealed at the hotel

room and a statement of the hotel manager was recorded. However,

the manger in her evidence has stated that no statement was recorded

Page 6 of 16

and two days after the arrest also some officers came and yet no

statement was recorded.

(e) PW-01 admitted that he made several alterations to his notes he made

in his crime note pad, but has failed to countersign the alterations.

(f) PW-01 has stated that the 60 heroin balls were counted for the first

time in the room of the appellant, but when confronted with his

previous evidence where he has stated that the count was done before

the arrest, it was his position that it was a mistake. However, PW-02

has stated that the count was taken at the point of arrest.

(g) The way the evidence has been given, there is doubt as to whether the

items taken were in the form of balls or capsules.

(h) Although PW-01 says that he questioned the appellant at the point of

arrest, there are no notes to that effect.

(i) Although PW-01 in his evidence has stated that when inspected, the

capsule like balls he felt the faeces smell in them, he has failed to

make any notes of that fact, and had there was such a smell, the

productions should have been sent to the Government Analyst to

check on that, which would have been conclusive evidence.

Apart from the above, it was the contention of the learned Counsel for the

appellant that at page 81 of the judgment (page 929 of the brief) the learned

trial judge has commented that the appellant has brought the 60 capsules

concealed in his stomach by swallowing the same and has passed it with his

faeces, a fact not supported by evidence, hence a misdirection which vitiate the

conviction.

When it comes to the dock statement of the appellant, it was the argument of

the learned Counsel that the learned High Court Judge has only considered the

part of the statement where the appellant said that he came to Kandy as a

Page 7 of 16

Buddhist pilgrim and has wrongly rejected it without considering any material

relevant to the defence of the appellant. He contended that this failure on the

part of the learned High Court Judge has caused prejudice to the appellant.

It was the contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General for the

Respondent that the appellant was arrested within 24 hours of his arrival in

Sri Lanka and there was no reason for the officials of PNB to arrest a foreigner

in Kandy without a valid reason. It was his view that although there are some

differences in the evidence of PW-01 and PW-02 with regard to some factual

matters, they do not go into the root of the matter. He pointed out that when

the evidence taken as a whole, the prosecution has proved the case beyond

reasonable doubt against the appellant.

This being a criminal prosecution the onus is always with the prosecution to

prove the charge or the charges against the appellant beyond reasonable

doubt. In a criminal matter an accused has to prove nothing. When analyzing

the evidence, a trial judge has to always bear in mind that the presumption of

innocence is always with an accused.

It was held in the case of Pantis Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 148

that;

As the burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove its case

beyond reasonable doubt and no such duty is cast on the accused and its

sufficient for the accused to give an explanation which satisfies the Court

or at least is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

The learned counsel for the appellant brought to the notice of the Court several

instances of the evidence of PW-01 and PW-02 who were the main witnesses for

the prosecution as stated before, which he termed as major contradictions

which should have been considered in favor of the appellant.

Page 8 of 16

In the case of The Attorney General Vs. Sanadnam Pitchi Theresa (2011) 2

SLR 292 at page 303, Shirani Tilakawardane,J. stated:

that whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily

affect the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established

that the Court must exercise its judgment on the nature and tenor of the

inconsistency or contradiction and whether they are material to the facts in

issue. Discrepancies, which do not go to the root of the matter and assail

the basic version of the witness, cannot be given too much importance.

(Vide-Bogm Bhai Hirji Bhai Vs. State of Gujarat, AIR (1983) SC 753)

With the above-mentioned legal principles in mind, I will now consider whether

the earlier cited alleged inconsistencies and contradictions are relevant to

create a doubt with regard to the prosecution version of events and the guilt of

the appellant to the charges preferred against him.

It is correct to say that there is a slight discrepancy as to the time of arrest in

the evidence of the two arresting officers. However, the appellant in his dock

statement has admitted that he was arrested and taken to the hotel he was

staying. The only difference being that it was the stand of the appellant that he

was arrested in the KCC Shopping Centre, which is a place of about 100

meters away from the place where the witnesses say that the arrest was made.

As observed correctly by the learned trial judge, the appellant has not

challenged the date of the arrest.

I find that the evidence of PW-09 who was the manager of the hotel concerned

is of paramount importance in this regard. She, in her evidence has confirmed

that the appellant was brought to the hotel by narcotic officials around 4.30,

5.00 or 5.30 in the evening of the 9th of September 2010, which was also the

day he arrived at the hotel. It was also her evidence that the officials informed

her that he was arrested with drugs at the lake round. It was her evidence that

Page 9 of 16

the room the appellant stayed was booked by a local who appeared to be that

he did not know the name of the person who was going to occupy the room. I

find no reason whatsoever for the hotel manager to state something that did

not happen, as she was not an interested witness.

This goes on to show that the witnesses were speaking the truth as to the

arrest of the appellant and the subsequent events.

Under the circumstances, I find that the alleged delay in the backup police

team to reach the place of arrest or the alleged time difference as to the time of

arrest are not matters that dent the credibility of the witnesses.

The PW-01 may not have made notes that he questioned that appellant at the

place of arrest. But the fact that after the arrest the appellant was taken to the

hotel where he was staying shows that in fact the appellant has been

questioned, as it was not within the knowledge of the officers of PNB where the

appellant was staying in Kandy.

As an experienced officer of the PNB, there wouldnt have been any difficulty for

PW-01 to conclude as to the method of carry, because of the way the drugs

were found packed in ball like capsules. There was no need for the substance

to be sent to the Government Analyst to substantiate the possible method of

carry as the appellant was detected with the drugs. Similarly, I find that where

the capsules were counted for the first time is not a matter that affect the

credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution.

PW-01 in his evidence has admitted that he made several alterations to his

crime note book by cutting what was written by a single line before making the

alterations so that it can be visible. Although one can term that as a failure to

follow the rules to the letter due to the failure of the witness to countersign the

alterations, it does not mean that the witness has changed his notes to fix the

appellant, as there is no basis to come to such a conclusion.

Page 10 of 16

For the reasons adduced as above, I am of the view that when taken

cumulatively, the alleged discrepancies do not lower the trustworthiness and

the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution.

I am in no position to agree with the contention that the learned High Court

Judge has failed to consider the appellants dock statement in the correct

perspective.

The defendant has only chosen to make a dock statement when he was

afforded the opportunity of presenting his defence.

It is the accepted law in this country that even a dock statement of an accused

can be considered as evidence subject to the infirmities that it was not made

under oath and not subjected to the test of cross examination. In my view,

such a statement is of little value as against the evidence of witnesses who

were subjected to a lengthy cross examination which failed to breach the test of

credibility.

In Queen Vs. Kularatne (1968) 71 NLR 529, it was held that while jurors

must be informed that such a statement must be looked upon as evidence,

subject, however, to the infirmities that the accused statement is not made

under oath and not subject to cross examination.

Held further;

1. If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon.

2. If it raised a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case for the

prosecution, the defence must succeed, and;

3. It must not be used against another accused.

As observed rightly by the learned trial judge, the claim made by the appellant

in his dock statement has no basis. It has been claimed that after the arrest,

Page 11 of 16

he was taken to several places over several days before being produced before

the Magistrate.

However, the case record bear testimony that the appellant has been produced

before the Magistrate of Kandy within the stipulated time frame after the arrest

on 10th September 2010 at 4.00 pm. After producing him before the Magistrate

a detention order has been obtained valid until 15-09-2010 to detain him at

the PNB in Colombo for further investigations. The order has been duly

obtained under the provisions of section 82(3) of the Poisons, Opium, and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (The Ordinance) .

This explains the statement of the appellant that he was detained in the

custody of the police for several days after the arrest, and was taken to several

places. However, I find that it has been done legally under the powers vested

with police in situations like this, after having obtained the relevant

authorization as provided for in the Ordinance.

I find that the learned trial judge has specifically rejected the claim made by

the appellant in his dock statement that he came on a pilgrimage to Kandy as a

Buddhist to worship the temple of the sacred tooth relic of the Lord Buddha as

there was no evidence to support such a claim and since he has failed to put

that proposition to the witnesses when they gave evidence. I find no basis to

consider that finding as a matter which amounts to not considering the dock

statement in its correct perspective.

I find that the learned trial judge has well considered the dock statement, given

the importance that can be attached to a dock statement before deciding that it

creates no doubt as to the case of the prosecution.

For the reasons adduced, I find no merit in the considered grounds of appeal.

4th Ground of Appeal: -

It was the argument of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the judgment

of the learned High Court Judge is not in conformity with the provisions of

section 283(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, as the learned High Court

Judge has failed to properly analyze the evidence other than summarizing the

evidence in detail. He also points to the misdirection of facts by the learned

trial judge as mentioned earlier with regard to his conclusion that the drugs

discovered has been brought by the appellant by swallowing the capsules.

Section 283(1) and (2) which provided for what should contain in a judgment

reads as follows;

(1) The judgment shall be written by the judge who heard the

case and shall be dated and signed by him in open court at

the time of pronouncing it, and in case where appeal lies shall

contain the point of points for determination, the decision

thereon, and the reasons for the decision.

(2) It shall specify the offence if any of which and the section

of the law under which the accused is convicted and the

punishment to which he is sentenced.

Although the learned trial judge has summarized the evidence in great detail in

his judgment, that is not a reason to find fault with a trial judge, as each judge

has his or her own style of writing a judgment.

After summarizing the evidence of the prosecution as well as the dock

statement of the appellant, the learned trial judge, at page 73 of his judgment

(Page 921 of the brief) has commenced the analyzing of the evidence being well

aware of the task before him. He has concluded that he has to determine that

whether the crime has been committed in the manner the prosecution

presented its case and whether it can be concluded that it was the appellant

who committed the alleged crime.

Page 13 of 16

I find that this was the correct approach in analyzing evidence in a criminal

case. Being a well experienced judge, I find that the learned High Court Judge

was well possessed of the legal principles that he should be mindful in a matter

of this nature.

In the case of James Silva Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980)2 SLR 167,

it was stated that;

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider

all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by

the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and asking himself,

whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he

believes the accused guilty of the charge on not guilty.

The learned trial judge has considered the evidence as to the arrival of the

appellant in Sri Lanka and reaching Kandy and the way his hotel reservation

had been made. The fact that the appellant was out of the hotel on the day of

the incident and the fact that he was taken to the hotel by the police officials

has been considered to conclude that the factual matters surrounding the

arrest of the appellant have been proved. The learned trial judge has

considered the evidence as to the actual detection of the heroin in the

possession of the appellant and has come to a firm finding with reasons that

the evidence in that regard is credible and trustworthy. I find no reasons to

disagree with his findings. The evidence as to the chain of productions and the

evidence of the Government Analyst who identified a pure quantity of 79.84

grams of diacetylmorphine commonly known as heroin has been considered in

the judgment before considering the defence of the appellant. It clearly appears

that by doing so the learned trial judge has considered whether the reasonable

doubt as to the case of the prosecution.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has come to the finding that the

appellant is guilty only for the charge of possession of heroin and not for the

trafficking with good reasoning.

Page 14 of 16

I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected as to the

facts when he determined that the appellant has brought the quantity of heroin

found in his possession concealing them in his stomach, and recovered it by

discharging it with his faeces, when there was no such evidence to support

such a contention.

However, for that matter to be considered relevant to have the effect of vitiating

the judgment, it should have the effect of causing material prejudice to the

appellant.

The proviso of Article 138 of the Constitution of the Republic, which confers the

appellate jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal reads as follows;

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

In Mannar Mannan Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1990) 1 SLR 280

Held:

The enacting part of sub-section (1) of section 334 mandates the Court to

allow the appeal where-

(a) The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having

regard to the evidence; or

(b) There is a wrong decision on any question of law; or

(c) There is a miscarriage of justice on any ground.

The proviso vests discretion in the Court and recourse to it arises only

where the appellant has made out at least one of the grounds postulated

in the enacting part of the sub-section. There is no warrant for the view

Page 15 of 16

that the Court is precluded from applying the proviso in any particular

category of wrong decision or misdirection on questions of law as for

instance, burden of proof. There is no hard and fast rule that the proviso is

inapplicable where there is non-direction amounting to misdirection in

regard to the burden of proof. What is important is that each case falls to

be decided on the consideration of

(a) The nature and intent of the non-direction amounting to a

misdirection on the burden of proof

(b) All facts and circumstances of the case, the quality of evidence

adduced and the weight to be attached to it.

In the case of Lafeer Vs. Queen 74 NLR 246, H.N.G.Fernando, C.J. stated;

There was thus both misdirection and non-direction on matters concerning

the standard of proof. Nevertheless, we are of opinion having regard to the

cogent and uncontradicted evidence that a jury properly directed could not

have reasonably returned a more favourable verdict. We therefore affirm

the conviction and sentence and dismiss the appeal.

Both the above mentioned are cases where the trial at the High Court was

before a jury, and decided in appeal under section 334 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, which has similar provisions to Article 138 of the Constitution

in the section itself.

I find that the principles discussed in the said appeals are of equal relevance to

a determination of an appeal under the provisions of section 335 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act of a trial held without a jury before the High Court in

view of the Proviso to Article 138 of the Constitution.

It is my considered view that the contended misdirection has not prejudiced the

substantial rights of the appellant nor has it occasioned a failure of justice, as

Page 16 of 16

even without such a misdirection, the appellant would in any way found guilty

on the evidence proven beyond reasonable doubt.

For the reasons considered as above, I find no merit in the 4th ground of appeal

either.

The appeal therefore is dismissed, as it is devoid of merit. The conviction and

the sentence affirmed.
