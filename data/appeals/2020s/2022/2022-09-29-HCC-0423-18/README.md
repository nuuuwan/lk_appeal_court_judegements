JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred as the Appellant)

was indicted by the Attorney General under Sections 54(A) (d) and 54(A) (b)

of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act

No. 13 of 1984 for the possession and trafficking of 8.2 grams of Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine) on 11th July 1996 in the High Court of Colombo.

After the trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the learned

High Court Judge of Colombo imposed death sentence on the Appellant on

27th of November, 2018.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this Court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this Court that the Appellant

had given consent for this matter to be argued in his absence due to the

restrictions of the Covid 19 pandemic. During the argument he was

connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The Appellant has raised the following appeal grounds in this case.

1. Whether the item of evidence is not sufficient to prove the

prosecutions case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

2. Whether rejection of evidence of the Appellant is wrong and principles

governing the evaluation of a dock statement.

3. Considering all the circumstances whether imposing the death

sentence is justifiable in this case.

3 | P a g e

In this case PW2 PS 17182 had received a particular information from a

private informant that a bald-headed person wearing a green coloured

sarong and a shirt was packeting heroin at No.75/50, Pettiwatte, Thotalanga

inside which happens to be his resident. The informant had stated that the

TV antenna has been hanging broken in front of the house, which was a sign

for easy identification of the house.

Upon receiving this information, PW1 IP/Ajith of the Foreshore Police Station

had organized the raid. Having selected eight other officers, they had left the

police station around 19.15 hours after completing all formalities. Before

reaching the location, at a convenient point the team hired three three-

wheelers to go the location. When all reached the location as per the

information, they had identified the house which matched the information

that the TV antenna was hanging broken. As per the information, the identity

of the Appellant was established and he was arrested immediately. Upon

examination a parcel in the knot of the sarong was discovered. The parcel

contained a large number of aluminium packets with brown coloured

powder. As the substances which had been recovered from his possession

reacted for Heroin (Diacetylmorphine), he was arrested and his statement

was recorded immediately. Based on his statement two more parcels had

been recovered. One of the parcels was recovered behind the Buddha statue

which had been kept in the siting room of the Appellant. Another parcel was

found concealed between two feet gap of rear wall of the next house and the

boundary wall of the Appellants house.

All three parcels contained 350 packets of heroin and the same were sealed

at the point by PW01. Rs.2500/- also recovered from the Appellant. All the

productions were kept in the custody of PW1 until he and the team had

reached the police station. At the police station the production was entered

in the production register under No. 146/96 and handed over the same and

the Appellant to the reserve police officer at 21.30 hours. As there was no

proper facility to weigh the production in the Foreshore Police Station, PW1

4 | P a g e

had taken the production and the Appellant to the Police Narcotics Bureau

on the following day. At the Police Narcotic Bureau, the contents of the all

350 packets were weighed together and the sum of weight of the substance

was observed to be 13.520 grams and the production was sealed again in

front of the Appellant at the Police Narcotic Bureau. After sealing, the

production was handed over to PW9 PS 10895 Gunasena under production

No.148 and 149. Production No.148/96 contained the substances which

reacted for Heroin and Production No.149/96 contained the 350 metal foils

and the cash Rs.2500/-.

PW2, SI/Herath who was a member of the raiding team, was called to

corroborate the evidence given by PW1.

After closing the case for the prosecution, as the evidence led by the

prosecution warranted the presence of a case to be answered by the

Appellant, the learned High Court Judge called for the defence. The Appellant

made a dock statement and closed the case for the defence.

In all criminal cases the burden always rests upon the shoulder of the

prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The Appellant is not

required to prove his innocence but if he decides to plead a general or special

exception of the Penal Code, then the Appellant has a duty of establishing

that the case of the Appellant comes within such exceptions. This burden is

imposed under Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance.

In the first ground of appeal the learned Counsel for the Appellant contended

whether the item of evidence is not sufficient to prove the prosecutions case

against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

The witnesses called by the prosecution had given cogent and consistence

evidence with regard to the raid and recovery of the productions. The learned

High Court Judge had very correctly analysed the evidence in its correct

perspective to reach his conclusion. When examining the evidence presented

by both parties, it revealed that the defence had not challenged the evidence

5 | P a g e

pertaining to the raid and recovery of productions. The only material fact

challenged by the defence was whether the heroin was sealed properly and

handed over to the reserve in a form of an envelope and parcel or whether as

two envelopes. PW1 has given evidence with regard to the detection,

transporting, weighing and handing over the productions to the reserve

police officers. The evidence is re-produced below:

The above re-produced portions of the evidence of PW1 clearly demonstrates

that the prosecution has very well established the probability of occurrence

of the chain of events from the detection and its reach up to the Government

Analyst Department. It also shows the accuracy and the consistency of the

investigating officer in this raid. A successful raid will certainly strengthen

the prosecution, especially in a drug related case.

Bradford Smith, Law Commission, WWW.smithlitigation.com 2014 states

that:

Good police note taking is important for two reasons. First, it invariably

bolsters the credibility of the police officer giving evidence. Second, it

promotes the proper administration of criminal justice by facilitating the

proof of facts. Conversely, sloppy police note-taking can be devastating

to the credibility of the officer giving evidence and seriously, it not

fatally, undermine the successful prosecution of the case.

Probability and consistency of the evidence given by prosecution witnesses

plays a crucial role in criminal prosecution. In this case, the evidence

adduced by the witnesses of the prosecution about conducting the raid,

recovery of production, sealing and its journey up to Government Analyst

Department clearly shows high probability of the guilt of the Appellant.

9 | P a g e

In Girija Prasad (dead) by LRs. V. State of M.P., AIR [2007] SCW 5589

(2007) 7 SCC 625, it was observed:

It is well-settled that credibility of witness has to be tested on the

touchstone of truthfulness and trustworthiness. It is quite possible that

in a given case, a Court of Law may not base conviction solely on the

evidence of Complainant or a Police Official but it is not the law that

police witnesses should not be relied upon and their evidence cannot be

accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars by other

independent evidence. The presumption that every person acts honestly

applies as much in favour of a Police Official as any other person. No

infirmity attaches to the testimony of Police Officials merely because

they belong to Police Force. There is no rule of law which lays down that

no conviction can be recorded on the testimony of Police Officials even if

such evidence is otherwise reliable and trustworthy. The rule of

prudence may require more careful scrutiny of their evidence. But, if the

Court is convinced that what was stated by a witness has a ring of

truth, conviction can be based on such evidence.

As a result, it is wrong to assert that the prosecution has failed to present

adequate evidence to establish this case beyond reasonable doubts.

Therefore, the ground urged under number one has no merit.

In the second ground of appeal the Learned Counsel for the Appellant

contends that the rejection of evidence of the Appellant is wrong and the

learned High Court Judge had deviated from principles governing the

evaluation of a dock statement.

In an appeal it is the profound duty of the Appellate Court to consider all the

evidence presented by both parties in the trial. If the evidence presented by

the prosecution is cogent and passes all the tests, the court has no difficulty

whatsoever to act on the same and affirm the conviction of the Appellant.

10 | P a g e

But, if the prosecution fails to adduce cogent and consistent evidence, then

the court has no option but to award the benefit of the doubt to the Appellant.

Further, in an appeal against conviction, the Appellate Court has the duty

to itself appreciate the evidence on the record and if two views are possible

on the appraisal of the evidence, the benefit of reasonable doubt has to be

given to an accused. Therefore, examining the evidence presented by the

Appellant, as well as discovering and assessing materials favourable to the

Appellant, must thus be thoroughly considered before the court may reach

a final determination.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had considered the dock

statement and correctly discussed the stance the Appellant had taken up in

his dock statement. Hence, as the stances taken up by the Appellant in his

dock statement does not override the prosecution case, the Learned High

Court Judge had relied upon the evidence of prosecution as reliable and

come to his decision that the Appellant is guilty to the charges levelled

against him. Hence, the Appellant is not successful in his second ground.

In the final ground of appeal, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant without

prejudice to the 1st and 2nd ground of appeal, invited this courts indulgence

to convert the death sentence to a life imprisonment considering the age of

the Appellant. According to the Counsel, the Appellant was 46 years old when

he was arrested on 11/07/1996. Hence, he is 62 years old now. The Learned

Additional Solicitor General made no submission opposing to this ground

which has been raised first time during the hearing of this appeal.

Given his age and the quantity of pure Heroin involved, I consider it is

appropriate to consider the third ground of appeal in the affirmative.

For the reasons stated above, I conclude that the charges in the indictment

against the Appellant have been proved beyond reasonable doubt by the

11 | P a g e

prosecution. I uphold the decision reached by the Learned High Court Judge

of Colombo on 27/11/2018.

Further, for the reasons stated in the third ground of appeal, I direct that the

death sentence be changed to life imprisonment, effective from the date of

conviction.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed subject to the above variation in the

sentence.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Colombo along with the original case record.

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.
