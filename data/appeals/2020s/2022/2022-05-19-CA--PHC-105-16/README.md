This is an appeal filed on 29.09.2016 against an order of the High Court delivered

on 14.09.2016, by which a revision application of the instant appellant was

dismissed without issuing notice. The impugned order dealt with a case falling

under the purview of the Forest Ordinance (as amended) whereby the Magistrate

Court ordered the confiscation of the vehicle bearing No. 68-6538 on 03.01.2012,

which was utilised to commit a forest offence. The appellant claims to be an

innocent buyer of the said vehicle after the commission of the forest offence

(13.10.2013) and during the pendency of the vehicle inquiry and prays the vehicle

is not be confiscated. This appeal pivots on the issue of whether an owner of a

vehicle who got such ownership after the commission of a forest offence is entitled

to relief under the Forest Ordinance (as amended).

The facts of the case are as follows: on or about 03.01.2012, a vehicle bearing

No. 68-6538 was taken into custody for the transportation of timber without a

valid license in violation of the Forest Ordinance (as amended). The trial was

concluded with the accused pleading guilty and a fine of Rs. 5,000/- was

imposed. Afterwards, a vehicle inquiry ensued, allowing parties to show cause as

to why the vehicle should not be confiscated. At the inquiry stage evidence of

CA-PHC-0105-16 Page 4 of 6 19/05/2022 IJ-25-22

three persons were led, namely the owner of the vehicle at the time of the

commission of the offence, the person in whose possession the vehicle was at the

time the forest offence was committed and the appellant, the owner of the vehicle

at the time the inquiry was taken up. The learned Magistrate delivering the order

of confiscation directed the vehicle to be auctioned in a public auction. In the

said order, the learned Magistrate has traced the legislative history of the Forest

Ordinance (as amended) with a focus on the application of Section 40. The

learned Magistrate has drawn a distinction between the owner at the time of the

commission of the forest offence and the appellant, determining that the

appellant cannot be considered as coming within the purview of the Forest

Ordinance (as amended) (Vide page 59 of the Appeal Brief). The learned

Magistrate holds that the appellant had no obligation to fulfil the requirements

set out by Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance (as amended) at the time of the

commission of the offence, a requirement which forms the basis of the vehicle

inquiry. In delivering the confiscation order, the learned Magistrate determines

that the owner pertinent to the vehicle inquiry is the owner at the time of the

commission of the vehicle and that the said person has failed to satisfy the Court

that he had taken all precautionary measures to prevent the use of the vehicle

for the commission of a forest offence (Vide page 60 of the Appeal Brief). Aggrieved

by the said order, the appellant has filed a revision application to the High Court,

whereby the impugned order was delivered affirming the order of the Magistrate

and dismissing the appellant application in limine.

This Bench has dealt with the law governing the confiscation of vehicles under

the Forest Ordinance (as amended) in CA PHC 119/18 CA Minute 15.03.2022,

CA PHC 24/17 CA Minute 03.03.2022, CA PHC APN 139/19. CA Minute Dated

09.11.2021 These applications dealt with claimants who were the owners of the

confiscated vehicle at the time of the commission of the offence, and who made

their claims under Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance (as amended). As held in

Samarasinghe Dharmasena v W. P. Wanigasinghe and Others CA PHC 197/13

CA Minute dated 22.01.2019, .it is well settled law that in a vehicle inquiry the

claimant has to discharge his burden on a balance of probability. According to

Section 40 for the Forest Ordinance (as amended) it is mandatory to prove on a

CA-PHC-0105-16 Page 5 of 6 19/05/2022 IJ-25-22

balance probability that the owner took every possible precaution to prevent the

vehicle being used for an illegal activity. To claim any relief under the Forest

Ordinance (as amended), the claimant ought to prove that all precautionary

measures were taken at the time of the offence to prevent such an offence and

that, in fact, the claimant had no knowledge of the commission of the offence.

Following this logic, it is illogical for the appellant to claim any redress under the

Forest Ordinance (as amended) when she was not in any way privy to the vehicle

at the time the offence was committed. The offence was committed on

03.01.2012, and the appellant took over ownership on 13.10.2013.

In giving evidence, the person who sold the vehicle to the appellant after the

commencement of the trial under the Forest Ordinance (as amended) states the

following about informing the appellant (Lakshmi) regarding the pending case:

The appellant giving evidence on the same point states the following:

Subsequently the learned Magistrate poses a question to the appellant:

: 2012.01.03 ?

(Vide Page 44 of the Appeal Brief)

The appellant has failed to apply due diligence prior to purchasing the vehicle.

While being aware of a pending case against the vehicle in question, the appellant

failed to assess whether the transferor had any right to transfer the vehicle to the

appellant. The vehicle was with the transferor having been released to the

transferor on a bond pending the conclusion of the vehicle inquiry. At this

juncture, the maxim of caveat emptor- qui ignorare non debuit quod jus alienum

emit ought to be highlighted. Let the Purchaser, who is not to be ignorant of the

amount and nature of the interest, exercise proper caution. In short, buyer

beware. Hence, the facts and circumstances of the instant appeal disentitle the

appellant from claiming any relief or redress under the Forest Ordinance (as

amended).

Considering the above, this Court finds no reason to interfere with either the

confiscation order dated 20.04.2016 delivered by the Learned Magistrate of

Balapitiya or the order delivered by the Learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya

dated14.09.2016.

Appeal dismissed.
