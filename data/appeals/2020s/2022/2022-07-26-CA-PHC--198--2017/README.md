MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the order dated

20.05.2017 of High Court of Galle.

The accused petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) had been

charged in the Magistrates Court under Section 314 and 486 of the Penal Code.

As these two offences are compoundable offences under Section 266 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the CPC), when the

matter was called before the magistrate on 13.02.2015, the complaint had

been present, the accused had been present and the willingness to settle the

matter had been expressed and the matter had been compounded and the

proceedings have been terminated.

Thereafter, the virtual complainant had filed an affidavit pleading

misinterpretation of facts by the Magistrate and had pleaded that she had no

willingness to compound the matter, as such; the Magistrate had refixed the

matter for trial on 24.04.2015.

Being aggrieved by this order, the matter had been referred to the High Court

and the learned High Court judge had held that, it was an order of actus curieie

neminem gravabit and has upheld the order of the magistrate.

The Presidents Counsel appearing for the petitioner stated that under Section

266 of the Criminal Procedure Code, when a matter is compounded based on

the willingness of both parties no conditions have been laid down in the Section

for the two parties to follow but it amounts to an acquittal as laid down in the

case of CA PHC APN 28/2014 by Justice Salam.

He further submitted that, the High Court judge had indicated that the case

record had not been signed by either party which is a practice of Court.

Therefore, the matter had not been compounded as per Section 266 of the CPC.

The Counsel for the Respondents reiterated the basis upon which the High

Court judge had affirmed the order of the Magistrate stating that practices of

Court become law after many years.

Having considered the submissions of both parties, this Court draws its

attention to Section 266 of the CPC and note that the Section does not stipulate

any practices of Court to be followed before compounding an offence but lays

down certain conditions needed to be adhered to by the parties, and by no

means does it stipulate any following of practices of Court which has been in

existence for many years as pleaded by the counsel for the respondents. The

Section merely lays down the offences which can be compounded and the

willingness of all parties in addition to having a pending case before the

Magistrate.

Therefore, we are unable to agree with the contention of the counsel for the

respondents.

The High Court Judge has averred that an injustice has been caused to the PW1

by not being able to express her consent for the settlement and has quoted the

Latin principle of actus curieie neminem gravabit, which says that no party

should suffer in the hands of Court, but the magistrate is also bound by the

principles laid down in the laws pertaining to its jurisdiction, and we take in to

consideration the Indian case of Gain Singh vs. State of Punjab and Anr decided

on 24.9.2012 Criminal Appeal where it was held that Court cannot amend the

Page 6 of 6

statute and must maintain judicial restraintCourt should not try to take over

the function of the Parliament or the executive.

The High Court has referred to many practices adopted by Courts which have

not been laid down in law but are mere practices and have held very firmly that

the procedure has not been followed, but this Court notes that Section 266 of

the CPC does not speak of any of the practices referred to by the High Court

Judge, as such this Court is of the opinion that the instant application for

revision should be allowed and the impugned order of the High Court dated

20.11.2017 should be set aside.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
