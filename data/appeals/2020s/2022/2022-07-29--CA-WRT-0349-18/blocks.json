This is clearly borne by the letter dated 13.8.2018, purportedly issued by the 10th Respondent to the 1st Respondent-Commissioner.",

Both letters bear the same date.

The Mahanayaka Thero has to alter his register first. If the Mahanayaka Thero had altered his register, he should inform the Commissioner what he has altered. The Commissioner should be aware of the alterations done by the Mahanayaka Thero because he has a duty to alter his register accordingly. The Commissioner is expected to make the same alteration done by the Mahanayaka Thero. The two alterations should be similar. In this case, when the Commissioner altered his register for the 2nd time there was no evidence before the Commissioner about the alterations (if any) done by the Mahanayaka Thero. Without knowing what alterations had been made by the Mahanayaka Thero and without knowing whether there had been an alteration in the register in the custody of the Mahanayaka Thero and without verifying whether an alteration had been made in the register in the custody of the Mahanayaka Thero and if so without verifying about the contents of the alteration, the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs had altered the register in his custody.
