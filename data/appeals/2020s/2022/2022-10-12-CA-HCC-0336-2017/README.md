This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence of him by the

learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Kurunegala on the following

counts.

1. That he caused the death of Yapa Mudiyanselage Ramani Dissanayake

on or about 11th March 2007 at Kirindigalla, and thereby committed

the offence of murder, punishable in terms of Section 296 of the Penal

Code.

2. At the same time and at the same transaction, he caused injuries to

Ekanayaka Mudiyanselage Loku Manike, and thereby committed the

offence of attempted murder, punishable in terms of Section 300 of the

Penal Code.

Page 3 of 12

After trial, by the judgement dated 07-09-2017 the learned High Court Judge of

Kurunegala, found the appellant guilty on the charge of murder and he was

acquitted for the charge of attempted murder due to lack of evidence as the

injured Loku Manike was dead when the case was taken up for trial, and since

her deposition was disallowed to be led in terms of Section 33 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

Facts in Brief

PW-01 Kaushalya Dissanayake was 17 years of age when she testified before the

High Court on 30th October 2017, and was 11 years old when the incident

happened. The deceased Ramani Dissanayke was her fathers younger sister,

whom she has referred to as Sudu Amma, and the injured Loku Manike was her

grandmother. The appellant was the husband of the deceased. The deceased, her

husband the appellant, Loku Manike, and the daughter of the deceased were

living in a house situated in a close proximity to the house of the witness.

This incident has happened around 4.35 in the evening of 11th March 2007. The

witness, while playing outside of her house has heard a commotion from the

direction of the house where her grandmother lived, which was on a higher

alleviation to their house. Upon hearing the noise, the deceased, who was also

near her, and the witness has gone towards the house of the grandmother and

she has seen the grandmother holding onto her head and crying while seated in

the room which was near the kitchen. When she reached the door of the room,

she has seen the appellant attacking the deceased onto her neck using a

mamoty. She has seen her fallen onto the bed in the room. Upon seeing this, the

witness has rushed out of the house and has given a call to her fathers elder

sister who was living in Gokarella area as to what was happening. Later the

villagers who gathered after hearing the cries of the inmates of the house had

taken steps to admit both the injured to hospital. Subsequently, she has come

to know that her fathers sister had succumbed to her injuries.

Page 4 of 12

It has been her evidence that this incident happened a week after the deceased

returned home from Kuwait where she worked for two years. It was also her

evidence that on the day of the incident, the appellant kept on threatening the

deceased that she would be killed and the deceased went to Gokarella police

station and returned around 11 a.m. after lodging a complaint in that regard.

The deceased had gone to the police after the appellant left home to attend a

funeral.

At the time of the incident, the witness has seen the appellant who returned from

the funeral house looking for something under the fireplace of the house and has

also seen her grandmother attempting to call the police. When this incident

happened, the witness has been about 8-10 feet away from the deceased and she

has stated that she can identify the mamoty used as it was the mamoty that had

been in use for some time in the house of the deceased.

Under cross-examination, the learned Counsel for the appellant had marked five

contradictions from the statement made by the witness to the police. It has been

suggested to her that she was not there when the incident happened and she

was lying before the Court, which she has denied.

PW-10 PS 28871 Rathnayake Bandara was the police officer who has recorded

the first statement made by PW-01 on 11-03-2007 at 19.50 hours at the

Gokarella police station.

The Judicial Medical Officer who conducted the postmortem has given evidence

marking the postmortem report as P-01. He has observed 9 injuries in total on

the body of the deceased. He has observed injury number 1, 2, and 3 on the back

of the head that may have been caused using a blunt weapon which has

fractured the skull into the brain. Injury number 4 and 5 had also been to the

head, but those two injuries had not resulted in a fracture. Apart from the above,

he has observed 2 contusions on the back shoulder, and another contusion on

the left hand. He has opined that all these injuries are injuries caused using a

blunt weapon.

At the conclusion of the prosecution evidence and when the appellant was called

upon for his defence, he has made a statement from the dock. It has been his

position that he never mistreated his wife, although she had not been faithful to

him. It was his position that on the date of the incident, he went to Galewala to

attend a funeral house, and on his return, he found his wife and mother-in-law

fallen in the room with bleeding injuries. It was his position that he was arrested

by the police later, while in a paddy field, and he was innocent of the charges.

A witness too has been called on behalf of the appellant. The witness Nayana

Nandani was the younger sister of the appellant and her evidence had been that

there were no issues between the appellant and the deceased and she was

informed that her brother had come to know that his wife was dead when he

returned after attending a funeral.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the following grounds of appeal were urged by the

learned Counsel for the appellant for the consideration of the Court.

1. The Trial Court was in error when it has failed to consider the serious

contradictions and omissions in the evidence of the sole eye witness

Kaushalya Dissanayke and thereby has caused a miscarriage of justice

to the accused appellant.

2. The Trial Court was in error when it has failed to consider that the

evidence of the sole eye witness is negated and contradicted by medical

evidence.

3. The Trial Court was in error when it has failed to consider the existence

of many reasonable doubts in the case of the prosecution and thereby

causing a miscarriage of justice towards the appellant.

The learned Counsel for the appellant contended that according to the evidence

of the JMO, the deceased has had 9 injuries in total but it had been the evidence

of PW-01 that only one blow was dealt and that was to the neck of the deceased.

It was the position of the learned Counsel that the JMO has not observed any

Page 6 of 12

injuries to the neck. It was also her position that witness PW-01 has failed to

explain the reasons as to why she did not see the other injuries being caused to

the deceased, if she really saw what happened.

In the contradiction marked V-05, the witness had stated to the police that the

appellant attacked the deceased and her grandmother over her head using a

mamoty, although she denied stating so in giving evidence before the High Court.

It was the position of the learned Counsel for the appellant that this was a

contradiction that goes onto the root of the matter.

It was the contention that when considered together, a doubt would invariably

be created as to whether PW-01 who was the sole eyewitness to the incident has

actually seen what happened or whether she has narrated in her evidence

something she never actually witnessed. It was the view of the learned Counsel

for the appellant that this doubt should have been considered in the favour of

the appellant by the learned High Court Judge.

However, it needs to be said that it was admitted by the learned Counsel that

the appellant failed to put forward his defence to the relevant witnesses when

they were giving evidence, but only had taken up that in his dock statement. The

learned Counsel also admitted that when the appellant was arrested a day after

the incident in a paddy field and taken to the hospital, it has been discovered

that he has consumed poison for which the appellant has failed to provide an

explanation.

It was the position of the learned Additional Solicitor General (ASG) that the

reason for the PW-01s failure to see all the injuries caused to the deceased was

obvious as she has fled the scene of crime as soon as she saw the deceased being

attacked and fell onto the bed in the room where she was attacked. The learned

ASG pointed out the fact that the sole eye witness was just 11 years old when

she saw her grandmother and the fathers sister being attacked. It was the

position of the learned ASG that given her age and the time gap before she could

give evidence in Court, there can be inevitable contradictions and omissions in

Page 7 of 12

such evidence. However, it was her position that the mentioned contradictions

do not affect the credibility of the witness and the learned High Court Judge has

correctly analyzed the evidence and had come to a correct finding in convicting

the appellant for the charge of murder.

The learned ASG pointed out further that the medical evidence was very much

consistent with the evidence of PW-01 since the main injuries caused to the

deceased had been to the back of the head. She also brought to the attention of

the Court that the position taken up by the appellant when he was called upon

for a defence has not been put to any of the witnesses and the evidence given by

PW-01 as to the fact that the appellant came home after attending a funeral and

he was looking for something under the fireplace had not been contradicted.

Under the circumstances, the learned ASG moved for the dismissal of the appeal

as it was devoid of any merit.

The Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal

All the grounds of appeal will be considered together as they are integrated. It

was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the evidence of

PW-01 was not reliable as it carried several contradictions and omissions.

As mentioned earlier, PW-01 was a 11-year-old child at that time. When the

incident happened, she was playing in the garden and it is obvious that the event

where the PW-01 has seen her grandmother being injured and her aunt being

attacked by her husband has overwhelmed the witness.

The incident has happened on 11th March 2007 and PW-01 has given evidence

more than 6 years after the incident. Evidence shows that the witness has made

her 1st statement to the police soon after the incident happened. She has been

the 1st informant of the incident. Therefore, no reasonably prudent person can

expect a witness who has observed an event under such conditions to bear a

photographic memory of the events unfolded before the witness. The evidence

clearly shows that soon after seeing her grandmother with a head injury, and

Page 8 of 12

her aunt being attacked, the witness has run away from the scene of crime, and

had informed the others as to what was happening.

I find it appropriate to refer to the Indian Supreme Court Case of Bhoginbhai

Hitijibhai Vs. State of Gujarat (AIR) 1983-SC 753 at Page 756, where it was

observed;

1. By and large, a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a videotape

is replayed on the mental screen.

2. Ordinarily so happens that, a witness is overtaken by events. The

witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has

an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be

expected to be attuned to absorb the details.

3. The powers of observation differ from person to person what one may

notice and other may not. An object or movement might emboss its

image on one persons mind whereas it might go unnoticed on the part

of another.

I am in no position to agree with learned Counsels contention that, among the

five contradictions marked, the contradiction marked V-05 was a contradiction

that goes into the root of the matter. The said contradiction reads as follows:

.

The only difference in the above statement to her evidence given in Court where

she says when she saw the appellant attacking her aunt, she was about 8-10

feet away was that the appellant attacked her grandmother and aunt using a

mamoty over her head ( ). Although what she meant by saying over

my head was not clear, the fact remains even in V-05, she has been consistent

with her evidence that the appellant attacked the deceased and the grandmother

of the witness using a mamoty.

It is well settled law that contradictions that do not go into the core of the matter

cannot have the effect of vitiating the evidence of a witness. Therefore, I do not

Page 9 of 12

find any material discrepancies in the evidence of PW-01 who was the sole

eyewitness to the incident. I do not find any basis for not to rely on the evidence

of PW-01. I find that when taken as a whole, her evidence was cogent and

truthful as to what she saw on that fateful day.

To prove a criminal case, it is not the number of witnesses relied on by the

prosecution that matters but the quality of the witnesses.

The relevant section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows;

134. No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required

for the proof of any act.

In the case of Mulluwa Vs. The State of Madhya Predesh 1976 AIR 989 it

was stated that,

Testimony must always be weighed and not counted.

After considering the relevant principles, Jayasuriya, J. in the case of

Sumanasena Vs. Attorney General (1999), 3 SLR 137 stated thus;

The Court could have acted on the evidence of solitary witness Nandasena,

provided the trial judge was convinced that he was giving cogent, inspiring

and truthful testimony in Court. The learned trial judge has come to such a

favourable finding in favour of witness Nandasena as regards to his

testimonial trustworthiness and credibility.

For the reasons stated as above, I find no merit in the first ground of appeal.

I find no basis in the argument that the evidence of the sole eye witness has been

negated and contradicted by the medical evidence either.

As pointed out rightly by the learned ASG, as soon as PW-01 saw her aunt being

attacked by the appellant using a mamoty, she has fled from the scene of the

crime. Therefore, her evidence that she saw only one blow being dealt to the

appellant was truthful as to what she saw. In her evidence, PW-01 has stated

that the blow was dealt to the neck of the deceased. The evidence of the JMO has

Page 10 of 12

established that injury number 1, 2, and 3 had been to the lower back of the

head inflicted with a blunt force which is very much consistent with the evidence

of PW-01. The JMO has observed four other injuries to the back shoulders and

back left hand, which are also consistent with the evidence of PW-01where she

has stated that the deceased fell onto the bed when she was first attacked on the

back of the neck.

As discussed earlier, I am unable to find any plausible, reasonable doubts in the

case of the prosecution as contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant.

The appellant has spoken about an alibi only when he was called upon to present

his defence at the conclusion of the prosecution case. He has failed to put across

this when the relevant witnesses gave evidence or to cross-examine them on that

line. PW-01 in her evidence clearly states that in fact the appellant came home

after attending a funeral and was looking for something just before the attack on

the deceased and her mother. It was also her evidence that the deceased went to

the police and made a complaint with regard to the threats made by him to the

deceased that he would kill her, after the appellant went to attend the funeral.

None of these pieces of evidence had been confronted and challenged by the

appellant when he had the chance to challenge such evidence.

It is settled law that any position taken up by an accused person in a criminal

trial, must be put to the relevant witnesses when they give evidence in a trial,

which the appellant has failed to avail of. I find that the position taken up by the

appellant was an afterthought and nothing else.

It is trite law that any stand taken by an accused in a case must be put to the

witnesses for them to respond to that position.

Page 11 of 12

In the case of Sarwan Singh Vs. State of Punjab 2002 AIR Supreme Court iii

3652 at 3655, 3656 it was stated thus;

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to

avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross examination, it must

follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.

His Lordship Sisira de Abrew, J. in the case of Pilippu Mandige Nalaka

Krishantha Thisera Vs. The Attorney General, CA 87/2005 decided on 17-

05-2007 held:

.I hold whenever evidence is given by a witness on a material point is not

challenged in cross-examination, it has to be concluded that such evidence

is not disputed and is accepted by the opponent subject of course to the

qualification that the witness is a reliable witness.

The Indian Supreme Court observed in the case of Motilal Vs. State of Madya

Pradesh (1990) (CLJ NOC 125 MP);

Absence of cross-examination of prosecution witnesses of certain facts

leads to inference of admission of that fact.

I am of the view that this is a matter where the Ellenborough Dictum which our

Courts often consider in criminal cases can be applied based on the facts and

the circumstances unique to this case.

No person accused of a crime is bound to offer any explanation of his

conduct or of circumstances of suspicion which is attached to him; but

nevertheless if he refuses to do so, where a strong prima facie case has been

made out, and when it is in his own power to offer evidence if such exist, in

explanation of such suspicious appearances which would show him to be

fallacious and explicable consistently with his innocence, it is reasonable

and justifiable conclusion that he refrains from doing so only from the

Page 12 of 12

conviction that the evidence so suppressed or adduced would operate

adversely to his interest. Rex Vs. Lord Cochrane and Others (1814)

Gurneys Report 479

It was the position of the appellant that when he came home from the funeral,

he found his wife and mother-in-law fallen with injuries. If that was the case, it

would have the normal reaction of a reasonably prudent person to assist others

or to act by himself to take the injured to the hospital for medical attention.

According to the evidence of the police officers who conducted the investigation,

they have managed to arrest the appellant only a day after the incident while he

was in a paddy field in a state where he could not get up, whereupon he was

admitted to the hospital. According to the evidence of the police officer who

arrested the appellant, he has come to know that the appellant has consumed

poison after the incident. The appellant has never denied that he consumed

poison and was admitted to the hospital by the police after his arrest. Under the

circumstances, the reasons for the appellant to consume poison was a matter

that only the appellant can explain. The appellant should have explained to

Court the reasons, which has not been done.

For the reasons considered above, I find no merit in any of the grounds of appeal

advanced by the learned Counsel for the appellant.

The appeal, therefore, is dismissed. The conviction and the sentence affirmed.
