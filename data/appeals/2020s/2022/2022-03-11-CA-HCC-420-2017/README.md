JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter after referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General before the High Court of

Colombo under Section 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for Possession of 2.45

grams of Heroin on 02nd November, 2004.

After the trial the Appellant was found guilty on the count and the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed a sentence of life imprisonment

on the 8th of September, 2017.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. During the argument he was connected via zoom from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. Irregularity in the production.

2. Irregularity in the raid.

3. Contradiction between witnesses.

4. Contradiction with regard to the place of incident.

3 | P a g e

5. Contradiction with regard to the colour of the bag.

6. Alteration of the Government Analyst Report.

Originally the Appellant was found guilty to the charge and the learned High

Court Judge sentenced him to life imprisonment on 17/12/2009. During the

first trial when the defence was called the Appellant while giving evidence

from the witness box took up the defence of alibi but this was disallowed by

the learned High Court Judge on the basis that the Appellant had not

followed the proper procedure laid down in Section 126A of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. Hence the Appellant went back to the dock and

made a dock statement.

In the Appeal No.CA/293/2009, filed against the 1st conviction, the Court of

Appeal after considering the submissions made on behalf of the Appellant

held that the rejection of leading evidence for the defence of alibi in the trial

was inaccurate. Further His Lordships of the Court of Appeal had sent the

case back to the High Court for a re-trial before a new judge.

This appeal is filed against the conviction and the sentence passed in the re-

trial. The re-trial was commenced on 24/02/2014 after more than 09 years

of the offence.

Back ground of the case.

On 02/11/2004 PW1 IP Ariyaruwan attached to the Police Narcotic Bureau

had received information from PW8 RPC 38120 Lal Kumara about a person

engaged in trafficking Heroin in Modera Kimbula Ela area. Along with 09

other police officers attached to the Police Narcotic Bureau, he had left for

the raid after completing all necessary formalities. The team had left the

bureau around 7.45 a.m. and reached the destination around 8.05 a.m. as

per the information.

4 | P a g e

PW1 IP Ariyaruwan and PW8 RPC 38120 Lal Kumara had walked up to a

boutique belonging to a Muslim gentleman situated on Madampitiya road.

The other team members were positioned near a convenient point. The

informant had met PW2 RPC 38120 Lal Kumara near the boutique and

exchanged the necessary information. PW2 RPC 38120 Lal Kumara had told

that the Appellant was coming towards the cross road which leads to a public

bathing well. When both officers were walking towards the bathing well, a

person had arrived according to the information received but he got panicked

after seeing these two officers. When he tried to run back the two officers had

apprehended the Appellant and recovered a parcel wrapped in a pink

coloured grocery bag from his trouser pocket. A powder like substances was

observed to be contained in the parcel. As the substances in that parcel

reacted indicating the presence of Heroin he was arrested and the team

members were summoned to that place immediately. After his arrest his

house was searched by the police team but nothing was recovered.

At the Police Narcotic Bureau, the Heroin was properly weighed and sealed

after obtaining the thumb impression of the Appellant. The parcel was

weighed about 101.7grams and was marked as production number N.1. The

tulip bag which had been used to carry the parcel was also sealed and

marked as N.2. At 11.16 am on 02/11/2004 IP Ariyaruwan had handed over

the parcels to the reserve police officer IP Rajakaruna after marking as

production No.29/04 and 30/04 respectively. At the trial he had identified

the production and the Appellant properly.

PW2 RPC 38120 Lal Kumara who had received the information and

participated in the raid along with PW01 had properly corroborated the

evidence of PW01 without any contradictions or omissions.

IP Rajakaruna to whom the productions were handed over by PW01 had

given evidence and confirmed that he handed over the same to the

Government Analyst on 03/11/2004 and identified the production and the

Government Analyst Receipt which had been marked as Z.2 in the trial. In

5 | P a g e

the receipt the Government Analyst had confirmed that the productions

pertaining to this case had been handed over by PW06 IP Rajakaruna with

seals intact.

PW10 Government Analyst Mrs.Rajapaksha had given evidence and

confirmed that the parcel marked as N.1 (PR 29/04) had contained 2.45

grams of pure Heroin. The Government Analyst Report was marked as Z.1 in

the trial. Her qualifications and expertise in the field of narcotics have been

admitted under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979 by the defence.

In the Government Analyst Report which had been marked as Z.1 the witness

had mistakenly mentioned that Heroin (diacetylmorphine) was not

identified in the black coloured plastic bag. (Emphasis added).

But while giving evidence she had said that she had mistakenly added the

word not and she cut the said word and placed her counter sign. Hence,

she had corrected the mistake and the court awarded the opportunity to the

defence to cross examine her regarding that mistake which was corrected.

The court also directed several questions on that particular point and

directed the witness to file a copy of her notes to this case. No copy of her

notes filed in the record nor Learned High Court has commented in his

judgement regarding this.

After the close of the prosecution the defence was called and the Appellant

gave evidence from the witness box and proceeded to call witnesses. In his

evidence he had taken up the position that he was arrested at home and

nothing was found in his possession.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person. In a case of this nature

the prosecution not only need to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt but

also ensure, with cogent evidence that the Appellant had committed the

offence.

6 | P a g e

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences relation to drugs, we are of

the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to fill

the gaps of badly handled prosecutions where the identity of the good

analysis for examination has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt.

In Perera V. Attorney General [1998] 1 Sri.L.R 378 it was held:

the most important journey is the inward journey because the final

analyst report will depend on that.

In Witharana Doli Nona v.The Republic of Sri Lanka CA/19/99 His

Lordship Justice de Abrew remarked thus;

It is a recognized principle that in drug related cases the prosecution

must prove the chain relating to the inward journey. The purpose of this

principle is to establish that the productions have not been tampered

with. Prosecution must prove that the productions taken from the

accused Appellant was examined by the Government Analyst

Therefore, proving the chain of custody is a very important task for the

prosecution in a drug related case. If investigating officers do not do their

duty properly, the chain of custody can be successfully challenged in the

trial. This is because the prosecution always relies on evidence gathered by

police officers in cases of this nature.

7 | P a g e

In the first ground of appeal the Appellant takes up the position that the

alleged Heroin was in PW01s personal locker from 9.30 a.m. to 11.16 a.m.

thus creates a serious doubt as to the integrity of the production. Thereby

the learned counsel for the Appellant argues that the conviction is unsafe.

According to chief investigation officer IP Ariyakumara, after coming to the

Police Narcotic Bureau the substance found in the possession of the

Appellant was weighed and sealed properly and handed over to PW02 IP

Rajakaruna. The handing over of the production has been done at 11.16 a.m.

as PW02 was not in the Police Narcotic Bureau when the party returned.

Therefore, the said production was kept in the personal custody of PW01

who headed the raid on that day. PW01 in his evidence properly explained

why he kept the production till 11.16 a.m. in his personal locker. This point

need not be considered as there is no any ambiguity or doubt occasioned

about the evidence of PW01. He had clearly and correctly explained to the

court that he had taken all precautions and due care to ensure the

production is properly handed over to the reserve officer of the Police Narcotic

Bureau. Hence integrity/chain of custody of the production had not been

disturbed as claimed by the counsel for the Appellant.

Under this same ground the counsel for the Appellant further argues that

PW01 had failed to identify a piece of paper in which he had placed his official

seal and obtained the signature of the Appellant.

Justice Thakkar in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjigibhai v State of Gujarat

1983 AIR SC 753 stated:

By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video

tape is replayed on the mental screen.

8 | P a g e

PW01 in his evidence reiterated that he marked the production including the

white paper as N-1. According to him he had marked all the production

shown to him during the re-trial. At this point the prosecution brought to

the notice of the court that the said piece of paper was marked as P06 during

the 1st trial. As more than 09 years had elapsed following the incident the

said paper had been pasted with other production. Hence it is very difficult

to separate the same for identification. As this point also has no bearing on

the outcome of the case, the learned High Court Judge has not considered

this point in his judgment. Hence the Appellant is not successful in his first

ground of appeal.

In his second ground the counsel for the Appellant contends that it raises a

serious doubt as to whether PW01 IP Ariyaruwan introduced/planted the

Heroin on the Appellant as PW01 was not checked before he left for the raid,

unlike the other officers.

According to PW01 he had received information about the trafficking of

Heroin through an informant of PW08 Lal Kumara. Accordingly, the raid was

organised. When this information was received by PW08 it was brought to

the notice of the Officer-in-Charge of the Narcotic Bureau by this witness.

After receiving necessary instructions from the OIC, PW01 had organised the

raid. As he headed the raiding team, he had received all instructions from

the OIC of the Bureau. Hence PW01 was under direct supervision of the OIC

of the Bureau at all the times.

As per the evidence of PW01 the Appellant is a stranger to him. No enmity

was reported against the Appellant. PW01 had only seen him at the raid.

There was no evidence of a necessity to plant/introduce Heroin against the

Appellant. As the argument advanced by the Appellant under this ground is

very vague this ground too has no merit.

As the third and fourth appeal grounds are interconnected, the said grounds

of appeal have been considered conjointly. Under these grounds the counsel

9 | P a g e

for the Appellant contends that there are contradiction and inconsistencies

in the evidence of PW01 Ariyaruwan and PW8 RPC Lal Kumara as to the

place of arrest of the Appellant. The counsel submits that although PW01

had stated that the Appellant was walking along the untarred road, but the

corroborating witness PW08 Lal Kumara had said that the Appellant was

standing at the beginning of the said road. According to the evidence of PW01

the Appellant was arrested somewhere along the untarred road when he tried

to flee after seeing PW01 and PW08.

This position was very well corroborated by PW08 in his evidence at page

295-296 of the appeal brief. Hence the stance taken by PW01 and PW08 that

the Appellant was arrested on an untarred road and that the Appellants

house is within walking distance from the place of arrest is very well

established even after 09 years of the incident. Even the Learned High Court

Judge had made an observation regarding the name of the road on which

the Appellant was arrested along with the Heroin.

In support of this ground the Appellant had marked a plan as V3 in the trial.

The said plan was drawn by the defence witness No.02 S. Rasappa who is a

licenced surveyor. According to this defence witness he had prepared V3 on

22/05/2015. The arrest was taken place on 02/11/2004. Hence the plan

was drawn after ten and a half years of the incident. What he has drawn was

the geographical appearance of the place of incident on that day i.e.,

22/05/2015. Hence, he was unable to capture the exact geographical

appearance as at 02/11/2004. As such the said V3 has less evidential value.

Even though it has less evidential value, the Learned High Court Judge had

adequately considered the said evidence in his judgment. Hence, the

evidence of PW01 and PW08 were not contradicted anywhere in the trial with

regard to the place of arrest.

The counsel for the Appellant further contended that the Learned High Court

Judge had not properly considered the defence witnesses in his judgment.

Defence witnesses 1 and 2 had given evidence after about 13 years of the

10 | P a g e

incident. The Learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence of the

said witnesses and applying the necessary tests, had very accurately arrived

at the conclusion that the evidence of defence witnesses had failed to create

a doubt in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.

Under this same ground the counsel for the Appellant contends that the

police party had failed to record the evidence of the defence witness No.02

Premalatha who is the sister of the Appellant. Premalathas contention was

that the Appellant was arrested at his own residence and not on the untarred

road as claimed by the prosecution. The Appellant further argues that

although in his evidence PW08 RPC Lal Kumara had said that he had

recorded a statement from a woman aged 35 years old on that day, but in

the evidence given by him in the 1st trial he had testified that the said

statement was recorded by PC 30204 Bandara. Hence, he argues that this a

very serious contradiction.

This contention cannot be considered as a serious contradiction as PW08 did

not deny that the police recorded a statement from defence witness No.02.

His position was that her statement had been recorded at the Appellants

house. He was unable to state as to who recorded her statement as he too

had given evidence after nearly 10 years of the incident. Due to this reason

this contention cannot be a serious one in this case. Hence this ground too

has no merit.

In the fifth ground the Appellant contends that PW01 and PW08 had given

contradictory evidence with regard to the colour of bag in which the Heroin

was detected.

In the evidence of PW01 at pages 226-227 of the brief it is stated that a black

coloured tulip bag was recovered from the Appellants trouser pocket. Upon

further examination of the said bag a pink coloured bag with some brown

coloured substance inside was recovered. As per page 245 of the brief, the

said pink coloured bag was marked as P5 through this witness.

11 | P a g e

Even though PW08 had mentioned the colour of P5 as green as noted on

page 313 of the brief, the defence had admitted the marking P1-P8 under

Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. Hence, it

is a futile exercise to bring an argument regarding colour of P5 under this

ground.

In the final ground of appeal the counsel for the Appellant contends that the

alteration made to the Government Analyst Report is highly irregular and

that it creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.

PW10 Mrs. Rajapaksha, the Senior Deputy Government Analyst who had

submitted the report which had been marked as Z-1 stated that she has done

a correction in open court when this case was heard first on 16/02/2009.

According to her it was originally mentioned that Heroin (diacetylmorphine)

was not identified in the black coloured plastic bag in the last paragraph of

the report. As she wrongly entered the word not in her report, with the

permission of the court the word not was cut off and her counter sign was

placed at the end of the line. As she was the one who analysed the production

and submitted the report and corrected it in open court, she only placed her

counter signature in the report. (Emphasis added)

Upon perusal of the court proceedings, it is abundantly clear that the

correction had been done to the Government Analyst Report in open court

with the approval of the court. Hence it is incorrect to argue that this an

irregular procedure. The court had given permission to alter the report after

examining her personal notes. The defence was awarded the opportunity to

cross examine her on her personal notes. As such relying on the Government

Analyst Report would not occasion a failure of justice. This ground of appeal

too is therefore, devoid of any merit.

Further the defence had admitted the inward journey of the production

under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

12 | P a g e

We have scrutinised the evidence and the judgment of the Learned High

Court Judge and are satisfied that the Appellant has been rightly convicted

of the offence that has been levelled against him.

Due to the aforesaid reasons, we are not inclined to interfere with the

judgment of the Learned High Court Judge dated 08/09/2017. Hence, we

dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed on

the Appellant.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Colombo along with the original case record.
