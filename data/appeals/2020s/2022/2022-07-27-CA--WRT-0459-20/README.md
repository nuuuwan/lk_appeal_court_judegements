B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Petitioner, Seylan Bank PLC, by Petition dated 14th December 2020, seeking

the intervention of this Court in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution prays, inter alia,

for the following reliefs:

1. A Writ of Certiorari to quash and set aside the award (published in Government

Gazette 2191/42 dated 04.09.2020 marked P2) pronounced by the 4th

Respondent, Arbitrator.

2. A Writ of Certiorari to quash the notice dated 08.10.2020 (marked P3) issued by

the 3rd Respondent, Assistant Commissioner of Labour, demanding the Petitioner

Bank to deposit the awarded sum of money.

The 4th Respondent Arbitrator was appointed by the 1st Respondent, the Minister

of Labour, in terms of Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950, as

amended. The mandate for settlement by arbitration is as follows:

" ...

51 , 58

,

."

The Arbitrator is thus tasked with determining whether the retirement of the 52

employees of Seylan Bank PLC prior to reaching the age of 58 years is fair or just and if

the retirement is found to be unfair or unjust what relief the said employees would be

entitled to. Having concluded the proceedings, following the leading of evidence, the

Arbitrator found in favour of the 5th to 52nd Respondents holding that the Banks

unilateral decision to reduce the age of retirement was unjust as the said employees had

a legitimate expectation to be employed until they reached the age of 58 years (in terms

of Circular No. SCL 2008/043 dated 19th September 2008) and that there was no evidence

to show that the Bank had genuinely exercised its discretion when deciding whether to

refuse the extension of services. Consequently, a sum of Rs. 165, 214, 950/- was awarded

to the employees, based on the aggregate sums of money they would have drawn as a

salary had they continued employment till the age of 58 years.

The gravamen of the Petitioner Banks complaint is that the Arbitrator has not

duly considered the situation of the Bank at the time of the dispute.

Page 7 of 22

Before considering the merits of the instant application, for the purpose of clarity,

it is pertinent to set out the role of an Arbitrator.

An Arbitrators role, as clearly set out in Section 17 of the Industrial Disputes Act,

is to make all such inquiries into the dispute as he may consider necessary, hear such

evidence as may be tendered by the parties to the dispute, and thereafter make such

award as may appear to him just and equitable.

S.R. De Silva in his seminal text The Legal Framework of Industrial Relations in

Ceylon analysed the case law interpreting the term just and equitable, which he notes

does not yield to a precise definition, and set out certain principles that the term does

not embrace. Among such principles, it is noted that [Arbitrators] have no power to act

arbitrarily or make arbitrary orders and their discretion must be exercised judicially and

reasonably; they are required to consider and decide every material question involved in

the dispute and cannot ignore facts on grounds of justice and equity.

This was affirmed by his Lordship Bandaranayake J. in State Bank of India v. N.

Edirisinghe (1987) 1 CALR 100, in holding that, an Arbitrator appointed in terms of

Section 17(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act is under a duty to act judicially. Nevertheless,

the functions of an Arbitrator do not involve the exercise of judicial power in the sense in

which that power is exercised in the Courts. The dominant duty of an Arbitrator is to

make an award which appears to him just and equitable

In making an award that is just and equitable it must also be borne in mind that

the Legislature did not intend to confer on an Arbitrator the freedom of a wild horse. The

Arbitrator is obliged to act within, and not exceed, its mandate. As held by his Lordship

H.N.G. Fernando C.J. in Municipal Council of Colombo v. Munasinghe, 71 NLR 223,

The mandate which the Arbitrator in an industrial dispute holds under the law

requires him to make an award which is just and equitable, and not necessarily an award

which favours an employee. An Arbitrator holds no licence from the Legislature to make

any such award as he may please, for nothing is just and equitable which is decided by

whim or caprice or by the toss of a double-headed coin.

A similar view is espoused in Singer Industries v. Ceylon Mercantile Industrial &

General Workers Union [2010] 1 SLR 66. Her Ladyship Chandra Ekanayake J. held,

It is a cardinal principle of law that in making an award by an arbitrator there

must be a judicial and objective approach and more importantly the perspectives both of

Page 8 of 22

employer as well as the employee should be considered in a balanced manner and

undoubtedly just and equity must apply to both these parties.

The award must not be detrimental to the public interest as well. In The Manager,

Nakiyaddeniya Group v. The Lanka Estate Workers Union (1969) 77 CLW 52, his

Lordship de Kretser J. held,

In the making of a just and equitable order one must consider not only the interest

of the employees but also the interest of the employers and the wider interest of the

country for the object of social legislation is to have not only contended employees but also

contended employers.

With the above principles in mind, this Court must now determine, in view of the

allegations made by the Petitioner Bank, whether the Arbitrator has arrived at the right

finding which is just and equitable in the circumstances of this case, having taken into

account all the material considerations. If the Arbitrator has not acted like such a Writ of

Certiorari will lie to quash the award.

In the instant case Seylan Bank PLC, a duly licensed Private Commercial Bank

incorporated under the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988, employed the 5th to 52nd Respondents.

As per Clause 13 of their Letters of Appointment the retirement age was 55 years. This

Clause was amended by Circular No. SCL 2001/10 dated 13th March 2001 (marked X1).

In terms of the said Circular, the retirement age continued to be 55 years of age. However,

employees were entitled to apply for extensions annually until they reached the age of 60

years. It was made explicit that the granting of extensions was entirely at the Banks

discretion.

In the year 2008, by Circular No. SCL 2008/043 dated 19th September 2008

(marked X2) the age of retirement for all categories of employees was extended to 58

years. This Circular titled Retirement Age Limit reads,

We are pleased to inform that the Founder Chairman and the Senior Management

has decided to extend the retirement age limit upto fifty eight (58) years for all categories

of staff.

This will come into effect immediately.

During the month of December 2008, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka exercising its

regulatory powers intervened in the management of Seylan Bank by dissolving the

existing Board of Directors and appointing a new Board. The Board of Directors of the

Page 9 of 22

Bank of Ceylon oversaw the management of Seylan Bank. These steps were taken to

address a crisis of confidence and a possible collapse that Seylan Bank was faced with in

the wake of the infamous collapse of Golden Key Credit Card Company, a company within

the Ceylinco Group. Ceylinco was a major shareholder in Seylan Bank. The new Board

was tasked with re-establishing financial stability. (This was not disputed by the 5th to

52nd Respondents)

The evidence of Jayakody Arachchige Ajith Rohana Perera, led on behalf of the

Respondents states as follows:

As part of the steps taken to return the Bank to normalcy (illustrated further in

the Case Study marked X5) Circular No. SCL 2009/003 dated 19th March 2009 (marked

X3) was issued, six months after Circular No. SCL 2008/043 was issued. This Circular

titled Retirement Age reads,

We refer to an extract of the minutes of the Board of Directors Meeting held on

9th March, 2009 and wish to inform you that the Board has decided to adopt the following

with immediate effect:

a) Implement the Public Administration Circular and set the retirement age at

55 years.

b) If any staff member applies for an extension, the Management to evaluate

his/her performance and grant extensions annually until he/she reaches the

age of 57 years at the discretion of the Management.

c) Only in an event where the Management decides that the services of a highly

skilled employee who could not be easily replaced and who will contribute to

the bottom line directly, such an employee could be exceptionally granted an

extension annually until he/she reaches the age of 60 years. However, this

practice is not to be encouraged.

Page 11 of 22

Please treat our Circular No. SCL 2008/043 dated 19th September, 2008 as

rescinded.

Accordingly, it is seen that the retirement age is reverted to 55 years. However,

employees have the option of applying for annual extensions until they reach the age of

57 years, and additionally, highly skilled employees who are not easily replaceable could

apply for annual extensions until they reach the age of 60 years. By this, the new

management has considered the necessity of retaining skilled employees in this manner.

This was not provided for in Circular No. SCL 2008/043 in which all employees,

irrespective of whether highly skilled or not, had to retire at the age of 58 years.

The 5th to 52nd Respondents, some of whom were denied extensions and some of

whom were granted a one-year extension but denied a second time, complained to the

Commissioner of Labour against their unjustifiable termination, sometime after their

extensions were denied. As no settlement was forthcoming the Minister of Labour acting

under Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act referred the dispute for mandatory

arbitration.

As alluded to above, the Arbitrator found in favour of the 5th to 52nd Respondents

holding that the Banks unilateral decision to reduce the age of retirement was unjust as

it frustrated the employees legitimate expectation to work until they reach 58 years of

age and that there was no evidence to show that the Bank had genuinely exercised its

discretion when deciding whether to refuse the extension of services. The employees were

awarded a sum of Rs. 165, 214, 950/-.

This award (marked P2) was challenged by the Petitioner Bank primarily on the

ground that the Arbitrator had acted outside the scope of his mandate by inquiring into

the question of whether the Bank properly exercised its discretion to grant/refuse

extensions and that the Arbitrators finding that there was no financial crisis was

erroneous. Additionally, it is argued that the employees could not have formed a

legitimate expectation to continue in service till they reach the age of 58 years and the

employees were belated in making their complaint to the Commissioner of Labour.

As noted above, the role of the Arbitrator is circumscribed by law and his mandate.

His mandate is reproduced again for the purpose of convenience:

" ...

51 , 58

Page 12 of 22

,

."

If an Arbitrator has given his decision in bad faith, if he has made a decision which

he had no power to make, if he failed in the course of his inquiry to comply with the

requirements of natural justice, if he has misconstrued the provisions giving him the

power to act or his mandate so that he failed to deal with the question remitted to him

and decided some question which was not remitted to him, if he has refused to take into

account something which he was required to take into account or if he has based his

decision on some matter which he had no right to take into account his award will be

quashed.

Thus, a question arises as to what considerations are relevant or material, which

ought to have been considered by the Arbitrator, and those which are irrelevant and thus

ought not to have been considered by the Arbitrator. This question in regard to the

relevancy of considerations in reaching a decision is normally whether that consideration

is relevant to the statutory purpose, or in the instant case, whether it is relevant to the

mandate.

If the ground of challenge is that relevant considerations have not been taken into

account a Court must assess the actual or potential importance of the factor that was

overlooked.

In the instant case, the Arbitrator failed completely to take into account the

severity of the financial crisis that Seylan Bank was faced with during the year 2008/2009,

which compelled them to issue Circular 2009/003. The relevant part of the Arbitrators

reasons reads as follows:

, 57 " 20" , 165 " 21 , X5

.

Page 13 of 22

. 2010

. [emphasis added]

It is thus seen that the Arbitrator has relied on some facts and figures presented

by the employees and newspaper articles of a statement made by the Governor of the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka at the time assuring depositors that the financial crisis has

been resolved. The Arbitrator further notes that the situation was resolved by the year

2010.

While it is true that the financial situation was resolved by 2010 and any

catastrophic consequences that could have ensued from the crisis were mitigated, the

Arbitrator has failed to address his mind to how the crisis was brought under control.

There is no dispute whatsoever that the Central Bank did have to intervene. It is a

common sensical proposition that the Central Bank would have to make such a dramatic

intervention only if a Bank was facing a severe financial crisis. The repercussions of a

collapse of a Bank will lead to disastrous consequences not only to the employees that

would have to be made redundant after its bankruptcy but also to depositors who have

entrusted their monies to the Bank in confidence. Not to mention the ripple effect on the

entire economy of the country. This was executed in terms of Section 30(1) of the Monetary

Law Act.

This Crisis of confidence that Seylan Bank faced was following the collapse of the

Golden Key Credit Card Company, as mentioned above. Queues of depositors formed

outside branches of Seylan Bank to withdraw their deposits. These fears were amplified

by the collapse of Pramuka Savings & Development Bank Limited which led to thousands

of depositors being rendered helpless not long before this. The entire sordid tale is set out

in the Case Study (marked X5) presented by Seylan Bank. The Case Study sets out

the steps taken by the new management, one of which was to reduce the high staffing

ratio by lowering the age of retirement to 55 years (p. 42 of the Case Study). Thus, the

Circular No. SCL 2009/003 dated 19th March 2009 does not arise in a vacuum.

The 5th to 52nd Respondents do not deny that there was a crisis. In Paragraph 44

of their written submissions, it is noted that the aforementioned Case Study clearly

established that the financial crisis was caused by a misunderstanding subsequent to

the collapse of the Golden Key company, which had triggered a run-on deposits of the

Petitioner Bank. It is their contention that, as per the Case Study, the Crisis was only

short-lived since customer and investor support was restored without a need for a

Page 14 of 22

government bail-out. It was perhaps owing to mismanagement or malpractice that the

crisis arose, but there is no denying that it did arise. To paraphrase the words of his

Lordship Sirimanne J. in Heath & Co v. Kariyawasam 71 NLR 382, no reasonable man

could have, in my opinion, reached any other conclusion on the evidence placed before

him.

Yet, it must be reiterated that what has to be understood is that it would not have

been resolved if not for the complete restructuring the Bank had to undergo, one step of

which was, unfortunately, the lowering of the retirement age. It is not prudent to now

look at the situation in retrospect as these were steps that the management thought were

best at the time. To use the words of the Bombay High Court in B.J. Shetty & Others v.

Air India Limited 2000 (1) BomCR 743, the Court is not best Judge of a business decision,

for the wearer knows where the shoe pinches or as his Lordship Alles J. in Ceylon

Transport Board v. Thungadasa, 73 NLR 211, held, One cannot under the guise of

making "just and equitable orders make orders which in effect dictate to the management

how a Department or Corporation should be run.

It must also be noted that the Arbitrator is empowered by Section 36 of the

Industrial Disputes Act to, inter alia, require any person to furnish, in writing, such

particulars he may consider necessary; to require any person to give evidence on oath or

otherwise before him; require any person to produce such documents as he considers

necessary for the purposes of settling the dispute. An expert may have been summoned to

clarify the financial situation if the Arbitrator needed further material to grasp the

severity of the crisis faced at the time the circular was issued.

Further, an institution such as a Bank which expects the utmost trust and

confidence of its employees may hope to retain employees, especially skilled employees,

who are experienced in running the business of the bank instead of hiring new employees

who need to be trained. Time would be spent cultivating that relationship of trust.

Nonetheless, despite the perceived advantages of retaining trusted staff, who had an

unblemished record, a tough call had to be made to restore the age of retirement to 55

years of age and allow them to work until 57 years or 60 years, on extension, depending

on which category they belonged to. This was because of the austerity measures the new

management had to undertake to mitigate a crisis.

Therefore, we are of the view that the Arbitrator has erred by not considering this

material consideration. That is, the Circular lowering of the age of retirement was a

Page 15 of 22

necessary step the Bank had to take as part of a total restructuring to alleviate a crisis;

it was not an arbitrary decision taken at the whim and fancy of the Bank.

The Arbitrator must arrive at a finding which is just and equitable for both parties,

and the public interest. In this case, the public interest was an important consideration

more so than in other industrial disputes given that the employer is a Bank, which is

entrusted with the savings/investments of others.

It is notable that the Bank, upon its restructuring, has not plainly asked all

employees who had already surpassed the age of 55 years to leave outright. A

Memorandum dated 23rd April 2009 (marked X6) was issued by the General Manager

clarifying the application of Circular No. SCL 2009/003 (which reduced the retirement age

to 55 years) for those employees reaching the ages of 56 to 58 during the year 2009. In the

said Memorandum, it is stated that employees going on 55 years and reaching 56 years

will be permitted to work till they reach 56 years of age and retire with effect from their

56th birthday: such employees could apply for an extension to continue until they reach 57

years of age (the Management would decide whether to grant an extension). The

Memorandum also permits those going on 56 years and 57 years to work until they reach

57 and 58 years of age respectively. This evinces the fact that the Bank acting equitably

had allowed those employees who had reached the ages of 56 to 58 years to continue until

their next birthday without applying for an extension (although in plain terms of Circular

No. SCL 2009/003 their services ought to have terminated on the date that Circular was

issued). This was misconstrued by the Arbitrator as a violation of their own Circular. The

relevant part of the Arbitrators reasons read as follows:

13 2009/003

It must also be noted that although the Arbitrator has made the following

observation with regard to Circular No. SCL 2009/003,

A 3 ,

Page 16 of 22

this Court observes that Circular No. SCL 2009/003 is rather similar to Circular No. SCL

2001/10. No evidence was forthcoming as to whether Circular No. SCL 2001/10 was issued

following consultation of employees. On the other hand, as mentioned below, it transpires

that Circular No. SCL 2009/003 was issued following consultation. The relevant portion

of these two Circulars will be juxtaposed for the purpose of clarity.

SCL2001/10 SCL2009/003

Your employment if not terminated

earlier, shall ipso facto cease upon your

reaching the age of retirement which

shall be 55 years. However, on your

reaching the age of 55 years you will be

entitled to apply for extensions annually

until you reach the age of 60 years.

Granting of such annual extensions shall

be entirely at the discretion of the Bank.

a) Implement the Public Administration

Circular and set the retirement age at 55

years.

b) If any staff member applies for an

extension, the Management to evaluate

his/her performance and grant

extensions annually until he/she reaches

the age of 57 years at the discretion of the

Management.

c) Only in an event where the

Management decides that the services of

a highly skilled employee who could not

be easily replaced and who will

contribute to the bottom line directly,

such an employee could be exceptionally

granted an extension annually until

he/she reaches the age of 60 years.

However, this practice is not to be

encouraged.

When both Circulars are compared, the retirement age is set at 55 years of age,

similar to Clause 13 of the Letters of Appointment under which the 5th to 52nd

Respondents were employed, with a provision to apply for annual extensions until an

employee reaches 60 years of age. The difference being, in Circular No. SCL 2009/003 the

annual extensions are based on two categories. Those employees that are highly skilled

Page 17 of 22

and not easily replaceable are permitted to apply for annual extensions up to 60 years of

age, whereas other employees can only apply until they reach the age of 57 years. Further

evincing the fact that the Bank (the management of which was run by the State-owned

Bank of Ceylon) has not merely adopted a Public Administration Circular and called for

the retirement of all employees at 55 years but that it has considered the policy of the

Bank with regard to the retirement of employees that existed prior to the Circular of 2008.

The Petitioner Bank also contends that the Arbitrator acted beyond his scope by

inquiring into whether Seylan Bank had properly exercised its discretion to grant or

refuse extensions to the employees (relying on the judgment of Amerasinghe v. Board of

Directors [1998] 1 SLR 367) and finding that the Bank had not duly and fairly considered

the applications for an extension made by the employees.

The relevant part of the Arbitrators reasons states:

... "X4" b

.

.

. [emphasis added]

The mandate of the Arbitrator is to determine whether the retirement of the 5th to

52nd Respondents prior to the age of 58 years was fair or just. The Arbitrator was not

called upon to determine whether the Bank had exercised its discretion to not extend the

services of the employees correctly. Although much ink was spilled on this point, it is

plainly irrelevant to the present dispute.

The Bank has granted extensions to certain Respondents, yet not to others. It is

impossible to make a common determination whether all of them were or were not entitled

to be extended further as that has to be judged on an individual basis. The Arbitrator

erred by stepping outside the bounds of his mandate and making a broad finding that

since there was no evidence before him whether the application for extension was

considered duly and fairly by the Bank, the discretion had not been exercised in such a

manner.

Even if it is presumed that inquiring into whether the applications for extensions

were considered duly and fairly fell within his mandate the burden is on the employees,

in terms of Sections 101 and 102 of the Evidence Ordinance, to lead evidence to establish

Page 18 of 22

that it was not done so. A mere statement that their applications were not duly and fairly

considered is insufficient.

This Court agrees with the Petitioner Banks contention and holds that the

Arbitrator has acted beyond his mandate.

Our case law abounds with instances in which an Arbitrators award has been

quashed on the basis that the Arbitrator has not taken into account material

considerations or that he has acted beyond his mandate. A few of these are as follows:

In Virakesari v. Fernando 66 NLR 145, his Lordship Weerasooriya J. held:

The omission of the 1st Respondent to take into consideration the evidence

touching the charge of having instigated a go-slow is, in my opinion, a misdirection

amounting to an error of law.

In Gunasekera v W P L De Mel, Commissioner of Labour 79 NLR 409, his Lordship

Tittawella J. held:

A lack of jurisdiction may arise in different ways. While engaged on a proper

inquiry the tribunal may depart from the rules of natural justice or it may ask itself the

wrong questions or may take into account matters which it was not directed to take into

account. Thereby it would step outside its jurisdiction. A tribunal which has made

findings of fact wholly unsupported by evidence or which it has drawn inferences wholly

unsupported by any of the facts found by it will be held to have erred in point of law. The

concept of error of law includes the giving of reasons that are bad in law or inconsistent,

unintelligible or it would seem substantially inadequate. It includes also the application

of a wrong legal test to the facts found taking irrelevant considerations into account and

arriving at a conclusion without any supporting evidence. If reasons are given and these

disclose that an erroneous legal approach has been followed the superior Court can set

the decision aside by certiorari for error of law. If the grounds or reasons stated disclose

a clearly erroneous legal approach the decision will be quashed. An error of law may also

be held to be apparent if the inferences and decisions reached by the tribunal in any

given case are such as no reasonable body of persons properly instructed in the law

applicable to the case could have made. The above is a summary of some of the grounds

for awarding certiorari as set down in S. A. de Smith's work-Judicial Review of

Administrative Action [emphasis added]

In Collettes v. Bank of Ceylon [1984] 2 SLR 253, his Lordship Sharvananda J. (as

he then was) held:

This Court undoubtedly has the jurisdiction to revise the concurrent findings of

fact reached by the lower court in appropriate cases. However, ordinarily, it will not

interfere with findings of fact based upon relevant evidence except in special

circumstances, such as, for instance, where the judgment of the lower court shows that

the relevant evidence bearing on a fact has not been considered or irrelevant matters have

been given undue importance or that the conclusion rests mainly on erroneous

considerations or is not supported by sufficient evidence. When the judgment of the lower

court exhibits such shortcomings, this court not only may, but is under a duty to examine

the supporting evidence and reverse the findings. [emphasis added]

The five-judge bench of the Supreme Court held in the same case that the question

of whether the Tribunal has failed to take into account the relevant considerations is a

question of law. This was also referred to in Fonseka v. Candappa [1988] 2 SLR 11 and

Sithamparanathan v. Peoples Bank [1989] 1 SLR 124.

Wade & Forsyths, Administrative Law (11th Edition) at p. 325 notes:

The decision maker must take the obligatory relevant considerations into account

and if he fails to do so the judicial review court will set him right.

In the instant case, the Arbitrator has not taken into account material

considerations and, it is manifest that the Arbitrator has overstepped the limits of his

mandate and has sought to deal with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within

the terms of reference.

The Arbitrator has made a finding that it was unfair for the 5th to 52nd Respondents

to retire prior to the age of 58 years as they had a legitimate expectation to serve until

they reach that age.

The relevant part of his reasons states:

The doctrine of legitimate expectations as per Wade & Forsyth stems from

fairness, the need to protect against the abuse of power, legal certainty, and protection of

the citizens trust in the system. As Wade & Forsyth observe (at p. 450), Where some

boon or benefit has been promised by an official that boon or benefit may be legitimately

expected by those who have placed their trust in the promises of the official. It would be

unfair to dash those expectations without at least granting the person affected an

opportunity to show the official why his discretion should be exercised in a way that fulfils

his expectation.

Lord Diplock in the landmark judgment of Council of Civil Service Unions v.

Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374 noted that it is preferable to refer to such

expectations as legitimate instead of reasonable so as to indicate that the former has

consequences to which effect will be given in public law. His Lordship observed legitimate

expectations arise when decisions affect a person:

by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which either

(i) he had in the past been permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he

can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until there has been

communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has been

given an opportunity to comment; or

(ii)he has received assurance from the decision-maker will not be withdrawn

without giving him first an opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they

should not be withdrawn.

His Lordship Prasanna Jayawardena J. in Ariyarathne & Others v. Illangakoon &

Others SC FR Application No. 444/2012 decided on 30.07.2019, provided a comprehensive

exposition of the doctrine of legitimate expectations in our legal system. His Lordship

observed that in cases of a substantive legitimate expectation, as in the instant case, the

Courts must adopt the following twofold approach:

First, to examine whether the constituent elements of the claimed substantive

legitimate expectation are in line with the principles referred to earlier which describe

the usual characteristics of a substantive legitimate expectation that a court may be

inclined to protect and enforce.

If those constituent elements are present,

Page 21 of 22

the court should weigh the character and substance of the expectation and the

prejudice caused to the petitioner by its frustration, on the one hand; against the

importance of the public interest which led to the public authoritys change of heart, on

the other hand; and then decide whether that exercise of weighing the competing interests

leads to the conclusion that the petitioners expectation is of such weight and the

consequences of its frustration are so prejudicial to him when compared to the public

interest relied on by the public authority, that the public authoritys decision to change

its policy and negate the expectation was disproportionate or unfair or unjust and

amounted to an abuse of power which should be quashed; or whether the decision to

change the policy should stand because the public authority has acted proportionately,

fairly and justly when it decided that the petitioners substantive legitimate expectation

could not be granted since public interest demanded a change of policy.

It is also noteworthy that in the written submissions of the 5th to 52nd Respondents,

in Paragraph 27 it is stated that a significant number of the Respondent Employees were

not due for retirement even under the terms of this Circular [SCL 2009/003] and therefore

was not affected by it until several years had passed. This statement seems disingenuous.

In the instant case, even if the 5th to 52nd Respondents are successful in

establishing that they possessed a substantive legitimate expectation to be employed until

they reached the age of 58 years, they will be unsuccessful in enforcing it as on a weighing

of competing interests the consequences of frustration of the expectation are minute when

compared to the interest of the Bank, its employees, depositors, investors, and the

economy as a whole which would have been in jeopardy.

The Arbitrator also notes that the reduction of the age limit has taken place

unilaterally:

58

55

.

As per the evidence of the witness, one Angelo Bosco, Executive Officer Human

Resources for the Petitioner Bank, consultation had taken place with the Bank of Ceylon

Employees Union. This is set out as follows:

However, the 5th to 52nd Respondents deny that such consultation took place. This

is a factual dispute that this Court cannot determine.

For the aforesaid reasons, a Writ of Certiorari will lie to quash the award of the

Arbitrator. By virtue of this determination, the notice issued by the 3rd Respondent dated

08th October 2020 demanding the Petitioner Bank to deposit the awarded sum of money

is quashed as well.
