One Chitra Werapitiya along with J. M. Dudley Jayasundera and Madara Tennakoon, on

or about 12.01.1999, have instituted a partition action bearing No.15049/Partition in the

District Court of Ratnapura seeking to partition the subject land of the instant application

which is morefully described in the schedules to the Petition. The said J. M. Dudley

Jayasundera is supposed to be the brother of the 1st Petitioner and the said Madara

Tennakoon is the wife of the 1st Petitioner.

According to the Petitioners, while a lis-pendens was in operation with regard to the said

subject land, the 1st Respondent Land Reform Commission (LRC) has executed deeds of

transfer bearing Nos. 6921, 6922 and 6923 dated 02.09.1999 and has transferred an

undivided portion of the subject land containing an extent of one acre each to one

Rupahinge Gunaratne and his two sons namely, Rupahinge Indrakumara and Rupahinge

Chandrakumara. Subsequently the said two sons were also made defendants to the

partition action and they have sought a dismissal of the said action claiming the entirety

of the subject land. The LRC also has filed its statement of claims in the said partition

action and has claimed 7/10th of the subject land. The said statement of claim is marked

as P5.

The 1st Petitioner by Deed bearing No. 3655 dated 29.07.2004 (Marked P6) received a

half portion of allotments of land called Ganga adddarahena depicted as Lot 21 in the

FVP 39 and allotment of land called Ganga addarahena and Lokudeniyahena depicted

as Lot 21B in FVP 39 (marked as P6) from the said Dudley Jayasundara.

1st Petitioner who became aware that the said land was vested with the LRC, wrote to the

relevant Minister indicating his willingness to purchase the said land from the LRC and

as a result the relevant Minister directed the Chairman LRC to look into the matter.

During the pendency of the aforementioned Partition Action, the LRC has conducted an

inquiry whilst giving an opportunity to all the stakeholders to represent themselves at the

inquiry. The 1st Petitioner has requested the LRC to grant a lease in his daughters name

(2nd Petitioner) as he held more than 50 acres of land. The said inquiry continued for a

period over 8 years and on conclusion, a report dated 15.02.2013, marked P8, was

submitted.

Page 4 of 7

The aforementioned report marked P8 discloses, inter alia, the following details and

observations about the subject land;

i. The entire subject land consisting of A6.R0.P6 has been vested with the 1st

Respondent LRC under the LRC Law;

ii. There had been multiple transactions between the period of 07.04.1987 and

23.05.1988;

iii. Since the entirety of the subject matter was vested with the LRC, any transaction

after the introduction of the LRC Law is considered to be illegal, as per the section

18(5) of the LRC Law;

iv. The LRC has sold 3 acres of the land vested with LRC to Mr. R. Gunaratne and

two others of the same family on 02.09.1999 for housing purpose under section

22(1)(c) of the LRC Law;

v. The 1st Petitioner has made a request that he be given the land vested from Mrs.

Dedigama, i.e, A3.R0.P6, after determining this extent as a part of the Statutory

Declaration as he has purchased the same in 2004;

vi. As Mr. Migara Jayasundara is husband of Mrs. Madara Tennakoon who is the

sole heir to the statutory declaration (SD) of her father, wife and husband cannot

own lands over 50 acres of land under LRC Law; First this SD should be verified;

If the SD covers 50 acres, this land cannot be sold to Mr. Migara Jayasundara

unless it is given on lease;

vii. Balance land (apart from the lands sold extent of A2.R3.P31 and another

A0.R0.P29) with the extent of A3.R0.P06 could be declared as SD to Mrs.

Dedigama, if appropriate, after identification and considering present position of

the lands already proposed for balance SD of Mrs. Dedigama . By this process, the

ownership of the land does not automatically passes on to Mr. Migara Jayasundare

as he is husband of Mrs. Madara Tennakoon who is the sole heir to SD of her

father. Assume, litigation may arise between Mr. Guneratne and Mr. Migara

Tennakoon on purchase deeds, though they are illegal.

viii. Mr. R. Gunaratne and his family has enjoyed the entire land for the last so many

years without paying a single cent to the LRC for unsold lands. The income derived

is considerable.

Subsequently, based on the said Report, the LRC made a determination dated 26.02.2013

marked P10 on the subject land. However, since then no action has been taken to

implement such determination which is acceptable to the 1st Petitioner. Therefore, the

Petitioners of the instant application seek, inter alia, for a mandate in the nature of a writ

of Mandamus directing the 1st and/or 2nd to 9th Respondents to implement the decision of

the 1st Respondent dated 26.02.2013 marked as P10.

Now I advert to examine whether the Petitioners are entitled to the reliefs prayed for in

the prayer of the Petition, particularly whether this Court could issue a writ of Mandamus

as prayed for in paragraph (b) of the prayer of the Petition. It is important to observe that

none of the Respondents have filed statements of objections against the Petition of the

Petitioners. On the day of the hearing the learned Counsel for the 1st to 3rd Respondents

indicated that the decision marked as P10 has not been rescinded by LRC. Similarly, at

the threshold stage of this matter the LRC has not resisted on issuing formal notice on the

Respondents of this application.

Thus, the pertinent question is whether this Court could grant reliefs in favour of the

Petitioners merely because the Respondents have not raised any objections to the

assertions of the Petitioners. The decision of the LRC marked P10 is based on the

conclusions and the recommendation of the Report marked P8. The inquiring officer has

issued the said Report on 15.02.2013 as a consequent to the meeting held on 02.10.2012

on which date several interested parties have participated. On a careful perusal of the said

Report P8 it appears that the said inquiring officer himself has raised several valid points

such as declaring that the transactions taken place after the LRC law coming in to effect

was illegal. This Court had no opportunity to listen to submissions on behalf of the other

relevant parties who were interested in the subject matter other than going through the

contents of the said Report P8. Although I gathered above mentioned facts from the

Report marked P8, this Court is unable to assess the actual rights of the Petitioners or

other parties only with the available material to Court due to the complexity of the issues.

Therefore, I am of the view that this Court is not fully possessed with facts and evidence

to analyze the decisions in P8 and P10 and thus, I am not inclined to issue a writ

directing the LRC to implement the decisions reflected in P10.

However, I divert my attention now to the contention of the Petitioners who assert that

the Executive Director of LRC, subsequent to the above determination marked P10, has

Page 6 of 7

requested the 1st Petitioner by way of a letter dated 05.07.2013 (marked P11) to provide

a project proposal in respect of the subject land in order to lease out the relevant balance

portion of the land. The Petitioner through document marked P12 has submitted such

proposal to the LRC. Though such proposal was submitted by the 1st Petitioner, no further

actions have been taken by the LRC up to date with regard to the said land in favour of

the Petitioners.

Moreover, it is necessary to draw my attention to the 1st Petitioners letter dated 11.03.2021

(marked P20) addressed to the Chairman of LRC. What emanates from the said letter is

that the Legal Officer of LRC has communicated to the 1st Respondent that the deterrent

to execute the decision in P10 was a Supreme Court case bearing No.

SC/SPL/LA/415/2019, pending at that time. According to the Petitioners the said

Supreme Court case is a Special Leave to Appeal Application from the Judgement of the

Court of Appeal dated 15th October 2019 in case bearing No. CA/WRIT/ 271/2013. The

Petitioners state that R. Guneratne and his two sons R.Indrakumar and Chandrakumar

filed three writ applications including the said application No. CA/WRIT/271/2013 and

the 1st Petitioner was not a party to those applications. It seems to be that the Petitioners

of those writ applications have moved Court inter alia not to transfer certain portions of

the subject land to any third party other than those Petitioners.

As per the Judgement marked as P16 the said application No. CA/WRIT/271/2013 has

been dismissed and the Petitioners allege that the said Supreme Court case bearing No.

SC/SPL/LA/415/2019 also has been dismissed on 10.03.2021. Anyhow a copy of such

order of the Supreme Court has not been annexed to the instant application. Apart from

all above, the Petitioners filling a motion dated 20.06.2022 tendered to this Court a copy

of the proceedings in case No. 15049/Partition dated 17.11.2021 and accordingly, the

District Court of Ratnapaura as per an application of the respective Plaintiff has dismissed

the said Partition Action.

In light of the above, I take the view that if all relevant litigation has come to an end there

seems to be no other valid reason for LRC to desist from resolving the disputes in respect

of the subject land and from addressing the issues raised by the Petitioners. It is observed

that a grave prejudice would be caused to the 1st Petitioner/ Petitioners who have been

seeking relief from LRC and also to any other parties with legitimate rights if no action

would be taken expeditiously by LRC.

Page 7 of 7

In the circumstances, I proceed to issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus

directing the 1st Respondent LRC to resolve the issues of the Petitioners according to law

without any further delay and if the LRC is satisfied that the decisions in P8 and P10

are reasonable and lawful, to give effect to such decisions in an appropriate manner before

taking decisions, if any, to alienate the subject land to a third party other than the

Petitioners. I take the view that there is no necessity to issue a writ of Prohibition as prayed

for by the Petitioners due to the nature of the above mandate issued by this Court.

Application is partly allowed.
