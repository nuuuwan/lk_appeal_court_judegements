This is a revision application filed on 31.07.2020 against a judgment of the

Provincial High Court of Matara dated 12.06.2020, which refused to revise an

order of the Magistrate Court of Matara dated 20.12.2019. This instant

application was supported on 21.09.2020, and notices were issued to the

respondents. On 26.11.2021, the State Counsel informed Court that no relief had

been sought from the Attorney General and requested the Attorney General be

discharged. Thereafter, notices were issued to the remaining respondents, after

which time was granted to file objections. When the matter came up to be

mentioned on 20.07.2022, the counsel appearing on behalf of 3rd to 6th

respondents submitted that she had no intention of filing objections and that she

concedes to the prayer of the petitioner to set aside both the Magistrate Court

order dated 20.12.2019 and the High Court order dated 12.06.2020. As the Court

of Appeal cannot deliver a judgment to set aside an order by mere consent, the

judgment was reserved.

The facts of the case are as follows. On 20.03.2018, the officer in charge, police

station Gandara (hereinafter the 1st respondent), filed a report before the

Magistrate Court, Matara under Section 81 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act, No. 15 of 1979 (hereinafter the CPC). The report detailed a land dispute

between the petitioner and the 3rd to 6th respondents. The report further informed

the Magistrate that despite a warning by the 1st respondent and a reference to

the Mediation Board, parties have continued the dispute as of habit causing a

breach in peace as per Section 81 of the CPC. Hence, the 1st respondent moved

to issue an order against the petitioner and 3rd 6th respondents to show cause

as to why they should not be bonded over per Section 81 of the CPC. The show

cause inquiry commenced, and the petitioner tendered written reasons on

29.10.2019. As the 3rd 6th respondent failed to show cause, the Magistrate

entered the said respondents into a bond of Rs. 1 million for an indefinite period

by order dated 26.11.2019.

On 20.12.2019, the Magistrate ordered the petitioner to enter into a bond of Rs.

1 million for an indefinite period of time citing that the petitioner failed to show

CA-CPA-89-20 Page 5 of 8 01/08/2022 IJ-33-22

cause as to why such a bond should not be issued against her, thereby invoking

the Magistrates powers under Section 81 of the CPC. Aggrieved by the

Magistrates order dated 20.12.2022, the petitioner filed a revision application to

the High Court on 08.06.2020. On 12.06.2020, the High Court dismissed the

application of the petitioner in limine. Such dismissal was solely based on the

determination that the petitioner is guilty of laches.

Hence, it is incumbent upon this Court to examine whether there exists any

illegality or irregularity in the Magistrate Court order dated 20.12.2019 and

whether the learned High Court judge has erred in law by dismissing the

petitioners revision application on a technical ground. Prior to an examination of

the outlined issues, this Court will set out the law pertaining to Section 81 of the

CPC:

The Section provide for the taking of security from certain classes of people to

keep the peace. This is a form of prevention and not punishment. Upon

receiving information, if the Magistrate is satisfied that the facts stated are well

founded, and that it is necessary or desirable to call upon the party complained

against to keep the peace he must first call upon such party to show cause why

such an order should not be made.

Whenever a Magistrate receives information that any person is

likely to commit a breach of the peace or to do any wrongful act that

may probably occasion a breach of the peace within the local limits

of the jurisdiction of the court of such Magistrate, or that there is

within such limits a person who is likely to commit a breach of the

peace or do any wrongful act as aforesaid in any place beyond such

limits the Magistrate may in manner hereinafter provided require

such person to show cause why he should not be ordered to execute

a bond with or without sureties for keeping the peace for such

period not exceeding two years as the court thinks fit to fix.

(Emphasis added)

CA-CPA-89-20 Page 6 of 8 01/08/2022 IJ-33-22

A plain reading of Section 81 of the CPC clearly establishes the legislative

intention of limiting the period for which an accused is bonded over to keep the

peace: a period not exceeding two years. Therefore, in framing Section 81,

the legislature requires the presiding judge to delineate a specific period when

ordering the execution of a bond. Under Ordinance No 15 of 1898, the maximum

period under which a person could be bonded was 6 months (See Police Officer

V. Dineshamy 21 NLR 127; Velaiden V. Zoysa Et Al. 14 NLR 140; Weerasinghre

V. Peter 39 NLR 426).

However, in the instant case the order made by the Magistrate under Section 81

of the CPC does not specify a time period. Thus, the Magistrate order dated

20.12.2019 carries a fatal illegality as it is in direct contravention of Section 81

of the CPC. The same illegality has been averred by the petitioner in the revision

application filed to the High Court. Yet, the learned High Court judge has

completely disregarded this fatality and has dismissed the petitioners application

solely on the ground of laches. i.e., the delay of 5 months.

While unexplained, inordinate delay may be significant in deciding whether the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Court ought to be invoked or not, the purported

delay must not be viewed in isolation. Such a construction is in line with the wide

discretion vested under the revisionary jurisdiction, which allows rectification ex

mero motu. The fact of the instant case is such that the impugned order of the

Magistrate carries a fatal illegality vis--vis its disregard of the maximum period

under which an accused can be bonded over under Section 81 of the CPC. As

opined by Sansoni CJ, the object of the power of revision is the due

administration of justice (Mariam Beebee v Seyed Mohamed 68 NLR 38). Due

administration of justice warrants the compliance of the law as enacted by the

legislature, a point which the Magistrate has failed in the instant case. The fact

of the instant case aptly echoes the following dicta quoted from Somawathie v

Madawala and others (1983) 2 SLR 15 at 30 and 31: The court will not hesitate

to use its revisionary powers to give relief where a miscarriage of justice has

occurred . . . Indeed, the facts of this case cry aloud for the intervention of this

court to prevent what otherwise would be a miscarriage of justice.

CA-CPA-89-20 Page 7 of 8 01/08/2022 IJ-33-22

Furthermore, it is pertinent to comment on the sum of the bond imposed by the

Magistrate. While Section 81 of the CPC does not indicate the manner of

calculation, Section 87 may be of some guidance, as both Sections are under

Chapter IV Prevention of Offences B Security for keeping the peace in other

cases and security for good behaviour. Section 87 provides that the amount of

every bond shall be fixed with due regard to the circumstances of the case and

shall not be excessive. Hence it is clear that a Magistrate having been satisfied of

breach of peace under Section 81 ought to set an amount which is not fanciful

or arbitrary with due regard to the facts and circumstances of the case and the

party concerned. The provisions of Chapter IV of the CPC should not be used with

the object of imprisoning a person who has made himself obnoxious to others, he

should be given a chance of obtaining his freedom by tendering security. A point

to be considered when setting the bond amount would be the partys status in

life, and the sum demanded should never be such as to absolutely preclude him

from being able to furnish the necessary security.

A bond of Rs 1 million, no doubt in such circumstances is an exorbitant amount.

The facts of the case involve a personal dispute between two parties over a land.

Though the Magistrate has discretion in deciding the quantum of the bond as he

thinks fit, as examined above, he should act judiciously. Such quantum must be

considered in light of the offence/ act committed and should not be imposed just

for the sake of being imposed. The effect of the impinged Magistrate order would

result in absurdity where any claim that the petitioner had breached peace within

the indefinite period of time would result in the petitioner being liable under a Rs

1 million bond. Any default on the part of the petitioner would result in a fine,

which, if defaulted, would result in imprisonment.

At this juncture, it is pertinent to refer to the order delivered by the Magistrate

against the 3rd 6th respondents as well. The said order dated 26.11.2019 carries

the same fatal errors as the impugned order dated 20.12.2019 i.e., failure to

define the bond period, the quantum of the bond being exorbitant. Article 138

which sets out the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court empowers the Court to

correct all errors in fact or in law. As per Section 365 of the CPC the Court of

Appeal is vested with the power to take congnisance of and exercise the

CA-CPA-89-20 Page 8 of 8 01/08/2022 IJ-33-22

revisionary jurisdiction against any case record of the proceedings of which has

been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge. As provided

by the Article 145 of the Constitution the Court of Appeal may, ex mero motu or

on any application made, call for, inspect and examine any record of any Court

of First Instance and in the exercise of its revisionary powers may make any order

thereon as the interests of justice may require. Hence, it is incumbent upon this

Court to use its revisionary powers against the order of the Magistrate Court

dated 26.11.2019 despite it not being referred to in the prayer of the instant

application.

Hence, it is the considered view of this Court that the Magistrate Court order

dated 26.11.2019 has erred in law by failing to comply with Section 81 of the

CPC. In light of such a fatal illegality, it is the view of this Court that the High

Court order dated 12.06.2020 erred by dismissing the revision application of the

petitioner in limine. Hence, both orders are hereby set aside. This Court further

sets aside the order of the Magistrate dated 26.11.2019.

Application allowed.
