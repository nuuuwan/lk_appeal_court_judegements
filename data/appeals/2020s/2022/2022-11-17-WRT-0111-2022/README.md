Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner was appointed to the post of Senior Lecturer Grade II in the Department of

Computational Mathematics in the Faculty of Information Technology of the 1st Respondent

University of Moratuwa (University) w.e.f. 03.11.2008, by letter dated 21.10.2008, marked

R1 (A5). The said Letter of Appointment contained, among others, the following clauses;

02. This post is permanent and unless your appointment is terminated earlier, you will be on

probation for a period of three (03) years (or more in the case it is considered expedient

to extend the period of probation), from the date of assumption of duties by you and

until you receive a letter confirming you in your appointment.

06. You are required to complete an Induction training course (which includes Teaching/

Learning Methodologies) within a period of one (01) year from the date of first

appointment which is a pre-requisite to secure eligibility for confirmation in the post.

The Petitioner has not been confirmed in her post up to date on the basis that the Petitioner

had failed to submit proof of satisfactory completion of an Induction Training Course

(Course). The University sent several letters informing the Petitioner that she may be

confirmed in her post only upon her submission of a certificate proving satisfactory

completion of the Course. Upon the failure of the Petitioner to submit such proof as required

by the University, the services of the Petitioner was terminated by the Vice Chancellor of the

University by letter dated 14.05.2019, marked X3, w.e.f. 01.06.2019.

The defence taken by the Petitioner is that she could not complete the Course as a

consequence of the workload ensuing from her being entrusted with many other

responsibilities after her recruitment including the commitment to author several research

papers. Though the Petitioner thereafter informed the Vice Chancellor by letter dated

03.06.2019, marked A25, of her having completed the Course (on 01.06.2019) along with

the certificate of completion (marked A24), no response was received by the Petitioner.

Page 4 of 10

The Petitioner seeks for an order in the nature a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of

the 1st Respondent contained in letter, marked X3, to terminate the services of the Petitioner

and also a Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to implement the recommendations

contained in University Services Appeals Board (USAB) order dated 25.05.2021, marked

X2 (R6).

Its a pre-requisite in terms of Clause 6 of the said Letter of Appointment (R1) that the

Petitioner should complete an Induction Training Course within the period of one year from

the date of first appointment in order to secure eligibility for confirmation in the post. The

plain reading of the said Clause implies that completing an Induction Training Course is not

the only requirement to confirm the Petitioner in her post. The word eligibility embodied in

the said Clause clearly envisages that there may be other grounds as well for consideration

when confirming the Petitioner in her post.

Other Clauses relating to the period of probation contained in the Letter of Appointment;

12. If your services are unsatisfactory during the period of probation or fail to reach the

requisite standard of proficiency in Sinhala/Tamil, or you fail to obtain such

qualifications or pass such examination as may be specified by the Council, you are

liable to be discontinued at any time during the period of probation or at the end thereof.

13. If your services during the period of probation have been satisfactory and pass or obtain

an exemption from the prescribed proficiency test in Sinhala/Tamil, you will be

confirmed in your appointment at the end thereof.

The grounds to discontinue the services of an employee who is on probation under above

Clause 12 are twofold. The services will be discontinued a.) if such servicers are unsatisfactory

or b.) if the employee fails to reach the requisite standard of proficiency in Sinhala/Tamil or

fails to obtain such qualifications or pass such examination as may be specified by the

University Council. Perhaps one can presume that the said Clause 12 cannot be treated as a

stand-alone section when deciding whether the services of a probationer could be terminated

only on the grounds mentioned therein. However, an overall conspectus of the circumstances

of this case reflects the fact that the said Clause 12 is the only provision in R1 which spells

out discontinuation of service during the period of probation.

Page 5 of 10

In terms of above Clause 13, if the services are satisfactory and requirements for language

proficiency have been fulfilled, the employee should be confirmed in his appointment. The

fundamental issue in the instant application is that the University has neither confirmed the

Petitioner in her services nor extended her period on probation.

The question which arises here is whether the failure to complete a Course would be a pre-

condition to terminate the services of the Petitioner.

It is a mandatory duty, according to the law set forth by this Court in regard to the period of

probation, for the University to complete a formal review of the performance of the Petitioner

by the end of the probationary period as stipulated in the Letter of Appointment and further,

it is vital that the outcome of the review is communicated to the Petitioner. Anyhow, it

appears that the University without following a proper procedure to review the performance

has bestowed the Petitioner with additional responsibilities, such as appointing her to the post

of Head of Department of Computational Mathematics (Vide-A7(b) and A8). The

Petitioner was appointed as the Head of the said Department after serving a period of one

month as the Acting Head of the same Department. Similarly, she has served as the Acting

Director Undergraduate Studies (A9), Curriculum Coordinator (A18), Research

Coordinator (A19), Chairman of the Admissions Committee 2010 (A20), a member of the

Consultative Committee of Social Harmony (A21) and an academic member for the

upliftment of University games-Taekwondo (A22) during the purported period of probation.

This clearly shows that the University authorities have not raised objections on Petitioner

continuing her services at the University even after a lapse of one year, the period stipulated

for completion of the Course.

The Respondents referring to documents, marked R9 & R10 assert that the University has

assisted the Petitioner in completing the Course at the Open University by making relevant

payments on behalf of the Petitioner. As per Clause 21:2 (b) of Chapter III of the University

Establishments Code, the University is bound to give all facilities to the officers enabling them

to gain such qualification or pass such tests etc., within the initial period of probation.

However, it is vital to note that the payments reflected in R9 & R10 have been made in the

year 2013 and that was after a lapse of almost 5 years from the appointment.

Page 6 of 10

The Section 72(1) of the Universities Act No.16 of 1978, as amended (the Act) declares that

every appointment to a post of teacher shall, in the first instance, be for a probationary period

of three years. Such probationary period can be extended by one year at a time for a further

period not exceeding five years. Surprisingly, the University without giving effect to the

provisions of this Section has accorded liberty to the Petitioner to serve for an uninterrupted

period of almost 11 years. Besides, effect must be given to Clause 2 of the Letter of

Appointment which provides to extend the period of probation when it is considered

expedient. This is a clear violation of the statutory provisions by the University and it is the

root cause for the alleged grievances of the Petitioner. Such conduct of the University

illustrates the potential pitfalls that can affect the rights of a probationer who blindly continues

to serve with a legitimate expectation.

I take the view that when an employee is serving during the probationary period, the

employers duty is not only to assess the employee but also to provide necessary training,

guidance and supervisory support to the employee. In State Distilleries Corporation vs.

Rupasinghe (1994) 2 Sri. L.R. 395 (at p. 400) Mark Fernando J. has observed that Probation is

a period during which an employee is tried or tested and given the opportunity of

proving himself in relation to his employment. Moonemalle J. in Moosajees Ltd. vs. Rasiah

(1986) 1 Sri. L.R. 365 (at p. 369). has observed that the period of probation is a period of trial

during which the probationers capacity, conduct or character is tested before he is admitted

to regular employment.

The precedent enunciated in the above judgements in reference to the role of an employee

who is on probation is pertinent for this Court to arrive at a conclusion whether the

Petitioners services could be terminated on the failure of non-completion of the said Course.

The Respondents heavily relying on the documents R2 to R4, R7, R8 and R11

implicate that the University has brought to the attention of the Petitioner several times the

failure of the Petitioner to complete the Course. It is abundantly clear that none of those

reminders demanded a termination of services in the event of failing to comply with the

provisions of Clause 6 of R1. The University is setting forth the word termination for the

first time in its letter dated 14.05.2019, marked X3, by which the services of the Petitioner

Page 7 of 10

has been terminated. It needs to be stressed that there cannot be any restriction for the

authorities to take a suitable action such as not granting increments etc. other than

termination, in an event of failure to fulfill the requirement of completing the Course.

No charges on unsatisfactory service or on language proficiency have been levelled against

the Petitioner. In other words, the Petitioner has not been charged upon an offence which

demands disciplinary action against her. Termination of services after a disciplinary inquiry

is considered as a major punishment in terms of Clause 4:1:2 Chapter XXII of the University

Establishments Code. Attention should be drawn to the fact that there was not even an

attempt to hold a disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner on a category of offence such as

incompetence under Clause 2 of the said chapter or on any other ground.

Analyzing the approach taken in several related judgements1 which supports the view that the

employee on probation has no right to be confirmed in his service and/or the services of such

employee can be terminated without assigning reasons, I have found in Lanka Canneries (Pvt)

Ltd vs. Commissioner of Labour and others, CA/WRIT/385/2021 decided on 31.08.2022 that;

..any employer should mandatorily follow an effective procedure right throughout the period

of probation if an employer needs to enjoy the benefit of not confirming probationers as per the

propositions in the aforesaid judgements cited by the Petitioner.

The general provisions in Clause 21:3:1 of Chapter III of the said Establishments Code gives

the authority to terminate an employee who is on probation without assigning reasons. But

the said Clause cannot be considered as a stand-alone section as such provisions should be

mandatorily subject to the above judicial precedent which enhances the jurisprudence on

1 Hettiarachchi vs. Vidyalankara University 76 NLR 47; Ceylon Cement Corporation vs. Fernando (1990) 1 Sri.

L.R. 361; Priyadarshana and two others vs. Lanka Ports Authority (2008) 2 Sri. L.R. 208; Moosajees Limited

vs. Rasiah (1986) 1 Sri. L.R. 365; Brown & Company Limited vs. Samarasekara (1996) 1 Sri. L.R. 334, 335;

Liyanagamage vs. Road Construction and Development Private Limited (1994) 2 Sri. L.R. 230; Ceylon Ceramic

Corporation vs. Premadasa (1986) 1 Sri. L.R. 287.

employment during probation. The scheme of the said Establishments Code demands an

inquiry before a decision is made on a disciplinary ground.

The University Establishments Code, in my view, is fully equipped with necessary provisions

to terminate the services of an employee (who is subjected to the said Code) on probation

subject to a disciplinary inquiry upon offences such as inefficiency, incompetence, negligence

etc. recognized under its Clause 2:2. I may not asses the legality of those relevant clauses of

the Code but need to acknowledge them on principle at this juncture. For completeness, I

must mention that this Court has extensively dealt with the procedure to terminate the

services of an employee on probation who is subjected to Termination of Employment of

Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971 (TEWA) in Lanka Canneries (Pvt) Ltd vs.

Commissioner of Labour and others.

The failure to take prompt action at the appropriate stage by the Human Resources Division

of the University cannot lead to reprimand the Petitioner. Though the failure to fulfil the

requirements of completing a Course would be a precondition for the Petitioner to be

ineligible to secure confirmation in the relevant post, that certainly, based on the

circumstances of this case, will not be a precondition to terminate her services. The period of

probation cannot be assumed as a grace period for the employer to exercise his discretion in

an unfettered manner to terminate the services of an employee arbitrarily, unreasonably and

against the law.

For the forgoing reasons, I arrive at the conclusion that the decision to terminate the services

of the Petitioner should be quashed. The Petitioner in addition to the relief sought to quash

the said decision by way of writ of Certiorari, claims for a declaration that the Petitioner is

entitled to be reinstated with back wages. Once the impugned decision to terminate the

services is quashed, eventually the Petitioner should be reinstated. Anyhow, I am not inclined

to make any determination on back wages as it is, in my view, within the purview of the

University authorities. It is because this determination does not bestow the Petitioner

explicitly with a confirmation in her services, although it can be presumed that the Petitioner

has gained over the years necessary experience expected by way of an Induction Training

Course. The decision to confirm the Petitioner in service or extend her probationary period

Page 9 of 10

should be taken independently by the University following the criteria in Clause 12 of the

Letter of Appointment.

In view of my earlier findings, this Court makes an observation that the University will be

entitled, if it wishes, to take an appropriate decision upon the failure to submit proof of

completion of the Course during the stipulated period. Such decision, if necessary, should be

taken according to law and particularly according to the University Establishments Code and

following an appropriate inquiry. This does not imply that the University should terminate

the services of the Petitioner based on the same grounds after reinstatement. I have taken the

above view as I cannot possibly overlook the failure on the part of the Petitioner who is very

much in a better position than an ordinary employee to read and understand the provisions

of the Letter of Appointment. Not complying to a mandatory requirement may lead to a

breakdown in discipline. Especially in an academic institution like the 1st Respondent

University, discipline is paramount and not only the students but the academic staff also ought

to obey the rules.

Now, I advert to the Petitioners other relief. The Petitioner seeks for a writ of Mandamus

directing the Respondents to implement the order of the USAB dated 25.05.2021, marked

X2. An application has been made by the Petitioner to the USAB after her services were

terminated and the USAB in its order, marked X2 (R6) held that it is unable to make an

Order that the University should act contrary to the provisions of the Letter of Appointment.

Additionally, the USAB has made a strong recommendation that the University should

reconsider the decision to terminate the Petitioner and take all necessary steps to reinstate and

confirm the Petitioner as the University will not be benefited by terminating the services of an

employee with such wide experience without any fault on her part. However, the Council of

the University informed the Petitioner that it had considered the above order of the USAB

and decided not to take action in accordance with the recommendation of the USAB as it

would be contrary to the provisions of the letter of appointment.

The USAB has made such strong recommendation whilst concluding that it cannot order the

University to act contrary to the provisions of the Letter of Appointment. As mentioned

above, this Court has already determined that the Petitioner is entitled to get the letter of

Page 10 of 10

termination quashed. In this context, I am not inclined to consider the relief prayed for by the

Petitioner for a writ of Mandamus.

Based on all the circumstances of this case, a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari is

issued quashing the decision to terminate the services of the Petitioner reflected in the letter

dated 14.05.2019, marked X3. I order no costs.
