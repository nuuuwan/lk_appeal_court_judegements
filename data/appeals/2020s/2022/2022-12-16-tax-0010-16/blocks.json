Therefore, according to the nature of business of the Appellant bank, its profits fall exclusively under section 3(a) and does not fall under section 3. In the above circumstances, the Appellant bank should be treated as carrying on the business of banking and therefore investments in government development bonds and the foreign currency loan granted to the government of Sri Lanka to earn interest has to be treated as part of the banking activity. Therefore, the Appellant bank is not entitled to claim exemption under section 9(b) of the Inland revenue Act. Further, exemption under section 9(b) will not be applicable to interest derived by the bank, since such income is derived as business income and it is liable to tax, unless specifically excluded by any other provision of the Inland Revenue Act.",
