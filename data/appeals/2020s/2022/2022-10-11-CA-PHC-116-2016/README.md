This is an appeal against the order dated 24.10.2016, delivered by

the High Court of the North Western Province holden in Puttalam

which acted in revision and affirmed the vehicle confiscation order

dated 16.12.2015, delivered by the Puttalam Magistrate Court

under the Forest Ordinance. The claimant petitioner appellant

(hereinafter the appellant) has preferred this instant appeal to this

Court in order to have both the orders set aside, and thereby

disallow the confiscation of the vehicle bearing registration no. NW

HJ 3437.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The accused is a son of

the appellant who was charged in the Magistrate Court of Puttalam

for the offence of transporting one cube of granite in a lorry bearing

the registration no. NW HJ 3437 (hereinafter the vehicle) within a

reserved forest without a valid license, thereby contravening Section

20 (1) (d), read with Section 40 and Section 40 (1) of the Forest

CA-PHC-116-2016 Page 4 of 8 11/10/2022 IJ-42-22

Ordinance as amended by laws, inter alia, Act no.65 of 2009

(hereinafter the Act). The accused pleaded guilty to the charge and

the Magistrate convicted the accused on 21.10.2014, and imposed

a fine of Rs 20000/= with a default imprisonment sentence of three

months. The conviction of the accused ensued the confiscation of

the vehicle in relation to the offence which was released temporarily

to its registered owner, the appellant on a bond. After an inquiry

into the matters of the appellants knowledge of the said diversion

of the vehicle in relation to the case and whether the appellant has

taken sufficient precautionary measures to prevent such an offence

to the satisfaction of the court, the learned Magistrate set out the

order dated 16.12.2015 to confiscate the vehicle. Aggrieved by the

said order dated 16.12.2015, the appellant filed a revision

application in the High Court of Puttalam, and the revision

application was rejected by the High Court for want of necessary

precautions on the part of the appellant to prevent the commission

of the offence under the Forest Ordinance. Hence, the appellant has

preferred the instant appeal to the Court of Appeal, seeking to set

aside the order dated 16.12.2015 of the Magistrate Court and the

order dated 24.10.2016 of the High Court.

Before diving into an analysis of the merits, it is apt to quote the

relevant law in this instant application. Thus, Section 40 of the Act

is quoted as follows:

(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the

State in respect of which such offence has been committed;

and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in

committing such offence,

CA-PHC-116-2016 Page 5 of 8 11/10/2022 IJ-42-22

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such

offence, be confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools,

vehicles, implements and machines used in the commission of

such offence, is a third party, no Order of Confiscation shall

be made if such owner proves to the satisfaction of the Court

that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such

tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines, as the case

may be, for the commission of the offence. (Emphasis added)

As such, the legislature on Forest Law has unequivocally casted a

burden on the third party of an offence within the ambit of Section

40 to dispense the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the court

that he, as the registered owner of the vehicle in dispute, has taken

necessary precautionary measures to prevent the vehicle from being

employed in acts of crime. Therefore, this Court primarily looks into

the contention of whether the learned Magistrate has correctly

applied the relevant legal provisions and evaluated the evidence

presented before the court in arriving at the final determination that

the appellant has failed to dispense the said burden.

The Magistrate Court, followed by the High Court decided against

the appellant for want of satisfactory show of cause as to why the

vehicle should be released to the appellant. The learned Magistrate,

in delivering the impugned order, has firstly examined whether the

appellant has sufficiently established the ownership to the vehicle

and after affirming such evaluation, the learned Magistrate has

evaluated the evidence presented by the appellant, during which,

certain discrepancies in the presented evidence were noted to hold

that the appellant has failed to constitute, on a balance of

probability, the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the court,

CA-PHC-116-2016 Page 6 of 8 11/10/2022 IJ-42-22

that the appellant has unequivocally dispensed the burden casted

on him by the Forest Ordinance.

It was the contention of the appellant that, she was uninformed of

the said diversion of the vehicle. The appellant admitted that she

has given the vehicle to the accused to be serviced and until such

time of notification of the arrest, the appellant was unaware of the

whereabouts of the accused and the vehicle. Hence, the learned

Magistrate delivered the order dated 16.12.2015 to confiscate the

vehicle for the lackadaisical attitude of the appellant towards the

accused and the use of the vehicle infers a want of precautionary

measures to prevent the commission of illegal acts. Thus, mere

instructions given to the accused on the ordinary course of using

the vehicle does not properly dispense the burden cast on her under

the Forest Ordinance. The High Court, following the invocation of

its revisionary jurisdiction, affirmed the order by the learned

Magistrate.

In this instant application, this Court primarily looks into the

submissions made on behalf of the appellant, to determine whether

the appellant has satisfied the

burden cast on him under the Forest Ordinance. At this juncture,

it is apt to quote the observations made in Samarasinghege

Dharmasena v W. P. Wanigasinghe CA(PHC) 197/2013 CA

Minute dated 22.01.2019, where its stipulated that it is amply

clear that simply giving instructions to the driver is insufficient to

discharge the burden cast on a vehicle owner. Therefore, merely

giving instructions alone will not fall under the possible preventive

measures ought to be taken by a vehicle owner.

In the matter at hand, the appellant contends that she has given

instructions to her son, the accused to abstain from using the

CA-PHC-116-2016 Page 7 of 8 11/10/2022 IJ-42-22

vehicle for illegal activities. However, the cross examination of the

appellant, revealed that the vehicle has been engaged in a prior

offence where the accused has diverted the vehicle and gotten

arrested for the illegal transportation of sand. Therefore, it further

cements the observation of this Court, that a mere exchange of

instructions to the accused, does not suffice the burden cast on her,

the fact that the accused is the appellants son and that there is a

record of a prior offence, imputes a duty upon the appellant to

closely monitor the use of the vehicle by the accused and to take all

precautions to prevent the commission of such an offence, as a

reasonably responsible person in ownership of a vehicle, in order to

satisfy this Court.

As held in S. D. N. Premasiri v Officer In Charge, Mawathagama

C A (PHC) 46/2015 Court of Appeal Minute dated 27.11.2018

it is imperative to prove to the satisfaction of Court that the

vehicle owner in question has not only given instructions but also

has taken every possible step to implement them. It is observed by

this Court that, in this instant application, the appellant has proved

neither.

Similarly, in H.G.Sujith Priyantha v O.I.C.Police Station,

Poodala C.A (PHC) No 157/12, it was held that mere verbal

instructions to the driver on the conduct of employing the vehicle

does not suffice to dispense the burden cast on him, on a balance

of probability. As such, in this instant matter, this Court observes

that the appellant has not properly dispensed the burden of proving

on a balance of probability, the burden cast on him to constitute,

to the satisfaction of the Court that she has taken all necessary

precautions to prevent the commission of an offence, as a

responsible owner of a vehicle.

CA-PHC-116-2016 Page 8 of 8 11/10/2022 IJ-42-22

For the above reasons, it is considered the view of this Court, since

the appellant has failed to dispense the burden cast on her, that

the learned Magistrate has duly concluded the matter at hand and

the learned High Court Judge has correctly dismissed the revision

application. Accordingly, we see no reason to interfere with the

order of the learned High Court Judge dated 24.10.2016 and the

confiscation order of the learned Magistrate dated 16.12. 2015.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
