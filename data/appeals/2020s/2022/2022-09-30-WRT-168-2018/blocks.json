He further alleges that the said paddy field belonged to twobrothers who had later transferred it to the Complainant-Respondent. The 1st Respondent hadbeen the tenant cultivator of the said paddy filed since 1986. As the 1st Respondent had seriouslyfallen ill, it is alleged that he had gone with the Petitioner to one Somapala, whom he believedwas the owner, and had sought his consent for the Petitioner to cultivate the paddy field. It is theposition of the Petitioner that the said Somapala had given consent on the basis that the Petitionerpays him the rent. However, the ownership of the paddy field had changed and the new owner,the Complainant Respondent subsequently complained in terms of section 7(10) of the AgrarianDevelopment Act No 46 of 2000, alleging that the 1st Respondent had without consent sublet thepaddy field to the Petitioner, thereby in violations of the provisions of the Agrarian DevelopmentAct and had requested to cancel the tenancy rights of the 1st Respondent-Respondent and toobtain the vacant position. Thereafter the Assistant Commissioner fixed the matter for inquiry.The Petitioner as well as the Complainant Respondents agent had taken part in the inquiry. Afterthe conclusion of the inquiry, both parties had been given the opportunity to file their writtensubmissions and subsequently, the 3rd Respondent delivered his order. Being aggrieved by thesaid order, the Petitioner has filed this application seeking a writ of certiorari and a writ ofMandamus.",

Namely, he has failed to demonstrate that he has taken any meaningful steps to amendthe paddy land register and get himself registered as the tenant cultivator thus, depriving him ofany legal right. We also find that in view of documents 1X1 and 1X2 and also of documents1R1 1R5 marked before the Commissioner, and to which the Courts attention was drawn, thePetitioners inability to submit any receipts issued to him for payment of rent up to theproceedings being filed before the Commissioner, defeats the Petitioners argument that he is thetenant cultivator and had been cultivating since 1998. Further in view of the above-mentionedmarked documents and in view of the Complainant-Respondents denial of the Petitioner beingthe tenant cultivator, the Petitioners contention of him cultivating the land since 1998 as thetenant cultivator becomes a disputed fact.",
