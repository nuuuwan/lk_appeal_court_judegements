The interest is embedded in the business (in the words of Rowlatt J.) or a mere incident in the business (in the words of Lord Hanworth M.R.)-see Butler v. The Mortgage Company of Egypt, Ltd. I do not think it can be separated off or identified as distinct from the general business of the company. I do not think therefore that these items are assessable as such.

If it is a case of dividends, interests, or discounts appertaining to a business, they fall within the words profits of any business and section (6) (1)(a) applies. If, however, it is a case of dividends, interest or discounts accruing to an individual not, in the course of a business, but as a part of his income from simple investments, then section 6 (1) (e) is the relevant section, and so far as interest is concerned, section 9 (3) modifies section 9 (1) (Emphasis added).",

In that content it appears reasonable to assume that, had the legislature intended to exempt interest as claimed by the Appellant the former could have specifically done so vide provisions in the Inland Revenue Act itself. This contention appears apparent when we consider the provisions relating to incorporation of banks in Sri Lanka and those incorporated outside Sri Lanka. The requirements are clearly different.

It is a kind of loan given to the Sri Lankan Government by the Appellant. In appreciation, the government of Sri Lanka has given tax benefit from the accrued interest. How the Appellant finds money to invest in Sri Lanka Development Bonds is a matter of the Appellant. He cannot deduct any borrowing cost, if it is the only business he is doing in Sri Lanka. Therefore, it is my view that that the Appellant being engaged in businesses other than investing in Sri Lanka Development Bonds, cannot deduct any borrowing cost incurred in investing money in Sri Lanka Development Bonds from any other taxable income. If he is allowed, the Appellant will get dual benefit from the investment, that is to say the tax benefit in the accrued interest and deducting the incurred expense from taxable income where he has not really incurred that expense to generate the taxable income.

Even though the Appellant has not produced any document or a separate account in this case, the Appellant stated at the inquiry that they are keeping all the data in their company.
