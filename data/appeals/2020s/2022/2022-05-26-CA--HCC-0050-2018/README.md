This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence of him by the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo, where he was sentenced to life

imprisonment.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Colombo on one count of

trafficking of 6.6 grams of diacetylmorphine, commonly known as Heroin on

02nd April 2013, an offence punishable in terms of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Amendment Act No 13 of 1984.

He was also charged for having in his possession the same quantity of Heroin

at the same time and at the same transaction, an offence punishable in terms

of the same Ordinance.

After trial, he was found guilty for the offence of possession of Heroin, while he

was acquitted of the charge of trafficking of Heroin preferred against him, and

sentenced as above by the learned High Court Judge.

Facts in brief: -

Page 3 of 11

Sub Inspector of Police Udara Premasiri (PW-01) has reported to duty at 8.00

a.m. at the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) on the day of the incident, namely,

02-04-2013. While on duty, he has been informed by one of his subordinate

officers (PW-04, PC22836 Sandaruwan) that he received an information from

one of his personal informants about trafficking of Heroin by a person.

Accordingly, he has organized a raid and had left the PNB at 6.30 p.m. with his

team of officers including PC Sandaruwan. After reaching the place where the

informant wanted them to come and meet him at 7.15 p.m., he has been

informed that a person carrying Heroin will come from the direction of

Wallampitiya in the motorbike No- WN-0802. While waiting in Kolonnawa-

Gothatuwa junction with his team of officers expecting the arrival of the

mentioned motorbike, it has arrived at 7.45 p.m. Upon searching appellant

who came in the motorbike, the witness has found a parcel in his right trouser

pocket, which he has identified as Heroin. The parcel weighed at 10 grams

when it was weighed at the PNB. The witness has explained the procedure he

followed in sealing the productions and handing over to the production officer

of the PNB.

Under cross examination, it has been revealed that the same team of officers

led by PW-01 has conducted two other raids during the day, before the raid

which led to the arrest of the appellant. They have left the PNB at 11.00 a.m.

and had arrested a person named Dharmasiri at Dematagoda with 500 grams

of Heroin in his possession and returned to PNB at 1.40 p.m. They have left the

PNB again at 3.00 p.m. and had arrested another person with Heroin at

Maradana and had returned to the PNB at 5.00 p.m., and had left for the raid

that led to the arrest of the appellant at 6.30 p.m. on that day. The witness has

admitted that it was the same vehicle that was used for all the raids and it was

the same officer who went waring a police uniform. He has also stated that he

received information from three different informants for the three detections. It

was his position that when Dharmasiri was arrested he did not go to his house

Page 4 of 11

and searched it, and has denied the suggestion by the learned Counsel for the

appellant that he and his team went to the house of the said Dharmasiri.

It has been the position of the appellant that after getting to know of the mobile

phone number of the appellant using the mobile phone of Dharmasisi, the

appellant was asked to come to the house of Dharmasiri and was arrested

there when he went to get money for his fish selling business, and the Heroin

found in the possession of Dharmasiri was introduced to the appellant and the

other person mentioned as the person arrested in the second raid. The witness

has denied the position of the appellant stating that he has no reason for

falsely implicate the appellant as he is unknown to him.

Under cross-examination, it has been further revealed that the witness has

failed to mention in his out entry that he searched the officers who went with

him in order to find whether they are carrying any unauthorized substance. It

has been explained by the witness saying that it was his habit to mention that

in his detailed notes and not in the out entry.

In response to the suggestion that it was not possible to conduct several raids

in this manner, the witness has stated that these were not the only raids

carried out by his team, but there was one unsuccessful raid previous to these

three detections as well. According to the evidence of the witness, he and his

team of officers have left the PNB at 10.40 a.m. on the previous day (01-04-

2013) and had returned only at 10.35 a.m. on the day of these three raids,

namely, 02-04-2013.

PW-04, PC 22836 Sandaruwan was the officer called by the prosecution to

corroborate the evidence of the PW-01. He is also the person who has received

the information about the trafficking of heroin from an informant. He has given

similar evidence in relation to the raid and the arrest of the appellant. There

has been no material contradictions and omissions in the evidence of PW-04 to

that of PW-01. However, when questioned about the other two raids conducted

Page 5 of 11

by the same team of officers on that day, he has claimed that he is not in a

position to remember the details of those raids.

The prosecution has called other witnesses to prove the production chain in

this case. The Government Analyst report is a matter that had been admitted

by the defence.

At the closure of the prosecution case, and when a defence was called from the

appellant, he has opted to make a statement from the dock. It was his position

that he is a fishmonger by profession, and he went to the house of the earlier

mentioned Dharmasiri at around 5.00-5.30 p.m. on the day of his arrest after

he was informed by Dharmasiri by phone to come to collect the money he

wanted as a loan from him for his fish business.

When he went to the house, he found Dhrmasiri and a friend of him seated in

the house and when he went inside, some police officers who were inside

detained him and questioned as to the reason for coming. Although he

explained, he was taken to the PNB along with the other two and implicated for

the crime was his stand.

In his judgment, the learned High Court Judge has found the witnesses called

for the prosecution as credible and consistent. It has been the observation of

the learned High Court Judge that it was not improbable for PNB officers to

conduct several raids in a day and the PW-01s failure to mention in his out

entry that he examined other officers who took part in the raid does not affect

the truthfulness of the evidence of the witness.

The learned High Court Judge has determined that the appellant has nothing

to prove, and it was the duty of the prosecution to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt. Determining that the appellant has failed to offer a

reasonable explanation against the evidence against him and that the appellant

has taken different stances as to his arrest when PW-01 and PW-04 gave

Page 6 of 11

evidence, it has been determined that the appellants stand cannot be accepted

and it does not create any doubt as to the evidence of the prosecution.

Accordingly, the appellant has been convicted only for the possession of 6.6

grams of Heroin while he has been acquitted from the charge of trafficking the

same amount.

The Grounds of Appeal: -

At the hearing of the appeal the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant

raised the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

(1) The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the probability of the

evidence of the prosecution in its correct perspective.

(2) The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the evidence

favourable to the appellant in the judgment.

(3) The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself in his analysis of

the defence evidence.

It was the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant that

it was improbable for the same team of PNB officers to function continuously

almost two days in the manner it has been stated in the evidence, which gives

credence to the appellants stand as to the way he was arrested. Arguing that

the probability of the evidence of the prosecution should have been considered

by taking the evidence in its totality, it was the position of the learned

Presidents Counsel that failure to search the house of Dharmasiri when he

was arrested with 500 grams of heroin and the failure of the PW-01 to keep

proper notes in his out entry are matters that should have been considered in

favour of the appellant. Contending that the learned High Court Judge was not

correct when he determined that the appellant has taken different stands when

the two main witnesses gave evidence and the appellant was consistent in his

defence, it was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel that the learned

Page 7 of 11

High Court Judge, although he has stated that it was the prosecution who

should prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, that burden has been shifted

to the appellant in this case.

In reply, it was the position of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) for

the respondent, that the learned High Court Judge has never shifted the

burden of proof to the appellant and has rightly commented on the different

stances taken by the appellant at the trial. Commenting that it was not

unusual for a professional outfit like the PNB to work continuously due to the

exigencies of work, it was the position of the learned DSG that the version of

events as narrated by the witnesses are highly probable given the facts and the

circumstances. Arguing that the learned High Court Judge has well considered

the stand taken by the appellant in order to find whether it had created a

doubt as to the case of the prosecution before finding the appellant guilty for

the charge of possession of Heroin, it was the contention of the learned DSG

that the judgment need no interference by this Court.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

In view of the submissions made by the parties, all the grounds of appeal will

be considered together as they are interrelated.

It is the settled law that a trial Court has to be extra careful in analyzing the

evidence of trained police officers who engages in specialized duties in order to

find out whether such evidence is credible and trustworthy, although such

evidence has the same value as any other evidence.

In this action, the PW-01 has commenced his evidence giving the impression to

the Court that as an officer of the PNB he reported to work at 8.00 a.m. in the

morning as his normal practice and left for the raid where the appellant was

arrested at 6.30 p.m. on the 2nd of April 2013.

However, under cross-examination, it has been revealed that in fact, it was not

so. He had admitted that he and the same team of officers conducted two other

Page 8 of 11

raids during the day before the arrest of the appellant in the raid relevant to

this case. It has been revealed that the same team of officers led by PW-01 has

left the PNB at 11.00 a.m. for the first raid for the day and had arrested a

person called Dharmasiri with 500 grams of Heroin in his possession. When

suggested that it was not probable for a same team of officers to conduct raids

in that manner, the PW-01 has come out that in fact he and his team of same

officers returned to the PNB only at 10.35 a.m., after leaving at 10.40 a.m. on

the previous day, after an unsuccessful raid. Although this fact has been

revealed by the witness to show that there can be several raids in a day, this

also reveals that the team has left the PNB only 25 minutes from their return to

the Bureau, after been out on duty for 24 hours.

Although it may be possible for a dedicated team of specially trained officers to

work in this manner as argued correctly by the learned DSG, in my view, what

needs to be considered is whether it may be the truth or any other assumption

also possible given the facts and the circumstances of the case, after giving

consideration to the totality of the evidence.

In that context, I find it was rather strange for the PW-01 to say that he

reported to duty at 8.00 a.m. on the day of the incident, which was not correct

according to his own evidence. I find it questionable as to why the PW-01 did

not take steps to search the house of Dharmasiri when he was found with 500

grams of Heroin as it was the normal practice of the PNB to investigate further

when a person is found with such a quantity of Heroin. I am of the view that

there was a duty by the witness to explain as to why he did not follow the

normal practice on this occasion. I find that the prosecution cannot get away

from their responsibility of eliminating this type of reasonable doubts, as the

defence of the appellant was that part of the Heroin found in the possession of

Dharmasiri was introduced to him after getting him down to the house of

Dharmasiri.

In the case of Karunadasa Vs. Officer-in-Charge, Motor Traffic Division,

Police Station Nittambuwa (1887) 1 SLR 155 it was stated by Perera, J. that;

It is an imperative requirement in a criminal case that the prosecution

must be convincing, no matter how weak the defence is, before the Court is

entitled to convict on it. It is necessary to borne in mind that the general

rule is that the burden is on the prosecution, to prove the guilt of the

accused. The prosecution must prove their case apart from any statement

made by the accused or any evidence tendered by him. The weakness of

the defence must not be allowed to bolster up a weak case for the

prosecution. The rule is based on the principle that every man is presumed

to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and criminality is never to be

presumed.

One of the main reasons why the learned High Court Judge has concluded that

the appellants version of events has no credibility was that he has taken

different stands when the two main witnesses gave evidence. It had been

concluded that the position taken up by the appellant when PW-04 gave

evidence as it appears in page 179 of the appeal brief was that

;

The learned High Court Judge has interpreted the said potion of evidence

recorded to conclude that it was the stand of the appellant that he was arrested

at his home and not in the way the witnesses claimed and it was contrary to

the stand taken by the appellant when PW-01 gave evidence. However, I find

that if considered in its totality rather than compartmentalizing the evidence, it

is clear that it was the same stand taken by the appellant throughout the trial.

This becomes so clear if one look at the way the learned State Counsel who

prosecuted before the High Court has re-examined PW-04, which reads as

follows;

Page 10 of 11

2013.04.02

? (page 192

of the appeal brief)

It was held in the case of Don Samantha Jude Anthony Jayamaha Vs. The

Attorney General, C.A. 303/2006 decided on 11-07-2012 that;

Whether the evidence of the defence or the dock statement is sufficient

to create a doubt cannot be decided in a vacuum or in isolation because it

needs to be considered in the totality of evidence that is in the light of the

evidence for the prosecution as well as the defence.

I find that the above conclusion of the learned High Court Judge was a

misdirection as to the evidence as rightly pointed out by the learned Counsel

for the prosecution. I am also unable to agree with the finding that it was not

probable for the earlier mentioned Dharmasiri to have a reason to call the

appellant. I am of the view that it is quite possible for a fishmonger to borrow

money from others to carry out his vocation given the facts and the

circumstances. Although it may not be very material under normal

circumstances, I find that the PW-01s claim that it was his habit to record that

he searched the officers who take part in a raid of this nature in his detailed

notes rather than in his out entry, too, as relevant under the context of whose

version of events are more probable.

Basnayake, J. stated in the case of Alim Vs. Wijesinghe 38 CLW 95 that

where the same facts are capable of an inference in favour of the accused and

also of an inference against him, the inference consistent with is innocence

should be preferred. (See- The Law of Evidence Volume II (Book I) by

E.R.S.R.Coomaraswamy at page 297)

Page 11 of 11

At this juncture I am also reminded of the legal maxim known as Blackstones

Formulation which says that It is better that ten guilty persons should escape

than one innocent suffer, which is based on the essential principle of our

criminal law that a criminal charge has to be established beyond reasonable

doubt.

(See- Glanville Williams, Proof of Guilt, 3rd Edition, 186-190)

It is my considered view that if considered in the correct perspective, there was

sufficient basis for the Court to conclude that the appellant has created a

reasonable doubt with regard to the evidence adduced by the prosecution

which should have been considered in favour of him.

For the reasons as stated above, I am unable to agree with the reasoning for

the finding of the appellant guilty for the possession of Heroin by the learned

High Court Judge. I am of the view that it was not safe to convict the appellant

given the infirmities of the evidence of the prosecution.

Accordingly, I set aside the conviction and the sentence dated 26-04-2018, as it

cannot be allowed to stand, and acquit the appellant of the charge for which he

was found guilty.

Appeal allowed.
