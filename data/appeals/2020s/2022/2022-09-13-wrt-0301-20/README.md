B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Petitioner, by Petition dated 26th August 2020, invoking the writ jurisdiction

of this Court in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution, seeks, inter alia, a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision contained in P1 and P2, a Writ of Mandamus directing

the 1st to 3rd Respondents to hold a fresh inquiry in compliance with the Land

Development Ordinance No. 19 of 1935, as amended, and a Writ of Mandamus directing

the Respondents to grant permit to the Petitioner under the Land Development

Ordinance. This order pertains to whether notice ought to be issued to the Respondents.

The matter was supported on 09th June 2022 and thereafter both parties filed their

written submissions.

The background as narrated in the Petition is as follows.

The land in question (Nambarawatta Grant/Permit No. L.L. 58990) which is

situated in the village of Nambarawatta- Divithura in the District of Galle was granted

pursuant to Section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance to the late Wijesekera

Gunawardhana Gurusinghe Arachchi Tuder, the Petitioners father-in-law (The husband

of the 4th Respondent). The Petitioners father-in-law died leaving his widow (the 4th

Respondent) and his four children: the Petitioners husband, the 5th Respondent, the 6th

Respondent, and one Anil Indrajith, who died leaving his heir the 7th Respondent.

Following his fathers demise on 20th February 2001, in the absence of the father

nominating a successor, the Petitioners husband, being the eldest son, together with the

Petitioner and their son (the 8th Respondent), entered possession of the land and resided

in it.

On the demise of the Petitioners husband on 13th September 2012, the 4th

Respondent (the Petitioners mother-in-law) disputed the Petitioners continued

possession of the land. This dispute was referred to the District Secretary and later

referred to the 2nd Respondent, who then referred it to the Committee of Petitions. The

Petitioner was unable to attend the inquiry as her son suddenly fell ill. The Committee

decided to grant title to the 4th Respondent and successive title to the surviving children

Page 4 of 9

and grandchildren of the late Wijesekera Gunawardhana Gurusinghe Arachchi Tuder.

The Petitioner unsuccessfully objected to the decision of the Committee. The Committee

recommended to the 3rd Respondent, for the land to be divided amongst the 4th to 8th

Respondents. The relevant part of the letter (dated 24th February 2016) marked P1 reads

as follows:

2015.10.12

/3/2/89 2015.11.06 .

wd{d 2015.10.20

..

ldhd,fha .

.

I. ... . - 1/2

II. .... - 3/4

III. ... . - 1/2

IV. . . . -

The Petitioner contends that the 4th Respondent, who did not take possession of

the land within six months of the death of the original grant holder as per Section 68 of

the Land Development Ordinance, is now not entitled to claim possession, and nominate

successive heirs. The Petitioner claims that she should be entitled to succeed to the land

on the demise of her husband (the eldest son of her father-in-law) and not the 4th

Respondent.

Further, the Petitioner contends that the decision of the Committee was made

under the incorrect assumption that the Petitioner too had participated in the inquiry.

As a result, she contends that the decision of the Committee to grant title in

contravention of Sections 48A and 68 of the Land Development Ordinance and that too

without a proper hearing to the Petitioner is ultra vires, arbitrary, capricious, and

violative of the principles of natural justice.

On this basis, the Petitioner now seeks a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision

of the Committee, a Writ of Mandamus to compel the Committee to undertake a fresh

Page 5 of 9

inquiry to ascertain the persons entitled to succeed to the land in question, and a Writ of

Mandamus compelling the Respondents to grant a permit to the Petitioner.

Succession under the Land Development Ordinance is different from the general

law on succession. This is made clear by Section 170 of the Land Development Ordinance

which provides that no written law, other than this Ordinance, which provides for

succession to land upon an intestacy shall apply to any land alienated under the Land

Development Ordinance (Dharmalatha v. David De Silva [1995] 1 SLR 259).

On the death of the original grant holder, the spouse of the grant holder is entitled

to succeed to the land. If the spouse of the original grant holder dies or fails to succeed to

the land, it is only then that a nominated successor can succeed to the land. This position

was clearly established by his Lordship Malalgoda J. in Kalander Asiya Umma v.

Mohideen Bawa Abdul Cassim, SC Appeal 48/2013 decided on 04.09.2019. Having set out

Sections 48A(1) and 49 his Lordship held:

In the said circumstances it is clear, that according to the above provisions of the

Land Development Ordinance, a nominated person can only succeed to a land to which he

is lawfully nominated, is either after the death of the spouse or when the said spouse

failed to succeed to the said property. When going through the above provisions it is

further observed that the nominee is not entitled by law to succeed to a property until the

death (or failure to succeed to the land) of the spouse of the original permit holder. In

other words he becomes entitled by law to succeed to the property only after the death (or

failure to succeed) of the spouse of the original permit holder.

In the instant case, assuming that the 4th Respondent has failed to take possession

of the land within a period of six months from the date of the grant-holders death (as per

Section 68) it is only then that the nominated successor can succeed to the land.

However, in the instant case, in the absence of a nomination of a successor, it is

Section 72 that becomes applicable. Section 72 deals with succession upon the death of

the life-holder, in the absence of nominating a successor. The title to the land is to devolve

as per Rule 1 in Schedule 3 to the Ordinance, wherein male relatives are preferred over

female relatives, and the older relation is preferred to the younger in the order of

succession. This Section set out for the purpose of convenience reads:

Page 6 of 9

If no successor has been nominated, or if the nominated successor fails to succeed,

or if the nomination of a successor contravenes the provisions of this Ordinance, the title

to the land alienated on a permit to a permit-holder who at the time of his or her death

was paying an annual sum by virtue of the provisions of subsection (3) of section 19A or

to the holding of an owner shall, upon the death of such permit-holder or owner without

leaving behind his or her spouse, or, where such permit-holder or owner died leaving

behind his or her spouse, upon the failure of such spouse to succeed to that land or holding,

or upon the death of such spouse, devolve as prescribed in rule 1 of the Third Schedule.

Rule 1 of the Third Schedule provides as follows:

(a) The groups of relatives from which a successor may be nominated for the purposes of

Section 51 shall be as set out in the subjoined table.

(b) Title to a holding for the purposes of Section 72 shall devolve on one only of the

relatives of the permit-holder or owner in the order of priority in which they are

respectively mentioned in the subjoined table, the older being preferred to the younger

where there are more relatives than one in any group.

Table

(i)Sons (vii)Brothers

(ii)Daughters (viii)Sisters

(iii)Grandsons (ix)Uncles

(iv)Granddaughters (x)Aunts

(v)Father (xi) Nephews

(vi)Mother (xii) Nieces

In this rule, relative " means a relative by blood and not by marriage.

This position is further solidified by Section 51 of the Land Development

Ordinance which provides:

No person shall be nominated by the owner of a holding or a permit-holder as his

successor unless that person is the spouse of such owner or permit-holder or belongs to

one of the groups of relatives enumerated in rule 1 of the Third Schedule.

Page 7 of 9

In the instant case, the Petitioner does not fall within any of the categories of relatives

provided in Rule 1 of Schedule Three as she is the daughter-in-law of the original grant-

holder. She would thus have no legal right in terms of the Ordinance to claim a permit for

the said land. For the Petitioner to claim, her late husband after the demise of his father

should have claimed to be the Successor. However, for some reason, he neglected/failed to

exercise his rights.

In order to claim a Writ of Mandamus, which is, to use the words of Wade & Forsyth,

a weapon in the hands of the ordinary citizen, when a public authority fails to do its duty by

him, there are certain pre-requisites that the party applying for it ought to satisfy. In the

case of Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs Jafferjee and Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd

[2005] 1 SLR 89 his Lordship J.A.N. De Silva, J. (as he then was), with their Lordships S.N.

Silva C.J. and Weerasuriya J. agreeing, set out these prerequisites as follows:

There is rich and profuse case law on Mandamus on the conditions to be satisfied by the

Applicant. Some of the conditions precedent the issue of Mandamus appear to be:

(a) The Applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal duty by the parties

against whom the Mandamus is sought (R v Barnstaple Justices). The foundation of

Mandamus is the existence of a legal right (Napier Ex Parte)

(b) The right to be enforced must be a Public Right and the duty sought to be enforced

must be of a public nature.

(c) The legal right to compel must reside in the Applicant himself (R v Lewisham Union)

(d) The application must be made in good faith and not for an indirect purpose

(e) The application must be preceded by a distinct demand for the performance of the duty

(f) The person or body to whom the writ is directed must be subject to the jurisdiction of

the court issuing the writ

(g) The Court will as a general rule and in the exercise of its discretion refuse writ of

Mandamus when there is another special remedy available which is not less convenient,

beneficial and effective.

(h) The conduct of the Applicant may disentitle him to the remedy.

(i) It would not be issued if the writ would be futile in its result.

Page 8 of 9

(j) Writ will not be issued where the Respondent has no power to perform the act sought

to be mandated.

The above principles governing the issue of a writ of Mandamus were also discussed at

length in P.K. Benarji v H.J. Simonds. Whether the facts show the existence of any or all

pre-requisites to the granting of the writ is a question of law in each case to be decided not in

any rigid or technical view of the question, but according to a sound and reasonable

interpretation. The court will not grant a Mandamus to enforce a right not of a legal but of a

purely equitable nature however extreme the inconvenience to which the applicant might be

put. [emphasis added]

The conditions set out in this judgment have been referred to and those which were

relevant to the respective case have been analysed in Arulanathan v. D M Jayaratne 2008

BLR 264, Mohamed Sali Nazeera Begam & Others v. Vladimir Mikhaylov C.A. Writ

Application No. 13/2012 decided on 19.01.2012, H.M.P.G. Ranasinghe Bandara v. W.M.P.K.

Weerasekara & Others, CA/PHC/55/2016 decided on 16.11.2020, Lincoln Property Holdings

(Private Limited) v. Condominium Management Authority & Others, C.A. (Writ) Application

No. 577/07 decided on 14.10.2021.

Craig in, Administrative Law 8th Edition (at p. 801) notes that for Mandamus to apply

there must be a public duty owed to the applicant. This, he says, involves two distinct

requirements: first, the duty must be of a public as opposed to a private character, and second,

even if the duty is of a public character it must be owed to an individual.

In the instant case, as the Petitioner has no legal right to compel the Respondents to hold

a fresh inquiry and grant a permit to her the Writ of Mandamus will not lie.

Similarly, the Petitioner will not be able to obtain a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

decisions contained in P1 and P2 as she lacks locus standi.

It should be noted that quashing the decisions contained in P1 and P2 will only be

detrimental to the Petitioner as by those decisions her son (the 8th Respondent) has been

allocated a share of the land. If not, she would not be entitled to any share of the land.

For the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that this application must be dismissed

without costs.
