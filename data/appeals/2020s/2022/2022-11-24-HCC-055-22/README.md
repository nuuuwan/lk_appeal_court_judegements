The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for

committing sexual harassment of Jeong Eun Hui by removing her

undergarments, on or about the 17th of October 1998, within the Dalseo

Police precinct of the Daegu province of the Republic of Korea, an

offence punishable under Section 345 of the Penal Code.

According to the charge, the crime has been committed in Korea. This

case was heard in the High Court of Colombo, Sri Lanka on the

directions given by the Honourable Chief Justice in terms of section

9(2)(b) of the Judicature Act. The indictment was filed 20 years after the

incident.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions were filed only on behalf of

the appellant. At the hearing, the learned Deputy Solicitor General for

the complainant-appellant and the learned Presidents Counsel for the

accused-respondent made oral submissions.

The prosecution presented the following evidence in the High Court

trial:

Jeong Eun Hui was a university student at Keimyung University. She

was last seen leaving the university premises around 10.30 p.m. on

16.10.1998. Thereafter, her body was found on the Guma Expressway

about 300 meters away from the Namdaegu interchange, on the lane

running from Daegu to Masan, in the early morning of 17.10.1998. She

died as a result of a motor traffic accident that occurred on the

expressway that caused a rapture of the brain. Her body was clothed at

the time it was found; however, her undergarments were not found on

the body. Underpants with a sanitary pad and a girdle were found on

the expressway on the same day about 100 meters away from the place

of the accident. DNA analysis confirmed that the blood on the sanitary

pad attached to the underpants matched with the Jeong Eun Hui.

Further, the analysis also confirmed the presence of semen on the

underpants and the girdle. DNA analysis established that the semen

belongs to the accused- respondent.

As the victim died as a result of this unfortunate motor traffic accident,

she could not give evidence in the High Court trial. There were no

eyewitnesses to this incident. Therefore, there was no other evidence to

connect the respondent to this incident except the DNA evidence found

in the undergarment of the victim.

Considering the aforesaid circumstances, the learned High Court Judge

acquitted the accused-appellant after the prosecution case,

4

acting in terms of Section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

(CCPA). It is against that acquittal that the Honourable Attorney

General preferred this appeal.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the appellant based his

arguments on the ground that the learned trial judge had

misinterpreted the scope and application of section 200(1) of the CCPA.

The learned DSG contended, citing the decision of Attorney General V.

Baranage, that the learned trial Judge should have called for defence

because a reasonable inference could be drawn from the proven facts

that the respondent committed sexual harassment to the victim by

using criminal force. He contended that acquitting the respondent

without calling the defence is an erroneous order. The substance of his

argument was that the victims subsequent acts of climbing a high

ground and entering the expressway with undergarments in hand infers

that the respondent had used criminal force on her during the sexual

act done a short while ago. Furthermore, he contended that the

presence of semen on her underwear proves that the respondent

engaged in a sexual act with her. Taking all these items of evidence

together, the learned DSG contended that the offence of sexual

harassment in terms of section 345 of the Penal Code has been

constituted. While admitting that there is a possibility of drawing some

other inferences, the learned DSG argued that the learned High Court

Judge should have called for defence because the inference of guilt to

the charge specified in the indictment could also be inferred from this

evidence.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the respondent contended in reply

that the respondent was indicted for committing sexual harassment by

removing the undergarments of Jeong Eun Hui, however, there is no

evidence whatsoever that the respondent removed her undergarments.

The learned DSG stated in his submissions that she

5

had worn jeans without undergarments at the time her body was found.

The learned Presidents Counsel contended that her undergarments

could not be removed without removing the jeans she wore. In addition,

the learned Presidents Counsel raised an issue as to how the

respondents semen came to her underpants if he had removed her

underpants and committed a sexual act.

In the case of The Attorney General V. Baranage (2003) 1 Sri L.R. 340,

the relevant portion pertaining to the argument advanced by the

learned DSG appears as follows:

In a trial by a judge without a jury, the judge is the trier of facts and as

such at the end of the prosecution case in order to decide whether he

should call upon the accused for his defence, he is entitled to consider

such matters as the credibility of the witnesses, the probability of the

prosecution case, the weight of evidence and the reasonable inferences

to be drawn from the proven facts.

The contention of the learned DSG was that on the proven facts of the

case, a reasonable inference could be drawn that the appellant used

criminal force and sexually harassed her. The position taken up by the

learned DSG was that after the sexual harassment, she ran away to the

expressway with her underpants in hand and that is why her

underpants was found on the expressway about 100 meters away from

the place of the accident.

At the stage of deciding whether the accused should be called upon for

his defence, it is not necessary to consider whether there is evidence to

prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. However, at the very least,

there must be some evidence on each element of the offence to call the

defence, because an offence would not be constituted if there is no

evidence of one of the basic elements required to prove the charge.

6

The burden of the prosecution to prove the lack of consent in a rape

case has been discussed in Sunil and Another V. The Attorney General

- (1986) 1 Sri L.R. 230 as follows:

The burden of proving absence of consent on the part of the complainant

where the charge is one of rape or abduction is always on the prosecution

and never shifts.

It was also stated in the said judgment that I find that the learned trial

Judge has taken pains to exhort the jury adequately that the burden of

proving the case, particularly, the ingredient of absence of consent on the

part of the complainant, was on prosecution and the prosecution alone,

and that this burden never shifted to the accused.

Hence, it is apparent even in proving other sexual offences, the accused

has no burden to establish consent. The prosecution should prove the

lack of consent beyond reasonable doubt. According to section 345 of

the Penal Code, assault or use of criminal force is the central element

in establishing the offence of sexual harassment. Without establishing

the said element, the offence of sexual harassment under Section 345

of the Penal Code could not be established because having some sort of

sexual act with consent, between a woman and a man over the age of

18 is not an offence, except for the offensive sexual acts such as

unnatural sex, incest, and other offensive sexual acts described in the

Penal Code.

According to the charge, the respondent committed sexual harassment

by removing her undergarments. Hence, two main elements necessary

to establish the charge are:

1. The respondent removed her undergarments.

2. The respondent removed undergarments by using criminal force.

7

There was no evidence whatsoever that the respondent removed her

undergarments. Also, there is no proven fact to draw a reasonable

inference that the respondent removed her undergarments. So, there is

no evidence whatsoever to establish the first element. In the absence of

evidence that the respondent did the act described in the charge, the

question of whether the act was done by using criminal force does not

arise.

Be that as it may, it is apparent that the act described in the charge

was not the act that caused the semen to be on her underpants,

because having the respondents semen in her underpants does not

infer in any manner that the respondent removed her underpants. If

the respondent had removed her underpants as described in the charge

and engaged in some other sexual act, a question arises as to how the

semen got into her underpants, which he had taken off. Having semen

on her underpants infer the possibility of doing a sexual act without

removing her underpants if he did any. This is a possible assumption.

Assumptions have no relevance in dealing with criminal charges. In

fact, the reason for assuming this possibility in this case is to show that

the finding of her underwear on the expressway containing his semen

does not raise a reasonable inference that the respondent committed

the offence described in the charge, and under the above

circumstances, it is more possible to infer that he did not remove her

undergarments.

Anyhow, her subsequent act of rushing to the expressway with the

underpants that contained the semen of the respondent in her hand,

does not infer in any manner that the respondent removed her

underpants by using criminal force. In the circumstances, it is apparent

that there is no evidence that the respondent removed her

undergarments and there is no evidence that the respondent used

criminal force in removing her undergarments. In the absence of

8

evidence to establish the main ingredients of the offence, the

prosecution has failed to establish the commission of the offence

described in the indictment.

In the case of Harold Rex Jansen V. Hon. Attorney General C.A.

Application No 151/13, decided on 26.02.2014 it was held that a High

Court Judge is empowered to acquit an accused under section 200(1)

when the evidence fails to establish the commission of the offence.

The necessity for the accused to give an explanation arises only if the

prosecution establishes the commission of the offence specified in the

indictment. As explained previously, the prosecution in this case failed

to adduce any evidence that the accused-respondent committed the

offensive sexual act described in the charge. Also, the prosecution failed

to adduce any evidence regarding an assault or any criminal force used

by the respondent. In the absence of evidence regarding the aforesaid

elements of the charge, the commission of the offence set out in the

indictment has not been established. Accordingly, the respondent in the

instant action is entitled to be acquitted without the defence being

called, as the accused-respondent had no case to meet.

It is to be noted at this juncture that the learned High Court Judge in

his order has gone beyond the required limits in observing the

possibility of involvement of someone other than the accused in this

incident. I do not agree with some of his findings. However, for the

reasons stated in this judgment, I hold that the conclusion of the

learned High Court Judge to acquit the accused-respondent without

calling the defence is correct.

Accordingly, I find no reason to interfere with the order dated

10.12.2021.

The appeal is dismissed.
