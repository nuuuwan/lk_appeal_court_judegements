According to the submissions made by the Representatives of the Appellant and the Representatives of the Respondent, the Mabey & Johnson paid 6% of the commission based on the value of bridge products imported by the Ministry of Highways and the Road Development Authority. The Appellant has received a commission as the agent of the contractor in introducing its business and promoting the project between the contractor and the Ministry of Highways and the Road Development Authority. In this regard, we further draw our attention to the interview notes dated 07.12.2012. According to above notes which were submitted by the Respondent as R8, the Appellant had acted as an indenting agent for Mabey & Johnson Ltd. The Appellant has not rendered any service to the Mabey & Johnson Ltd, UK and the Appellant has acted as an intermediator between the contractor, Mabey & Johnson and the Ministry of Highways and Road Development Authority. The Appellant Company received the commission only as a result of the goods purchased by the Government Ministry. The Appellants work cannot be considered as a service. Therefore, the Appellant is not entitled to claim tax concession in terms of section 13 (dddd).",
