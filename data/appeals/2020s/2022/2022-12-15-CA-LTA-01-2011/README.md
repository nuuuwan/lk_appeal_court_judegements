B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Accused-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was indicted in

the High Court of Colombo under Section 286A(1)(C) of the Penal Code as amended by

Act No. 22 of 1995. The charge as set out in the indictment reads:

.

That is, during the time period between the 31st of March 2002 and the 11th of August

2002, the Accused committed the offence of being in possession of and distributing through

Page 3 of 19

a website of the internet indecent photographs of children, an offence punishable under

Section 286A(1)(C) of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 22 of 1995.

The indictment was served on the 4th of June 2007 and the trial commenced on the 2nd

of October 2007. After trial, the Accused was acquitted by the learned High Court Judge

by judgment dated 28th January 2011. Aggrieved by this judgment, the Honourable

Attorney General filed this appeal seeking leave to appeal and to set aside the acquittal.

Leave was granted on 9th December 2011.

The facts pertaining to this case, albeit briefly, are as follows;

A post/advertisement on a lewd website on 31st March 2002 seeking young boys

between 14-20 for sex and hot relationship resulted in the commencement of an

investigation by the National Child Protection Authority (hereinafter referred to as the

NCPA). According to the evidence of one Mrs. Chandima Sanjeewani, the Internet

Protection Programme Computer Operator of the NCPA at that time (PW9), she, on the

instructions of the Chairman of the NCPA, replied to that post/advertisement on the

website itself using the pseudonym Shane, a fictitious 15-year-old boy. The Accused had

responded to that reply and had given an email address (kevinw@37.com) to contact him

on. She had corresponded with him using the email address shane86lk@yahoo.com.

There was a series of emails back and forth. She explained that her task was

corresponding with the Accused via email. In one such correspondence, the Accused had

provided two telephone numbers (908165 and 908164) to contact him during the day

and to ask for Kamal when calling those numbers. The Accused had sent several

pornographic images of children in those emails.

Subsequently, the NCPA assigned one Duminda Perera (PW1), a Computer Operator

of the NCPA, to lend his voice to and to bring this fictitious character Shane to life by

playing the role of a decoy. He had been given a file or docket of the printouts of all the

correspondences, including the pornographic images. After being given the Accuseds

number, as aforesaid, PW1 called him, disguising his voice as that of a teenager. They

spoke over the telephone on a few occasions. In the last of such calls, they agreed to meet

at the Kelaniya University, where the Accused was employed as the Senior Assistant

Registrar. They agreed on the date, time, place, and description of the clothes that each

would wear as well. As discussed, they met on the 11th of August 2001, a Sunday, at

around 3 pm. Participating in this sting operation were, among others, Chief Inspector

Thomson Wijesena - the Officer in Charge of the Special Police Investigation Unit of the

Page 4 of 19

NCPA (PW3), Dimuthu Prasad Galappaththi- an Investigating Officer of the NCPA

(PW2), Channa Nishantha Soysa a Computer Data Entry Operator/ Recorder of the NCPA

(PW5), an Investigating Officer (one Priyantha) and a few officers from the Peliyagoda

Police Station. PW1 carried a small bag with a video camera that was carefully hidden in

the bag in a manner that would not be visible to anyone, but capable of capturing the saga

as it unfolded.

PW1, who described himself to be in an anxious state of mind as this was his first sting

operation, initially whizzed past the Accused who was standing at an entrance where they

were supposed to meet, dressed in the clothes he had said he would be clad in. When PW1

arrived back at the place they were supposed to meet, where the Accused was standing,

the Accused said to him (roughly translated: [you] went full speed,

right). The Accused then invited him into his office and was arrested when they were

making their way to his office.

At the trial, the Prosecution led the evidence of the twelve witnesses. P21 to P27, PX,

and PY were the documents and productions that were marked by the Prosecution. After

the Prosecution closed its case, the Accused made a dock statement and led the evidence

of two witnesses. The learned High Court Judge acquitted the Accused by judgment dated

28th January 2011 (page 782 of the proceedings).

The grounds of appeal urged by the Honourable Attorney General are, reproduced

verbatim, as follows:

1. The learned High Court Judge had erroneously come to the finding that the Prosecution

had failed to prove that the Accused had exclusive possession of the computer.

2. The learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the necessary inferences arising out

of:

a. the meeting of the accused and the decoy as pre-arranged over the telephone.

b. the communication between the Accused and the decoy via emails, where the Accused

refers to himself as Kamal.

c. the communication between the Accused and the decoy via telephone, where the

Accused provides a description of himself to the decoy.

d. The conduct of the Accused upon meeting the decoy, whom the Accused claims to have

never encountered before.

It must be kept in mind that a cardinal rule of a criminal trial is that the prosecution

must prove the charges levelled against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. If this

Page 5 of 19

standard is not met, a court of law cannot and must not convict, or affirm the conviction

of, the Accused no matter how vile the crime alleged to have been committed. This

standard, although originating in the adversarial system of criminal justice, is enshrined

as a fundamental right in Article 13(5) of our Constitution as well. Recently, his Lordship

Yasantha Kodagoda PC J. in Officer-in-Charge Special Crimes Division v. Mananage

Sunil Dharmapala SC Appeal No. 155/14 decided on 28.06.2021, in an enlightening

discussion of the principle observed:

a reasonable doubt means a doubt in respect of which a valid reason can be attributed. For a

doubt to be recognised as amounting to a reasonable doubt, the ground for the development of

the doubt must be objective and reason based. There should be a logical basis for the entertaining

of the doubt. That is the distinction between a mere doubt and a reasonable doubt. [emphasis

added]

Bearing this in mind, we now venture into the task of determining whether the

Prosecution has successfully met this threshold for conviction.

The contents of the photographs

Section 286A(1)(c) reads:

Any person who-

(i) takes, or assists in taking of any indecent photograph of a child; or

(ii) distributes or shows any such photograph or any publication containing such

photograph;

(iii) has in his possession for distribution or showing, any such photograph or publication;

(iv) publishes or causes to be published, any such photograph or publishes or causes to be

published, any advertisement capable of conveying the message that the advertiser or

person named in the advertisement distributes or shows any such photograph or

publication or intends to do so,

commits the offence of obscene publication and exhibition relating to children and shall on

conviction be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term not less than two

years and not exceeding ten years and may also be punished with fine. [emphasis added]

The fact in issue that must be proved, in addition to whether the photograph is

indecent (which is not dealt with in this judgment as there appears to be no dispute on

this aspect), in order for this Section to be applicable is whether the indecent photograph

depicts a child. A child means a person under the age of eighteen years. (Section 286A

(4)). If the pictures depicted were that of adults, this Section would be inapplicable.

Page 6 of 19

As our jurisprudence has not dealt with the issue of proving or ascertaining the

age of the person depicted in the indecent material it will be of use to assess the approach

taken in foreign jurisdictions.

In the United Kingdom, the case of R v. Land [1998] 1 All ER 403, dealt with a

conviction for possessing indecent photographs of a child contrary to Section 1(1)(C) of the

Protection of Children Act 1978. There was no direct evidence about the identity or ages

of any of the persons in the videos. The Appellant argued, on appeal, that expert paediatric

evidence should have been called before the jury. The Court of Appeal, dismissing the

appeal, observed that Section 2(3) of the Act which provides that for the purpose of the

Act a person is taken as having been a child at any material time if it appears from the

evidence as a whole that he was then under the age of 16 underscores the difficulty of

making a positive identification of an unknown person depicted in a photograph and

therefore the age of such person is a question of fact based on inference without any need

for formal proof. The relevant portion of the judgment is worth quoting:

The judge directed the jury that in deciding whether it was proved that the photographs

were of a child:

You can do no more than use your own experience, your judgment and your critical

faculties in deciding this issue. It is simply an issue of fact for you, the jury, to decide what you

have seen with your own eyes

In our judgment this direction is not open to question. In any event such expert evidence

tendered by either side would be inadmissible. The purpose of expert evidence is to assist the court

with information which is outside the normal experience and knowledge of the judge or jury.

Perhaps the only certainty which applies to the problem in this case is that each individual reaches

puberty in his or her own time. For each the process is unique and the jury is as well placed as an

expert to assess any argument addressed to the question whether the prosecution has established,

as it must before there can be a conviction, that the person depicted in the photograph is under 16

years. [emphasis added]

However, there is doubt whether the approach taken in this case is too broad-

brush. For instance, in Griffiths (Procurator Fiscal, Perth) v. Neil Macdonald Hart [2005]

HCJAC 51, Lord Osborne, who delivered the opinion of the High Court of Justiciary in

Scotland, having cited the last paragraph quoted above observed:

We must respectfully disagree with that view. In our opinion, while there may be cases in

which proof of the essential facts in question may be achieved without reference to an expert

witness or witnesses, in other kinds of case, where the subject of the image may be approaching

Page 7 of 19

the age of 16, there may be very considerable difficulty for the fact-finding tribunal in that regard.

In such cases, the evidence of one or more expert witnesses may well be necessary in practice to

enable the Crown to prove that the subject of an image is under 16 years of age.

However, in a recent judgment of the High Court of Justiciary, John Leadbetter v.

Her Majestys Advocate [2020] HCJAC 51 it was held that there was no need for expert

evidence, that is to say a skilled witness, to prove that a photograph depicts a child. It

found:

There may be cases on the margins in which little weight may be put on a persons

testimony that a person was a child rather than an adult; a child being a person under 18 in this

context (Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 ss 52(2) and 52A(4)). In such cases, the evidence of

a paediatrician may be advisable, if other sources, such as a birth certificate or the persons parents

or other relatives, are not available. That is not to say that an adult witness, with a normal degree

of experience of life, cannot express a view on whether a person, whether shown in a photograph

or otherwise, is a child, especially if the person is naked. This is consistent with Griffiths v Hart

2005 SCCR 392, Lord Osborne, delivering the opinion of the court at para [15] citing R v Land

[1999] QB 65, Judge LJ at 70-71.

Once it is accepted, as it was in Griffiths, that the evidence of police officers was admissible

to corroborate the evidence of a paediatric endocrinologist as to the age of girls shown in

photographs, that evidence must be regarded as admissible as proof that the photographs depicted

children.

Whether a person appears to be a child is not a matter which requires technical or scientific

evidence. Identifying a person as a child is part of everyday life. It is something within common

knowledge and experience. A person is entitled to give evidence of his or her impression of whether

someone is a child and, if so, within what age range. In light of all the evidence, the fact finder

then has to decide whether it appears from the evidence as a whole that the person was under

eighteen (1982 Act s 52(2)). This would, in any event, be something which a sheriff or a jury could

do themselves by looking at the images, were that the evidential course taken.

Despite this dictum, it must be noted that in Leadbetters case the pictures were

relatively straightforward, meaning that it was easily identifiable that the persons

depicted were children since all the children were below 14 years of age. Further,

Detective James McGoldrick had been trained in categorising indecent images of children:

he did have special training in identifying whether someone was a child. Despite what

was said in submissions both to the sheriff and to this court, he said both in chief and

especially in cross that his Home Office training included being able to identify someone

as a child.

Page 8 of 19

In the United States, jurisprudence is of mixed opinion. The position can be

summarised in the following passage quoted from the judgment of the United States Court

of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Katz 178 F.3d 368 (1999):

The threshold question whether the age of a model in a child pornography

prosecution can be determined by a lay jury without the assistance of expert testimony must

be determined on a case by case basis. As the government correctly points out, it is sometimes

possible for the fact finder to decide the issue of age in a child pornography case without hearing

any expert testimony. See United States v. OMalley, 854 F.2d 1085 (8th Cir.l988) . However,

in other cases, the parties have been allowed to present conflicting expert testimony. See United

States v. Anderton, 136 F.3d 747, 750 (11th Cir.l998) In yet other cases, one party presents

expert testimony, while the other does not. See United States v. Broyles, 37 F.3d 1314, 1316

(8th Cir.l994)(Government presented the expert testimony of a paediatric endocrinologist and

Broyles presented no evidence.) A case by case analysis will encounter some images in which

the models are prepubescent children who are so obviously less than 18 years old that expert

testimony is not necessary or helpful to the fact finder. On the other hand, some cases will be

based on images of models of sufficient maturity that there is no need for expert testimony.

However, in this case, in which the government must prove that a model, who is post-puberty

but appears quite young, is less than eighteen years old, expert testimony may well be necessary

to assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. Fed.R.Evid.

702.

Citing this passage with approval, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania in

Commonwealth v. Robertson- Dewar 829 A.2d 1207 (2003) observed the flexibility

inherent in the law was due to the following concern:

Given the anonymity of the internet, the identity of children depicted and their

whereabouts are frequently unknown. Thus, conventional means of proving age such as birth

certificates or testimony of a relative are usually unavailable. To require law enforcement

officials to track down and identify the children depicted in order to successfully prosecute a

child pornography case would rip the teeth out of the child pornography statute and destroy its

efficacy as a preventive measure in the sexual exploitation of children. Therefore, the legislature

has vested the trier of fact with the function of determining the age of the child depicted and

further allows for this element to be sufficiently established through competent expert

testimony in close cases.

There is academic scepticism about the correctness of the approach taken in Land

as well. Alisdair A. Gillespie in an article titled Child pornography (an article in

Information & Communications Technology Law, October 2017) notes that it appears

Page 9 of 19

strange that expert evidence is not required. This is considering the severity of the

punishment an accused must face if convicted. Further:

There does appear some evidence that lay persons are as good at identifying the age of

children as experts, although that was one study and did not involve the use of real children as

subjects. However, research suggests identifying age is complicated.

He reconciles that the rejection of expert evidence might be the laws way of

ensuring that the image is looked at through a lay-persons eyes and not the gaze of those

who are looking for evidence of childhood.

Jonathan Clough in Lawful Acts, Unlawful Images: The Problematic Definition of

Child Pornography ((2012) 38(3) Monash University Law Review 212 at 231)

commenting on Land notes:

This decision was made at a time when the relevant age in England and Wales was under

16. Whatever merit there may have been at that time, it may be doubted whether one could state,

with the confidence necessary in the context of a penal provision, that a glance will quickly show

whether the person depicted is under 18. Ascertaining the age of a person from a visual image is

notoriously unreliable. Apart from the variability in rates of sexual maturation due to biological,

personal and environmental factors, viewing an image in two dimensions does not allow for a full

inspection of features.

The literature available on estimating or ascertaining the age of a child or whether

in fact a person depicted is a child amply demonstrates that it is not a straightforward

question. The methodology used to make such an estimation, when the person depicted

is not known, needs to be addressed if cases of this type are to be successfully prosecuted.

Therefore, we will not attempt to generalise the method that has to be adopted in cases of

this nature, and instead leave it to be decided on the facts and circumstances of each case.

However, we must note that with the advent of technology newer issues such as whether

the images have been morphed or are depicting real children, which as per the literature,

can be done so seamlessly, that it may appear that the task of ascertaining or estimating

the age of the child depicted becomes more arduous. Whether our legislation can capture

within its fold the new advancements in technology will have to be seen as well. Therefore,

in reaching that right balance between the prosecution of such crimes and ensuring a fair

trial for the Accused, this Court must be cautious not to set the standard too high or too

low.

Page 10 of 19

Yet, what is evident in the cases discussed above and, in the literature, available

is the fact that the majority favours a cautious approach when ascertaining or estimating

the age of the person depicted in the photographs. In grey areas, for instance where the

image is of a pubescent child or where there is an allegation that the image is not of a real

child, expert evidence, such as that of gynaecologists, paediatricians have proved

beneficial. It would be prudent to exercise caution and subject the photographs to forensic

analysis or the opinion of medical professionals even when the images are

straightforward. This is important not only because of the severe penalties the Accused

would face, if convicted, but, also because in our law it is possession of child pornography

that is illegal. There is no general prohibition on the possession of adult pornography for

personal gratification, subject to certain exceptions such as non-consensual adult

pornography. That distinction then becomes important.

We must then see whether this level of minimal caution has been exercised by the

relevant prosecuting authorities in the present case. It appears that this factor has been

neglected in the judgment of the learned High Court Judge. There were statements of

witnesses made that the images they saw were of underage male children. It appears

inconclusive whether they depicted children: For instance, PW1 when referring to the

pictures in the emails says on the one hand that it depicted

(page 47 of the Brief proceedings dated 2nd October 2007) and, on the other hand,

(page 72 of the Brief proceedings dated 9th January 2008). Referring to

one particular image PW1 remarks

(page 115 of the Brief

proceedings dated 21st February 2008).

However, in the absence of any proof that the photographs were in fact of persons

below 18 years of age such as a Forensic Report or any expert opinion this fundamental

condition has not been made out. The Prosecution has also failed to establish the

competence or level of experience of the relevant witnesses in their ability to ascertain or

estimate the age of the children depicted in such photographs.

It must be reiterated that although we do not intend to stifle child pornography

prosecutions, as the relevant Section makes it applicable only to material involving

children specifically, the Prosecution must satisfy that the photograph did in fact depict

Page 11 of 19

children. Additionally, given the consequences involved if found guilty of this offence it

is prudent to err on the side of caution. Equally important is that it must be obscene.

The authenticity of the emails were they authored by the Accused?

The next pressing issue is whether the Prosecution successfully proved that the

emails were authored by the Accused himself. The emails emanated from the address

kevinw@37.com. This was denied by the Accused, who claimed in his dock statement that

he operated/owned only one email address, which was an official email address

wimal@klm.ac.lk, and that he neither created nor operated the kevinw@37.com email

address.

The evidence of the witnesses demonstrates how easy it would be to create an email

address. This is a commonly known fact as well. For instance, this is clearly borne out in

the evidence of PW9 on page 335 of the Brief (proceedings dated 6th October 2008):

: E -Mail

?

: .

: ?

: .

: 1,2,3 E-mail

?

: .

: E-mail ?

: .

The Prosecution has not made use of the provisions found in Section 201 of the

Criminal Procedure Code. There was no rebuttal. There is nothing to connect the Accused

as the sender of the vulgar emails, apart from mere inferences that the Honourable

Attorney General has laid out in the afore-quoted second ground of appeal. Firstly, we do

not see the relevance of such inferences to the charge (which deals with sending child

pornography through email, and possession of child pornography in the Accuseds

computer). Secondly, the inferences are weak. It is indisputable that they met, but this

Page 12 of 19

Court finds that the meeting alone is insufficient to prove that the Accused sent the

emails. We are also mindful that the evidence of interested witnesses such as PW1 (the

decoy) must be analysed cautiously.

There is a failure to establish that the Accused is the author of the initial post on

the lewd website, and the subsequent email correspondences.

Authentication of emails, and determining their source is not a straightforward

task. As Samuel A. Thumma and Darrel S. Jackson commented in The History of

Electronic Mail in litigation 16 Santa Clara High Tech. L.J.1 (2000):

Not surprisingly, attorneys have discovered that e-mail messages can be particularly

relevant and instructive evidence in litigation, and can be a gold mine, or a nightmare, depending

upon the party an attorney represents.

We are compelled to look to foreign jurisdictions to glean some guidance on the

issue of authenticating the identity of the person sending the email, as our law is yet to

address it.

In the United States, in the case of State of Idaho v. Michael Eugene Koch 157

Idaho 89, 334 P.3d 280 (2014) the Supreme Court of the State of Idaho discussed several

methods in which email evidence may be authenticated. It observed:

Other jurisdictions have recognized that electronic evidence may be authenticated in a

number of different ways consistent with Federal Rule 901 and corresponding state statutes.

Courts have not required proponents offering printouts of emails, internet chat room dialogues,

and cellular phone text messages to authenticate them with direct evidence, such as an admission

by the author or the testimony of a witness who saw the purported author typing the message. See,

e.g., United States v. Fluker, 698 F.3d 988, 999 (7th Cir. 2012). Rather, courts have held that

circumstantial evidence establishing that the evidence was what the proponent claimed it to be

was sufficient. See, e.g., State v. Thompson, 777 N.W.2d 617, 624 (N.D. 2010) (providing a

comprehensive review of other jurisdictions authenticity requirements for electronic

communications). Circumstantial proof might include the email address, cell phone number, or

screen name connected with the message; the content of the messages, facts included within the

text, or style of writing; and metadata such as the documents size, last modification date, or the

computer IP address. See Fluker, 698 F.3d at 999; United States v. Siddiqui, 235 F.3d 1318, 1322

1323 (11th Cir. 2000); United States v. Safavian, 435 F. Supp. 2d 36, 4041 (D.D.C. 2006).

In support of his argument that eyewitness testimony is necessary to authenticate a text

message when the defendant does not admit to sending it, Koch points to the Nevada Supreme

Court decision, Rodriguez v. State, 273 P.3d 845, 849 (Nev. 2012) . The court required actual

Page 13 of 19

proof of the defendant sending the text message because there was direct evidence that the text

messages were sent while the phone was in the possession of multiple people other than the phones

actual owner. Rodriguez does not stand for the proposition that eyewitness testimony of who sent

a text is required for its authentication, but rather that where evidence establishes that a phone

is in multiple peoples possession at the time incriminating messages are sent, a higher level of

proof that the defendant sent the incriminating messages is required.

In India, the High Court of Calcutta in Abdul Rahaman Kunji v. The State of West

Bengal (2014) held:

It is true that merely sending e-mail from a particular e-mail address would not lead to a

presumption that the particular e-mail was sent by the originator, i.e., the person from whose e-

mail address a mail emanates. Hacking is not an unknown phenomenon in the world of electronic

records. Therefore, the salutary provision in law is that the presumption relating to the

genuineness of an electronic message is rebuttable and the Court cannot presume that the message

has been sent by a particular person.

A word of caution of the learned Judges of the Calcutta High Court worth

reiterating is:

Today, closed circuit television cameras are being installed in most areas where computers

are accessible or where it is possible to use one's own devices which access Wi-Fi connections, or

mobile networks, e.g., personal computers, mobile phones, tablet computers etc. The evidence

obtained from such video recordings could be used to corroborate the identity of the originator of

the electronic communications who sends such communications especially from a closed area. This

would make it easier for the investigating officers in future to unearth the truth in crimes involving

electronic messaging and communications with more certainty. It is necessary for the investigation

agencies to keep pace with the technological advances in the world of electronics and to prove their

case in accordance with the Evidence Act by making the best use of such technologies.

Laird Kirkpatrick in an article titled 9:9 Authenticating Email, Social Media,

Web Pages, Text Messages, Instant Messaging, Electronic Signatures (December 18,

2014) 5 Federal Evidence 9:9 (4th ed. Thomson/Reuters 2013); GWU Law School Public

Law Research Paper No. 2014-60; GWU Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2014-60 notes:

Certainly testimony by a person who saw the purported author write and send such

material would suffice. If the computer, or for that matter the cell phone or android from which

such material was sent is owned by a particular person, was seized from that person's possession,

or there are other compelling circumstances linking the computer to that person, such facts may

Page 14 of 19

be enough to authenticate the material as having come from that person. If it is a shared computer,

or one to which others had access, additional evidence linking the purported author to the email

seems essential. For example, proof that the person in question was the one using the computer

when the message was sent should suffice to connect the message to that person. Particularly in

criminal cases where establishing authorship, and where a jury may have to be persuaded beyond

a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the author in order to convict him, prosecutors

sometimes call technical witnesses who do a trace. For emails, an expert may rely on the coded

Internet Protocol Address appearing in the email header and trace it back to the service provider

who relayed the message and sometimes back to a particular computer.

We recognise that this offence took place in 2002 and that sophisticated techniques

for proving authorship of emails may not have been as advanced as in todays day and

age. We are reminded of the words of Lord Denning in Roe v. Minister of Health [1954] 2

QB 66 We must not look at the 1947 accident with 1954 spectacles.

Nevertheless, the distinguishing factor in the instant case is the inability to

unmask that it was the Accused who posted the advertisement and authored those

distasteful correspondences. This only becomes more difficult to prove when considering

the next part of the judgment.

I would wish to draw a parallel to the defence of an alibi. The Accuseds emphatic

rejection that he did not create, own or operate the particular email address, through

which he corresponded with Shane, is similar to the defence of an alibi, in which the

Accused would deny ever being at the scene of the crime. The burden of proof would be on

the Prosecution to prove that he did in fact author those emails.

Possession of indecent photographs of Children

It must be noted that the computer which contained the illicit pictures was the one

found in the cubicle of the Accuseds office. The question that then arises is whether the

Accused had exclusive access or possession of the computer in his cubicle or whether his

colleagues, four others as per the evidence, had access to it as well. This question could

have been more conveniently dealt with had it been his personal computer.

According to the evidence elicited by PW1 before he and the Accused entered the

Accuseds office, the officers that participated in the sting operation with him inspected

the computer, not in the presence of the Accused. Meaning that they were able to access

Page 15 of 19

the computer without any difficulty such as having to enter a password. The fact that the

computer did not have password protection is borne out in the evidence of other witnesses

as well. For instance, PW2 (Dimuthu Prasad Galappaththi of the NCPA) who was at the

scene when the computer was inspected answered as follows (Page 211 of the Brief

proceedings dated 1st July 2008):

Therefore, the pornographic content found on the computer, a computer that was

openly accessible by anyone including the Accused, and one which was not password

protected creates doubt about whether it was he in fact who had downloaded and stored

the indecent photographs.

In the notable case of Don Sunny v. Attorney General (Amarapala Murder Case)

[1998] 2 SLR 1 it was famously held:

The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had the opportunity

of committing the offence.

When we peruse the judgment, the learned High Court Judge has correctly

identified these related issues. The following excerpts duly illustrate the same:

Therefore, we find no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge.

Before we conclude there is one observation that must be made. To do so, the words

of his Lordship Colin-Thome J. in Benwell v. Republic of Sri Lanka [1978-79] 2 SLR 194

is a good starting point:

Computer evidence is in a category of its own. It is neither original evidence nor derivative

evidence and in admitting such a document a Court must be satisfied that the document has not

been tampered with. Under the law of Sri Lanka computer evidence is not admissible under any

section of the Evidence Ordinance and certainly not under section 34. One has, therefore, to look

to the law of England which can be brought in under section 100 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Page 18 of 19

In England under the Civil Evidence Act, 1968, computer evidence has been made

admissible only in civil cases and that too under the most stringent conditions as set out in section

5 of the Act... In any event such evidence is not admissible in English Law in criminal cases.

Such evidence is clearly inadmissible under any provisions of the Evidence Ordinance of Sri

Lanka.

To address this lacuna, the Legislature introduced the Evidence (Special

Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995, after a period of about fifteen years, to permit computer

evidence in civil and criminal cases. It appears in the Journal Entries of the High Court

record (15th August 2007) that the Prosecution has given notice, as required under Section

7 of the Act, at the request of the Accused, at the High Court. However, we observe that

at various stages when productions were introduced such as printouts of the email

correspondences and the relevant tape recordings of the telephone conversations, those

were admitted subject to proof. If the provisions of the Section 7 notice had been

complied with we are unsure why such evidence was admitted subject to proof.

We would advise, therefore, if the Honourable Attorney General seeks to rely on

computer evidence, it would be efficacious and strengthen the purpose for introducing the

Evidence (Special Provisions) Act for Section 7 notice to be issued and for the inspection

of the computer evidence to take place prior to serving the indictment, at the Magistrates

Court.

The appeal is dismissed without costs.
