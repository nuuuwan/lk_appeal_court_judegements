    "text": "called upon to decide which rules are merely directory and which are mandatory, carrying certain adverse consequences for noncompliance. Many types of rules have been enacted in the interest of due administration of justice, irrespective of whether or not a non-compliance causes prejudice to the opposite party. It is in this context that judges have stressed on the mandatory nature of the rules, and the need to keep channels of procedure open for justice to flow freely and smoothly. The position would be worse if the non-compliance causes prejudice to the other party It has further held that the rules of procedure have been devised to eliminate delay and to facilitate due administration of justice. 2) Attorney General vs. Wilson Silva 1992 1 Sri L R 44 it was held that even the Attorney General must comply with rule 46 , which is as we are all aware is the need to file an affidavit along with the petition in applications under article 140 and 141 of the Constitution. In the instant matter the purpose of filling the instant application is to revise the order of the High Court in which the petitioner has claimed that the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge is inadequate and he substantiates the position with the facts of the case and the nature of the offence with which the respondent was indicted. Therefore it is very obvious that the petitioner is relying on the facts of the case which is more the reason why the petition should have been accompanied with an affidavit although the rule does not makes a specification for issues of law and facts. Furthermore as stated above for the due administration of justice and to avoid delay, following the rules by all parties is important. Therefore in view of the rule quoted by the respondents and the decided cases cited above it is very clear that following rule 3 (1) (a) is mandatory in applications filed under article 138 of the Constitution. The next point raised by the respondent is that the petition had been filed after 10 months of the impugned order. It is a well-established principle that if a party files a revision application the party filling the same must do so without any delay. Delay has been considered to be fatal if it is not explained by the",
