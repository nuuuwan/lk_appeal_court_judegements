Decided on: 16.11.2022

Prasantha De Silva, J.

Order Applicant being the competent authority, Sri Lanka Plantation Corporation, had filed

action against the Respondent, D.V. Dharmasiri in the Magistrates Court of Galle in

case bearing No. 10529, under the provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 07 of 1979 in order to recover the possession of the state land

which forms the subject matter in the instant case.

The position taken up by the Applicant was that the subject matter of this

application, which is described in the schedule as a state land is unlawfully occupied

by the Respondent. The Respondent has failed to vacate the subject land despite a

quit notice being served in terms of Section 03 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act. Hence, the Respondent has failed to comply with Section 4 (b) of

the Act, the Appellant has instituted the instant action in the Magistrates Court of

Galle.

Page 3 of 12

Upon the notice being served on the Respondent, the Respondent was to appear and

show cause why the Respondent and his dependents, should not be ejected from the

subject land. Accordingly, Respondent showed cause and objected to the issuance

of the Ejectment Order on several grounds. Thereafter, the inquiry concluded

allowing both parties to file written submissions. Consequently, the learned

Magistrate delivered the Order on 20.05.2020 in favour of the Applicant and issued

an Order of ejectment against the Respondent and his dependents from the subject

land.

Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 20.05.2020, the Respondent-Petitioner

invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the of the Provincial High Court of Galle by

way of revision application bearing No. 56/20, dated 01.06.2020.

Thereafter, the Applicant-Respondent had filed statement of limited objections and

raised several preliminary objections against the issuance of notice for the

Respondent-Petitioner to quit the from the subject land.

On 30.07.2020, the Respondent-Petitioner and the Applicant-Respondent had agreed

that the matter could be concluded if it was first found that the Applicant-

Respondent is the competent authority in terms of the provisions of the said Act.

The learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Galle held that by Order

dated 13.10.2020, the Applicant-Respondent was in fact the competent authority in

terms of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.07 of 1979 and dismissed

the Respondent-Petitioners application.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner

[hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Petitioner] has preferred this revision

application to this Court. Pursuant to the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent

[hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Respondent] filing the statement of

objections, Court allowed both parties to file written submissions to conclude this

matter.

It appears that the following questions of law and facts were raised on behalf of the

Petitioner to determine the issue in hand. It was the contention of the Petitioner

that the learned Magistrate and learned High Court Judge have applied the incorrect

Page 4 of 12

law on who should be considered as the proper Competent Authority in terms of

Section 18 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

The learned Magistrate in the Order dated 20.05.2020 has held as follows:

. ( ) 1997

, The head of other government department or institution

being a department of institution created by law, where there property is under the

control or such department or institution .

.

It is seen that the learned High Court Judge in his Order dated 13.10.2020 has held

as follows:

Bhashwara Senanka Gunarathne, the Chairman, Sri Lanka

Tourism Development Authority Vs. Ganeshapillei Kalipillai, CA (PHC) 141/2015

C.A.M 26.02.2020 .

Section 18 of the Act states thus;

Competent authority used in relation to any land means the Government Agent an

Additional Government Agent or an Assistant Government Agent of the District in

which the land is situated and, includes,

Section 18 (h) of the Act states thus;

The head of any other Government Department or institution being a department

or institution created by law, where such land is under the control of such

department or institution.

Therefore, delegation of power from the members of the authority to the Chairman

to act as competent authority would not arise since the Chairman as the head of the

authority has every right to make this application to Court in terms of Section 18 of

the Act according to the decision of Bhashwara Senanka Gunarathne, the

Chairman, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority Vs. Ganeshapillei

Kalipillai [supra].

Page 5 of 12

However, it was the contention of the Petitioner that the learned Magistrate and

High Court Judge have applied the incorrect legal principles to determine who the

competent authority was. It was submitted that this incorrect application of law

amounts to an exceptional circumstances and that is had caused a grave prejudice

to the Petitioner.

In this respect, the case of Wedamulla Vs. Abeysinghe [1999] 3 SLR 26 was cited

and this endorsed the legal position that where a corporate body is involved, only

an officer generally or specifically authorized by the said corporate body can be

considered as the competent authority.

It was held as follows, inter alia

The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act provides that where a quit notice has

been issued to a person in unauthorised possession or occupation of any State land

and such person fails to comply with such notice, any competent authority may

make an application in writing in the prescribed form to the Magistrates Court

having jurisdiction setting forth the matters referred to in Section 5 (1) (a) and

praying for the recovery of such land and for an order of ejectment of the person

in possession or occupation (see Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act, No. 07 of 1979 as amended by Act No. 29 of 1983). Competent

Authority includes an officer generally or specially authorized by a corporate body,

where such land is vested in or owned by or under the control of such corporate

body. (Section 18 State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act as amended by Section 5

(h) of Act No. 58 of 1981).

In the matter before me, the Appellant was by name and designation appointed the

competent authority by the Board of the Urban Development Authority in whom

the land in question was vested. He had every right, therefore, to make an

application for the possession of the land and for ejectment of the Respondent.

Admittedly, as the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal observes, a corporate body

has then the right to sue and be sued. However, he overlooked the fact that

proceedings under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act are required to be

initiated by a competent authority.

Page 6 of 12

However, the learned Magistrate and the High Court Judge have held on the

incorrect legal position that the State Plantations Corporation is a government

department or institution.

In the Court of Appeal, it was held in Alwis Vs. Wedamulla Additional Director

General UDA [1997] 3 SLR 417 by Jayasuriya, J. that the Magistrate had no

jurisdiction to entertain the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) action due to

following reasons:

The Urban Development Authority Act (as amended) states that the Urban

Development Authority is a body corporate which can institute proceedings and also

be sued in legal proceedings. Thus, it is a legal persona which could have instituted

proceedings even in its own name. In addition the statute provides for the

competent authority to institute proceedings on behalf of the Urban Development

Authority. Having regard to the definition of the term "Competent Authority" in the

Urban Development Authority Act, it is manifest that the Additional Director

General is not a Competent Authority. If there had been a delegation of powers,

rights and functions of the Director-General of the Urban Development Authority

to the Additional Director-General, then the petition and affidavit filed in the

Magistrate's Court ought to have set out and pleaded such delegation or

appointment. There is no averment in the affidavit and in the documents filed that

the powers of the Director-General have been delegated on A. Wedamulla, the

Additional Director-General did not have a locus standi and a right and status to

institute these proceedings.

Secondly, the proceedings in ejectment could be instituted by the Urban

Development Authority against a person who is in occupation of land vested in the

Urban Development Authority provided such applications to eject are authorised

and have had the written approval of the Minister of Housing. Thus, the statutory

provisions of the Urban Development Authority Act and the State Lands (Recovery

of Possession) Act set out a condition precedent for the filing of applications for

ejectment before the Magistrate's Court and even if an application is wrongly

accepted without such authority, the learned Magistrate would not have

jurisdiction, without the satisfaction of the condition precedent, to further

exercise jurisdiction upon such application.

Page 7 of 12

Persons affected by an intention to institute proceedings in ejectment on the part

of officials, frequently make representations and submissions to the Minister and

after consideration of such representations, the Minister may or may not grant

written approval. The proof of grant of such approval is a condition precedent to

the institution of proceedings in ejectment and, compare the provisions of

Sections 104 and 147 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Sections 97(1) and 135 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The obvious intention of these statutory

provisions in the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is to protect the private

person from frivolous and vexatious proceedings in ejectment. There is no averment

either in the affidavit or in the documents filed before the learned Magistrate that

the Minister of Housing has authorised and approved the proceeding in question to

eject the Respondent-Petitioner from this land. Though the amended statutory

provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act has precluded a

Respondent from challenging and impugning the notice served on him, still such

Respondent is entitled to urge successfully before the Magistrate that a condition

precedent for the filing of the application has not been fulfilled by the Petitioner.

The giving of notice under Section 3 of the said Act is only a mere step in the

commencement of proceedings to secure such ejectment.

Hence the learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to entertain this application and

he also had no jurisdiction even if he had wrongly entertained it, to exercise further

jurisdiction in conducting the proceedings upon this application.

Therefore, it is manifest that the application is defective in these respects and it

is one that ought not to have been entertained by the Magistrate on account of the

failure to comply with the condition precedent for the exercise of jurisdiction.

These points have been strenuously urged by the learned Presidents Counsel before

this court, belatedly under the guise of filing a statement of objections, the

Applicant-Respondent is seeking to rectify defects omissions and deficiencies in the

application filed before the Magistrate. I hold that this Court is not the forum for

the correction of defects and deficiencies which have been perpetrated in filing

proceedings before the Magistrate.

Page 8 of 12

It was submitted that in the quit notice and application for ejectment under

Section 5 in the case at hand, there is no averment in the averment/documents to

specify that the State Plantations Corporation had appointed the Respondent and

that the Respondent has been generally or specially authorized to act as the

competent authority. Therefore, it is submitted that the learned Magistrate had

no jurisdiction to entertain this application for ejectment.

Also, in the Court of Appeal Case of Banda Vs. President, MPSC Ltd, Medirigiriya

and another [2003] SLR 193, the Court endorsed the view that where the properly

constituted competent authority is in dispute, all actions taken on such application

are null and void. Court held as follows:

Under Section 18(1)(gg) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, a

Divisional Secretary can delegate his powers under the Act to any other public

officer. The term Public Officer, has been defined in Article 170 of the

Constitution as a person holding a paid office under the Republic. He is a person

who is elected for a term by the members of the cooperative society. Therefore,

the President of a MPCS is not a public officer and accordingly the Divisional

Secretary has no power to delegate his powers under the Act to such a person. The

delegation being invalid, all acts done under such purported delegation are also

invalid.

Accordingly, I hold that the President of the MPCS Medirigiriya had no lawful power

or authority to make an application under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act to the Magistrates Court to obtain an order to evict the Appellant. Therefore,

all actions taken or all orders made under such invalid application are null and void

and has no force or avail in law. Accordingly, I allow the appeal and set aside the

order of the High Court dated 24.05.2000 and the order of the Magistrate,

Hingurakgoda dated 03.06.1999 and dismiss the application made by the President,

MPCS Medirigiriya dated 30.10.1998 as the Magistrates Court had 70 jurisdictions

to entertain and act upon the said application. The Appellant is entitled to a sum

of Rs. 5000/- payable by the MPCS, Medirigiriya.

It was argued on behalf of the Petitioner that according to the above determination,

the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge have incorrectly concluded

that the State Plantations Corporation is an entity which falls within the definition

Page 9 of 12

of Section 18 (h) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act. It was submitted

that Section 18 (h) does not apply to corporate entities such as the State Plantations

Corporation.

In view of the aforesaid judicial decisions, it was contended by the Petitioner that

both in the Magistrates Court and the High Court, the orders are based on an

incorrect legal basis, and in terms of the binding judicial precedent of the Supreme

Court and the persuasive judicial decisions of the Court of Appeal, the orders against

the Petitioner in the Magistrates Court and High Court deserve to be set aside.

It is observable that in terms of Section 2 of the Sri Lanka State Plantations

Corporation Act, the said Corporation is a Corporate body which reads as follows;

Establishment of the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation.

(1) There shall be established a Corporation which shall be known as the Sri Lanka

State Plantations Corporation and which shall consist of the persons who are from

time to time appointed under Section 3 as the members thereof. (2) The Corporation

shall be deemed to be established on the date with effect from which its first

members are appointed under Section 03.

(3) The Corporation shall have perpetual succession and a common seal, and may

sue and be sued in the name assigned to it by subsection (1).

Therefore, it is seen that Section 18 (l) should apply to the State Plantations

Corporation in order to determine who the Competent authority is. In terms of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, Section 18 (l) reads as follows:

In this Act, unless the Context otherwise requires-

Competent authority used in relation to any land means the Government Agent, an

Additional Government Agent or an Assistant Government Agent of the District in

which the land is situated and, includes-

(1) an officer generally or specially authorised by a corporate body, where such land

is vested in or owned by or under the control of, such corporate body.

Therefore, it was submitted on behalf of the Respondent that in terms of Section 18

(h) of the Act the head of any Government Department or Institution being a

department or institution created by law, where such land is under the control of

Page 10 of 12

such department or institution can be considered as the competent authority under

the Act.

Moreover, in terms of Section 18 (1) of the Act, any officer who is generally or

specially authorized by a corporate body, where such land is vested in or owned by

or under the control of, such corporate body can be considered as a competent

authority under the Act.

Accordingly, in terms of the documents marked R2 and R3 annexed to the statement

of objections filed by the Respondent, it is evident that the Respondent has been

duly authorized to act as the competent authority by the Sri Lanka State Plantations

Corporation. As such, it is evident that the Respondent is the competent authority

in terms of the Act having legal standing to prefer an application under the Act.

In any event, the Petitioner is not lawfully entitled to contest that the Respondent

is not the competent authority in terms of the Act. In the case of Namunukula

Plantations PLC. Vs. Nimal Punchihewa CA (PHC) APN 29/2016 C.A.M

09.07.2018, it was held that;

The Petitioner submitted that the Respondent was not the competent authority in

respect of the state lands vested with the SLSPC. Such an objection is not a matter

that can be taken up before the learned Magistrate or in these proceedings. One of

the facts to be stated in the application made under Section 5 of the Act is that the

person making the application is a competent authority for the purposes of the Act.

In view of Section 6 of the Act, a person who has been summoned cannot contest

that the claimant is not a competent authority.

Further, the application preferred by the Respondent to the learned Magistrate

clearly depicts the boundaries of the land which forms the subject matter of the

application. As such, the Petitioners contention that the land cannot be identified

with certainty clearly fails.

The Petitioner further contends that the land in question is a private land. However,

in terms of Section 9 of the Act, it is very clear that the learned Magistrate is not

empowered to inquire into such a contention. If the land is in fact a private land,

Page 11 of 12

the correct course of action for the Petitioner would have been to vindicate his title

in terms of Section 12 of the Act.

The aforementioned position has been clearly set out in Namunukula Plantalions

PLC Vs Nimal Punchihewa [supra] where it was held that;

A person who has been summoned in terms of Section 6 of the Act can only

establish that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or

other written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law

and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered

invalid. He cannot contest any of the matters stated in the application made under

Section 5 of the Act. One of the matters required to be stated in the application

is that the land described in the schedule to the application is in the opinion of

the competent authority State Land. This fact cannot be contested by the

person summoned....

It is relevant to note that the Respondent has at all times followed the procedure

stipulated in the Act in recovering possession of the state land which forms the

subject matter of this application. In such circumstances, Court observes that there

are no grounds whatsoever which warrant the revision of the Order of the learned

Magistrate dated 20.05.2020.

According to the proceedings dated 30.07.2020, both parties, agreed that the matter

could be concluded if the learned High Court Judge comes to a conclusion on

whether the Respondent is the competent authority in terms of the Act.

It is noteworthy that the Petitioner has explicitly agreed that the revision application

could be dismissed if it is found that the Respondent is the competent authority

under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

By order dated 13.10.2020, the learned High Court Judge had very correctly come

to a finding that the Respondent is the competent authority in terms of Section 18

of the Act. As already established above, in terms of either Section 18(h) or 18(l)

the Respondent can be considered as the competent authority under the Act. As

such, there are no grounds to challenge the legality of the Order dated 13.10.2020

in that regard.

Page 12 of 12

As such, we see no reason for us to interfere with the Order of the learned High

Court Judge of Galle dated 13.10.2020 and the Order made by the learned Magistrate

dated 20.05.2020. Hence, I hold that the competent authority appointed by the Sri

Lanka State Plantations Corporation is entitled to invoke the provision of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act in respect of the impugned land in the instant

action and the Quit Notice is validly issued on the Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner.

Thus, the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent is entitled to have the Order of the

learned Magistrate dated 20.05.2020 executed.

Therefore, we dismiss the application of the Petitioner with cost fixed at Rs 25,000/-

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL K.K.A.V. Swarnadhipathi, J.

I agree.
