The Counsel for the Petitioners was heard in support of this application on 10.02.2022 and on the same day the court has issued a limited stay order in terms of paragraph G of the prayer to the petition staying the proceedings of the Wakfs tribunal operative till 07.03.2022.

After the notice returnable date the court had fixed the matter for inquiry regarding the granting of leave. While the inquiry was pending the 9th to 12th Respondent-Respondents had tendered a motion dated 30th August 2022 along with an affidavit and moved court to set aside the Order dated 8th June 2022 and direct the Respondent-Petitioners to amend the caption by inserting the correct addresses of the 9th to 12th Respondent- Respondents and to suspend the Order dated 8th June 2022 until the hearing of this application.

In a situation where the Petitioner himself had issued a notice on the opposing party before supporting the application for interim relief and if the opposing party appears in court in response to that notice, then the matter ends there and the opposing party can object to the application. If the opposing party does not appear in court in response to that notice, then the court has to issue notice through the registry. Otherwise, the court cannot assume jurisdiction over that party. The notice issued by the Petitioner cannot be treated as an official communication and it cannot be treated as a formal notice issued by court. That is why this court issued a limited stay order for 2 weeks against the Respondents when the matter was supported for interim relief, instead of issuing a stay order until the final determination of this application. Thereafter, on several occasions the Petitioner had made applications for the extension of the stay orders. Rule 2(4) states that the proceeding sub-rule shall apply to every application for an extension of an interim relief but the Petitioner had never noticed the opposing party in respect of those applications and the court had extended the stay orders from time to time but only for a period not exceeding 2 weeks. The Petitioners have never taken steps to notice the 9th to 12th Respondent-Respondents through court. When this case was supported for notice and extension of the stay orders on 25.05.2022, the Petitioners had not taken steps to notice the 9th to 12th Respondent-Respondents through the court registry. Therefore, the application against the 9th to 12th Respondent-Respondents on that day has to be treated as an ex-parte application without formal notice to the 9th to 12th Respondent-Respondents and the proceedings have to be treated as ex-parte as against the 9th to 12th Respondent-Respondents. The court by an oversight had issued interim orders against 9th to 12th Respondent-Respondents until the final determination on the footing that the 9th to 12th Respondent-Respondents had formal notice of the application. Therefore, that order is clearly a per incuriam order made on the footing that the 9th to 12th Respondent-Respondents had notice of the application.

Even assuming that they were aware of the case, the court cannot assume jurisdiction over them without serving notice on them.

If the Court has no jurisdiction, it is of no consequence that the proceedings had been formally conducted, for they are coram non judice.

In that case Lopes LJ. had observed as follows, The question we have to deal with is whether the admitted failure to serve the summons upon which the order in this case was based was a mere irregularity, or whether it was something worse, which would give the defendant the right to have the order set aside. In my opinion, it is beyond question that failure to serve process where service of process is required, is a failure which goes to the root of our conceptions of the proper procedure in litigation. Apart from proper ex parte proceedings, the idea that an order can validly be made against a man who has had no notification of any intention to apply for it is one which has never been adopted in England. To say that on order of that kind is to be treated as a mere irregularity, and not something which is affected by a fundamental vice, is an argument which, in my opinion, cannot be sustained.",
