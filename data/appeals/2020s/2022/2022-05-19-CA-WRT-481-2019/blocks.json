The Petitioner had not raised any objections within the stipulated time period. Hence, on 12-12-2017 the 2nd Respondent had commenced the work.",

In view of the obstruction of the Petitioner to the Project, the Ceylon Electricity Board sought the necessary intervention of the 1st Respondent by letters dated 15-08-2019 and 23-08-2019 (R7 and R8). Accordingly, by letter dated 18-09-2019 the 1st Respondent had summoned the Petitioner for an inquiry pertaining to the dispute, whereas the latter failed to respond to the said letter. Thereupon, the 1st Respondent by letter dated 02-10-2019 authorized the 2nd and 3rd Respondents for the completion of the Project (R11a/P12). When the Petitioner had submitted to the 1st Respondent documents to establish his ownership to the land on which the construction is being carried on, the matter was once again fixed for an inquiry/field inspection, which was also cancelled as the Petitioner refused to attend the same (R12 and R13).",
