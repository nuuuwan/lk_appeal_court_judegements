However, the question of priority by prior registration will arise only in a situation where the two deeds are competing with each other. According to the amended pedigree of the Plaintiff these two deeds are not competing with each other and both deeds can be accommodated within the pedigree disclosed by the Plaintiff. According to the amended pedigree of the Plaintiff Abanchiya had inherited a 26/48 share from Siriya. Out of those rights Abanchiya had transferred a 20/48 share to Podiya on the deed marked 5V1. The remaining 1/8 share had been transferred to Podina by the deed marked 2. Therefore, the two deeds are not competing with each other and the question of priority by prior registration will not arise.

By answering the issue number 10 in a negative the learned District Judge has come to a conclusion that a judgment in the case number 17265 does not operate as res judicata in respect of the rights accrued to Podiya as Podina had not acted upon on that judgement. Accordingly, the learned District Judge had answered the issue number 13 in the affirmative and come to the conclusion that the Plaintiff can maintain this partition action. By answering the issue number 14 in the negative the learned District Judge has come to the conclusion that, the deed marked 5V1 will not prevail over the deed marked 2 in favour of Podina. The findings of the learned District Judge and the conclusions reached by her can be upheld for the following reasons. For the reasons stated earlier I have come to the conclusion that, a valuable consideration had passed on the deed number 16967 marked 2 and it has been registered in the correct folio. Therefore, if a competition arises that deed should prevail over the earlier deed marked 5V1 by virtue of priority by prior registration. The parties had arrived at a settlement in case No. 17265 ignoring this legal position. It appears from the proceedings in the case No. 17265 the Plaintiff in that case Podina who was a minor at that time had entered in to the settlement with Podiya on the wrong footing that she was unable to prove the fact that the consideration had passed on the deed marked 2 in favour of her when the contents of the deed spoke to that fact. Therefore, Podina had entered in to that settlement on a mistaken belief of a question of law namely, whether the deed number 16967 marked 2 in favour of her could gain priority by prior registration. After the entry of the aforementioned settlement it becomes a consent decree which has the same force of a decree entered by Court. In the case of Katiritamby Vs. Parupathipillai reported in 23 NLR 209, it was held that an erroneous decision on a pure question of law will operate as res judicata quoad, the subject-matter of the suit in which it is given, and no further. In that case Garvin A. J. had cited the following passage from Caspersz on Estoppel A decision which is erroneous cannot have the force of res judicata in a subsequent proceeding for a different relief. Or when the cause of action is different, but the matter has already been in controversy, then the estoppel ought to be limited to matters distinctly put in issue and determined previously, and should further be restricted to questions of fact or of mixed law and fact..Section 537..But as regards the law, an erroneous",

The decision in Katiritambys case was followed by the Supreme Court in the case of Subramaniam Vs. Kumaraswami 57 NLR 130 in which case it was held that an erroneous decision on a pure question of law will operate as res judicata in regard only to the subject matter of the suit in which it is given. It does not prevent the Court from subsequently deciding the same question correctly in another suit between the same parties when the subject matter of the suit is different. Therefore, assuming that the consent decree in the earlier case based on a settlement entered between the parties on a mistaken belief of a question of law and which is contrary to law, contains a decision of Court it cannot operate as res judicata as far as the devolution of the rights of Abanchiya and Podina are concerned and it does not prevent the District Court from subsequently deciding the same question correctly in another suit between the same parties. In cross examination it has been suggested to the 5th Defendant that the plaintiff who claims her title through Podina who has no title according to the earlier settlement had possessed her rights in the corpus and the 5th Defendant had not denied that suggestion. Plaintiffs husband who testified on behalf of the Plaintiff had stated that the 5th Defendant Sirineris and Jayadewa cultivated this paddy field and gave the Plaintiff her share. The 12th Defendant who is the son of Jemma who had purchased rights from Podina after the settlement stated in evidence that the 5th Defendant Sirineris cultivated the land and gave a share of the produce to Jemma. Later Sirineris gave this share to Jemmas children. The evidence of the Plaintiffs husband and the 12th Defendant regarding Sirineris giving a share to them were not taken in cross examination and therefore that evidence can be believed. That shows that the parties to the earlier settlement had not acted upon it and those who had purchased rights from Podina had possessed the corpus without any objections from Podiyas heirs. The contents of the deed marked 7 show that Podina had transferred her rights in three lands to Wijehamy on that deed. In that deed Podina had referred to the fact that she derived her title to those three lands on the deed number 16967 marked 2. In terms of the settlement marked 5V5 Podina had consented to confine her rights only to one land called Alawalagewatta and she had agreed to give up the rights in the other lands she had purchased on",

Vijehamy in turn had sold those rights to 5th Defendant Sirineris, Jayadewa and Ordiris on 8. Sirineris, Jayadewa and Ordiris are children of Podiya in whose favour the earlier settlement was entered. If Podina lost her rights to the other two lands after the settlement and if Podiya became the owner of the other two lands and if the parties had acted upon that settlement, it was not necessary for Podiyas children to purchase the rights of those two lands from Wijehamy who had purchased those rights from Podina. That shows that the parties to the earlier settlement had never acted upon that settlement. Lord Blanesburgh in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in Charles Hubert Vs. Edward Keith Walcott A. I. R. 1929 P. C. 289: 118 I. G. 7 (P. C.) had observed as follows, For such a purpose an order by consent not discharged by mutual agreement and remaining unreduced is as effective as an order of the Court made otherwise than by consent and not discharged on appeal. Accordingly, an order by consent is as effective as an order made by court otherwise than by consent only if it is not discharged by mutual agreement. Dr. Nand Lal in his treatise The Law and Doctrine of Res Judicata 2nd edition 1965 observes thus, But the compromise is a contract between the parties superadded with command of the court but is subject to all the infirmities of a contract. Professor C. G. Weeramanthry in his treatise The Law of Contracts volume 2 at page 710 states that the termination of a contract by agreement may take the following forms.",

    "text": "For the reasons I have stated earlier one can come to the conclusion that the heirs and successors in title of Podina and the heirs and successors in title of Podiya had not acted upon on the compromise effected between Podina and Podiya in court and they have abandoned the settlement by their conduct. They have waived off the terms of settlement by their subsequent conduct. Therefor the learned District Judge had come to a correct conclusion when she answered the issues number 5, 6 and 7 in the affirmative in favour of the Plaintiff. The learned District Judge has given to the successors in title of Podiya (5th, 6th,7th, 8th and 9th Defendants) the entire 5/12 share which had been transferred to Podiya by Abanchiya. The learned District Judge had given to the successors in title of Podina the entire 1/8 share which had been transferred to Podina by Abanchiya. Both those deeds can be accommodated within the pedigree disclosed by the Plaintiff. The 5th and 9th Defendants cannot ask the court to prevent Podinas successors in title from getting their undivided rights because of a compromise which the parties and their successors in tittle had waived off by their conduct. Therefore, the appeal of 5th and 9th Defendants must necessarily fail. The 4th Defendant-Appellant is claiming rights under Doisa. As shown in the amended plaint Doisa had transferred her balance rights a 22/192 share to Abiththa who in turn had transferred the same to Rapiel. Rapiel had transferred that share to the 4th Defendant-Appellant Premawathie. It is the case of the 4th Defendant-Appellant that at the trial the deed No. 20746 upon which Doisa had transferred her balance rights to Abiththa had not been produced due to the non-availability of the deed and as a result that share had not been given to the 4th Defendant-Appellant. Therefore the 4th Defendant-Appellant prays that she be allowed to produce that deed and claim for that share. This cannot be done without setting aside the judgement. The Plaintiffs husband who testified on behalf of the Plaintiff had stated in his evidence that the balance rights of Doisa a 22/192 share devolved on the 4th Defendant. But he had not disclosed the complete devolution. He had not produced any deeds to prove that limb of the devolution but the 2nd Defendant had disclosed that devolution and produced the deeds except the deed No. 20746. But the 2nd Defendant had failed to disclose the balance right which Doisa had transferred to Abiththa. According to the evidence of the Plaintiffs",

    "text": "husband and the amended plaint Doisa had transferred a 22/192 share to Abiththa. The learned District Judge has taken into consideration that limb of the pedigree and the evidence led regarding the same. According to what she had observed, as shown in the amended pedigree Dinesa owned a 22/48 share which is equal to 88/192. That right had devolved on Silindu and Doisa. Silindu and Doisa had transferred a 7/16 share (84/192) to Podisingho, Simanderis and Abedewa on 1. After transferring a 84/192 share on 1, Doisa did not own a balance 22/192 share to dispose on the deed No. 20747. Therefore, the learned District Judge has refused to accept that limb of the devolution and we see no reason to interfere with that finding. For the aforementioned reasons we see no merit in these two appeals. We are of the view that the learned District Judge had come to a correct conclusion regarding the devolution of title of the co-owners and we see no reason to interfere with that finding. Therefore, we affirm the judgement of the learned District Judge dated 04.03.1999 and dismiss both appeals. We make no order for costs.",
