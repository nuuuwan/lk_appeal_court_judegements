This appeal is from the judgment, delivered by the learned Judge of the High Court of Kalutara, dated 15.12.2015, by which, the accused-appellant, who is before this Court, was convicted and sentenced to death for having committed the murder of one Mohamed Izzadeen Mohamed Izzad (the deceased) on or about 07.01.1999.

The accused-appellant had been indicted on 08.08.2006 in the High Court of Kalutara for committing the murder of Mohamed Izzadeen Mohamed Izzad on or about 07.01.1999, which is punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code.

The trial had commenced on 23.10.2008 after the accused-appellant opted for a non-jury trial. The prosecution had, led evidence of 8 witnesses and marked the productions - 1 and - 2. Once the prosecution had closed its case the accused-appellant gave evidence from the witness box and had called his brother as a defence witness. At the conclusion of the trial, the accused-appellant had been found guilty on the murder charge and sentenced to death. Aggrieved by the said decision the accused-appellant preferred this appeal.

The case for the prosecution relied on direct and circumstantial evidence. There were 2 eyewitnesses in this case namely PW 1 and PW 2. The learned High Court Judge has decided to disregard the evidence of the mother of the deceased who was the PW 1. She has forgotten the incident which took place 10 years ago. The learned Counsel for the respondent argued that the decision of the learned High Court Judge to disregard the evidence of PW 1 was a justifiable decision due to her old age and being illiterate.

Mohamed Izzadeen Mohamed Imran (PW-02), giving evidence before the learned trial Judge nearly 14 years after the indent, has stated that the deceased is his elder brother and as at the date of the incident, he was living with his wife and children. That was in his wife's house and the deceased brother and their parents were living separately, three houses away.

This was a date during the Islamic Holy month of Ramadhan and he was fasting. He had returned from the mosque after performing the noon prayers. While he was inside the house, he had heard a sound and when he came out of the house, he had seen his deceased brother, hitting a boy named Saman for plucking and stealing 'Kurumba' from the deceased brothers plantation. Thereafter said 'Saman' (brother of the appellant) had been crying and proceeded towards his house. The deceased brother had proceeded towards a boutique of Zarook, that was situated in the vicinity. He had then gone back into the house and while he was engaged in religious activity, he had heard the person named 'Sunil' (Appellant) calling his brother.

The second incident of accused-appellant, took place having arrived near their house and calling for the deceased. It took place around half an hour after the first incident of his brother assaulting a boy named Saman. Though this witness has come out of the house, the appellant has asked as to where 'Izzad' the deceased has gone. Then he had told this witness' I have no issues with you and I will resolve it with 'Izzad' and proceeded towards the direction of the Boutique of `Zarook'.

Page 3 of 17

While the appellant was calling the name of the deceased and proceeding toward the boutique of Zarook, the deceased had responded and come in the direction of where the appellant was. At that time the appellant had questioned the deceased as to why he hit his (appellant's) brother. When the deceased had asked in return as to whether he came to assault him, the appellant has answered in the affirmative and pulled out a knife and stabbed the deceased on the left side of the chest.

Thereafter the appellant had chased behind this witness and while he was trying to run away, he has fallen. Though the appellant has attacked him with the knife too fortunately for him it did not strike him and thus when he got up and pursued the appellant had escaped from the scene. Subsequently, he had proceeded towards the shop of Zarook where his deceased brother was fallen and taken steps to rush the deceased to the hospital. The deceased had been pronounced dead on admission.

The learned counsel for the respondent argued that PW 3 and PW 4 who are independent witnesses have corroborated most of what was narrated by PW 2. Though they have not witnessed the act of stabbing, the other incidents that took place before the incident has been confirmed by these two witnesses in their testimony. Though PW 1, who was the mother of the deceased and PW 2, was called by the prosecution, the learned High Court Judge has decided to disregard her evidence. The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that it was a justifiable decision to do so, as observed by the learned High Court judge due to her old age.

The Doctor (PW 6) in his evidence has stated that he observed 2 injuries on the body of the deceased and has stated that in his opinion Injury number 1 that was found on the left side of the chest was a fatal injury. It was the opinion of the doctor that the said injury ought to have been inflicted with considerable force, while the deceased was in a standing position. Further, he has opined that haemorrhage due to severe bleeding caused by the stab injury is the cause of death. It was observed that the doctor, on being asked about the possibility of the deceased sustaining the injury by falling onto a weapon, while involved in a scuffle, has very clearly stated that the proposition could be excluded, considering the material available.

The learned Trial Judge after the case for the prosecution was closed called for defence and the appellant testified under oath and called his younger brother to give evidence and closed the defence case.

It is important to note that there were 26 contradictions in the evidence of PW 1. The learned trial Judge very correctly decided to disregard her evidence. The evidence of PW 2 was also considered by the learned trial judge along with some contradictions.

On his evidence in chief, PW 2 states that he was living in his wife's house with his wife and their kid. But according to his police statement, he was living at his parents' house.

Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant argued that PW 2 and PW 4 were having per se contradictions in their evidence and the learned trial judge could not consider them as material contradictions. They are as follows;

According to the above contradictions can see that there is no consistency in the evidence of the prosecution side.

Thantiriee Plyasena vs. Bribery Commission CA/31/98 dated 29.01.2001 to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption;

There are material contradictions inter se in the evidence of Bandara and Fonseka regard to the incident except on the matter of acceptance Rs. 3000/- by the accused-appellant. Such discrepancies in their evidence would make the Court reluctant to act on their testimony since it is doubtful as to which witness is speaking the truth. Further in a case where the raid had been organized such discrepancies in the evidence of the witness who had taken part in the raid cannot be excepted. Because of the contradictions and other infirmities as referred to above, it would appear that the evidence of these two witnesses is unreliable and therefore it is dangerous and unsafe to convict the accused-appellant on such evidence.

Padmatileke (SGT) vs. Director General, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption SC/99/2007;

Where the material witnesses make inconsistent statements in their evidence on material particulars, the evidence of such witness becomes unreliable and unworthy of credence, thus making the prosecution case highly doubtful.

AG v Manjula Priyantha HA (PHC) APN 19/99 dated 26.09.2000 . furthermore, the prosecutrix went to the extent of saying that there was blood in her trousers (nicker) which she had washed after returning home. If that was the case, the doctor should have observed some injuries. On this matter, one cannot ignore her evidence where she said that she was not wearing a nicker

Page 12 of 17

on the date of the alleged sexual act. All these matters go to show that she has not been truthful to Court,

Hewage Chandarapala vs. AG, CA/131/2001 dated 05.08.2005. The principal eyewitness to the incident was the wife of the deceased Anula Gunawardene in her evidence she had stated that she identified the 1st, 2nd and 4th accused-appellants. She could not identify the other two persons who were present near her house. The other inmate Manika who was present at the time of the incident had failed to identify anyone and she had told the father of Anula (Peththa) that the suspects who came to the house of the deceased were wearing masks.

Kanattha Gamage Wijetilaka and two others vs AG, CA/189/2000 dated 02.10.2009 the case against the 2nd and 3rd accused-appellants depended on the evidence of Jayanthi, the sister of the deceased. Jayanthi when giving evidence in the Magistrate Court was unable to say the weapon that the 3rd accused was carrying. But in her evidence in the High Court, she stated that the 3rd accused was having a sword. This contradiction was marked as V 1.

Jayanthi in her statement made to the Police says that she did not see the 3rd accused attacking the deceased. But in her evidence in the High Court, she stated that she saw the 3rd accused attacking the deceased with a sword. Jayanthi in her evidence in the High Court has stated that the three accused came on bicycles. But she has failed to maintain this fact in her statement made to the Police, at the inquest and the non-summary inquiry. According to Jayanthi soon after the attack on her brother she met her aunt Danawathie and told Danawathi that it was the 1st accused who killed her brother. She failed to maintain to Dhanawathie the fact that the 2nd and 3rd accused attacked her brother.

Court held when we consider all these matters, we think that Jayanthi is not a credible witness. The learned trial judge has considered the said contradictions and omissions. But he failed to appreciate the value of the said contradictions and omissions in deciding the credibility of Jayanthi.

It is important to note that in the above-mentioned authorities the contradictions and omissions which go to the root of the case should not be ignored lightly and the trial Judge should give proper attention when he finally decides whether the accused is guilty or not for the offence he was charged.

In the present case, PW 2 failed to mention Saman's name in the police statement. This is marked as an omission by the defence counsel.

Vide page 393 of the appeal brief is as follows;

In his police statement, PW 3 stated that he was not at the boutique until 1.00 pm and he failed to mention in his police statement that he was going to the boutique and coming out several times.

The weapon used was never produced in Court and was not identified by the Doctor as the weapon used for the murder. He could have identified the weapon and said that it could have caused the injuries. It can be argued that production in a case could have been considered circumstantial evidence against an accused. Learned counsel for the accused-appellant argued that when there is no cogent evidence given by eye-witnesses or when there is not sufficient evidence to warrant a conviction it would not always be necessary to produce the weapon which used for the crime. In the present case, the Prosecution failed to produce the weapon. The prosecution witnesses including PW 1 and PW 2 testified that the wound was caused by a knife. But the doctor said the weapon should be something longer than a knife.

According to PW 2, the accused-appellant stabbed the deceased only one time. But according to his evidence, it was revealed that he has not seen the incident.

According the story of the accused-appellant he says that his brother Saman was beaten by the deceased. Saman, with a bleeding ear, came to him and told him what happened. PW 4 also said that he saw that deceased slapped Saman. It was revealed by the accused-appellant that there was no animosity between him and the deceased. When they were passing the deceased house, the deceased came with a knife to them in an aggressive manner. The learned counsel for the accused-appellant submitted that he used his private defence and tried to prevent the attack by the deceased. When they were struggling together, the accused-appellant saw the bleeding on the deceased.

"The right is essential of defence, not retribution. As pointed out by Russell in Law of Crimes.

Page 16 of 17

The Text Book on the Indian Penal Code by K.D. Gaur, Fourth Edition at pages 178 and 179 are as follows;

A man is justified in resisting by force anyone who manifestly intends and endeavours by violence or surprise to commit a known felony against either his person, habitation or property. In these cases, he is not obligated to retreat, and may not merely resist the attack where he stands but may indeed pursue his adversary until the danger is ended and if in a conflict between them, he happens to kill his attacker, such killing is justifiable.

Chacko Mathai v State of Kerala AIR 1964 KER 222 was held as follows;

"The right of private defence is a highly prized gift granted to the citizen to protect themselves by effective self-resistance against unlawful aggression. No man is expected to fly away when he is attacked. He could fight back and when he apprehends death or grievous hurt could see that his adversary is vanquished without modulating his defence step by step. Faced with a dangerous adversary, no man can act with a detached reflection and under such circumstances, if he travels a little beyond the limit, the law protects him and hence courts should not place more restrictions on him than the law demands."

On the other hand, according to the prosecution witnesses, it reveals that the deceased was an aggressor. He had issues with his brother and he attacked Saman as well. According to prosecution evidence on that faithful day, he fought with his brother too.

It is a settled principle under criminal law that the prosecution should prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. When there are witnesses it is reasonable if one witness cannot recall the incident and testifies a different thing about the incident. But it is quite suspicious if all the witnesses tell different stories about the same points. The learned Counsel for the accused-appellant argued that when we consider the evidence of this case we can believe that there are no actual eyewitnesses. Prosecution witnesses contradicted the evidence given on material points which they gave in the examination in chief and cross-examination. They have given different versions.

The Evidence of PW 3 and PW 4 is based on hearsay evidence and several contradictions affect the root of the case. The learned counsel for the accused-appellant further argued that it is a cardinal principle that unreliable and unacceptable evidence cannot be rendered credible, simply because there is some corroborative material. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the shadow of a doubt. The benefit of the doubt, to which the accused is entitled, is reasonable doubt; the doubt which rational thinking men will reasonably, honestly and conscientiously entertain and not the doubt of a timid mind.

It is my view that the evidence of the accused-appellant attracts the plea of a grave and sudden provocation and self-defence. This court came to the said conclusion of the present appeal, considering the following evidence:

(I) The total absence of any pre-plan or premeditation: it is manifestly clear from the evidence led at the trial that the accused-appellant was provoked after his brother was assaulted by the deceased and later on when they met each other the deceased had come to attack the accused-appellant.

Page 17 of 17

(II) The appellant has further testified that the scuffle between him and the deceased had accidentally resulted on the deceased causing his death thereby attracting the plea of a grave and sudden provocation and self-defence as embodied in special exceptions 1 and 3 to section 294 of the Penal Code.

However, had the trial court considered the above-mentioned factors in its correct judicial perspective, the trial court would have come to an accurate factual finding that the accused-appellant caused the death of the deceased by accident upon being provoked by the deceased consequently affording the plea of a grave and sudden provocation to the accused-appellant. Not only that, this court can consider the accused-appellant must have used his right of private defence to protect himself when the deceased came to attack him.

I wish to say that the failure to take into account the afore-cited extenuating circumstances amounts to a non-direction resulting in a miscarriage of justice.

In this case, the appellant had proved the right of private defence and grave and sudden provocation and sudden fight. Even though the accused had acted excessively when inflicting the said injury using a big knife, the matters already discussed above indicate a sudden fight without premeditation and without taking any undue advantage in the heat of passion.

For the reasons set out above, I conclude that the learned trial Judge had misdirected himself by failing to evaluate the said material in favour of the accused-appellant. I, therefore, decide to set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge of Kalutara on 15.12.2015 and replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under section 297 of the Penal Code based on sudden fight and self-defence and impose a sentence of rigorous imprisonment for 7 years.

We direct that the sentence should take effect from the date of imposition. Therefore, the sentence imposed should take effect from 15.12.2015.

The appeal is allowed.

Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment along with the main case record to the High Court of Kalutara and a copy of the Judgement to the prison authorities forthwith.
