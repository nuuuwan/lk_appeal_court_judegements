PW4 has answered a question by the defence stating that a fracture of this kind could be caused by hitting with a club or a pole. However, her evidence was that the victim has received a gunshot that has caused the guttered laceration. The medical evidence does not support in any manner the position that the said guttered laceration could be caused by a club being thrown at or it being hit on the elbow.

Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating officer not going to the: root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the Court before whom the witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about the general tenor of evidence given by the witness, the appellate Court which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the trial Court and unless there are reasons weighty and formidable it would not be proper to reject the evidence on the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial details. 8.
