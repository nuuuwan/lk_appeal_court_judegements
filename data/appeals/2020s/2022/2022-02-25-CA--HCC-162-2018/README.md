Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence imposed on

him by the learned High Court judge of Anuradhapura, where he was

sentenced for a term of nine years rigorous imprisonment and a fine.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Anuradhapura for

committing the offence of rape of one Rasika Udayangani on 28th June 2012,

an offence punishable in terms of section 364(1) of the Penal Code as amended.

After trial, he was found guilty as charged and was sentenced as above. In

addition, he was also ordered to pay a compensation of rupees 100000/- to the

victim, in default an additional sentence of one-year rigorous imprisonment

was also imposed.

Facts in brief:

The prosecutrix (PW-01) has obtained the services of the appellant who was a

Kapu Mahaththaya (a person who performs rituals) to perform a ritual in order

to bring back her boyfriend who was making attempts to avoid and leave her. It

is evident that she was in real desperation as she has had sexual intercourse

Page 3 of 12

with him on his promise that he will marry her. As arranged previously, the

appellant has come to her brothers house where the prosecutrix also lived at

around 9.00pm. on 27-06-2012 and had performed the ritual. Upon hearing

that PW-01 has failed to follow the instructions given by him, the appellant has

returned to the house the next day (28-06-2012) informing that he has to

perform further rituals to make the situation right.

After telling the members of the household, including the sister-in-law and the

neighbour who was present, to leave the house and to go to the back garden,

and keep the doors and the windows open, he has informed PW-01 that some

oil needs to be applied to her female organ, for which the prosecutrix has

agreed. Lowering her under garments the appellant has performed the

mentioned act and the prosecutrix has felt dizzy as a result. Thereafter, the

appellant has made the prosecutrix to lie down on the floor of the house where

they were. Through dizziness she has seen that the appellant lowering his

trouser and climbing on her and without giving weight to the body the

appellant has forced his male organ into the vagina of the prosecutrix. It was

the evidence of the prosecutrix that she shouted through fear and called for the

sister who was outside, but no sound came out from her. It was stated that

before those who were outside came in, she cleaned the bloodstain that was on

the floor. The appellant has then asked the neighbour who was present to bring

a king-coconut for further rituals, but has left after applying some water on the

face of the prosecutrix.

Soon after he left, the prosecutrix has informed her sister-in-law (PW-02) as to

what happened, but they have decided not to complain to the police

immediately as arrangements have been made for an alms-giving in the house

for the next day, which no one wanted to disrupt. There is no dispute that the

complaint in this regard to the police has been made on 30th June 2012.

Under cross examination, the prosecutrix has explained her reasons for not

informing the sister-in-law that she was raped by the appellant while the

Page 4 of 12

appellant was still present in the house stating that because of the reputation

the appellant had as a Kapu Mahaththaya who can do evil things, she had no

courage to do so, but informed of what happened no sooner he left the house.

She has also admitted that she was not a virgin at that time because of the

previous sexual relationship she had with her boyfriend. She has also

explained that although she felt dizzy at the time, she could see and

understand what the appellant was doing and what happened to her.

The stand of the appellant had been that this was a false complaint against

him because of the prosecutrixs failure to pay him his fees for the performance

of the ritual which led to a verbal confrontation with the brother of the

prosecutrix.

Confirming the position of the prosecutrix the sister-in-law (PW-02) has stated

that no sooner the appellant left, she was informed of what happened, but

waited till the alms-giving is over to make a complaint to the police. It was her

evidence that rupees 7500/- was paid to the appellant and there was no

dispute as to the payments as alleged, and that there was no reason for her

sister to fabricate a story against the appellant.

PW-10 was the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who examined the prosecutrix on

30-06-2012 at 4.30 pm. in the teaching hospital Anuradhapura. His report has

been marked as P-01 at the trial. When examining her genital area, he has

observed a fresh healing deep posterior hymeneal tear at 6 O clock position

and was of the opinion that it was a result of recent sexual penetration. He was

firm in his opinion that this type of an injury occurs when a female is in a

sleeping position facing upwards and a male person inserting a penis from top

of her, considering the place of injury to the hymen of the prosecutrix.

Under cross examination, the JMO has stated that in the space where the

short history given by the patient needs to be mentioned in P-01, what was

written was a short summary in his words in English and not the exact words

spoken by the prosecutrix.

Page 5 of 12

After the closure of the prosecution case and when the appellant was called

upon for his defence, he has chosen to give evidence upon oath. He has

admitted that he went to the house of the prosecutrix on the 27th night to

perform a ritual and has stated that although he was promised a sum of

rupees 7500/- for his services, he was paid only a sum of rupees 500/- with a

promise to pay the balance later.

It was his evidence that he went to the house of the prosecutrix for a second

time at her request since it was informed to him by her that she has not

followed the instructions given by him on the previous day, and admits that he

went there at around 3.00-3.30 pm. on the day in question. It was his position

that he only performed a ritual on that occasion too and when wanted the

balance of the agreed amount be paid to him, the brother of the prosecutrix

who was drunk started scolding him in filth and also attempted to assault him.

It was his stance that a false complaint of this nature was made against him

due the mentioned dispute that arose with regard to the payment he

demanded.

At the hearing of the appeal the learned Counsel for the appellant urged the

following main grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

(1) The prosecutrix was not a credible witness hence, her evidence should

not have been relied on by the learned trial judge.

(2) The prosecution has failed to prove the penile penetration.

(3) Medial evidence was not conclusive and leading of medical evidence

before the prosecutrix gave evidence has caused prejudice to the

appellant.

(4) Infirmities in the judgment.

1st Ground of Appeal:

Although the learned Counsel for the appellant took pain to argue that the

evidence of the prosecutrix was not credible, I find no reasons to agree. One

has to understand the desperation of the prosecutrix who was 27 years of age

and had lost her virginity because of her association with her boyfriend, which

is cherished in our society. It is clear that in order to bring him back to her, the

prosecutrix and her family members have decided to seek the help of the

appellant.

He, being a Kapu Mahaththaya, who obviously had the ability to convince

people as to his abilities to perform rituals and with a reputation, it is clear

that the prosecutrix and her family members had faith in him. I am unable to

believe that such a person will not be paid the amount he demanded for the

ritual and any member of the family of the prosecutrix will dare to get into an

argument as alleged by the appellant with him over the payment, given his

reputation.

When the appellant came to the house for the second time the brother of the

prosecutrix had not been there. It is very much apparent that because of the

respect and the fear the appellant commanded, the prosecutrix and her family

members had believed him when he said that an additional ritual needs to be

performed.

It was the contention of the learned Counsel that the evidence that the

appellant asked the doors of the house to be kept open when he committed the

act as alleged, is not probable as no one would do such an act for anyone to

see. However, the evidence is that all the inmates of the house were sent to the

back garden of the house and anyone in the front side of the house and the

road cannot see what was happening inside due to its location.

Page 7 of 12

It is quite possible that the prosecutrix had allowed the appellant to apply oil

on the vagina of her under the circumstances mentioned above. And her saying

that she felt dizzy after it can be possible due to the fear factor.

Although she has felt dizzy it is clear that she was in a position to see and

understand what was happening to her. She has given evidence as to how the

appellant inserted his penis into her vagina. Her being unable to originate any

sound, although she has shouted for help can also be explained under the

circumstances. Her cleaning the floor of any blood before others could come to

the place where she and the appellant were and her not telling the sister what

happened while the appellant was still in the house are very much possible

scenarios in my view. Being the villagers that they are, waiting till the pre-

arranged alms giving is over before going to the police also can be

understandable.

Delay is a subjective factor which may vary according to circumstances. It was

held in the case of D. Tikiribanda Vs. Hon Attorney General 2010 BLR 92

that;

If delay of making a statement is explainable, the evidence of a witness

should not be rejected on that ground alone.

In Sumanasena Vs. Attorney General (1999) 3 SLR 138, it was held that;

Just because the witness is a belated witness, the Court ought not to

reject his testimony on that score alone. Court must inquire into the reason

for the delay and if the reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable, the

Court could act on the evidence of a belated witness.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the reasons for

the prosecutrix to wait till the morning of the 30th to make her police complaint

and had satisfied himself that it is not material given the circumstances, which

need no further scrutiny from this Court.

Page 8 of 12

I am of the view that when taken as a whole, the evidence of the prosecutrix is

highly probable which has not created any doubt as to her evidence that she is

telling the truth as to what she had to face at the hands of the appellant. I view

her as a credible and trustworthy witness.

For the reasons adduced as above, I find no merit in the first ground of appeal.

2nd ground of appeal: -

The prosecutrix has given clear evidence as to what happened to her after the

appellant applied some oil on her vaginal area and after she felt dizzy. The

appellant has asked the prosecutrix to lie down and she has seen the appellant

lowering his trouser and coming on top of her, and has felt the forceful

insertion of his penis into her vagina. She has even described how it was done

by the appellant without giving weight to her body. The JMO (PW-10) has

confirmed that there had been recent penile penetration of the vagina of the

prosecutrix and had been firm in his opinion that it has happened without

consent, given the position of the hymeneal tear he observed on the

prosecutrix. Hence, I find no merit in the argument that the prosecution has

failed to prove penile penetration.

3rd ground of appeal: -

It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the

prosecution has commenced the leading of the evidence of this action by calling

the JMO, and it has caused prejudice to the appellant. The basis for this

argument is that had he been called after the leading of the evidence of the

prosecutrix, the appellant could have been able to cross examine the JMO

based on the evidence of the prosecutrix.

It appears from the case record that as the JMO was present to give evidence

on the day it was first taken for trial, following the usual practice of obtaining

the evidence of official witnesses whenever they are available to give evidence,

the evidence of the JMO has been recorded. Although it would have been better

Page 9 of 12

if the evidence of the JMO was called after the evidence of the prosecutrix, I am

unable to agree that it has caused any prejudice to the appellant. The JMO has

been cross examined by the defence with a clear understanding of the medical

evidence of the JMO and his opinions expressed. Given the fact that he was not

an eyewitness to the incident and was only giving evidence based on his

examination of the prosecutrix two days after the alleged incident, I see no

basis to conclude that his answers would have been different had the PW-01

gave her evidence before him.

It would have been a different scenario had the learned High Court Judge has

also considered the evidence of the JMO before he considered the evidence of

the prosecutrix. It is clear from the judgment that the learned trial judge has

considered the evidence of the JMO only after being satisfied that the

prosecutrix is speaking the truth and after considering the other evidence, in

order to find whether the medical evidence is consistent with the version of

events as narrated by the prosecutrix.

In the case of D.Tikiribanda Vs. Hon Attorney General (supra) it was held:

When the medical report is consistent with the version of a sexually

harassed victim it can be taken as evidence consistent and thus from to

some extent corroboration and is admissible under section 157 of the

Evidence Ordinance (although that may not be corroboration in the strict

sense).

Hence, I find no merit in the mentioned ground of appeal either.

4th ground of appeal: -

The last ground of appeal pursued by the learned Counsel was that due to

several infirmities of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge, the

judgment cannot be termed a considered judgment, and it has caused

prejudice to the appellant. He cited the instant where it has been stated that it

was the prosecutrix who gave evidence first, whereas it was the PW-10 the

Page 10 of 12

JMO. Another point taken was that the learned trial judge has failed to

consider the evidence of PW-06 at all, in the judgment. It was also the position

of the learned Counsel that the learned trial judge has shifted the burden of

proof to the appellant when he stated at page 8 of the judgment (Page 226 of

the brief) that the appellant has failed to call evidence to prove the statements

made by him in giving evidence.

It is true that it was not the prosecutrix but the JMO who has given evidence

first in this action. However, the learned trial judge has rightfully not

considered his evidence first, but the evidence of the prosecutrix and the other

relevant witnesses. I am unable to find any basis to conclude that this has

caused any prejudice to the appellant. PW-06 was the WPC 3835 of

Rajanganaya Police who recorded the first complaint of the prosecutrix on the

30th of June 2012 and took charge of the frock she was wearing at the time of

the incident and the t-shirt she has used to clean the bloodstains on the floor

as productions. She has also accompanied the Officer in Charge (OIC) of the

Rajanganaya Police for the investigations and has produced the prosecutrix

before the JMO.

I find that none of these facts are disputed facts. It has been an admitted fact

that the complaint was made on the 30th. Although some productions have

been taken in, they have not been marked through the prosecutrix at the trial,

which makes them of no value, although the learned trial judge has

commented about the t-shirt mentioned by OIC when he gave evidence.

It is correct to say that the learned trial judge has commented that appellant

has failed to call additional evidence to substantiate his position, other than

his evidence. However, when taken as a whole, it is clear that the learned trial

judge has analyzed the evidence of the prosecution not based on the failures of

the defence, but on the evidence adduced by the prosecution to come to a firm

finding that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. I

find that at no point he has shifted the burden to the appellant.

Page 11 of 12

It is settled law that for the mentioned infirmities to be considered relevant,

they must cause prejudice to the appellant which amounts to a denial of a fair

trial to him.

The proviso of Article 138 of the Constitution reads as follows;

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

In Mannar Mannan Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1990) 1 SLR 280, it was

held:

The enacting part of sub-section (1) of section 334 mandates the Court to

allow the appeal where-

(a) The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having

regard to the evidence; or

(b) There is a wrong decision on any question of law; or

(c) There is a miscarriage of justice on any ground.

The proviso vests the discretion in the Court and recourse to it arises

only where the appellant has made out at least one of the grounds

postulated in the enacting part of the sub-section. There is no warrant

for the view that the Court is precluded from applying the proviso in any

particular category of wrong decision or misdirection on questions of law

as for instance, the burden of proof.

There is no hard and fast rule that the proviso is inapplicable where

there is non-direction amounting to misdirection in regard to the burden

of proof. What is important is that each case falls to be decided on the

consideration of;

Page 12 of 12

(a) The nature and intent of the non-direction amounting to a

misdirection on the burden of proof

(b) All facts and circumstances of the case, the quality of evidence

adduced and the weight to be attached to it.

The above mentioned is a case where the trial at the High Court was before a

jury, and decided on appeal under section 334 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, which has similar provisions in Article 138 of the Constitution

in the section itself. I find that the principles discussed in the said appeal are

of equal relevance to a determination of an appeal under the provisions of

section 335 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act of a trial held without a jury

before the High Court, in view of the Proviso to Article 138 of the Constitution.

I find that the mentioned infirmities in the judgment have not caused a

substantial prejudice to the rights of the appellant and had occasioned a

failure of justice to him.

For the aforementioned reasons, I find no merit in the appeal. The appeal

therefore is dismissed and the conviction and the sentence imposed on the

appellant affirmed.

However, considering the time taken for the conclusion of the appeal, which

was not due to any fault of the appellant, the sentence is ordered to run from

the date of the conviction, namely, 31-07-2018.
