This case concerns an application for revision in terms of Article 138 of

the Constitution. Weligamage Priyantha Botheju (hereinafter the

petitioner) pleads that in Magistrates Court of Jaffna Case No. B

936/2013, the learned Magistrate has erroneously released the impugned

vehicle bearing number 62-3928 to the respondent-respondent

CA-PHC-APN-05-2017 Page 4 of 8 15/12/2022 IJ-58-22

(hereinafter the first respondent), in contradiction to the prevailing law on

the subject.

The facts of the instant case are as follows. The petitioner claims that the

accused-respondent-respondent (hereinafter the second respondent) took

ownership of the impugned vehicle (a van) which was originally owned by

the petitioner, through fraudulent means by supplying the petitioner with

invalid cheques. After this initial transaction took place between the

petitioner and the second respondent, the ownership of the impugned

vehicle has passed onto several other people, until it was vested with the

first respondent. The police who have been tracking the said vehicle upon

complaints by the petitioner of cheque fraud, have finally seized the vehicle

while it was under the alleged ownership of the first respondent. The

impugned vehicle and the first respondent were produced before the

Magistrates Court of Jaffna under the case number B 936/2013 for an

inquiry under section 431 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

The learned Magistrate by order dated 11.03.2015 released the vehicle to

the first respondent, as the vehicle had been seized from his possession.

Thereafter, a separate case under section 403 of the Penal Code for

cheating and dishonestly inducting a delivery of property has been filed

against the second respondent pertaining to the alleged fraud committed

by him, which is currently in progress in Jaffna High Court. The petitioner

being aggrieved by the learned Magistrates decision to release the vehicle

back to the first respondent, has made a revision application to the High

Court of Jaffna, and the learned High Court judge has dismissed the

application and affirmed the learned Magistrates decision by order dated

27.07.2015. Thereafter, the petitioner has preferred the instant revision

application to this Court to have the above two decisions set aside and

release the impugned vehicle to the petitioner.

For ease of reference, section 431(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Code Act, No.15 of 1979 it reproduced below:

CA-PHC-APN-05-2017 Page 5 of 8 15/12/2022 IJ-58-22

(1) The seizure by any police officer of property taken under section 29

or alleged or suspected to have been stolen or found under

circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any

offence shall be immediately reported to a Magistrate who shall

forthwith make such order as he thinks fit respecting the

delivery of such property to the person entitled to the possession

thereof, or if such person cannot be ascertained respecting the

custody and production of such property.

(2) If the person so entitled is known the Magistrate may order the

property to be delivered to him on such conditions (if any) as the

Magistrate thinks fit. If such person is unknown the Magistrate may

detain it and shall in such case publish a notification in the court

notice-board and two other public places to be decided on by the

Magistrate, specifying the articles of which such property consists

and requiring any person who may have a claim thereto to come

before him and establish his claim within six months from the date

of such public notification.

(3) Such notification may also, if the Magistrate thinks fit, be published

at least once in newspapers published in Sinhala, Tamil and English

if the value of the property amounts to two thousand five hundred

rupees or more. (Emphasis added)

Punchinona v. Hinniappuhamy 60 NLR 518 is a case that bears

similarity to the instant case, and it concerned the corresponding provision

then in force (Section 419 of the Criminal Procedure Code) In this case

H.N.G. Fernando J, held, affirming Costa v. Peries 35 NLR 326 that;

[the Magistrates Court] has either to return the property to the same

person, or refuse to do so if it thinks it necessary to detain the property

for the purposes of proceedings before itit has no power under the

section to order property seized and removed from the possession of one

person to be given to another person, because the possession of property

cannot be lightly interfered withIf the Magistrate does not consider

official custody to be necessary, he has no alternative but to order

CA-PHC-APN-05-2017 Page 6 of 8 15/12/2022 IJ-58-22

delivery back to the person from whose possession the property was

seized.

Therefore, it is apparent that Section 431 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act is not a provision that confers the jurisdiction on the court

to decide disputed claims to possession, but bears the objective of

providing for the Magistrate to be promptly brought in to official touch with

the property seized by the Police.

And as per the dictum in Silva and Another v. Officer-in-Charge, Police

Station, Tambuttegama (1991) 2 SLR 83, there is a degree of discretion

vested in the Magistrate by section 431 of the Code (cited above) in that it

provides for the Magistrate to make an order as he thinks fit regarding the

delivery of an impugned property. Therefore, in exercising this discretion,

it is pertinent to determine whether the leaned Magistrate has considered

all the relevant factors and provided reasons for the decision. The learned

Magistrate has noted in his order that the petitioner has only taken steps

to make a police complaint five months after the transaction to transfer

the ownership to the second respondent, and by that time the ownership

has passed on to several people. It is also noted that all the documents

pertaining to the vehicle, namely, its registration, insurance documents,

revenue license, signed MTA6 Form etc. have all been handed over to the

second respondent, who claims that the transaction took place amicably.

These documents have thereafter been ultimately handed over to the first

respondent when he bought the impugned vehicle. The learned Magistrate

has also considered that the police investigations have not revealed that

the said vehicle has been utilized in any illegal activity, nor that the vehicle

was transferred from the petitioner to the second respondent through

coercion or force, but amicably. Based on such reasons the learned

Magistrate has deliberated on releasing the vehicle to the second

respondent.

CA-PHC-APN-05-2017 Page 7 of 8 15/12/2022 IJ-58-22

Bearing the above in mind, it is pertinent to evaluate the present revision

application against the thresholds stipulated in Article 138(1) of the

Constitution which states as follows:

(1) The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions

of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be [committed by the

High Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by

any Court of First Instance], tribunal or other institution and sole and

exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in

integrum, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things

[of which such High Court, Court of First Instance] tribunal or other

institution may have taken cognizance :

Provided that no judgement, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which

has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice. (Emphasis added)

In the milestone case of Bank of Ceylon v. Kaleel and Others [2004] 1 SLR 284

at page 287 (CA) it was held as follows:

In any event, for this Court to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order

challenged must have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly

erroneous which go beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an

ordinary person would instantly react to it. In other words, the order

complained of is of such a nature which would have shocked the

conscience of Court.

This view was reinforced by Edusuriya J in Vanik Incorporation Ltd v.

Jayasekara [1997] 2 SLR 365 (CA) where he stated that,

Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice

has occurred due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but

only when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive

miscarriage of justice.

CA-PHC-APN-05-2017 Page 8 of 8 15/12/2022 IJ-58-22

In line with the above well-established precedent, the present application should

be evaluated. The petitioner in her pleadings has failed to establish a strong case

depicting a positive miscarriage of justice, and a manifestly erroneous decision of

such a nature that would shock the conscience of the Court. She has only cited

Silva v. Officer-in-Charge (supra) on the interpretation of the phrase person

entitled to the possession and that the impugned vehicle is an item having

potential evidentiary value - fruits of the crime and thus should not be handed

over to the first respondent.

However, in line with the above evaluation of the section 431 of the Code and

Article 138 of the Constitution, the petitioner has failed to establish that the

learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge have made manifestly

erroneous orders of such a nature that would shock the conscience of the Court,

resulting in a failure of justice. For the above reasons, this Court affirms the order

of the Magistrate Court dated 11.03.2015 and order of the High Court dated

27.07.2015.

Application dismissed.
