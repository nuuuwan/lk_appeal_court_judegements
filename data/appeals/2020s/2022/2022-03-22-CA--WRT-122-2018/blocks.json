When anindustrial dispute has been referred under Section 3 (1)(d) or Section 4(1) of the IndustrialDisputes Act to an Arbitrator for settlement by arbitration, Section 17(1) of the said Act requiressuch Arbitrator to make all such inquiries into the dispute as he may consider necessary, heresuch evidence as may be tendered by the parties to the dispute and thereafter make such awardas may appear to him just and equitable. In my view, the word make as used in the saidprovision, has the effect of throwing the ball into the Arbitrators Court, so to speak, and requireshim to initiate what inquiries he considers are necessary. The Arbitrator is not simply called uponto hold an inquiry, where the ball would be in the Court of the parties to the dispute and, itwould be left to them to tender what evidence they consider necessary requiring the arbitrator tobe just a judge presiding over the inquiry, the control, and progress of which will be in the handsof the parties themselves or their Counsel",
