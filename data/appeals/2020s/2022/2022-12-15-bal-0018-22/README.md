Before: Menaka Wijesundera J.

Argued on: 22.11.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain for the suspect namely

Krishthombu Baduge Danushka Dilshan alias Kambel under the provisions of the

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses act.

A person by the name of Isuru Sampath had complained against the suspect for

allegedly assaulting him on 25.11.2021 and the police had produced under the

provisions of the instant act and the Magistrate had remanded him.

The main contention of the Counsel for the suspect is that the instant act had

been used against the suspect in order to deny him bail when the offence in

question do not fall within the provisions of the act.

The Counsel for the respondents objected to the application and said that the

complainant in the instant matter is related to a complainant where the suspect

friend is an accused.

But we are unable to see as to how that situation falls under the provisions of the

instant act.

But we note that the suspect has been in remand for over a period of one year

and we see that the complaint against the suspect is very vague with regard to

the definitions under this act hence we see this as an act which had abused the

provisions of the instant act which in turn violates the objectives of the statute.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed and this Court directs the learned

Magistrate to enlarge the above-named suspect on suitable conditions of bail

upon the receipt of this order.

As such the instant application is allowed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

Neil Iddawala J.

I agree.
