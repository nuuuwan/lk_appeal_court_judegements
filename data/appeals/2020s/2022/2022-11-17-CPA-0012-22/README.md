Before: Menaka Wijesundera J.

Neil Iddawal J.

Counsel: Palitha Fernando, PC for the Petitioner.

Yohan Abeywickrema, DSG for the State.

Argued on: 12.10.2022

Decided on: 17.11.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to set aside the order dated

17.9.2021 of the High Court of Panadura.

The Counsel for the suspect stated that the suspect had been arrested

by the Narcotics Bureau on the 4.5.2018 for the alleged possession of

100 grams of a substance suspected to be heroin under the provisions

of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act No 13 of 1984

The main contention of the Counsel for the suspect is that he is in

remand custody since his arrest without the trial concluding.

The state Counsel appearing for the Respondents objected to the

application.

The law pertaining to the instant application concerning bail is laid

under section 83 of the act which has very clearly stated that a suspect

arrested or charged under section 54 A and B of the act can be enlarged

on bail only upon exceptional instances by the High Court.

Page 4 of 5

The term exceptional has not been denied in the act but in numerous

cases decided by our Court had concluded that exceptional

circumstances vary from case to case. In the instant matter the

exceptionality is the delay in concluding the trail and the suspect

languishing in remand.

In the case of Attorney General Vs. Edirieera (Supra) it was held,

.Delay is always a relative term and the question to be

considered is not whether there was mere explicable delay, as when

there is a backlog of cases, but whether there has been excessive or

oppressive delay and this always depends on the facts and

circumstances of the case..

In the instant matter the indictment had been filed against the suspect

but the trial had not concluded according to the brief submitted to us,

therefore up-to-date if one may calculate the suspect had been in

remand for nearly five years, which in the opinion of this Court is

excessesive and oppressive.

Hence it is the considered opinion of this Court that ends of justice

will be met only by granting bail as decided in the case of Carder vs.

O.I.C Narcotics Bureau [2006] 3 SLR in page 74 at page 77 by Justice

Eric Basnayake.

As such the instant application for revision is allowed and the

impugned order of the High Court is set aside and we order the trial

judge to enlarge the suspect on suitable condition of bail.
