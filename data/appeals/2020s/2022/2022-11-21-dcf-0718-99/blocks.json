Thereafter the 8th Defendant says that the land described by the 8th Defendant in his statement of claim is a portion of the corpus in this case. On that basis he claims rights in the corpus and claims for the land described in his statement of claim in lieu of his rights. If that is the position of the 8th Defendant, he cannot admit the rights shown to the 3rd- 7th Defendants by the Plaintiff. If the 8th Defendant has rights in the corpus and if he is entitled to the land described in the statement of claim of the 8th Defendant in lieu of those rights then the rights shown to the 3rd - 7th Defendants in Plaintiffs pedigree has to be reduced. The name of the corpus in this case is Rambuk Hena. In the deed marked 1 it is described as Rambuk Hena. According to the averments in the statement of claim of the 8th Defendant he had purchased rights in a land called Mahakapalle Kale. The 8th Defendant has not satisfied the Court that it is a part of the corpus. He had not taken out a commission and shown the location of the land in the preliminary plan. The learned District Judge has come to the correct conclusion that the land claimed by the 8th Defendant is a different land. In any event the 8th Defendant has not produced the deed no. 15090 dated 04.07.1986 upon which he claim for those rights. Therefore, the Court cannot come to the conclusion that the 8th Defendant has undivided rights in the corpus.

That case has no application to this situation. Thilakrathnes case was a case between co-owners and one co-owner was attempting to establish a prescriptive right to the corpus against the other co-owners.
