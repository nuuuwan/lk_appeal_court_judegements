B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The instant application seeks to impugn an order of the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal (dated 20th January 2020) which dismissed the Petitioners appeal from the

National Police Commission, disabling him from being appointed to the rank of Deputy

Inspector General of Police and, thereafter, Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police.

The Petitioner seeks a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said order of the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal; a Writ of Mandamus to compel the Administrative Appeals Tribunal

(or in the alternative to compel the National Police Commission) to promote him to the

post of Deputy Inspector General of Police with effect from 1st December 2012, and

thereafter to promote him to the post of Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police with

effect from 1st December 2015.

Prior to determining the merits of this application, in the light of the objection that

has been raised by the Respondents, it is pertinent to deal with the jurisdictional

intricacies that this application entails. The objection is that the orders of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal are not subject to this Courts Writ jurisdiction. This is

because of the Constitutional ouster clause found in Article 155C of the Constitution,

originally introduced by the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, which shuts

out this Courts supervisory jurisdiction to inquire into decisions of the National Police

Commission, similar to the ouster clause found in Article 61A in relation to the Public

Service Commission. It is argued that subjecting the Administrative Appeals Tribunals

decisions to judicial review enables a disgruntled applicant an opportunity to do indirectly

what cannot be done directly by calling into question the decisions of the National Police

Commission which are insulated from this Courts extraordinary Writ jurisdiction. This

Page 5 of 14

Article, as it stood prior to its amendment by the Twentieth Amendment to the

Constitution, i.e., the provision as it stood at the time relevant to this application, reads:

Subject to the jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court [under Article 126 and the

powers granted to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under Article 155L], no court or tribunal

shall have the power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call in

question any order or decision made by the Commission or a Committee, in pursuance of any power

or duty, conferred or imposed on such Commission or Committee under this Chapter or under any

other law.

Article 155L makes provision for a police officer aggrieved by any order made by

the Commission to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal established under

Article 59. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has the power to alter, vary, rescind or

confirm any order or decision made by the Commission.

Thus, any public officer aggrieved by a decision of the National Police Commission

or a committee or public officer to whom the powers of the National Police Commission

have been delegated could challenge such decision, either by way of a fundamental rights

application in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution or by preferring an appeal to the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal in terms of Article 155L.

The Respondents argument is not new and has been rejected. For the purpose of

convenience, we will cite the relevant excerpts from the judgment of the Supreme Court

in A.M. Ratnayake v. Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2013] 1 SLR 331. Although this

judgment dealt with Article 61A of the Constitution which insulates the decisions of the

Public Service Commission from this Courts Writ jurisdiction, the privative clause is

similar to Article 155C. His Lordship Saleem Marsoof PC. J. (with their Lordships

Ratnayake J. and Imam J. agreeing) observed:

On the face of it, the above provision of the Constitution [Article 61A, prior to the

Nineteenth Amendment], which constitutes a Constitutional ouster of jurisdiction, does not apply

to the impugned decision of AAT, it being specifically confined in its application to the orders or

decisions of the Public Services Commission, a committee or any public officer made in pursuance

of any power or duty conferred or imposed on such Commission, or delegated to such Committee

or public officer under the relevant Chapter of the Constitution. There is no corresponding

provision in the Constitution, which seeks to oust the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under

Page 6 of 14

Article 140 of the Constitution in regard to a decision of AAT. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal

(AAT) was established in terms of Article 59 (1) of the Constitution, and its powers and procedures

have been further elaborated in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act No. 4 of 2002, which

contained in Section 8 (2) thereof an ouster clause which is quoted below:-

A decision made by the Tribunal shall be final and conclusive and shall not be called in

question in any suit or proceedings in a court of law.

Learned State Counsel has contended strenuously that since AAT has been constituted as

contemplated by Article 59 (1) of the Constitution, the Constitutional ouster of jurisdiction

contained in Article 61A of the Constitution will apply to AAT as well. He has further submitted

that one cannot do indirectly what he cannot do directly, and that a challenge to any order or

decision of AAT would amount to indirectly putting in question an order or decision of PSC.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted equally strenuously that what was sought to be

challenged in the Court of Appeal was a decision of AAT on an appeal from PSC and therefore a

decision of AAT can by no stretch of imagination be construed to be a direct or indirect challenge

of a decision of the PSC.

. we are of the view that in all the circumstances of this case, the Court of Appeal did

possess jurisdiction to hear and determine the application filed before it. AAT is not a body

exercising any power delegated to it by PSC, and is an appellate tribunal constituted in terms of

Article 59 (1) of the Constitution having the power, where appropriate, to alter, vary or rescind

any order or decision of the PSC. When refusing notice, the Court of Appeal has not held that it

has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in view of Article 61A of the Constitution,

and probably had other reasons for refusing notice. [emphasis added]

On this basis, the decisions and orders of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal

have been subject to this Courts supervisory jurisdiction. However, as there is no

guidance on the extent of review, there is no uniformity, in subsequent case law, as to the

extent to which such decisions can be reviewed. On a sample of cases, it is seen that whilst

some have exercised limited review so as to avoid overtly trespassing into

Constitutionally forbidden territory, there is on the other end of the spectrum dicta which

has been bold in venturing into seemingly forbidden territory. This uncertainty becomes

problematic when in reality it is not possible to distinguish the contours of the decisions

of the National Police Commission and that of the Tribunal. In such situations, quashing

the decision of the Tribunal will have the effect of calling into question the decision of the

Page 7 of 14

National Police Commission. (The same would be applicable in the context of the Public

Service Commission as well).

His Lordship Janak De Silva J. in P.S. Weeraratne v. Public Service Commission,

CA Writ 410/2009 decided on 03.05.2019, whilst refusing to grant reliefs that would

indirectly impugn the decisions of the Public Service Commission on the basis an

established rule of interpretation that a court cannot do indirectly what it is prohibited

from doing directly, held that there was no impediment to consider the relief which

sought a Writ of Certiorari to quash and set aside the decision of the Tribunal. The basis

of such relief is on the ordinary grounds of judicial review viz, Illegality, Irrationality, or

Procedural Impropriety.

Having considered this judgment his Lordship Arjuna Obeyesekere, J. in W.A.G.

Weerasinghe v. Director General, Department of Technical Education and Training CA

Writ Application 256/2018 decided on 19.03.2021 stated thus:

While agreeing with the above reasoning, I take the view that the jurisdiction of this Court

under Article 140 would be limited to a review of the decision of the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal and would not extend to quashing decisions of the Public Service Commission or of a

committee or public official to whom the powers of the Public Service Commission have been

delegated.

His Lordship, citing the celebrated passage from the landmark judgment of Lord

Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service 1985 AC 374

went on to consider whether the decision of the Tribunal was unreasonable or illegal.

Recently, his Lordship Sobhitha Rajakaruna J. in Deepthi De Silva v. Chairman,

Administrative Appeals Tribunal CA Writ 614/2021 decided on 26.05.2022 considered the

parameters of this Courts jurisdiction when reviewing an order of the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal on a decision of the Public Service Commission. The judgment of

Kalamazoo Industries v. Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training [1998] 1 SLR 235

was cited in order to distinguish between this Courts role as an appellate body and its

role when exercising judicial review. His Lordship while observing that this Court

exercises a limited jurisdiction concluded that a decision of the Tribunal would be

reviewed in the following circumstances:

Page 8 of 14

(a) where the members of the AAT who made the impugned decision did not have legal

authority to make such decision or

(b) if the AAT has acted contrary to principles of natural justice or

(c) issue an order which is eminently irrational or unreasonable or tainted with illegality.

His Lordship also cautions that the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under

Article 140 would be limited to a review of a decision of the AAT and would not extend to

quash the decisions of the PSC or of a committee or public official to whom the powers of

the PSC have been delegated.

An Order of his Lordship Yasantha Kodagoda PC. J. in G.L.U. Sanjeewa

Godawatte v. National Police Commission CA Writ 92/2019 delivered on 8.11.2019, also

helpfully delineates the considerations this Court should bear in mind when dealing with

an application of this nature. As his Lordship cautioned, this Court has to protect itself

from being used as an additional layer of appeal in the thin guise of an application

seeking a Writ. The refusal to issue a Writ of Certiorari was based on the following

considerations:

(a) The Petitioner has not pointed out any ground upon which it can be concluded that the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal had in the consideration of the Appeal presented to it, acted

ultra-vires its statutorily conferred powers...

(b) The Petitioner has failed to establish that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had

acted in breach of the Rules of Natural Justice or violated any other procedural or substantive legal

requirement in the consideration of the Appeal presented to it by the Petitioner.

(c) There is no material indicative of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal having not taken

into consideration any relevant fact or having taken into consideration any irrelevant fact.

(d) The decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is cogent, and is based on reasons

that cannot be validly impugned. It is rational and based on the attendant facts and circumstances.

Page 9 of 14

(e) The Petitioner cannot claim that he had a legitimate entitlement to obtain redress since

the Petitioner does not possess the required minimum qualifications to be absorbed into the

Regular service of the Sri Lanka Police.

A case falling on the other end of the spectrum is Nishantha Tilak Minuwangoda

v. National Police Commission CA Writ 58/2019 decided on 07.04.2022. His Lordship

S.U.B. Karalliyadde J. issuing a Writ of Certiorari quashed the decisions of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal as well as the National Police Commission for their

decisions to dismiss the Petitioners appeal which were devoid of reasons.

Judicial Review is limited to reviewing the lawfulness of a decision or an order.

The traditional grounds of review are illegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety

(which encapsulates the rules of natural justice). As his Lordship Somawansa J. generally

observed in Pradeshiya Sabawa, Hingurakgoda v. Karunaratne [2006] 2 SLR 410 the

grounds on which Writs of Certiorari issue are: (a) acting in excess of jurisdiction or ultra

vires; (b) breach of a mandatory provision or rule; (c) breach of rules of natural justice; (d)

error of law on the face of the record.

Other ancillary grounds such as proportionality and the doctrine of legitimate

expectations are also now well recognised in our case law.

At this juncture, therefore, we are of the view that the extent of review that can be

undertaken when a decision of an Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been impugned

cannot be limited jurisdiction. It would involve a review that this Court would generally

undertake in any other Writ matter. Because if the decision of the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal which has affirmed a decision of the Commission is void, for breach of one of

those grounds of review, then the decision of the Commission, which the Tribunal affirmed

would in substance be called into question. To use the case facts of Delapolage Lakmini

Delapola v. Justice Imam & Others CA Writ 263/2013 decided on 26.07.2019, as an

example, his Lordship Nawaz J. found on a careful consideration it is quite manifest that

the Petitioner has been disadvantageously treated and relegated to her peril. Despite this

clear evidence of illegality, the PSC proceeded not to hold in favour of the Petitioner

[emphasis added]. This may appear to be an interpretation that flies in the face of Article

155C (or even Article 61A) because it enables a disgruntled applicant to indirectly

challenge a decision of the National Police Commission (or the Public Service Commission)

Page 10 of 14

when such decisions cannot be directly called in question because of the respective

privative clauses. Yet, as alluded to above, in substance such decisions are in fact called

into question. To circumvent this difficulty his Lordship Nawaz J. issued a

Mandamusfied-Certiorari sending the matter back to the Tribunal to rehear the appeal,

having set aside the impugned order. A similar approach was adopted by his Lordship

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J. in the case of Locomotive Operators Engineers Union v. Justice

N.E. Dissanayake CA Writ 339/2019 decided on 22.09.2021 as well.

While bearing in mind that interpreting the Constitution is beyond this Courts

Constitutional competence, a plain reading of the respective Articles itself rebuts that

rule of interpretation since the decisions of the Commission is subject to Article 155L

(in the case of the Public Service Commission, subject to Article 59). Although the Article

states that no court or tribunal shall have the power to inquire into a decision of the

National Police Commission, it deliberately creates an exception by subjecting it to the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That Article permits the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal as an appellate body to alter, vary, rescind or confirm any order or decision of

the National Police Commission. To use the words of his Lordship Nawaz J. in

Delapolage (supra):

Even in an appellate jurisdiction, the Appellate body is empowered to correct errors of law

and fact and the AAT enjoys the competence to vary or rescind a decision of the PSC when it is

tainted with an error of law and fact. If the PSC has given effect to a decision of a public officer

who has clearly exceeded his powers, it is within the jurisdiction of the AAT to go within the merits

of that decision in its appellate jurisdiction and set it right if it turns out to be erroneous on the

facts or law.

A view espoused by his Lordship S.N. Silva J. (as he then was), although not in the

context of the present discussion, in Halwan v. Kaleelul Rahuman [2000] 3 SLR 50:

The appellate jurisdiction save in instances where it is restricted to questions of law will

encompass the merits and the legality of the impugned order. In our context it is appropriate to

describe the appellate jurisdiction as the ordinary jurisdiction and review by way of Writs of

Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus as the extraordinary jurisdiction.

As per the Constitutional provisions, whilst a decision of the National Police

Commission is insulated from this Courts supervisory jurisdiction, the orders and

Page 11 of 14

decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which acts as an appellate body over

the decisions of the National Police Commission are not so insulated. As observed by his

Lordship Marsoof J. in Ratnayake (supra) There is no corresponding provision in the

Constitution, which seeks to oust the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 140

of the Constitution in regard to a decision of AAT.

The Legislature purported to insulate such decisions from judicial review by the

inclusion of a preclusive clause in the ordinary legislation i.e. the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal Act No. 4 of 2002, which set out the Tribunals powers and procedures. Section

8(2) of the Act provided that the decisions of the Tribunal are final and conclusive and

shall not be called in question in any suit or proceedings in a court of law. Yet, the well-

settled proposition of law that this Courts Writ jurisdiction conferred by Article 140 of

the Constitution cannot be ousted by ordinary legislation (Vide Atapattu v. Peoples Bank

[1997] 1 SLR 208) has the effect of making that provision ineffective.

The ineffectiveness of Section 8(2) against this Courts ample Writ jurisdiction is

evident from the following dicta:

His Lordship Yasantha Kodagoda PC. J. in G.L.U. Sanjeewa Godawatte (supra)

observed:

Furthermore, Section 8(2) of Act No.4 of 2002 provides that a decision made by the

Tribunal shall be final and conclusive and shall not be called in question in any suit or proceedings

in any court of law. However, it is settled law that, notwithstanding such finality and ouster clause,

a person aggrieved by a decision of the Tribunal may seek judicial review from this Court by way

of Writ, as it is a Constitutional remedy.

His Lordship Samayawardhena J. in Wickramasinghe Arachchilage Waruna

Sameera v. Justice Imam & Others CA Writ 73/2016 decided on 20.02.2019, having

analyzed a range of judicial authorities, held that Section 8(2) does not operate as a

blanket prohibition on the Court of Appeal to exercise writ jurisdiction over the decisions

of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Thus, either intentionally or by oversight, the Constitution has omitted to include

a Constitutional Ouster against decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Page 12 of 14

Therefore, when there is no Constitutional bar to review the decisions of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and when the Constitutional Ouster in Article 155C is

itself subject to Article 155L, thereby appearing to refute that rule of interpretation What

cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly (Quando aliquid prohibetur ex directo,

prohibetur et per obliquum), this Court can exercise its Writ jurisdiction in respect of

decisions and orders of Administrative Appeals Tribunals, which may also, in substance,

result in examining the decision of the National Police Commission, which at times may

be inseparable in reality from the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. For

example, if the decision of the Commission is found to be tainted by illegality, which is

an umbrella term for an entire set of sub-grounds such as the doctrine of relevancy,

improper motives, purpose, etc. and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal upholds the

same then if this Court quashes the decision of the Tribunal, in reality, the propriety of

the decision of the National Police Commission is called into question as well. If the

Tribunal has independently, for reasons different from that of the Commission made a

decision, then this Court can draw a distinction between the decision of the Tribunal and

that of the Commission, and consequently, a review can be undertaken only of the

Tribunals decision. Although theoretically possible, in reality, the distinction is not neat.

However, although this Court undertakes a review of the decision of the Tribunal,

and by extension a review of the decision of the National Police Commission, in situations

where both those decisions are in reality not separable, we are of the view that this Court

should not grant mandates in the nature of writs to quash the decisions of the National

Police Commission. An approach adopted by their Lordships Nawaz J. and Rajakaruna J.

is preferable to overcome this muddle until there is clarification from the Supreme Court.

That is, the matter can be remitted to the Tribunal for a fresh inquiry.

The above is different from a situation where the decisions of the National Police

Commission have not been appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In such a

situation, the Commissions decisions are insulated from review. If a disgruntled

applicant seeks to directly have the decision of the Commission judicially reviewed, then

this Court will be slow to review it as Article 61A stands firm. But the decisions of the

Commission are not insulated when an appeal has been made to the Tribunal, which then

undertakes a complete inquiry, as there is no Constitutional Ouster directly standing in

our way.

Page 13 of 14

Having appreciated the parameters of judicial review this Court can undertake

when a decision or order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is impugned, we will now

assess the claims of the Petitioner.

The Petitioner, as narrated in the Petition, is a retired Senior Superintendent of

Police who joined the Police force as a Sub-Inspector in 1982. Having successfully risen to

the ranks of Inspector of Police, Chief Inspector of Police, Field Assistant Superintendent

of Police of the Special Task Force, Assistant Superintendent of Police, Field

Superintendent of Police, and Superintendent of Police respectively in

1986,1992,1994,2000,2007 and 2008, he was finally appointed as a Senior Superintendent

of Police with effect from 1st December 2013. The Petitioner, a recipient of many medals

during his time of service, also functioned as, inter alia, the Acting Commandant of the

Special Task Force and the Director (Training) of the Special Task Force. On the 23rd of

January 2017, upon attaining the mandatory age of retirement (sixty years), he retired

from the Police force.

In 2016, prior to his retirement, the Petitioner requested to ante-date his

promotion as an Assistant Superintendent of Police from 1st December 2000 to 1st

December 1994, the date on which he was appointed as the Field Superintendent of the

Police, and to commensurately accord the Petitioner other ranks which he would be

entitled to as a result of such ante-dating. The National Police Commission acceded to

this request. The Petitioner, yet again, in 2017, requested the ante-dating of his promotion

as Superintendent of Police from 1st December 2008 to 1st December 2002, and Senior

Superintendent of Police from 1st December 2013 to 1st December 2007. The National

Police Commission acceded to this request as well. As a result of ante-dating his

promotion to the rank of Senior Superintendent of Police to 1st December 2007, he

contends that he then became eligible to be promoted to the rank of Deputy Inspector

General of Police on 1st December 2012, and the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police

with effect from 1st December 2015. This, together with his five-year service in the rank

of Senior Superintendent of Police, led him to seek an opportunity to participate in an

interview for the promotion to the rank of Deputy Inspector General of Police.

The National Police Commission, by letter dated 11th September 2017 (P9)

informed the Inspector General of Police that the Petitioner is not eligible to be called for

the said interview. The Petitioner made an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal

Page 14 of 14

but withdrew the said appeal. A fresh appeal was made to the National Police

Commission. The Commission dismissed this second appeal on the basis that this matter

had previously been determined by the Commission (P11). An appeal was made to the

Tribunal. This appeal was dismissed by Order dated 20th January 2020 (P12). The

Tribunal considered the observations of the Commission. These were, among others, that

the Appellant had failed to complete five years of active and satisfactory service and

earned five increments during that period; that he did not pass the relevant Efficiency

Bar examinations.

The Tribunal decided that he cannot be appointed to the rank of Deputy Inspector

General of Police. This is because, among other reasons, the post of Deputy Inspector

General is a vacancy-based appointment made on an approved scheme of recruitment; it

is not a Grade-to-Grade promotion that is not restricted to cadre vacancies. It also noted:

An appointment is made by calling for interviews by a Panel of interviewers where marks

are given for merit and seniority. Officers who had obtained the highest marks are selected for

appointment, such appointments are made strictly to fill the available cadre vacancies;

Appointments are given only to officers who able to serve in the said appointments in the future

We see no reason to interfere with the Order of the Tribunal, which appears to

have duly given its mind to this appeal, independent of that of the Commission. The

Administrative Appeals Tribunal has not acted illegally, irrationally, or in breach of the

rules of natural justice. The Petitioner has been unable to satisfy the elementary criteria

set out in Rule 10.3.1. in the applicable Scheme of Recruitment (R1), and it is premature

to claim entitlement to such an appointment when other preliminary requisites such as

efficiency examinations and interviews have not been successfully completed, the result

of those cannot be assumed to be in ones favour. The promotion is not automatic, or

routine. This application is therefore dismissed without costs.
