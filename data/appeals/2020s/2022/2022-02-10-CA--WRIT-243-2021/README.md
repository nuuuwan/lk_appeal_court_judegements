tendered on behalf of the 1st and 3rd Respondents: 14.12.2021

tendered on behalf of the 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th to 30th, 33rd, 34th, 36th

to 39th, 41st to 43rd Respondents: 07.12.2021

Decided on : 10.02.2022 Sobhitha Rajakaruna J. A vacancy in the Petitioner Company for an Accountant of the Grade A-5 was advertised

in a newspaper and Mr. M.G.D.D. Premathilaka (Mr. Premathilaka) was selected from

among the applicants and appointed as the Grade A-5 Finance Manager. Though the basic

monthly salary for the said position was Rs. 37,660.00, the Petitioner Company took steps

to add an additional amount equivalent to 12 increments to Mr. Premathilakas salary,

thus awarding him a monthly salary of Rs. 45,500.00 with effect from 01.07.2007. This

addition of 12 increments to Mr. Premathilaka's salary created a discrepancy in the salaries

of executive officers of the same grades as well as the higher grades.

Mr. W.A.N.A. Fernando (Mr. Fernando), who has been placed at a higher position than

Mr. Premathilaka, upon learning of the said increased salary awarded to Mr. Premathilaka

challenged the awarding of such 12 increments at once. Mr. Fernando, who belongs to

Grade A-4 drawing a monthly salary of Rs.41,010.00, was also consequently awarded an

increased monthly salary of Rs.48,390.00 by adding an amount equivalent to 10

Page 8 of 19

increments. This worsened the discrepancy in the salaries of executive officers who were

in Grades A-5, A-4, A-3, A-2 and A-1.

Therefore, 43 executive officers of the Petitioner Company sought a salary hike to keep

them in line with the additional increments paid to Mr. Premathilaka and Mr. Fernando

with effect from 01.07.2007 in view of the discrimination and unfairness caused to them.

Instead of taking steps to eliminate the discrimination and unfairness caused, the

Petitioner Company continued to pay the increased amounts as special allowances to

Mr. Premathilaka and Mr. Fernando from July 2007.

Subsequently those executive officers made a complaint to the Commissioner of Labour

as the Petitioner failed to adhere to their request. The Minister of Labour exercising his

powers conferred by Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, referred this dispute to an

Arbitrator on 12.08.2009. The relevant reference to Arbitration is as follows;

"Whether any injustice was caused to the forty three (43) employees of the Ceylon Petroleum

Storage Terminals Limited who belong to its executive Grades A5 to A1 and whose names

are referred to in the attached schedule, in consequence of the payment of special allowance,

in addition to the basic salary as applicable only in respect of two other executive officers in

the similar grades and any injustice was caused, what relief should be granted to each of them

by the company."

The Arbitrator limited his inquiry only in respect of the 40 officers who submitted their

affidavits out of the above 43 employees who complained to the Petitioner Company. The

main issue identified by the Arbitrator was to determine whether injustice has been caused

to those 40 officers belonging to Grades A-5 to A-1 due to the additional payments made

only to Mr. Premathilaka and Mr. Fernando, and if so, what relief should be awarded to

each of them by the Petitioner Company.

Three witnesses gave evidence on behalf of the applicant party at the arbitration and the

only witness who gave evidence on behalf of the Petitioner Company was its Deputy

General Manager (Human Resources Management), Mr. P.D.P. Dharmawansa. Based

on the evidence, the Arbitrator accepts that the awarding of a salary with 12 increments to

Mr. Premathilaka and a salary with 10 increments to Mr. Fernando created a salary

Page 9 of 19

discrepancy among the 40 officers whose names are mentioned in the letter dated

30.01.2019 annexed to the Award of the Arbitrator.

Finally, the Arbitrator concluded that each of the 40 applicants are to be awarded

Rs.6,000.00 each for a period of 3 years and 3 months, amounting to a total of

Rs.234,000.00 each. This period of 3 years and 3 months commences from 01.07.2007 and

ends on 01.12.2010. The Arbitrator has limited this period until 01.12.2010 due to the fact

that the Human Resources Manager of the Company had issued a letter to discontinue the

payment of the special allowances with effect from 01.12.2010 to Mr. Premathilaka and

Mr. Fernando based on a decision of the Board of Directors of the Petitioner Company.

The Petitioner claiming that the award dated 30.01.2019 (Award) and the Gazette

Extraordinary No.2133/44 dated 25.07.2019 by which the said Award was published,

marked P3 and P4 respectively, are inter alia ex facie illegal, irrational, unlawful,

arbitrary and accordingly, seek inter alia for a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari

quashing the said Award. The Respondents raised several preliminary objections and

submitted that this Court cannot grant the reliefs sought by the Petitioner.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the 4th, 6th 8th, 10th 30th, 33rd, 34th, 36th 39th

& 41st - 43rd Respondents (Respondents) is that the Award has been communicated to the

Petitioner along with the covering letter dated 08.08.2019 by the Commissioner of Labour

and however, the Petitioner has filed its application only on 27.04.2021 and that is 20

months after acknowledging the said notice of the Award. The Respondents have cited

several judgements and have submitted that an application for a Writ of Certiorari should

be filed within a reasonable time from the date of the order, which the applicant seeks to

have quashed.

The Respondents have cited the case of Jayaweera vs. Assistant Commissioner of

Agrarian Services Ratnapura and Another (1996) 2 SLR 70, in which F.N.D. Jayasuriya

J. held;

"A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of certiorari is not

entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even if

he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a discretion to deny him having regard to his conduct,

Page 10 of 19

delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction- are all valid impediments which stand

against the grant of relief"

I have drawn my attention to the following paragraph in the case of Biso Menika vs. Cyril

de Alwis and Others (1982) 1 SLR 368 (p. 379,380) a Judgement which was among those

referred to by the learned Counsel for the Respondents. Sharvananda J. has observed in

that case as follows;

"When the Court has examined the record and is satisfied the Order complained of is

manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction the Court would be loathe to allow the mischief

of the Order to continue and reject the application simply on the ground of delay, unless there

are very extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection

Unlike in English Law or in our Law there is no statutory time limit within which a

petition for the issue of a Writ must be filed. But a rule of practice, has grown which insists

upon such petition being made without undue delay. When no time limit is specified for

seekiing such remedy, the Court has ample power to condone delays, where denial of Writ to

the petitioner is likely to cause great injustice. The Court may therefore in its discretion

entertain the application in spite of the fact that a petitioner comes to Court

late, especially where the Order challenged is a nullity for absolute want of

jurisdiction in the authority making the order..." (Emphasis added)

The other preliminary objection raised by the Respondents is based on suppression and

fraudulent misrepresentation of material facts. The Respondents referring to the letter

marked P7 assert that the Petitioner has sought time to consider taking action upon the

impugned order and accordingly, the Petitioner had absolutely not made any inclination

to challenge the Award. The Respondents further submit that the nature of the letter

marked P7 amounts to a gross misrepresentation and it demonstrates the fraudulent

conduct of the Petitioner.

However, on perusal of the said letter P7, I observe that the said letter has been signed

by the Legal Officer on behalf of the Chief Legal Officer of the Petitioner Company, who

has only authority in this regard, in my view, to make recommendations to the Board of

Directors based on the legal consequences in taking such decisions. The said Legal Officer

Page 11 of 19

has categorically indicated by P7 that a Board Paper has to be submitted in respect of the

said Award.

Further, the following contents of paragraph 42 (iii) of the Petition has been drawn to the

attention of this Court by the learned Counsel for the Respondents;

"...the composition of the Board of Directors of the Petitioner company finally crystallized

only after the conclusion of the General Elections held in August 2020, and there was

confirmation in respect of the continuation of the Board of the Petitioner, and furthermore,

the regular functioning of the New Board commenced only thereafter;"

The said learned Counsel making forceful submissions contended that the explanations as

given above by the Petitioner are a fraudulent attempt to mislead Court and the Petitioner

being a limited liability company duly incorporated under the Companies Act has a

separate and continuing corporate personality. Accordingly, he argued that the Petitioner

cannot allege that its Board of Directors cease to function with approach of Elections and

the Petitioners excuses in this regard are nothing short of laughable and amount to a

blatant attempt to mislead court and make a mockery of these proceedings. The

Respondents rely upon the judgement in Namunukula Plantations Limited vs. Minister

of Lands (2019) 1 SLR 365 (p. 378) where Marsoof PC, J. held as follows:

If any party invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of a Court of Law is found wanting in

discharge of its duty to disclose all material facts, or is shown to have attempted to pollute

the pure stream of justice, the Court not only has the right but a duty to deny relief to such

person"

In opposition to the preliminary objections raised by the Respondents, the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner argued that the Arbitrator has erred by failing to take cognisance of the

fact that the disputed higher salary steps were discontinued with effect from 01.12.2010 as

a consequence to the complaints made by the applicants. This decision has been taken by

a subsequent Board of Directors of the Petitioner Company and as a consequence Mr.

Premathilaka and Mr. Fernando were given a reduced salary which was on par with their

peers in Grade A-5 and A-4. The Petitioner argued that the Arbitrator could not grant the

4th to 43rd Respondents, the said special allowance that was paid erroneously to

Mr.Premathilaka and Mr. Fernando.

Page 12 of 19

It is observed that the impugned discrepancy has been subsequently accepted as causing

issues and the said allowance was discontinued in an alleged bona fide endeavour by a

subsequent Board of the Petitioner Company. By letter dated 17.12.2010 (marked H at

the arbitration proceedings) the Human Resources Manager of the Petitioner Company

has informed the Finance Manager that the Board of Directors at the board meeting held

on 28.10.2010 had decided to withdraw the payment of special allowance of Rs.7,840.00

(per month) paid to Mr. Premathilaka and the payment of special allowance of

Rs.7,380.00 (per month) paid to Mr. Fernando. It should be noted that the said Board

decision to discontinue the payment of special allowance was taken subsequent to the

reference to arbitration and whilst the arbitration proceedings were pending. The

Arbitrator in paragraph 21 of his Award has taken cognisance of discontinuing the

payment of the said special allowance and however, has decided that the salary anomaly

created continued to be existed and such dispute has not come to an end.

In view of the foregoing, a reasonable question arises as to whether there is a serious

question on illegality or irrationality to be decided in respect of the Arbitrators Award

which outweighs the strength of the preliminary objections on laches and on

misrepresentation.

The following passage in Kalamazoo Industries Ltd vs. Minister of Labour and

Vocational Training and Others (1998) 1 SLR 235 is apt here. F.N.D. Jayasuriya J. in

that case has held;

Relief by way of certiorari in relation to an award made by an arbitrator will be forthcoming

to quash such an award only if the arbitrator wholly or in part assumes a jurisdiction

which he does not have or exceeds that which he has or acts contrary to principles of natural

justice or pronounces an award which is eminently irrational or unreasonable or is guilty of

an illegality." (Emphasis added)

Now, I advert to examine as to whether the Arbitrator has pronounced an Award which

is irrational or unreasonable or is guilty of illegality.

In an important ex cathedra statement of the grounds for judicial review Lord Diplock

preferred the term irrationality, explaining it as what can by now be succinctly referred

Page 13 of 19

to as Wednesbury unreasonableness1. But it is questionable whether irrationality is a

better word2. Virtually all administrative decisions are rational in the sense that they are

made for intelligible reasons, but the question then is whether they measure up to the legal

standard of reasonableness. Irrational most naturally means devoid of reasons whereas

unreasonable means devoid of satisfactory reasons3 (Vide - H.W.R. Wade & C.F.

Forsyth, Administrative Law, 11th edition, chapter 11, p.295)

It is an undisputed fact during the proceedings before the Arbitrator that the payments

made to Mr. Premathilaka and Mr. Fernando has created an anomaly in respect of the

salaries of the relevant executive officers of the Petitioner Company. Accordingly, I have

no option other than referring to such payment of special allowance as an erroneous act

done by the authorities of the Petitioner Company, by which Mr. Premathilaka & Mr.

Fernando have become unjustly enriched.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner making extensive submissions contended that the

Arbitrator has effectively attempted to cure an irregularity by causing another and

accordingly, two wrongs cannot make a right in law and further, the Arbitrator has strayed

beyond his mandate. It is extremely important to highlight here the averments in

paragraph 4 of the Petition of the Petitioner and the submissions made by the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner based on those averments. The Petitioner pleads that the Award,

inter alia, offends the principles of proportionality, reasonableness, fairness and rationality

in as much as;

i. the Arbitrator has erroneously embarked on a voyage of discovery, by straying

well beyond the scope of the reference to Arbitration, and furthermore, has been

demonstrably guided by irrelevant considerations;

ii. the Arbitrator has erred in holding that there was discrepancy in salaries in

Grades A-3 to A-1, which could not have been the case, and indeed, could not

have arisen, in as much as the allowance in issue, did not take the salaries of

the said two employees (who were in the lower Grade A-5 and A-4) over and

Page 14 of 19

above the salaries of those employees in the said superior grades, and there was

in any event, no evidence adduced by the Applicants to demonstrate the same;

iii. the Arbitrator erred in fact and in law in purporting to determine that even with

the cancellations of the special allowance, with effect from 01.12.2010 (by the

letter dated 17.12.2010), the salary discrepancy in the executive Grades of the

Petitioner company did not cease and still continued, whereas, the said finding/

determination cannot withstand objective scrutiny and indeed cannot be

reconciled by any parity of reasoning, the same is patently erroneous, and is

accordingly, vitiated in law;

iv. the Arbitrator erroneously purported to determine inter alia, that in making the

impugned award, he has taken into consideration the financial impact on the

Petitioner company, and that the impugned award in fair by the Petitioner

company, whereas, the impugned Award indicates to the contrary, and cannot

be reconciled, in as much as the total Award amounts to as much as

Rs.9,360,000.00;

v. the Arbitrator erred by failing to appreciate that the sums awarded by him are

not commensurate with the relevant starting salaries of the 4th to 43rd

Respondents, and in any event, subsequent to the reference to Arbitration, the

same was discontinued, and thereby, the purported grievance/ cause of action

ceased to exist, and now, by the impugned Award, the Petitioner company is

effectively being compelled to retrospectively grant a discontinued special

allowance to the 4th to 43rd Respondents;

vi. the Arbitrator erred by failing to take cognizance of the fact that, in any event,

no seniority of any employee was violated, and nor was there any continuation

of the payment in issue, warranting the impugned Arbitration Award;

vii. the Arbitrator erred by failing to take cognizance of the fact that in as much as

the purported discrepancy was subsequently accepted as causing issues, and the

allowance was discontinued in a bona fide endeavour by the subsequent Board

of the Petitioner Company, the Applicants thereafter, had no remaining

purported cause of action, nor grievance in terms of the law, nor most

significantly, any legitimate expectation, and the only matter outstanding if at

all, was the recovery of the additional payment from the said employees, which

in any event, the Arbitrator conceded, was beyond the scope of his mandate;

Page 15 of 19

viii. the Arbitrator erred by failing to take cognizance of the fact that the two

employees concerned, who received the special allowance, was in the Finance

Function/division, and they bore wholly different and unique qualifications,

and were in positions with a completely distinct and separate class and

character from the rest of the Applicants who were serving in other functions/

divisions, which will be dully elucidated;

ix. in as much as the said dispute was in respect of two employees in Grades A-5

and A-4 receiving a special allowance, the other employees in superior grades,

ranging from Grade A-3 to A-1, could not have been affected under any

circumstances whatsoever, by any parity of reasoning, and indeed they were

not affected at all, in as much as they were of completely different grade,

drawing a higher salary, and having unique and distinguished qualifications,

and being in a completely different class of persons i.e. they fall within a class

that has an intelligible differentia;

x. the Arbitrator erred by failing to take cognizance of the fact that merely because

the gap between the salaries of employees in two different Grade was reduced

(during the period in issue), the same does not warrant the awarding of a higher

salary to those in said higher Grades i.e. A-3 to A-1. The impugned Award and

its logic or more correctly, its lack of logic, is patently flawed by any parity of

reasoning, and is vitiated in law.

(Vide - paragraph 4, pages 7-11 of the Petition of the Petitioner)

The learned Counsel for the Respondents rejecting the above arguments of the Petitioner

contended that the relevant point in time to determine when the arbitration commenced

is the date of reference to arbitration and what should be considered is whether in civil law

terms, there was a cause of action as at that date. Therefore, he supports the finding of the

Arbitrator, elaborated in paragraph 21 of the Award by which emphasis has been made

that the salary anomaly existed or continued even after the stoppage of the payment of the

special allowance to Mr. Premathilaka and Mr. Fernando.

It is now necessary to ascertain the powers of an Industrial Arbitrator. The duties and

powers of the Arbitrator are prescribed in Section 17 of the Industrial Disputes Act. The

said Section 17(1) stipulates the following;

Page 16 of 19

...he shall make all such inquiries into the dispute as he may consider necessary, hear such

evidence as may be tendered by the parties to the dispute, and thereafter make such award as

may appear to him just and equitable. A labour tribunal shall give priority to the

proceedings for the settlement of any industrial dispute that is referred to it for settlement by

arbitration. (Emphasis added)

It is apparent that in terms of the said section, the Arbitrator exercises the just and

equitable jurisdiction. Therefore, the Arbitrator is empowered to hear and resolve

industrial disputes based on the law of equity.

The main dispute resolution mechanism set out under the Act, apart from conciliation

and entering into collective agreements which relate to mutual agreement, are Labour

Tribunals and Arbitrations. Both these mechanisms enable an Arbitrator or Labour

Tribunal to grant just and equitable relief to a workman. At present many employers have

raised the issue that this concept of equity has been stretched to the maximum and

sometimes even amounts to sympathy.4

Where an Industrial Arbitrator appears to have misunderstood the meaning of just and

equitable in s. 17(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act and has proceeded to make an award

which is tainted by a misapprehension of his own function, there is error of law and the

award will be quashed by certiorari.5 (See - Sunil F.A. Cooray, Principles of

Administrative Law in Sri Lanka, 4th edition, Vol. II, chapter 16, p.963)

Therefore, I am of the view that an Industrial Arbitrator is not empowered to exercise just

and equitable jurisdiction or to expand the ambit of the law of equity without a proper

legal basis. Doing justice is not discretionary but it is mandatory. In analysing the

conclusion arrived at by the Arbitrator in his Award, it emanates that the Arbitrator has

unduly used the umbrella of just and equitable jurisdiction. I take that view as the

Arbitrator has enabled a larger group of employees to be benefited by a drawback of paying

an erroneous allowance only to two employees. To my mind the just and equitable

jurisdiction should not be used as a conduit to pacify a set of protestors who claim for an

advantage upon an unjust enrichment created as a result of the mismanagement by the

authorities.

Whilst it was an admitted fact among all parties that the special allowance paid to two

employees created an anomaly and also in the backdrop that the Petitioner at any stage

during the arbitration proceedings had not attempted to justify such anomaly, it is

pertinent to find the legal basis upon which the Arbitrator has given life to a suspended

payment that was made erroneously? I see no valid reason for making an award in favour

of the Respondents based on an unjust enrichment of two employees of the Petitioner

Company. Hence, it is nothing other than a blatant error made by the Arbitrator by not

taking relevant material in to consideration or taking in to consideration irrelevant

material. In the circumstances, there are sufficient grounds for me to accept the aforesaid

arguments advanced by the Petitioner which established that the Arbitrator has erred by

not giving due effect to the fact of withdrawing the special allowance during the pendency

of the arbitration. Further, I take the view that the Arbitrator has granted relief to

employees in the superior grades ranging from Grade A-3 to A-1 without taking in to

consideration any viable evidence when actual dispute was in respect of two employees in

Grades A-5 and A-4 receiving a special allowance.

In the circumstances I hold that the Arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction paving way

for this Court to issue a writ against the Award in spite of the preliminary objections raised

by the Respondents. Moreover, I hold that the Arbitrator has not made a lawful Award

that can be duly enforced and that the said Award is eminently irrational and

unreasonable. Therefore, I proceed to issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari

as prayed for in the paragraph (b) of the prayer of the Petition of the Petitioner.

Although, I have taken the view to issue a writ of Certiorari as mentioned above, I cannot

possibly overlook the possible hardship faced by the above Respondents during the long

period of time engaged in litigation. The Minister referred the relevant dispute to the

Arbitrator on 12.08.2009 and in furtherance to an inquiry the Award has been delivered

only on 30.01.2019. The relevant gazette notification was published on 25.07.2019. Hence

it is obvious that the arbitration proceedings have taken almost 10 years which cannot be

considered as a due process in tendering justice in an industrial dispute. Eventually those

Respondents have been dragged in to this Arbitration and also in to the instant judicial

review process in an unceremonious or fruitless manner due to a wrong decision made by

the Petitioner Company creating a salary anomaly.

It is observed that the Petitioner has not taken a single step to recover the special

allowance paid to the respective two employees. I consider such action by the Petitioner,

being a Government owned business undertaking converted to a public company, is a,

prima facie, violation of the public trust doctrine in reference to the financial management

of the said Company. No action has been taken against the officers who are responsible

for creating a salary anomaly and, as a consequence, the unrest and the dissonance among

the Respondents. The said salary anomaly was created almost 14 years ago and the

Petitioner has failed to resolve the impugned issues for a period over 14 years. As a result,

it can be assumed that a reasonable expectation has been created within the Respondents

due to the gross ignorance and/or perversity of the Petitioner Company who crafted a

salary anomaly.

Enid Campbell, Sir Isaac Isaacs Professor of Law, Monash University, who has done an

extensive survey on awarding of costs in Judicial Review applications has stated in her

article Award of Costs on Application for Judicial Review published in Sydney Law

Review [1983] SydLawRw 3; (1983) 10(1) page 20 that;

Costs maybe awarded in applications for supervisory Judicial Review whether they be

applications for prerogative writs or like orders or for injunctions or declarations. In civil

litigation the judicial discretion to award costs as between party and party6 is normally

exercised in favour of the successful party. The discretion should not, it has been said, be

exercised against the victor except for some reason connected with the case.7

Although, the general rule in relation to the award of costs in Judicial Review is that the

successful party would be awarded costs, the Courts exercising the discretion has taken in

to account the conduct of parties to award costs even against the successful party. In

Taylor vs. Honiton Town Council & Another (2017) EWHC 101 (England and Wales

6 The discretion is conferred by Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth.). ss 26 and 27 (High Court): Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth.). s. 43; Supreme Court Act. 1970 (N.S.W.). s. 76; Supreme Court Act, 1867 (Qld.), s. 58; Supreme Court Act, 1935-1975 (S.A.). s. 40: Supreme Court Civil Procedure Act, 1932 (Tas.), ss. 12 and 13; Supreme Court Act. 1958 (Vic.). s 32 (I); Supreme Court Act, 1975-1979 (W.A.). s. 37. 7 Donald Campbell & Co. Ltd. vs. Pollak (I927) A.C. 732 at 812

High Court-Administrative Court), the Court has quashed the Town Councils decision to

impose sanctions on the Claimant. So, the Claimant was the successful party in that

application. The Court departing from the general rule on costs, the conduct of the parties

in dealing with the dispute once it had arisen has been taken in to consideration and been

evaluated for the interest of justice. Finally, the Court in that case has made an order that

the said Council should pay the Claimants costs up to and including the 19th March 2016

and further, that the Claimant is liable for the costs that the Council incurred on and after

20th March 2016.

On an overall conceptus of the circumstances of this case and also based on the submission

made by all learned Counsel, I hold that this is a fit and proper case to consider the conduct

of the Petitioner and to award costs for the Respondents payable by the Petitioner

Company. Hence, I order the Petitioner Company to pay each Respondent namely the 4th,

6th 8th, 10th 30th, 33rd, 34th, 36th 39th & 41st- 43rd Respondents in a sum of Rs. 125,000.00

each. I do not consider awarding costs against the other applicants who were before the

Arbitrator due to the reason that some of the applicants have abandoned the protest against

the impugned decisions of the Petitioner. Further, I have noticed some of the Respondents

(5th, 9th, 31st, 32nd, 35th, 40th) were not responsive to the notice issued by this Court. I have

come to the above conclusion on the quantum of the costs by reason of the special

circumstances of this case, already enumerated by me, and also by exercising my discretion

for the interest of justice.
