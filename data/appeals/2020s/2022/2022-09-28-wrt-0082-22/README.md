Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Heard learned Counsel for the Petitioner in support of this application and the learned State

Counsel opposing this application.

The Petitioner of this application was a Co-Petitioner in case No. CA/Writ/0578/21 which

has been dismissed by this Court on 12/01/2022. In the said application No.

CA/Writ/0578/21, the purported grievance of the 1st Petitioner therein was that he had not

been called for the interviews scheduled to be held on 23/11/2021.

Similarly, in the said application, the learned State Counsel had submitted as per the

instructions of the University that the 2nd Petitioner of the said case (Petitioner of the instant

application) is prima facie eligible to be present at the interviews.

The learned State Counsel in reference to the instant application submits that the Petitioner

has not been called for any interview and thus this application is premature. In terms of the

prayer of the amended Petition of the Petitioner, it is observed that the Petitioner is primarily

seeking a writ of Certiorari to quash the document marked P15(a) and P15(b). The said

impugned documents reflect the decisions made by the selection committee of which 2nd, 8th,

14th, 15th, 23rd, 24th and 25th Respondents are members.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner referring to the averments in paragraph 19 of the

Petition informs Court that he intends to challenge the composition of the relevant selection

committee as well. However, we are unable to find a properly formulated relief to that effect

in the prayer of the instant application.

In addition to the reliefs prayed for in reference to the documents P15(a) and P15(b), the

Petitioner is also seeking for a Writ of quo-warranto. According to the established law, we are

of the view that no Writ of quo-warranto lies against the appointments of this nature which

is more fully described in the Petition.

The learned State Counsel referring to the documents annexed to the motion dated

21/09/2022, submits that the Petitioner by way of his letter dated 19/11/2019 has specifically

applied for the post of Assistant Lecturer in Image Art/ Film and Television, Department of

Fine Art.

The Vice Chancellor by letter, marked 3(a), has sought permission from the University

Grants Commission to interview only the applicants specializing in Drama and Theater

before 24/11/2021. The Secretary to the University Grants Commission has communicated

the decision taken at the 1065th meeting held on 28/10/2021 and has informed that the

validity period of the advertisement for the post of Lecturer (Probationary)/ Lecturer

(unconfirmed)/ Senior Lecturer Gr. II/I in the Drama, Theater and Image Arts Unit had

been extended.

The learned State Counsel further points out that this Petitioner has filed a Fundamental

Rights application bearing case No. SC FR/429/2021 on identical matters and further, the

said Fundamental Rights application has been already refused by the Supreme Court.

The Court observes that the Petitioners purported grievance is based on the fact that he has

not been called for the interview mentioned in the Petition. The learned State Counsel

referring to several documents which are filed of record submits that the application of the

Page 6 of 6

Petitioner is premature. In the circumstances, we take the view that the Petitioner has failed

to submit an arguable case and prima facie there is no merit in this application.

It is observed that the manner in which the prayer of the Petition has been formulated and the

alleged contents of the body of the Petition do not warrant the Petitioner to duly challenge

the composition of the respective selection committee in the instant application.

At the threshold stage of a judicial review application, as established by several judgements,

the Court must be satisfied that there is a serious case to be heard and on the facts before

Court there is a probability that the Petitioner is entitled to relief. The vitiating ground must

be arguably material to the impugned decision and such decision must be arguably amenable

to judicial review. (See-Jinadasa vs. Weerasinghe 31 NLR 33 and R vs. Chief Rabbi ex. p.

Wachmann (1993) 2 All ER 249)

In light of the above, we are of the view that the Petitioner has failed to submit a prima facie

case which warrants this Court to issue formal notice of this application on the Respondents.

Accordingly, we proceed to refuse this application.
