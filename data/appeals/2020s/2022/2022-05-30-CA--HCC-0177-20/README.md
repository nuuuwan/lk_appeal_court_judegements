The learned High Court Judge directed the sentences imposed on counts 02 and 03 to run concurrently. The accused-appellant preferred this appeal against the said conviction and sentence.

When this appeal was taken up for argument the learned counsel for the accused-appellant informed Court that his client is not challenging the conviction. The accused-appellant is challenging only the sentence.

On 14.12.2020 when the case was mentioned before the learned trial Judge prosecution decided to amend the indictment. When it was read to the accused person, he decided to plead guilty to all 3 counts against him. The learned High Court Judge acted under section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, upon his plea convicted the accused person for the amended charges.

The learned trial Judge pronounced the sentence on 14.12.2020 and sentenced the accused person as follows;

(i) He was sentenced to 2 years of rigorous imprisonment for the offence described in indictment 01, which is punishable under Section 354 of the Penal Code. A fine of Five Thousand Rupees (Rs.5000/-) was also imposed and in default lenient imprisonment for 1 month. (ii) He was sentenced to 18 years of rigorous imprisonment for the second offence punishable under Section 365 b (2) (b) of the Penal Code as described in the amended indictment. A fine of Ten Thousand Rupees (Rs.10,000/-) was also imposed and in default lenient imprisonment for 2 months. (iii) Further, it was decided that a fine of Three Hundred Thousand Rupees (Rs. 300,000/-) should be paid on behalf of the victim of the offence mentioned in the 2nd indictment of the amended indictment and if the compensation is not paid or defaulted, it will be imposed as a fine and if the fine is not paid lenient imprisonment for 12 months. (iv) He was sentenced to 18 years of rigorous imprisonment for the 3rd offence punishable under Section 365 b (2) (b) of the Penal Code as described in the amended indictment. A fine of Ten Thousand Rupees (Rs.10,000/-) was also imposed and in default lenient imprisonment for 2 months. (v) Further, it was decided that a fine of Three Hundred Thousand Rupees (Rs. 300,000/-) should be paid on behalf of the victim of the offence mentioned in the 3rd indictment of the amended indictment and if the compensation is not paid or defaulted, it will be imposed as a fine and in default lenient imprisonment for 12 months. (vi) It was decided that the imprisonment prescribed for the above 02nd and 03rd amendment indictments should run concurrently and be taken together. (vii) The amount of One hundred and Twenty Thousand Rupees (Rs. 120,000) which is 20% of the compensation of Six Hundred Thousand Rupees (Rs. 600,000/-) imposed on the victim in connection with the aforesaid 2nd and 3rd amendment Indictments, acting

under sub-section 28(1) (a) (2) of the Act No. 04 of 2015, the accused has been directed to pay to the fund established under Section 29 of the Act

On behalf of the accused-appellant the learned counsel requested that the sentence imposed on the accused-appellant be reduced and the mandatory imprisonment be imposed from the date of this judgment.

The learned counsel for the respondent says that when considering the gravity of this offence he should not be dealt with leniently. It is to be noted that he is an unmarried person without any previous convictions. He has pleaded guilty to the amended charges and he had saved valuable time in court.

It is a practice that an accused person who pleads guilty to the counts in the indictment should be treated leniently and given him a chance to rectify his mistakes and go back to the society as a good person. In the present case, the learned trial Judge had imposed 18 years of rigorous imprisonment each for the 2nd and 3rd counts to run concurrently.

There is no doubt that the accused-appellant is technically guilty of the offence described in section 365 b (2) b of the Penal Code. However, after considering the facts and the circumstances of the case and the submission of the counsel I hold that this is not a case where the accused-appellant should be given the maximum custodial sentence.

We set aside the sentence of 18 years of rigours imprisonment imposed on the accused-appellant in respect of counts 2 and 3. We impose 8 years of rigours imprisonment each for counts 2 and 3. The imprisonment is backdated to the date of the judgement namely 14.12.2020. The fine, the compensation and the default term ordered by the learned trial judge for each count are affirmed. The sentence for the 1st count which is 2 years of rigorous imprisonment and the fine will remain the same and the default term ordered by the learned trial Judge for the 1st count is also affirmed.

We direct the sentences to run concurrently.

Appeal dismissed. The sentence is differed.
