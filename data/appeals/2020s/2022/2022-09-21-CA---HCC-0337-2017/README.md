R. Gurusinghe, J.

The accused-appellant (the appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Monaragala for having committed the murder of Karavila Kandage Gunadasa at

Uva Kudaoya on the 29th of September 2007.

After trial, the accused was found guilty and sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant

appealed to this court.

When this matter was taken up for hearing, the Learned Deputy Solicitor

General for the respondent submitted that under the circumstances of this

case, he agreed that the appellant should not have been convicted for the

3

murder but for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, an offence

punishable under section 297 of the Penal Code.

In this case, there were no eyewitnesses to the murder. The facts of this case

are briefly as follows:

The deceased and the appellant obtained about half an acre of land from PW2

on an informal agreement to cultivate capsicum. Initially, the deceased and

the appellant jointly cultivated capsicum on that half an acre of land.

Subsequently, both of them had grown capsicum separately. PW2 was also

growing capsicum in this land separately, but adjoining the cultivation land of

the deceased and the appellant. According to PW2, on the day of the incident,

around 6.00 in the morning, he had gone to the land. PW2 had seen the

appellant was on the land removing weeds. The appellant told PW2 that

yesterday also, the deceased had quarreled with him. The deceased told him

thus; (the appellant ) (the deceased)

. .

.

The evidence shows that there had been constant quarrels between the

deceased and the appellant. PW2 warned the appellant not to quarrel with the

deceased because he (as the land owner) is answerable to the police if

something like that happens. PW2 had gone home, and after about an hour, he

came to the land to water his plants. At that time, he had seen the deceased

person lying on the ground. He then alerted the deceased persons family about

the incident. By that time, the appellant was not in the vicinity. The appellant

had been taken into custody on the 4th of October by the Thanamalwila police

station.

The wife of the deceased PW1 had made a complaint to the police. In her

complaint, she stated that the appellant was the only person who had

4

problems with the deceased. The evidence revealed that there was a dispute

between the deceased and the appellant regarding a money transaction. The

police had recovered a (scythe or sickle) consequent to a statement of the

appellant. The injuries on the dead body of the deceased were compatible with

that caused by the scythe (.)

Those were the circumstantial evidences which led to the conviction of the

appellant. The evidence also reveals that the deceased person drinks alcohol

frequently and was short-tempered, and was inclined to fight with others.

The main item of circumstantial evidence is what the appellant had told about

the deceased to PW2. That is;

.

This portion of the evidence was considered against the appellant. When this

statement was taken as evidence, it should also have been taken into account

what is favourable to the appellant. As per the evidence, the appellant had

said, if he comes to quarrel with me today as well, I will finish him. So, this

should be taken as, if the deceased had not come to fight with the appellant,

there would not have been any incident. There were no eyewitnesses to the

incident. As per the evidence, it was probable that there was a sudden fight

between the deceased and the appellant.

In those circumstances, convicting the appellant for the offence of murder is

not safe. We, therefore, set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed on

the appellant by the learned High Court Judge. We convict the appellant of the

offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis that there

was a sudden fight between them.

5

I impose a term of 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment on him, to take effect from

the date of conviction, namely, 30thNovember 2017.

The appeal is partially allowed.
