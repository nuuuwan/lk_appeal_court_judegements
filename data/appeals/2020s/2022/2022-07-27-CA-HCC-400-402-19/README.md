Four persons were indicted for committing the murder of John

Susilawathie on or about 15.10.1991, an offence punishable under

Section 296 of the Penal Code. The four accused were tried without a

Jury. The fourth accused died before the Judgement was pronounced.

After the trial, the learned High Court Judge of Colombo convicted the

1st, 2nd, and 3rd accused-appellants by his Judgment dated 21.06.2019

3

and imposed the death sentence. This appeal has been preferred by

the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd accused against the said conviction and sentence.

Written submissions on behalf of both parties were filed prior to the

hearing. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned counsel for the

appellant and the learned Deputy Solicitor General made oral

submissions

This unfortunate incident occurred on 15.10.1991. According to the

evidence of the deceased's mother (PW1), all four accused came to her

house together while she was seated at her doorstep, jumped over her

head, and went inside. Following that, the accused stabbed the

deceased and assaulted her with her hands and all four accused ran

out of the house together.

The learned counsel for the appellant made his submissions on the

following grounds:

I. Has the learned Judge properly considered contradictions in the

evidence of the 2nd eye-witness for the prosecution?

II. Has the learned trial Judge considered properly the omission in

the evidence of the 2nd eye-witness for the prosecution with

regard to the dying declaration said to have been made by the

deceased?

III. Did the said eye-witness identify the knife?

IV. Is it proper to use the doctrine of common intention to determine

the liability of accused persons?

V. Is the impugned Judgment of the High Court, based on or

supported by the evidence led at trial?

In this case, there are two eyewitnesses. According to PW1, she

witnessed the stabbing and identified the accused-appellants.

According to PW2, she only saw the last part of the incident and

4

identified the accused-appellants. The learned counsel for the

appellants did not challenge the identification of the accused-

appellants. PW1 stated that the appellants were their relatives. It was

also revealed that the appellants were well-known to these two

witnesses.

1st ground of appeal - Contradictions

It was mentioned by the learned counsel for the appellants that the

second eyewitness for the prosecution stated in her testimony that she

went outside to take a bath and returned to her house after hearing

PW1's cries. She has also stated that the four accused ran away as

soon as she entered the house. The learned counsel for the appellants

pointed out that PW1 stated in her testimony that PW2 was at home

at that time. The learned High Court Judges view was, that if PW1 did

not see PW2 walk out of the house, she might have believed PW2 was

still inside. There is a strong possibility for that to happen because

PW2 had gone for a bath to a place very close to her house. In any

case, no doubt is cast as a result of that flaw because PW2 has never

stated that she saw the stabbing. She had only spoken about what she

had seen. She had seen all four accused coming out of her house and

running away. She also saw one of the accused armed with a knife.

The learned counsel for the appellants also contended that there is a

contradiction as to which accused possessed the knife. Naturally, she

would not remember who possessed the knife in such an exciting

situation. However, her evidence that she saw one person with a knife

would not become unbelievable for the reason that she couldn't tell

precisely which accused was armed with a knife. It is important to note

the following Indian judgment, which is extremely relevant in this

situation. In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V. State of Gujarat AIR 1983 SC

753, The Indian Supreme Court held as follows:

5

By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video

tape is replayed on the mental screen. Ordinarily, it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The

witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has

an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be

expected to be attuned to absorb the details. The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may

notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image

on one persons mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of

another.

Ordinarily, a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the

sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short

time span. A witness is liable to get confused or mixed up when

interrogated later on.

The aforesaid portion of the Indian Supreme Court Judgment is cited

in the case of A.K. Kamal Rasika Amarasinghe V. OIC Special

Investigation Unit and Hon. Attorney General - SC Appeal

No.140/2010 Special Leave to Appeal No.118/10, decided on

18.07.2018.

For the reasons stated above, I hold that the aforementioned

contradictions have no impact on the credibility of the witnesses'

testimony.

2nd ground of appeal Omission pertaining to a Dying Declaration

The omission that was brought to the attention of the Court was

related to a dying declaration in which PW2 stated that the deceased

told her that Upul (3rd accused) kept a cushion on her and pressed.

However, it was revealed in the High Court, that PW2 did not state

6

about this dying declaration to the police, in the inquest, or in the non-

summery inquiry. I agree that it is a material omission. Therefore, it is

safe to disregard the aforementioned dying declaration when

determining the action. However, upon perusing the learned High

Court Judge's Judgment, it is clear that the learned Judge did not base

his decision on this dying declaration.

However, the learned High Court Judge has taken into account

another dying declaration. The learned counsel for the appellant

formed no argument in relation to the aforementioned other dying

declaration. Prior to the date of the incident, the deceased had made

several complaints to the police, alleging that the accused were pelting

stones at her house and cracking unsuitable jokes. The deceased had

called the Bambalapitiya Police on the date of the incident and

informed them that she was being teased in an unacceptable manner

by the accused and that her house was being pelted with stones. IP

Suwaris Fernando's evidence elicited this information. The said

statement of the deceased was taken into account by the learned High

Court Judge in terms of section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance as a

dying declaration.

It was held in The King V. Mudalihami 47 NLR 149 that the statement

admissible under section 32 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance may be

made before the cause of death has arisen, or before the deceased has

any reason to anticipate being killed.

In Ajith Samarakoon V. The Republic (Kobaigane Murder Case) it was

held that evidence volunteered by the mother of the deceased in

regard to the entirety of what her daughter Nilanthi narrated to her

before she left the parental home on that day is admissible in evidence

section 32(1). The statement of the deceased to her mother is a fact

inextricably interwoven and connected to the circumstances of the

7

shooting and setting on fire which resulted in her death. It was held

further in the said case that where the evidence is relevant otherwise

than as motive alone and where there is a close proximate relationship

between the happening of that event and the murderous assault, such

circumstance would constitute a circumstance of the transaction.

According to the decisions of the aforementioned judicial authorities,

the learned High Court Judge has correctly considered the deceased's

other statement as a dying declaration in terms of section 32 of the

Evidence Ordinance.

Therefore, the issue of whether the said dying declaration was properly

considered would not arise, as the learned High Court Judges

conclusion was not based on the dying declaration that was relevant

to the omission brought to the notice of the court.

3rd ground of appeal Identifying the knife

The learned counsel for the appellant contended that, while PW2

identified and marked the knife during the examination in chief as the

knife used for stabbing, she later stated during cross-examination that

it was not the knife she saw. The learned Deputy Solicitor General

submitted that the learned High Court Judge has carefully considered

the aforementioned piece of evidence.

I believe it is unnecessary to consider whether the learned Judge's

analysis in respect of the knife is correct or not because identifying the

knife is not essential to prove the charge against the appellants. The

fact that PW2 observed one of the accused armed with a knife is

evident. Also, it is to be noted that it is extremely difficult for anyone

to identify a knife used in an incident like this. In this case, seeing one

of the accused-appellants armed with a knife is sufficient because

medical evidence establishes that the deceased died as a result of stab

8

injuries to the chest. If PW2 saw the appellants running out of the

house with a knife soon after the deceased was stabbed inside the

house, the only inference that could be drawn is that the appellants

stabbed the deceased and caused her death. Therefore, even though

the PW2 did not properly identify the knife, it is not a material factor

to be considered.

4th ground of appeal Common Intention

The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant in respect of

this ground is that there is no evidence regarding common murderous

intention, pre-arrangement, or sharing of the intention, and no

evidence of any overt act. The learned Deputy Solicitor General

contended in reply that the manner in which the stabbing occurred

clearly demonstrates the common murderous intention of the

appellants.

PW1 has stated that all four accused (3 appellants and the accused

who died) came together to her house when she was seated at her

doorstep, jumped over her head, went inside the house, and stabbed

the deceased. PW1 also stated that the 1st and 3rd appellants were

armed with knives. Furthermore, PW2 stated that she witnessed all

four accused who were in the house coming outside from her house

and running. She also saw that one of the accused was armed with a

knife when they ran out of the house. Soon after the appellants ran

out, the deceased was found inside the house, lying in a pool of blood.

The doctor testified that she died as a result of the stab injuries. As

previously stated, the identification of the appellants by the witnesses

is also not an issue. Hence, the common intention of the appellants to

murder the deceased is well established.

In the case of The Queen V. Mahatun - 61 NLR 540 it was held that

Under section 32 of the Penal Code, when a criminal act is committed

9

by one of several persons in furtherance of the common intention of

all, each of them is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were

done by him alone. If each of several persons commits a different

criminal act, each act being in furtherance of the common intention of

all, each of them is liable for each, such as if it were done by him alone.

To establish the existence of a common intention it is not

essential to prove that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant

to a pre-arranged plan. A common intention can come into existence

without pre-arrangement. It can be formed on the spur of the

moment.

The aforesaid decision gives answers to the arguments of the learned

counsel for the appellant regarding common murderous intention and

pre-arrangement or sharing of the intention. The facts that all three

accused-appellants with the other accused who died came together to

the house where the deceased was, stabbed the deceased, and ran out

of the house together armed with a knife clearly establish the common

murderous intention of all three appellants.

In Sarath Kumara V. Attorney General C.A. No. 207/2008, Decided

on 04.04.2014, it was held that ..once a participatory presence in

furtherance of a common intention is established at the

commencement of an incident, there is no requirement that both

perpetrators should be physically present at the culmination of the

event, unless it could be shown by some overt act that one perpetrator

deliberately withdrew from the situation to disengage and detach

himself from vicarious liability.

In the instant action, all appellants were present until all the incidents

related to the murder were completed. The important point emanating

from the aforesaid judicial authority is that if an accused claims that

he had no murderous common intention with others to commit the

10

crime, establishing an overt act of disengaging himself from vicarious

liability is up to the accused who claims that he had no common

intention with others to commit the crime. Hence, it is not the duty of

the prosecution to establish an overt act, as contended by the learned

counsel for the appellants. In the circumstances, the evidence in this

case clearly demonstrates that the appellants murdered the deceased

with a common murderous intention. Therefore, I regret that I am

unable to agree with the contention of the learned counsel for the

appellants that the doctrine of common intention has not been

properly applied to determine the liability of the appellants in this case.

5th ground of appeal Judgment was not supported by the evidence

led at the trial.

On this ground, the learned counsel summarized all of his arguments

and contended that the learned High Court Judge did not properly

evaluate the evidence and did not properly consider the doctrine of

common intention and dying declaration.

However, for the reasons stated above, I am unable to agree with the

contention of the learned counsel for the appellant. The learned High

Court Judge has dealt with the contradictions marked. However, the

learned counsel for the appellant made no submissions regarding any

other contradiction other than those addressed by this court. The

learned High Court Judge has correctly evaluated the eye-witnesses

evidence, dying declaration, position taken up by the appellants in

their dock statements and correctly concluded that the charge against

the appellants has proved beyond reasonable doubt.

Finally, the learned counsel for the appellants urged to reduce the

sentence, if the conviction is found to be correct in law. The learned

Counsel did not advance an argument that the learned High Court

Judge could have considered the lessor offence of culpable homicide

11

not amounting to murder. He entirely focused all of his arguments on

the basis that the charge of murder against the appellants has not

been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In the circumstances, I regret

that the learned counsel's request could not be considered, as the only

possible sentence for murder is the death sentence, according to law.

For the foregoing reasons, I affirm the conviction and the sentence

imposed on the appellants and dismiss the appeal.

The appeal is dismissed.
