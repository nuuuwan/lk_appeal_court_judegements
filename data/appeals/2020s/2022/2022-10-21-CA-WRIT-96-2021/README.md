Counsel : Sabry Nilamadeen with S. Rajendran for the Petitioner.

Hashini Opatha, SC for the Respondents. Argued on : 10.10.2022

Decided on : 21.10.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The primary relief prayed for by the Petitioner is for an order in the nature of a writ of

Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st Respondent to deduct a sum of Rs. 134,850.90 from

the Petitioners pension. The said decision is reflected in letter dated 02.09.2020, marked

P8a.

In terms of the Award of Pension, marked P1, the date of retirement of the Petitioner is

18.11.1997 and the date from which the said award is payable is also the same date. The

appointment held by the Petitioner at the date of retirement was one in the Sri Lanka

Education Administrative Service II.

It appears as per the documents annexed to the Statement of Objections of the 1st, 2nd, 4th and

5th Respondents that Appeal and Investigations Committees have been appointed by the

respective Ministries to investigate into complaints received with regard to politically

victimized persons and to make recommendations. Such committees have been appointed

based on Cabinet decisions in view of providing reliefs to the persons who have undergone

problems due to purported political reasons.

The Cabinet of Ministers by virtue of their decision on 02.03.2016 has decided to instruct the

Secretaires of the relevant Ministries to implement the decisions of the said Appeals and

Investigations Committees and such approval has been granted as a matter of policy. (A copy

of the said Cabinet decision is among the document, marked R2). The letter dated

23.12.2016, marked P2, has been issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Education (4th

Page 3 of 4

Respondent) as a consequence to the recommendations made by the respective Appeal and

Investigations Committees.

The Director of Pensions (2nd Respondent) after perusal of the said letter, marked P2, has

brought to the attention of the 4th Respondent that there was an inconsistency between the

item numbers (2) and (3) therein, as well as an inconstancy with regard to the effective date

considered by other Government Departments in implementing such recommendations.

(Vide-R3a, R3B and R3C).

As a result, the 4th Respondent issued a letter dated 21.02.2019, marked R3e, clarifying the

effective date of carrying out the recommendations of the aforesaid Committees. Accordingly,

the contents of the letter marked P2 has been amended by the substitution of the sentence

adjust the pension by granting salary increments and paying back wages considering the date of

retirement of the retired officer with the sentence when the effective date of the recommendations is

not mentioned, the date on which the Cabinet Memorandum has been approved i.e., 02.03.2016, should

be considered in view of adjusting the pension and paying back wages to the retied officer. Hence, the

effective date of implementing the reliefs should be the date of the Cabinet decision.

The impugned decision reflected in letter dated 02.09.2020, marked P8a has been issued

based on such directive of the 4th Respondent and also based on the fresh directions given by

the 2nd Respondent on 20.07.2020.

I am of the view that it is appropriate to draw my attention at this stage to the Rule of

Recognition which has been recognized as a concept of law by Hart. The following passage

in Understanding Conceptions of Law by H. J. F. Silva, Royal Institute of Colombo (RIC), 2015,

is in my mind pertinent to the instant application;

It was explained that the rule of recognition was intended to cure the defect of uncertainty in

the primary rules. Its role was to (i) serve as a test to determine the valid laws in a legal system.

Thus, it provided individual and officials with an authoritative criteria for identifying primary

rules,1 (ii) resolve doubts and disagreements relating to the valid rules in a community, (iii) confer

validity to primary rules in the system, provided they satisfied the criteria specified therein2 and

1 H. L. A. Hart, The Concept of Law, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1994 p. 100 2 Ibid

(iv) serves as the central agency for unifying the legal rules, into a legal system. There would not

be a system but only a collection of disparate rules, if not for the presence of such a rule.

Although, the 4th Respondent has rectified an ambiguity appeared in P2 by way of the letter

marked R3e, still the Petitioner has not fallen into the category of officers who should be

benefited under P2 as the Petitioners date of retirement is very much before the date of the

Cabinet decision i.e., 02.03.2016.

This Court is unable to interpret the terms mentioned in P2 in favour of the Petitioner as

alleged by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner since the said P2 has been amended

subsequently by R3e with proper authority. The said decision in R3e is not being

challenged by the Petitioner in this application and thus, I take the view that the Petitioner is

not entitled to be benefited by the terms of P2. The learned State Counsel for the

Respondents submitted that the decision in R3e was taken as a policy decision in order to

maintain consistency between the government institutions and also to regularize the

procedure. Further, it is observed that the authority of the 4th Respondent to issue the letter

marked P3e is also not been challenged by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner has filed this application in this Court only on 27.07.2021 and by such time

R3e had been issued and the contents of R3e had been adopted by the 1st Respondent by

way of the impugned decision, marked R8a.

For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that no writ can be issued in favour of the

Petitioner as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition. In the circumstances, I take the view that

there is no merit in this application and accordingly, I proceed to dismiss this application.

I agree.
