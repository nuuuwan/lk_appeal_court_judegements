This is an appeal filed on 07.09.2015 against the judgment of the learned

High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya in Case No. 46/2012 delivered on

31.08.2015 which affirmed in revision, an order of confiscation of vehicle

under the Forest Ordinance delivered on 29.03.2012 by the learned

Magistrate of Kuliyapitiya. The petitioner has invoked the appellate

jurisdiction of this Court to set aside both orders and thereby set aside the

confiscation of vehicle bearing registration No. NW JC 9439.

On 13.01.2012, the vehicle bearing registration No. NW JC 9439

(hereinafter the vehicle) was taken into custody for violation of the Forest

Ordinance. The accused pleaded guilty, and a fine was imposed with a

sentence of 6 months rigorous imprisonment. A vehicle inquiry was held

on 01.03.2012 under section 40 of Forest Ordinance as amended in which

the Registered Owner (hereinafter referred to as Appellant) gave evidence

and was cross-examined by the prosecution. After the conclusion of

submissions, the learned Magistrate ordered the vehicle to be confiscated.

Aggrieved by the said decision, the petitioner filed revision application in

the High Court, which dismissed the revision application and reaffirmed

the order of the learned Magistrate.

Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance No. 16 of 1907 as amended by Forest

(Amendment) Act No 65 of 2009 stipulates confiscation of vehicles

connected with a forest offence as follows:

(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence-

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the

State in respect of which such offence has been committed;

and

CA-PHC-139-15 Page 5 of 10 20/09/2022 IJ-37-22

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in

committing such offence

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence,

be confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is

a third party, no Order of Confiscation shall be made if such owner

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the

offence."(Emphasis added)

As such, the legislature has unequivocally cast a burden on a claimant of

a vehicle inquiry under the Forest Ordinance to dispense the burden of

proving to the satisfaction of the Court that he, having ownership of the

vehicle concerned, had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such

vehicle for the commission of the offence. It must be noted that the

requirement of proving that all precautionary measures have been taken

by such third party making a claim against a confiscation, is unique to the

Forest Ordinance in comparison with other legislations with similar

provisions. The position prior to 2009 was that a vehicle involved in a forest

offence is liable for confiscation and that a third party may make a claim

against such confiscation. After 2009, the legislature has delineated a

specific burden on such a party making a claim. He must prove that he

took all precautions to prevent the use of such vehicle for the commission

of the forest offence. The legislative intent of imposing such a stringent

threshold in section 40 of the Forest Ordinance as amended in 2009, is to

conserve the forest cover and preserve the green nature of Sri Lanka.

CA-PHC-139-15 Page 6 of 10 20/09/2022 IJ-37-22

Hence, the primary contention to be decided by this Court is whether the

learned Magistrate has correctly evaluated the evidence placed before him

when arriving at the final determination that the appellant has failed to

dispense the said burden. It was contended by the appellant that the

vehicle had been used to transport rocks from a quarry and the driver

(accused) picked up the vehicle when required and handed over at around

8.00/9.00 p.m. usually. He further contented that he employed the

accused as the driver of the vehicle as he was known to him from his own

village, and the driver himself had previously owned and driven a lorry.

The driver has requested the appellant to employ him as he had sold his

own vehicle. He further contended that the driver had not engaged in any

illegal activities with his own vehicle. He states that on the day in question,

driver had taken the vehicle to the quarry and had not returned. The

appellant had gone searching for the vehicle and the quarry had informed

him that the driver had gone to transport a load of rocks. Then the

appellant had called the driver on his mobile phone which had not worked.

He contends that upon being informed about the incident he inquired the

driver as to why he committed such an act when he is informed otherwise,

following which he has dismissed the driver from his employment. During

examination in chief, the appellant has given evidence as to the manner in

which he dispensed the burden cast upon him under the Forest

Ordinance, i.e., that he had given all instructions and taken all necessary

precautions to prevent the commission of a forest offence.

When perusing the evidence given by the appellant, it is noted that the

prosecution has not properly cross-examined and/or contradicted or

challenged the precautionary measures he has claimed to have taken.

Therefore, all such measures he has contended remain admissible as

evidence. At this point it is pertinent to quote His Lordship Justice Salam

CA-PHC-139-15 Page 7 of 10 20/09/2022 IJ-37-22

P/CA in the case of Jaleel Vs OIC Anti Vice Unit Police Station

Anuradhapura, CA PHC-108/2010 CA Minute 26.08 2014 It has to be

borne in mind that an order of confiscation of property whether movable or

immovable leads to deprivation of property rights of a citizen. Inasmuch as

the court has to approach the issue relating to the liberty of the subject by

giving a strict interpretation of the law and the same approach has to be

aimed at resolving the issues relating to the legality of the confiscation

orders as well..

Hence, in evaluating the evidence before the Court, the stringent

stipulations on confiscation as envisioned by the legislature must be

balanced and reconciled with individual property rights. In such a context,

evidence that were not challenged or otherwise disputed, in the absence of

any alternative propositions by the prosecution, must be given due

consideration.

At this juncture, the following observation in Samarasinghe Dharmasena

v W. P. Wanigasinghe CA(PHC) 197/2013 CA Minute dated 22.01.2019 is

applicable:

...it is well settled law that in a vehicle inquiry the claimant has

to discharge his burden on a balance of probability. According to

section 40 of the Forest Ordinance (as amended) it is mandatory to

prove on a balance of probability that the owner took every possible

precaution to prevent the vehicle being used for an illegal activity.it

is amply clear that simply giving instructions to the driver is

insufficient to discharge the burden cast on a vehicle owner.

Therefore, merely giving instructions alone will not fall under the

possible preventive measures ought to be taken by a vehicle owner

(Emphasis added)

CA-PHC-139-15 Page 8 of 10 20/09/2022 IJ-37-22

As held in S. D. N. Premasiri v Officer in Charge, Mawathagama CA

(PHC) 46/2015 Court of Appeal Minute dated 27.11.2018 it is

imperative to prove to the satisfaction of Court that the vehicle owner in

question has not only given instructions but also has taken every possible

step to implement them. Furthermore in Cadar Bawa Jennathul Farida v

Range Forest Officer and Others C.A PHC 94/2017 minute dated

05.07.2019, it was held that it is trite law that mere giving instruction is

not sufficient to discharge the burden cast on a vehicle owner under the

Forest Ordinance.

Nevertheless, the Act does not mean that the owner of vehicle should sit

beside the vehicle round the clock and should control all the activities of

the driver. The burden cast upon the owner is to prove to the satisfaction

of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such

vehicle for the commission of the offence. As stated by this division in

Kuttiali Mohommadu Marshooq Mohommadu Niyaz Vs Officer-in-

Charge, Police Station, Pannala CA/PHC/203/17 minute dated

21.06.2022 A vehicle owner employing a driver to carry out transportation

of goods cannot reasonably be expected to physically visit each and every

site to ensure that illegal activities are not carried out using his vehicle.

When considering the impugned order of the learned Magistrate, it is

evident that a discrepancy in the evidence given by the appellant as to the

date of the offence has been heavily relied upon by him. However, neither

the remainder of the undisputed evidence elicited during the examination

in chief has been considered nor has the learned Magistrate given any

reasoning for disregarding such evidence. It appears that the learned

Magistrate has based his determination on the singular fact that the

appellant has misquoted a date, holding the said discrepancy to be of such

graveness that it tipped the balance of probability in favour of the

CA-PHC-139-15 Page 9 of 10 20/09/2022 IJ-37-22

prosecution. This Court is unable to agree with such a construction. As

discussed earlier, a case concerning the confiscation of property under the

Forest Ordinance, one must strike a balance between the legislative

intention of conserving the environment and the proprietary rights of the

individual. In such a context, this Court is hesitant to completely shut out

the evidence of the appellant merely because he mistook the date of the

offence.

It is the view of this Court that the Magistrate ought to have considered

the undisputed nature of the evidence given by the appellant when making

his final determination. When weighing the evidence given by the appellant

against the prosecution, where no attempt has been made to challenge

such evidence or otherwise make proposal in support of the prosecution,

and the fact that the Magistrate has disregarded the bulk of the evidence

given by the appellant, this Court deems the instant application a fit case

to exercise appellate jurisdiction of this Court. This Court notes that the

High Court judgment dated 31.08.2015 has affirmed the impugned

Magistrates order by relying on the same discrepancy without considering

the remainder of the facts and points of law. Hence, this Court finds both

orders are warranting an intervention of this Court. Accordingly, this

Court sets aside the judgment of the High Court of Kuliyapitiya in Case

No. 46/2012 delivered on 31.08.2015 which affirmed in revision and the

order of confiscation under the Forest Ordinance delivered on 29.03.12 by

the learned Magistrate of Kuliyapitiya.

The appellant has further submitted that the Magistrate has failed to

frame a charge in accordance with Section 182(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure as the charge sheet is not signed by the Magistrate, and the

accused was erroneously charged under Section 13(1) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure as there is no nexus between the offence committed

CA-PHC-139-15 Page 10 of 10 20/09/2022 IJ-37-22

by the accused. While noting the said irregularities, this Court will not

examine the said asymmetries at this juncture, as it has already decided

the case on its merits.

This Court sets aside the order of confiscation delivered by the Magistrate

Court of Kuliyapitiya in Case No. 46/2012 dated 29.03.2012 and the

judgment affirming the same delivered by the learned High Court Judge of

Kuliyapitiya in Case No. 46/2012 dated 31.08.2015. The Magistrate Court

is ordered to release the vehicle bearing No. NW JC 9439 to the appellant

and the bond be discharged.

Appeal allowed.
