3 | P a g e

As the Appellant opted for a non-jury trial, the trial commenced before a

judge and the prosecution had led twenty witnesses and marked production

P1-11 and X-1 and closed the case. Learned High Court Judge having

satisfied that the evidence presented by the prosecution warrant a case to

answer, called for the defence and explained the rights of the accused.

Having selected the right to make a statement from the dock, the Appellant

had proceeded to deny the charges by way of his dock statement.

After considering the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the

defence, the Learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant as

charged on 26/08/2009 and sentenced him as follows:

1. Count 01 death sentence.

2. Count 02 4 years RI with a fine of Rs.1000/-. In default 03 months

simple imprisonment.

3. Count 03 4 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.1000/-.

In default 03 months simple imprisonment.

4. Count 04 2 years rigorous imprisonment.

5. Count 05 1-year rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. At the hearing the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has abdicated his powers to the

Government Analyst and thereby the Judges findings are

unacceptable regarding the weapon.

2. The production chain regarding the gun is totally contradictory and

therefore unacceptable.

3. The dock statement given by the Appellant has not even been referred

to in the judgment thereby making the judgment invalid.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to the eye witness PW8, Liyanage Gunadasa, he is a prison officer

by profession and on the date of the incident he had been assigned duties

with two other prison officers to escort the deceased to Colombo Magistrate

Court No.06 to extend his remand period. After producing the deceased

before the Learned Magistrate, they remained inside the court until the

Learned Magistrate singed the committal. At about 11.30 a.m. when they

were about to leave the court room, suddenly the Appellant had started to

shoot at the deceased with a pistol. At that time the deceased was standing

between the benches in the left side of the witness. Although the deceased

had run toward the door the Appellant had continued firing at the deceased.

The witness could identify the Appellant clearly as the people in the court

knelt on the ground for their safety. After shooting at the deceased, the

Appellant had held a person at gun point as a hostage and entered into a

glass partitioned room nearby. Thereafter, PW8 had run towards the

deceased who was lying on the corridor with bleeding injury. With the

assistance of other officers and the police officers the deceased was taken to

the National Hospital but was pronounced dead on admission.

PW5 Jayawardena who is an Army Soldier with two others were assigned to

special duty around Colombo Magistrate Court Complex on 09/01/2004. At

about 11.30 a.m. having heard sound of a gun, PW5 Jayawardena with his

colleague Pushpakumara had rushed to the Magistrate Court Complex. As

the people exclaimed in fear and reported the shooting which transpired

where Court No.06 functioned, the witness directed his colleague to guard

the downstairs and went up to the building. He had seen three people were

lying on the corridor and another was crying for help. Having heard the

shooting had taken place inside the Court room and when he entered, he

5 | P a g e

had seen people exclaiming and trying to get out from the Court room. As he

entered the Court room, he had seen the Appellant holding another person

on gun point and shouting I wont trouble anyone anymore. Acting

promptly the witness had kicked the Appellant and facilitated the police

officers to arrest him with the gun.

PW37 a three-wheeler driver by profession had confirmed that he went on a

hire with the Appellant and dropped him near the Colombo Magistrate Court

Complex.

According to PW47, the JMO who held the post-mortem examination opined

that the death of the deceased resulted due to the firearm injuries sustained

in the heart and liver.

PW46 the ballistic expert who examined the gun and the 07 spent cartridges

opined that that the spent cartridges which had been marked as P-2 had

been fired from the gun which had been marked as P-1 by the prosecution.

After the closure of the prosecution case, the Learned High Court Judge had

called for defence and explained rights of the accused. The Appellant opted

to make a statement from the dock.

The Appellant in his dock statement denying the charge stated that he

witnessed the shooting and grabbed the gun from the person who was

shooting, and when this happened, he was held by an Army officer and

thereafter arrested by the police and army.

In the first ground of appeal the Learned Presidents Counsel appearing for

the Appellant contended that the Learned High Court Judge has abdicated

his powers to the Government Analyst and thereby the Judges findings are

unacceptable regarding the weapon.

Experts can be of great assistance to Judges and juries in aiding them to

determine the issues in a case, including the guilt or innocence of an

accused. Also, the opinion of experts is relevant only when the court is

6 | P a g e

required to form an opinion as to any one or more of the following matters;

foreign law, science or art, or the identity or genuineness of handwriting or

finger impression, palm impression or foot impression.

Section 45 of the Evidence Ordinance states:

When the Court has to form an opinion as to foreign law, or of science,

or art, or as to identity or genuineness of handwriting or finger

impressions, palm impressions or foot impressions, the opinions upon

that point of persons specially skilled in such foreign law, science, or

art, or in questions as to identity or genuineness of handwriting or

finger impressions, palm impressions or foot impressions, are relevant

facts. Such persons are called experts.

In W.M.R.B. Wijayaratna and four others (Udathalawinna Murder Case)

SC/TAB/1/2007 decided on 24/07/2009 J.A.N. de Silva, C.J. held that:

(a) it is the function of the Court, with the assistance of an expert,

to decide on the similarity of hand writing, and that it is not proper

to act solely on the opinion of the expert. A Court cannot, of course,

without the assistance of an expert, come to an opinion on so

difficult a question, and the Courts have deprecated, indeed

condemned, any attempt on the part of a judge to come to a

decision without the help of an expert in handwriting.

(b) at the same time the decision being the Judges he should not

delegate his function to the expert. The opinion of the expert is

relevant, but the decision must, nevertheless, be the Judges. To

reach his decision his attention must be drown to the points of

similarity and dissimilarity.

(c) once the ground rules of the analysis have been explained by

the expert and the material unearthed by him is placed before the

Court, and the material is such or should be such that the Court

could legitimately come to its own conclusions regarding the

7 | P a g e

accuracy of the analysis, then the ultimate issue should never be

left to the expert.

(d) the decision on the ultimately issue in a scientific analysis to

which an experts evidence relates must not be left to the expert,

but must be decided by the Court with the acceptable assistance

of an acceptable expert after considering the material placed

before it by the expert as the basis of his opinion.

The Learned High Court judge in his judgment very extensively discussed

the evidence given by PW46, the Senior Deputy Government Analyst with

regard to the gun and the cartridges both spent and live. But he has not

totally relied on or delegated his functions to the Government Analyst.

Nowhere in the judgement indicate that the Learned High Court Judge had

abdicated his powers to the Government Analyst. Although the opinion given

by the Government Analyst is a scientific one, the Learned High Court Judge

only considered his evidence to his own decision with consideration of other

evidence.

Hence, it is incorrect to say that the Learned High court Judge had delegated

his function to the expert in this case. Hence, this ground has no merit.

In the second ground of appeal the Learned Presidents Counsel argues that

the production chain regarding the gun is totally contradictory and therefore

unacceptable.

In a case of this nature the evidence pertaining to the chain of production

plays a crucial role in adjudicating the matter at hand. It has to be proven

before court that the same items of recovery had been placed before the court

for its consideration. The chain of custody proves the integrity of a piece of

evidence. The chain of custody includes the recovery of production, its

custody, its movement from the recovery to the analyst and until it is allowed

and admitted in the court. The chain of custody needs to be documented for

every transmission, that is from the moment the evidence is collected,

8 | P a g e

transferred from one person to another, and to establish that nobody else

could have accessed or possessed that evidence without authorization.

According to PW21 PC 31559, he was the Court Officer of the Magistrate

Court No.06 on 09/01/2004.After the commencement of the court

proceedings he was seated closed to the Learned Magistrate of Court No.06.

After the deceaseds case was taken up, he was kept in custody of the prison

officers till the signing of the committal. After singing the committal he had

handed over the same to the prison officers. Thereafter the deceased was

escorted to the Magistrate Court No.04.When the deceased was about to be

taken out of the Court No.06, he suddenly heard a report of a gun. When he

removed the Learned Magistrate to his chambers, he had heard the sound of

another two or three shots being fired. When he came again to the court, he

had seen the Appellant holding a person at gun point had entered in to the

Registrars room. He had shouted at the Appellant to surrender, as the

Appellant had come out from the Registrars office. At that point the

Appellant was overpowered by the combination officers from police, army

and prison and the gun was recovered from him by PW17 SI/Perera and

handed over the same to this witness. Upon the direction of the Officer-in-

Charge of Keselwatte Police Station he had handed over the same to PW56

PS 29780 Jayawardena who was on duty at the court police post.

According to PW56 PS 29780 Jayawardena, he had received a 9mm pistol

bearing No. F 00585, an empty magazine with one live bullet and the

Appellant on 09/01/2004 and handed over the gun, empty magazine, the

live bullet and the Appellant to the Keselwatte Police Station reserve police

officer PW55 PC 9290 Nawaratne.

PW56 had handed over the Appellant to RPC Shantha from the Colombo

Crime Division. The pistol with empty magazine and one live bullet which

had been entered under PR 75/4 were handed over to IP/Iddamalgoda from

Colombo Crime Division.

9 | P a g e

PW13 CI/Iddamalgoda from the Colombo Crime Division had visited the

scene of crime on 09/01/2004.He had noticed three empty cartridges fallen

near the Registrars office door which is situated close to the entrance door

of the Court. Another empty cartridge was found fallen under a chair of

the bar table. The record room is situated on the corridor of the Court

No.06.Another empty cartridge with a pallet was found fallen near the record

room which is situated left side of the entrance to the court. Another empty

cartridge with two pallets were found fallen near the window of the record

room. A bullet mark was observed on the door of the record room. According

to the witness, he had collected 07 empty cartridges and three pallets from

the crime scene.

After collecting the above-mentioned productions upon further instructions

received from higher officers, PW13 had gone to Keselwatte Police Station

and taken the Appellant, the gun and a pair of shoes under his custody and

taken the same with other productions to the Colombo Crime Division. The

gun, live bullet, empty cartridges and the pallets were handed over to the

Colombo Crime Division reserve police officer under PR No.45/04. The pair

of shoes had been entered under PR No.46/04.

According to PW8 Jayawardena, he had seen the Appellant firing at the

deceased and the deceased had run towards the door of the court. The

deceased was found with injuries on the corridor of the court. His evidence

is very well tallying with the observation made by PW13 who had observed a

bullet mark on the door of the court record room which is situated very close

to the entrance of the court room. Due to aforesaid reasons, it is incorrect to

say that that the deceased was shot in the corridor and not in the court room.

PW50 PS 24766 Ranatunga had received the productions entered under

PR45/04 and PR46/04 from PW13 CI/ Iddamalgoda at the Colombo Crime

Division on 09/01/2004. On the same day he had handed over the same to

PW51 PC 5448 Ranasinghe at 21.20 hours. Again on 10/01/2004 at 5.00

a.m. PW50 had received the PR No.45/04 and 46/04 when he reported for

10 | P a g e

duty. On the same day he had handed over the PR No.45-46/04 to the person

in charge of the production room PW53 PS 29729 Dharmadasa.

PW53 PS 29729 Dharmadasa had received the production No.45/04 and PR

46/04 on 10/01/2004 and kept it in the production room. On 28/01/2004

he had taken the same to the Colombo Magistrate Court. Thereafter, on the

order of the court he had handed over the same to the Government Analyst

Department on the same day.

Considering the evidence led pertaining to the recovery of productions and it

reaching the Government Analyst Department, there is no evidence

contradicting with the evidence led by the Prosecution as claimed by the

Appellant. As the production chain, specially pertaining to the gun is not

disturbed at any stage of its recovery and reaching the Government Analyst

Department, I conclude this ground of appeal also without any merit.

In the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the dock statement

given by the Appellant has not even been referred to in the judgment thereby

making the judgment invalid.

Treating unsworn statement of an accused from dock as evidence has been

recognised and consistently followed in our courts despite the fact that

statement not being subjected to cross examination. It has to be treated as

other evidence which had been subjected to cross examination. Acceptance

of dock statement as evidence has been recognised in several land marked

cases in our jurisdiction.

In Kathubdeen v. Republic of Sri Lanka [1998] 3 SLR 10 the court held

that;

It is settled law that an unsworn statement must be treated as

evidence. It has also been laid down that if the unsworn statement

creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case or if it is believed,

then the accused should be given the benefit of that doubt.

11 | P a g e

In this case the Learned High Court Judge had considered the dock

statement of the Appellant in his judgment at page 437-438 of the brief. As

the Learned High Court Judge had considered the dock statement of the

Appellant in his judgment adequately, the judgment cannot be considered

as an invalid judgment as contended by the Learned Presidents Counsel.

Hence, the final ground of appeal also devoid any merit.

Considering all the circumstances, I am of the view that the appeal ought to

be dismissed as there is no merit in the pleaded grounds of appeal. Hence, I

affirm the conviction and sentence of the Appellant and proceed to dismiss

his appeal.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
