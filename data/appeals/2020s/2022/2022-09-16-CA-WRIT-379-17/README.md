The facts of the case are briefly as follows; the Petitioner is a resident of Maduluwawa in theDampe Grama Niladhari Division. The Petitioner alleges that he is the secretary of the SisilaFarmers Organization with a membership of 60 members who are engaged in agriculturalactivities on lands spanning over 68 acres. The Petitioner states that he has come to this Court onbehalf of the membership of the said organization. The Petitioner further states that he institutedthis action in the nature of a public interest litigation to address the grievances of the public.

The Petitioner states that 6th 13th Respondents are mining license holders and/or miningoperators who are engaged in mining operations, some of which are being carried out without avalid license obtained from the relevant authorities and some operations are being carried outviolating the conditions of the license. The Petitioner states that large-scale mining operations arebeing carried out in and around the vicinity of the land known as Goolshaneally Watte aliasNeelawalangala Watte in the Dampe village of Maduluwawa in the Divisional SecretariatDivision of Padukka of Colombo District.

The Petitioner states that the mining activities of the Respondents have damaged and causedirreparable damage to the environment and severely impacted the daily lives and the livelihoodof the villagers who are engaged in agricultural activities in the area. Petitioner further states thatsome of the mining operators are also engaged in illegal sand mining operations in

4

Neelawalangala Watte which has contaminated water sources in the area and affectedagricultural activities as well as rendered it unfit for human consumption. Petitioner also statesthat mining operations have severely affected the Puselioya which carries water to theMorakottanuwawela which was an area used for paddy cultivation for decades.

The Petitioner filed this writ application and prays for the following reliefs:

1. Grant and issue an order in the nature of a writ of certiorari directing the 1-5th

Respondents to quash/annul, cancel/suspend the approvals so far granted by them forcarrying out the mining operations in the Goolshaneally Watte alias NeelawalangalaWatte and in the area of the close vicinity.

2. Grant and issue an order in the nature of mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to act in

compliance with sections 10,16,17,22,26, 23A,23B,23C,23D,23N,23AA,23BB,23CC,24A,24C,24D of the National Environment Act No.47 1980 asamended, with regard to the mining operations described in the petition.

3. Grant and issue an order in the nature of mandamus directing the 3rd Respondent to act in

compliance with the sections 32, 33, 34, 74, 75, ,76, 77, 79, 80, 96 of the AgrarianDevelopment Act No. 46 of 2000 as amended with regard to the mining operations andits effects,

4. Grant and issue an order in the nature of mandamus directing the 4th and 4A Respondents

to act in compliance with under and in terms of sections 8 (cc), 8(f), 8(k), 8(p), 8(q), 8(r),8(s), 8J, 8K, 28 AND 28 A of the Urban Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978 asamended.

Petitioners complaint to Court

The Petitioners main complaints, are namely that the 6th -13th Respondents are carryingon illegal mining operations,Even if they have valid approval, they are violating the conditions of the approval,1st 4th Respondents have failed to discharge, exercise, and perform the duties vested inthem by way of statute, namely to curb the violations,Petitioner states that 6th 13th Respondents are engaged in mining operations violatingexisting laws, causing grave and irreparable loss and harm to the environment and tocitizens residing in its vicinity,Permit without Central Environmental Authority approval is a procedural irregularity.

Thus, this application for writs of certiorari and mandamus.

5

The Respondents in their objections have raised several preliminary objections. In summary, theRespondents are united in the following objections.

The Petitioner is in violation of the Court of Appeal Rules,The Petitioner has no locus standi to file this application,The necessary parties are not before Court,In any event the Petitioner has come to Court after an undue delay and the Petitioner isguilty of lashes,The prayer is vague thus no relief can be granted and the application is misconceived inlaw,The Petitioner is guilty of mispresenting and suppressing vital facts to the Court thus hasfailed to come with clean hands.

This Court will consider the said objections.

At the commencement of arguments, the parties informed Court that the 10th Respondent is nolonger carrying out mining operations and therefore the mining license of the said Respondent isno longer active. Thus, the Petitioner is not pursuing his case against the 10th Respondent.

As pleaded, when the Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, the Petitioners maingrievance was that 6th to 13th Respondents are carrying out illegal mining operations (para10) andare damaging the environment and causing a nuisance to the public including the Petitioner.However, in the same paragraph, the Petitioner submits that the said Respondents are holders ofmining licenses. Thus, it appears that the Petitioner himself is in doubt as to whether hisallegation against the Respondents on illegal mining can be maintained. The Respondents havecorrectly submitted that when a person is holding a valid license, he cannot be considered as aperson who is engaged in illegal mining. It is also pertinent to note that the Petitioner in hispetition, has failed to identify the Respondents who are allegedly conducting illegal mining.Without identifying, the Petitioner contends that some of the operators are carrying out illegalsand mining. All the Respondents denied the allegation and went further to state that they wereonly operating quarries.

Illegal mining operationsThe Petitioners main contention is that 6th to 13th Respondents are conducting illegal miningoperations. To answer this question, the Court will consider whether the said Respondents havelegally valid permits. 6th to 13th Respondents other than the 10th Respondent are in possession ofvalid mining licenses issued by the Geological Surveys & Mines Bureau. The said licenses weresubmitted by the Counsel as,

6R1 valid from 2017.10.03 to 2018.10.027R1 valid from 2017.11.10 to 2017.12.198R1 valid from 2017.01.31 to 2017.03.019R1 valid from 2018.01.08 to 2019.01.07

6

11R1 valid from 2017.09.04 to 2017.12.0312R1 valid from 2017.12.19 to 2018.12.1813R1 valid from 2017.11.14 to 2018.11.13.

The Respondents answering this allegation contended that, the 6th to 13th Respondents are validlicense holders of mainly the 1st Respondent, the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau and haveobtained all the approvals necessary from the relevant stakeholders to function. As per the material submitted to this Court, and as per the submissions of the parties, we find thatthe 6th to 13th Respondents have conducted mining operations with a valid permit. Thus, thePetitioners contention of Respondents carrying out illegal mining operations fails.

This Court will now examine the Petitioners second allegation that the Respondents are inbreach of the conditions of the permit.To substantiate this allegation, the Petitioner relies on a newspaper article (P4) and severalphotographs (P5a to P5c) which shows soil being removed from an undisclosed location. The6th,7th, 9th,11th,12th and 13th Respondents while denying these photographs, contended that theywere not engaged in gravel or soil mining. The 8th Respondent who had a permit for gravelexcavation denied that the photographs were from his site. We find the Petitioner too does notmake a direct allegation nor does he attribute the said photographs to the sites of 6th to 13th

Respondents. The next two documents, the Petitioner relied on are P6, and P7 which also doesnot reflect that the said documents are pertaining to the mining sites of the said Respondents.However, as per P8, it is clear that there had been several issues pertaining to the sites where thequarries are situated. Accordingly, the Geological Surveys and Mines Bureau had called for ameeting with the stakeholders which includes the 6th to 13th Respondents. The Petitionercontended that the said meeting was to discuss the violations of conditions in the permit bymining operators including the 6th to 13th Respondents. This was vehemently denied by the saidRespondents.

The said Respondents contention on the said meeting was that the meeting was not pertaining toany issues regarding them, but involved other mining operators who are not a party to this actionand pertaining to the transport of metal from the quarries. None of the parties have submitted theminutes of the meeting or the recommendations and conclusions of the said meeting to thisCourt. Thus, the reason the meeting was called, is in dispute.

The Petitioner also brought to our attention documents P10, P11(a-e), P12, P14, and P15 todemonstrate the illegal mining operations that are carried out. However, we observe that P10which is a police complaint has no relevance to the 6th to 13th Respondents. It is observed that thedocuments P11(a) to 11(e), P12, P14, and P15 too have no relevance to the 6th to 13th

Respondents. The document P13 is a report on a site where gravel is extracted as stated earlier inthis Judgment it is common ground that 6th to 13th Respondents except for the 8th Respondent is

7

not engaged in gravel excavation. There is no reference nor did the Petitioner allege that P13refers to the site occupied by the 8th Respondent. Hence, we find that the Petitioner has failed toestablish with the material submitted to this Court that the 6th to 13th Respondents have violatedany conditions of their permit. The Petitioner has failed to submit to the Court any complaints hehas made against the permit holder Respondents to demonstrate that they are violating the permitconditions or that they are carrying out illegal mining. It is also pertinent to note that even at theargument stage, the Petitioner failed to demonstrate what specific provisions of the permits areviolated and the specific Respondents who are violating the same.

Environmental LicenseThe Petitioners next contention was that the Respondents were acting without a properenvironmental license.1st to 5th Respondents with their objections, tendered to this Court, the approvals granted to thesaid 6th to 13th Respondents and have demonstrated that they had issued the industrial mininglicense only after considering the approvals of the other relevant state institutions. The UrbanDevelopment Authority had issued its approval subject to the mining being done in compliancewith the conditions imposed in the environmental permit and subject to its own conditions. Thus,it was contended that without the environmental permit, Urban Development Authority approvalwould not have been granted. Further, the mining had to be carried out under the supervision ofan authorized officer from the Environmental Authority (6R1-6R5). As per the submissionsmade and the documents submitted, it is demonstrated that all the other Respondents too hadobtained the necessary approvals including the environmental permit. It is also pertinent to statethat the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that he had complained specifically against the 6th to13th Respondents violating the conditions of the license or that they were engaged in illegal sandmining or mining.

This Court also observes that 6th to 13th Respondents had been carrying out these miningoperations with the permits issued by the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, and it wassubmitted that the Respondents have the approval of the Central Environmental Authority(CEA), Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, Department of Archeology, etc. TheRespondents further submitted that the said mining was done under the inspection of a technicalofficer registered with the environmental authority. It is pertinent to note that the6th,9th,10th,11th,12th, and 13th Respondents have submitted their respective environmental licensesto Court.

Now we will consider the objections raised by the Respondents.

Non-compliance with Court of Appeal Rules.The Respondents raised an objection on the grounds that the Petitioner has failed to comply withthe Court of Appeal Rules. It was the contention of 1st to 5th, 6th,9th,10th, and 13th Respondents that

8

the Petitioner has failed to comply with Rule 3(1) of the Court of Appeal rules. The said rulestates as follows, Rule 3(1)(a) Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the powersvested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 and 141 of the Constitution shall be by way ofpetition, together with an affidavit in support of the averments therein, and shall beaccompanied by the originals of documents material to such application (or duly certifiedcopies thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender any suchdocument, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the leave of the Court tofurnish such document later. Where a petitioner fails to comply with the provisions of thisrule, the Court may ex mero motu or at the instance of any party dismiss such application."The Respondents contended that the Petitioner has failed to submit certified copies of thedocuments and has failed to obtain the permission of this Court to submit the same at a laterstage. It was also contended that the document marked P4, a newspaper article does not evendisplay the name of the newspaper.

The second contention of the Respondents was that the Petitioner has failed to comply with Rule3(2) of the Court of Appeal rules. The said rule states as follows, The petition and affidavit, except in the case of an application for the exercise of thepowers conferred by Article 141 of the Constitution shall contain an averment that thejurisdiction of the Court of Appeal has not previously been invoked in respect of the samematter. If such jurisdiction has previously been invoked the petitioner shall contain anaverment disclosing relevant particulars of the previous application. Where any suchaverment as aforesaid is found to be false or incorrect the application may be dismissed.

The Petitioner has failed to answer these objections. The Court of Appeal Rules are there to beobserved. Our Courts have taken a strict view on compliance with the rules. In WoodmanExports (Pvt) Ltd Vs Commissioner General Labour and others 2010 (BLR) 238 theSupreme Court held that The non-compliance with a mandatory Rule by a party could lead toserious erosion of well-established Court procedures maintained by our Courts throughoutseveral decades and therefore the failure to comply with Rule 8(3) of the Supreme Court Ruleswould necessarily be fatal.

In the case of Caderamanpulle and Others Vs Caderamanpulle and Others (2005) 1 SLR398, Amaratunge J cited the case of Perera v Perera where Udalagama J observed, This Courton numerous occasions held that in applications for leave to appeal, compliance with Rule 3(1)of the Supreme Court Rules 1990 pertaining to appellate procedure is mandatory. (page 31)Having made the above observation, this Court proceeded to dismiss the application with thefollowing words, I am compelled to hold that non-compliance with the Supreme Court Rules isfatal to the application and proceed to sustain the preliminary objection raised by the defendant-petitioner-respondent and dismiss this application with costs."

9

In the case of Attorney General v. Wilson Silva (1992) 1 SLR 48 Justice Grero stated, Thepetitioner has not satisfied this Court with a reasonable explanation regarding the impossibilityof obtaining such copies in order to submit to this Court along with this application. At least noattempt has been made by him to tender them to this Court even subsequently. This Court is ofthe view that the said documents are very essential and they must be before this Court when thisCourt goes into the merits of the application. Non-compliance of the requirement regarding thetendering of such documents has not been satisfactorily explained by the petitioner andtherefore, this Court is of the view that there is a violation of the provisions of Rule 46, which isfatal to this application.

The Petitioner has not only failed to answer this objection but has also failed to give anexplanation for the non-compliance with the Court of Appeal rules.

Necessary parties are not before Court The learned Counsel for 6th,13th,9th, and 10th Respondents contended that there are several othermining operators who are carrying out mining operations in the Goolsheneally Watte also knownas Neelawangala watte. This is amply established by the documents submitted by the Petitionerhimself, especially the copies of the records of the Court cases against some of these operators. Itwas the contention of the Counsel that this is relevant, especially in view of the way the reliefsare prayed. The Petitioner is seeking a writ of certiorari to quash/annul, cancel/suspend theapprovals granted for carrying mining in the above-stated area. Thus, it was argued that theorders sought would affect parties who are not before Court but are legally carrying out miningoperations in the area.

It was also argued that the mining license issued, should be on a recommendation from the areaGrama Sevaka, The Divisional Secretary, The Pradeshiya Sabha, Department of Archeology, andespecially the Department of Geological Surveys and Mines Bureau who is the issuing authorityof the license and who has the obligation to supervise that the conditions of the license areobserved. None of them have been made parties to this action. It was contended that thePetitioner in paragraph 10 of his petition had reserved the right to amend the parties who areillegally engaged in mining and add necessary parties upon the receipt of additional information.However, the Petitioner has failed to make any application to such effect and has not amendedthe petition till the arguments were concluded. This objection too was not answered by thePetitioner. The Petitioner is seeking a writ of mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to actunder the provisions of the Mines and the Minerals Act but as correctly pointed out by the 1st to5th Respondents Counsel, the monitoring and supervisory duties are carried out under Act No 33of 1992 by the Geological Surveys and Mines Bureau and its officers. We find the Petitioner hasfailed to make the said Geological Surveys and Mines Bureau a party to this application.

In Rawaya Publishers Vs. Wijedasa Rajapakse and Others [2003 3 SLR 213] Justice AsokaDe Silva President of the Court of Appeal (as he was then) after considering the law relating to

10

necessary parties, held as follows, In the context of writ applications as a necessary party is onewithout whom no order can be effectively made. A proper party is one in whose absence aneffective order can be made but whose presence is necessary to a complete and final decision onthe question involved in the proceedings. If they are not made parties then the petition can bedismissed in limine. It has also been held that persons vitally affected by the writ petition are allnecessary parties. If their number is very large, some of them could be made respondents in arepresentative capacity. In view of the above judgment, the Respondents objection succeeds.Thus, we hold the petitioner has failed to make all the parties that are necessary and who will beaffected by the orders of this Court.

Petitioners prayer is vague thus no relief can be granted and the application ismisconceived in law.The Petitioners first relief sought is for a writ of certiorari. The said prayer prays as follows; Grant and issue an order in the nature of a writ of certiorari directing the 1-5th Respondents toquash/annul, cancel/suspend the approvals so far granted by them for carrying out the miningoperations in the Goolshaneally Watte alias Neelawalangala Watte and in the area of theclose vicinity.

When this Court asked on what grounds the Petitioner is seeking this relief, the Petitioner wasunable to give a direct answer. Further, this Court observes that the prayer seeks to quash all theapprovals so far given, it does not give a time period which means that it is a blanket applicationto quash all the permits issued, irrespective of a time limit, and it does not disclose to whom thepermits have been issued. This Court is kept in oblivion as to whether the permits have beenissued only to 6th to 13th Respondents in this case or whether any other mining operators areinvolved. If so, issuing a writ of certiorari as pleaded by the Petitioner will result in quashing thepermits issued to parties who are not before this Court and who are not a party to this case, andwho have no allegations against them.

Furthermore, the relief sought has to fail as the Petitioner is seeking to quash approvals given,not only pertaining to Goolshaneally watte alias Neelawalangala watte but even to areas in closevicinity. The Petitioner is seeking this relief without properly identifying the areas that are inclose vicinity and without disclosing up to what extent this close vicinity expands.

In his submissions, the Petitioner offered another vague answer to this objection and submittedthat the area where the mining is carried out is depicted in a Google map marked P3 but stoppedshort of identifying a clear location. This Court also observes that the Petitioner is not seeking awrit of certiorari based on the said Google map but is seeking to cover an undisclosed area byusing the word vicinity. It is well established that a Petitioner who seeks relief in a judicialreview application cannot succeed if his prayer is vague and also, he cannot couch all imaginablereliefs in the prayer. The Petitioner should know what his grievance is and be specific as to therelief he is seeking.

11

In Tilwin Silva v Ranil Wickremasinghe and Other (2007) 2 SLR 15 it was held that, ThePetitioners prayer for a writ of prohibition not to sign any similar agreement is vague wide, anddoubtful and such relief cannot be granted.

In his application for a writ of mandamus, the Petitioner has sought an order to compel theRespondents to act pursuant to several sections of the respective acts. However, the Petitionerhas failed to address this Court as to what specific provisions of the Act have not been compliedwith and/or whether the Respondents have refused to discharge the statutory duties cast on them.

As held in the above case, when a Petitioner seeks relief under judicial review, he should bespecific and should know what relief he is seeking and against whom or against what illegal actsthe relief is prayed. Under the circumstances, we agree that the prayer is vague and the objectionsucceeds. Mispresenting and suppressing vital facts to Court, thus has failed to come with cleanhandsThe Petitioner has come to Court on the basis that there is environmental destruction caused byillegal mining. His main allegation is against the 6th to 13th Respondents who are alleged to becausing the destruction by their illegal acts. To demonstrate the violations of the conditions ofthe permit, the Petitioner has attached the documents P4 and P5a-c. The Petitioner also submittedin paragraph 9 the copies of the mining license given to 6th to 13th Respondents and in thesubsequent paragraph has stated that the area residents had made several complaints to the policewhich resulted in a prosecution. To demonstrate this point, the Petitioner has tendered to Courtthe documents marked as P10 and P11a-e, P12, P14, and P15.

As stated elsewhere in this Judgment, this Court observes that the said documents are notpertaining to the 6th to 13th Respondents. The way in which the above-mentioned documents werepleaded was misleading to this Court and the failure of the Petitioner to disclose that the abovedocuments were not pertaining to the 6th 13th Respondents amounts to a misrepresentation offacts. Thus the Respondents contention that the Petitioner by misrepresentation has distorted theactual situation to gain an undue advantage at their cost, has merit.

In Namunukula Plantations Limited Vs Minister of Lands and others (2012) 1 SLR pg 376it was interalia held that It is settled law that a person approaches the Court for grant ofdiscretionary relief, to which category and application for a writ of certiorari would undoubtedlybelong, has to come with clean hands, and should candidly disclose all the material facts whichhave any bearing on the adjudication of the issues raised in the case. In other words, he owes aduty of utmost good faith (uberimafides) to the court to make a full and complete disclosure ofall material facts and refrain from concealing or suppressing any material facts within hisknowledge or which he could have known by exercising diligence expected of a person ofordinary prudence.

12

Thus, the objections of the Respondents succeed.

This brings us to make an observation pertaining to the second relief prayed namely a writ ofmandamus. The Petitioners documents P11a-c and P12, P14 demonstrate that in fact, the CentralEnvironmental Authority and the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau have taken action againstthe illegal mine operators whenever it had been brought to their notice. The documents clearlyestablish that contrary to the Petitioners allegation, the authorities had not been inactive, in fact,had been quite active and had prosecuted and suspended the mining license of the offender mineoperators if and when violations have taken place.

In view of the above observation, this Court is inclined to accept the Respondents objection thatthe Petitioner has failed to demonstrate whether he has brought to the attention of 1st to 5th

Respondents of specific violations and whether the said Respondents have failed or refused toperform, in violation of the provisions of the respective statutes.

Another reason why this application has to fail is that, the permits submitted to Court have allexpired. The permits granted have a specific time period. None of the parties submitted to thisCourt any new permits. Thus, issuing a writ to quash a nonexistent permit is futile. It is trite lawthat Courts will not issue a prerogative writ if it is futile.

However, this Court observes that in granting approvals and licenses for mining activities, 1st -6th

Respondents should strictly adhere to the provisions of the respective statutes that govern themand should be satisfied that the requirements are met before issuing the approvals and the saidapprovals should be granted according to law.

Therefore, after considering all the materials submitted and the submissions made, this Courtfinds the objections raised by the Respondents succeed. In any event, we find that the Petitionerhas failed to establish his case to the satisfaction of this Court.

Accordingly, we are not inclined to grant the reliefs prayed and for the reasons set out in thisjudgment, this application is dismissed without cost.
