This application is made by the petitioner seeking a constitutional injunction pursuant to article

143 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The petitioner being

a partner of a consortium has entered into a contract with the government of Sri Lanka. The

Consortium consists of two other partners namely N D Enterprises of 8th floor Hemkunt, House

Building, 6 Rajendra Place, New Delhi India, and Archedium (Private Ltd) of 2nd floor of

Liberty Arcade, R A De Mel Mawatha, Colombo 03. It was submitted that the Petitioner as

the contractor had entered into a contract marked P2 with the government of Sri Lanka as the

employer, for the construction of housing units, for the conflict-affected families in the

Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. The petitioner submits that the P2 contract was

entered into for the construction of 7000 houses. However, during the initial stage 300 houses

were to be completed. The petitioner has been informed to commence the construction of 300

housing units within the stipulated time namely by 13.10.2020. For this purpose, there was a

contractual requirement for the Petitioner to submit a performance bond. The Petitioner submits

that in terms of clause 4.2 of the Contract data he had submitted the performance bond

guarantee no 3100 2020 0049 valued at Rs. 72,800,000.00.

The Petitioner has been informed by a letter dated 8.7.21 (P3) that he should construct the 300

housing units on 13.10.2020. The said letter also informs the Petitioner to complete the work

before 14.01.2021. It is pertinent to note that the parties had entered into the contract marked

P2 on 17.05.2019 for the construction of houses. Subsequently, the Petitioner made a request

for an extension of time, and as per the available material submitted to this Court, on the

petitioners request extensions have been granted up to 29.07.2021 (P3). As the petitioner has

failed to complete the said housing units the following observations had been made in the letter

marked P3. The said observations are as follows;

Still you have not completed even 12 houses.

The Technical Team has been changed from time to time and it seriously affected the

progress of the site.

Assigned workforce is not adequate.

5

Quality control at the individual sites is in very poor condition.

Further, it is noted that you did not produce the following to show progress.

Confirmed shipping arrangement details for the next 278 Houses.

Exact completion date or work schedule for next houses.

The petitioner did not contest the said observations but submitted that due to the prevailing

situation in the country at the relevant time they were unable to complete the task. As per the

said letter, it is evident that the relevant ministry on 28.10.2020 released an advance payment

of 72 million to the Petitioner. By letter P3, the ministry has refused to extend the time period

for the Petitioner to complete the construction. The petitioner replied to the said letter on 9.8.21

(P4). Thereafter Subsequent to another application by the Petitioner requesting to grant an

extension, Ministry has given a further extension of a time up to 31.12.2021 and also extended

the tax exemption date granted to the Petitioner up to 31.12.2021. However, the ministry has

also requested to extend the validity period of the performance bond. (P5A, P5B, P8A). This

has been complied with by the Petitioner and the Performance bond extended from time to

time till 31.12.2022(P8b).

Thereafter the Petitioner submits that he could not import the necessary raw materials for the

construction due to certain restrictions relating to the importation of raw materials. The

petitioner has subsequently made a request to the Ministry to provide necessary assistance to

obtain the importation license. The Ministry by letter dated 21.02.2022 has informed the

director department of import control to issue an Importation license to the Petitioner (P6D).

However, the petitioner submits that the Ministry had failed to provide the necessary assistance

for the importation of raw materials until April 2022.

The Petitioner also submits that thereafter due to various intervening decisions taken by the

government namely temporarily suspending the importation of certain goods the Petitioner

could not meet the deadline to complete the project. On 08.11.2022 the Petitioner made a

further request seeking a further extension to complete the construction as the contract period

was to end on 30.11.2022(P16). The Petitioner submits that he has not got the requested

extension from the Ministry. However, the petitioner contends that through information

6

received the Petitioner believes that the employer is not going to extend the contract period but

would encash the Performance bond.

The Petitioner submits that as per clause 19 (1) of the Contract he is entitled to an extension

on request and further, submits that also, under clauses 8.4 and 8.5 he is entitled to an extension.

However, we find that under clause 19.1 for the contractor to seek an extension pursuant to the

said clause he should give notice to the engineer. The Petitioner has failed to submit to this

court any document to demonstrate that he has complied with the said clause and given the

notice to the engineer seeking an extension.

In anticipation of him not getting the requested extension from the employer and in his

apprehension that the Ministry is going to encash the performance guarantee, he has sought

injunctive relief from this Court. He further submits that he is seeking this relief until he files

a Civil action against the Respondent Ministry before the commercial High Court and District

Court of Colombo.

In considering this application it is pertinent to note that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate

to this Court with any substantive material his apprehension, that the performance guarantee

furnished is going to be encashed. what is pleaded is his belief which is not substantiated by

any material. It is also pertinent to note that the petitioner on previous occasions had been

given several extensions to complete the construction which he has failed to do.

In essence, by this application, the petitioner is seeking relief pertaining to a matter where his

relationship with the Respondent is based on a contract. It is not denied by the petitioner that

the breach of the contract would result in an actionable wrong which has a remedy provided by

the contract itself.

In any event, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate to this court that he has complied with

the contractual requirements to obtain an extension that would have been available to him under

P2.

7

The Petitioner is inviting this Court to injunct the Respondents from encashing or form

releasing the performance guarantee issued on behalf of the Petitioner. The Performance

guarantee marked as P8b is a contract between the bank and in this instance the Secretary

Ministry of Urban Development and Housing who is the beneficiary.

In Edward Owen Engineering Ltd vs Barclays Bank International Ltd 1978 1 ALL ER

976 it was held

A performance guarantee was similar to a confirmed letter of credit. Where. therefore, a bank

had given a performance guarantee it was required to honour the guarantee according to its

terms and was not concerned whether either party to the contract which underlay the guarantee

was in default. The only exception to that rule was where fraud by one of the parties to the

underlying contract had been established and the bank had notice of the fraud.

This principle has been followed in a number of cases in Sri Lanka.

In Hemas Marketing Pvt Ltd vs Chandrasiri and others 1994 2SLR 181, it was held When

a bank has given a guarantee, it is required to honor it according to its terms and is not

concerned whether either party to the contract which underlay the contract was in default. The

whole purpose of such commercial instruments was to provide security which was to be readily,

promptly and assuredly realizable when the prescribed event occurred. The only exception to

the rule is where fraud by one of the parties to the underlying contract has been established

and the bank had notice of the fraud. A mere plea of fraud put in for the purpose of bringing

the case within this exception and which rests in the uncorroborated statements of the applicant

will not suffice." In the said judgment, Dr. Ranaraja J further observed as follows, "It is only

in exceptional circumstances that Courts will interfere with the machinery of obligations

assumed by the banks. They are the lifeblood of international commerce. Such obligations are

regarded as collateral to underlying rights and obligations between merchants at either end of

the banking chain. Courts will leave the merchants to settle their disputes under the contract

by litigation."

In Indica Traders (Pvt) Limited v Seoul Lanka Constructions (Pvt) Limited and others

(1994) 3 SLR 387. it was held

It is thus clear that business transactions between a bank and a beneficiary, constituted in the

nature of a performance bond, a performance guarantee, letter of guarantee or a irrevocable

letter of credit, whereby the bank is obliged to pay money to a beneficiary, are not tripartite

transactions between the bank (surety), the beneficiary (creditor) and the party at whose

instance the bond, guarantee or letter is issued (the principal debtor) but, simply transactions

between the bank and the beneficiary. A bank thereby guarantees to the beneficiary payment

of money and is obliged to honour that guarantee according to its terms. Any dispute that may

arise between the beneficiary (creditor) and the party at whose instance the guarantee or letter

is given (the principal debtor), on the underlying contract, cannot be urged to restrain the bank

from honouring the guarantee or letter according to its terms. In an application for an

injunction to restrain the bank from making payment, the Court has to consider whether there

is a challenge to the validity of the bond, guarantee or letter itself, upon which payment is

claimed and whether the conditions as specified in writing are satisfied. If the challenge to the

validity is not substantial and the conditions as specified in the writing are met, prima facie no

injunction should be granted and the bank should be left free to honour its obligation.

The only exception to this general rule is where it is established by the party applying for the

injunction that a claim for payment upon such bond, guarantee or letter is clearly fraudulent.

A mere plea of fraud put in for the purpose of bringing the case within this exception and which

rest on the uncorroborated statement of the applicant will not suffice. An injunction.may be

granted only in circumstances where the Court is satisfied that the bank should not effect

payment. Therefore, an injunction may be granted on the ground of fraud only where there is

clear evidence as to:

(i) the fact of fraud and,

(ii) the knowledge of the bank as to the facts constituting the fraud..

9

A performance bond is similar to letters of credit issued by the bank, and the said bank is

obliged to pay once the demand is made if it satisfied the terms stipulated. It is a contract

independent of the underline main agreement between the petitioner and the Respondents. The

dispute between the petitioner and the respondents in this instance is not a dispute between the

bank and the beneficiary in whose favor the performance guarantee has been issued.

In the instant case before us, the Petitioner has not pleaded nor has he demonstrated any act of

fraud by the Respondents. In the absence of any fraud disclosed by the Petitioner himself, it is

safe to come to the conclusion that there cannot be a fraud that has been informed to the bank

and is within the knowledge of the bank. There is a long line of judgments that Recognizes

fraud as the exception where a court will interfere in a commercial transaction by granting an

injunction as prayed in this case. That too is, if the petitioner is successful in establishing fraud.

In our view, in this instance, the petitioner has failed to establish the need for intervention of

this Court

It is clear on the pleadings that the Petitioner has failed to complete the execution of the contract

he has entered with the respondent. The petitioner conceded that after the grant of three

extensions the petitioner has been able to complete only 12 houses out of the 300 houses that

were to be constructed during the initial phase. It is common grounds that the Petitioner has

obtained an advance payment of 72 million. The said sum has been released to the petitioner

on the strength of the Performance bond submitted by the Petitioner. The said performance

bond is the instrument the petitioner is seeking to injunct the respondents from encashing

and/or releasing.

It is also pertinent to note that the Petitioner as the partner of the consortium has instituted this

action under his name. Though he pleads that he is duly authorized to institute this action on

behalf of the other partners no such documentary proof has been submitted to this court.

As stated above in the absence of any material to establish fraud by the Respondents this Court

is not inclined to interfere with the banks contractual obligation to its beneficiary. It is also

10

pertinent to note that if as alleged by the Petitioner if there are violations of the conditions of

the contract the Petitioner can settle the said disputes in an appropriate forum pursuant to the

remedies that are provided in the contract itself.

When this application was supported, the counsel appearing for the 8th Respondent, the bank

submitted that they would abide by any order of this Court.

This court has constantly held that the injunctive remedy under the Constitution will be

exercised by this court only on exceptional grounds. The Petitioner has failed to demonstrate

that there are exceptional grounds in this instance, for this court to intervene.

Accordingly, for the aforesaid reasons we are not inclined to grant an injunction in terms of

article 143 of the constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka thus, this

application for an injunction is dismissed.
