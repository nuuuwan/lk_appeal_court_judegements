Argued on: 13.10.2021.

Decided on: 26.01.2022.

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner is a Company duly incorporated under the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007

and the Respondent is the Director General of Sri Lanka Customs. The Petitioner is

engaged in importation and distribution of Pringles brand Potato chips in Sri Lanka.

For the purpose of clearing the Potato chips, from the Customs, Petitioner used the

Harmonized Code (HS Code) 2005.20.00. The World Customs Organization (the

WCO), have developed and introduced a multipurpose international product

nomenclature system known as Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding

System or simply HS recognizing that all Customs and Border agencies around the

world must classify the identical good in the identical manner for the purposes of

levying import and export tariffs. The Harmonized System is governed by the

International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding

System.

In February 2014, Post Clearance Audit Directorate of the Sri Lanka Customs (the

PCAD) initiated a post-clearance audit trial regarding the Pringles Potato chips

imported by the Petitioner into the country under HS Code 2005.20.00 and by letter

dated 05.02.2015 marked as A 3 requested the Petitioner to submit documentation

relating to the product literature specially denoting the composition of all products

imported under the HS Code 2005.20.00. By letter dated 13.02.2015 marked as A 4

Petitioner submitted the requested information by the PCAD. The learned Counsel for

the Petitioner submitted to the Court that since the PCAD did not communicate any

determination and/or change in respect of the HS Code under which the Potato chips

3

were imported, the Petitioner continued to import the good under the same HS Code

believing genuinely that HS Code 2005.20.00 is the correct HS Code. The learned SSC

appearing for the Respondent submitted to Court that in pursuant to the post-clearance

audit, a Customs Inquiry had been conducted by the PCAD under the reference No.

PCAD/HQO/070/2017 and at the Inquiry it was found that the appropriate HS Code for

the product is HS 1905.90.20. He has further submitted to Court that the Commodity

Classification Division of the Customs (the CCD) which is the Division that is entrusted

with giving rulings on classification matters also confirmed that the correct HS Code

for the product should be 1905.90.20. It is important to note that the Custom duties

payable for the goods imported into Sri Lanka under HS Code 1905.90.20 are higher

than the Custom duties payable for the goods imported under the HS Code 2005.20.00.

In pursuant to the Customs Inquiry, the Respondent decided to charge Rs. 54 576

752.76 as short-paid levies from the Petitioner for 17 consignments imported into Sri

Lanka. The argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the decisions of

the Respondent to categorise the Pringles Potato chips under HS Code 1905.90.20

and to charge Rs. 54 576 752.67 as short levies are ultra vires the powers conferred on

the Respondent and those decisions were unreasonable, irrational, illogical and contrary

to the principles of natural justice and therefore, the Petitioner has a legitimate

expectation of directing the Respondent through Court to refer the dispute to the WCO

for determination of the correct HS Code. By this Writ Application, the Petitioner is

seeking the reliefs, inter alia, to issue writs of Certiorari to quash the letter dated

23.01.2018 marked as A6 of the Respondent informing the Petitioner to pay the short-

paid levies with immediate effect and the reminders dated 19.11.2018 and 28.02.2019

(marked as A8 and A11 respectively) to pay the same and a writ of Mandamus directing

the Respondent to seek opinion of the WCO regarding the appropriate HS Code.

The main issue to be decided in this Application is whether the correct HS Code for the

Pringle Potato chips imported by the Petitioner should be 2005.20.00 or 1905.90.20.

The learned SSC submitted to Court that for the determination of HS Codes, specialized

knowledge on classification is required and it is the exclusive domain of the technocrats

who have expertise in that area. The position of the learned SSC therefore, is that this

Court cannot assume the function of the CCD, which consists of experts on

classification and make a decision contrary to the decision of the CCD. Nevertheless,

he admits that the Court is not deprived from examining the reasonableness and the

legality of the determination of the CCD. I totally agree with the said submission and

the admission of the learned SSC. I, therefore, will consider whether the decisions of

the Respondent that the appropriate HS Code is 2005.20.00 and that the Petitioner

should pay the amount mentioned in the letter marked as A-6 as short-paid levies are

reasonable, rational and legal.

The argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the appropriate HS Code

should be 2005.20.00 is based on the following grounds;

(a) ex-facie the primary ingredient contained in "Pringles" Potato chips is potatoes as

every variety of "Pringles" Potato chips contain more than 50% potatoes as evidenced

by the documents submitted to the PCAD marked as A4.

(b) several Potato chips products have been imported into Sri Lanka categorised under

the said HS Code No. 2005.20.00 including "Mister Potato Crisps", "LAY'S Potato

Chips" and "LIGO Potato Chips" and the said Potato chip brands have been imported

subsequently to the PCAD inquiry being instituted against the Petitioner as evident by

the document marked as A10a and A10b.

(c) "Pringles" Potato chips are permitted to be imported into several other countries,

including India, Bangladesh, Maldives, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Canada,

Belgium, China, Austria, Argentina, Bolivia under the said HS Code No. 2005.20.00.

as evident from the document marked as A10c.

According to the National Imports Tariff Guide issued by Sri Lanka Customs (marked

as A9) HS Code 2005.20.00 comes under HS Heading 20.05. The products covered

5

under that HS Heading are Other vegetable prepared or preserved otherwise than by

vinegar or acetic acid, not frozen, other than products of Heading 20.06 (Heading 20.06

deals with Vegetables, fruit, nuts, fruit-peel and other parts of plants, preserved by

sugar). The description of the product which comes under HS Code 2005.20.00 is

Potatoes.

HS Code 1905.90.20 which the Customs has decided as the correct HS Code comes

under Chapter 19 of the National Imports Tariff Guide and the products covered under

that Chapter are Preparations of vegetables, fruit, nuts or other parts of plants. The

relevant HS Heading for HS Code 1905.90.20 is 19.05 and the products included into

that Heading are Bread, pastry, cakes, biscuits and other bakers wares, whether or not

containing cocoa; communion wafers, empty cachets of a kind suitable for

pharmaceutical use, sealing wafers, rice paper and similar products. The product

description given under HS Code 1905.90.20 is Other, in retail packaging of 1kg or

less. Therefore, it is evident that the HS Code 2005.20.00 deals with products

manufactured using Potato based preparations while HS 1905.90.20 does not deal with

any product manufactured using any form of Potatoes.

The learned SSC submitted to Court that the CCD had confirmed the decision dated

23.01.2018 of the Inquiring Officer who had conducted the Customs Inquiry that the

appropriate HS Code should be 1905.90.20. The classification opinion of the CCD is

marked as R2. According to the facts stated in R2, to decide the correct HS Code, the

CCD has considered certain HS Headings [20.05(4) and 19.05(A) (15)] and Folios (IV-

2005-1, IV-2005-2 and IV-1905-1 to 3). In paragraph 22 of the statement of objections,

it is stated that the Chapter Notes, Heading Notes and Subheading Notes of

Nomenclature of the WCO confirms the decision of the Inquiring Officer. The

allegation of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that at the Customs Inquiry those

Headings, Folios and Notes were not made available to the Petitioner or not even drawn

the attention of the Petitioner. None of those HS Headings, Folios and Notes are

6

tendered even to the Court for its consideration. Hence, the Court is not in a position to

decide as to whether the reasons mentioned in R2 for classification of Pringle Potato

chips under HS 1905.90.20 were reasonable/rational/legal. In South Bucks District

Council v Porter1 Lord Brown remarked that,

The reasons for a decision must be intelligible and they must be adequate. They must

enable the reader to understand why the matter was decided as it was and what

conclusions were reached on the principal important controversial issues, disclosing

how any issue of law or fact was resolved. Reasons can be briefly stated, the degree of

particularity required depending entirely on the nature of the issues falling for decision.

The reasoning must not give rise to a substantial doubt as to whether the decision maker

erred in law . . . The reasons need only refer to the main issues in the dispute, not to

every material consideration . . . A reasons challenge will only succeed if the party

aggrieved can satisfy the court that he has genuinely been substantially prejudiced by

the failure to provide an adequately reasoned decision.

The proceedings of the Customs Inquiry are tendered to Court marked as R5. The

allegation of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the Petitioner was not given

an opportunity to present its facts at the Inquiry and therefore, the Inquiry was not

conducted in a fair and reasonable manner. The learned Counsel for the Respondent

denied that allegation. The Court is not in a position to look into that allegation of the

Petitioner for the reason that page No. 106, which is the 1st page of the proceedings

dated 23.01.2018 of the Customs Inquiry is missing from R5. It has been stated at page

107 in A5 that a letter dated 02.08.2017 was received by the Inquiring Officer from the

CCD denoting that the Pringles brand Potato chips should be accepted within the HS

Code 1905.90.20 and that letter is annexed as P1 to the Inquiry proceedings. The

position of the Petitioner is that such a letter was not produced at the Inquiry nor the

attention of the Petitioner drawn to such a letter. The Court can observe that, that letter

1 [2004] UKHL 33.

7

is not even annexed to the Inquiry proceedings tendered to Court marked as R5. Under

the said circumstances, I am of the view that the Respondent has failed to satisfy the

Court that the Customs Inquiry had been conducted fairly and reasonably adhering to

the principles of natural justice. Furthermore, the Court can observe that no reasons

have been given in R5 for the classification of the product under HS Code 1905.90.20

and therefore, the decision taken at the Customs Inquiry is arbitrary and unreasonable.

In Karunadasa v. Unique Gem Stones Ltd and Others2, it was held that Natural Justice

means that a party is entitled to a reasoned consideration of his case; and whether or

not the parties are also entitled to be told the reasons for the decision, if they are

withheld, once judicial review commences, the decision may be condemned as arbitrary

and unreasonable.

Lord Wrenbury in Roberts v. Hopwoods3, emphasises that A person in whom is vested

a discretion must exercise his discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does

not empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded to do so. He must

in the exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought. In other words,

he must, by the use of his reason, ascertain and follow the course which reason

directs. He must act reasonably.4

Considering all the above stated facts and circumstances, I hold that the decision of the

Respondent to classify the Pringles Potato chips imported by the Petitioner within HS

Code 1905.90.20 is unreasonable, irrational, illegal and arbitrary. Therefore, I hold that

the letters marked as A6, A8 and A11 compels the Petitioner to pay short-paid levies

are unreasonable, illegal and irrational.

The learned SSC submitted to the Court that a writ of Mandamus cannot seek against

an entity and argued that since, the Respondent in the instant Application is named in

2 (1997) 1 SLR 256.

3 (1925) AC 578.

his official capacity, the Court cannot issue a writ of Mandamus. The Rule 5 of the

Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules-19905 provides thus;

5. (1) This rule shall apply to applications under Articles 140 and 141 of the

Constitution, in which a public officer has been made a respondent in his official

capacity, (whether on account of an act or omission in such official capacity, or to

obtain relief against him is such capacity, or otherwise).

(2) A public officer may be made a respondent to any such application by reference to

his official designation only (and not by name), and it shall accordingly be sufficient to

describe such public officer in the caption by reference to his official designation or the

office held by him, omitting reference to his name. If a respondent cannot be sufficiently

identified in the manner, it shall be sufficient if his name is disclosed in the averments

in the petition.

Therefore, when considering the said Rule, it is clear that the above stated submission

of the learned SSC is without merits.

According to the facts revealed before the Court it is clear that the Petitioner had

imported Pringles brand Potato chips for about two to three years under HS Code

2005.20.00 before the dispute about the correct HS Code arose. As mentioned

hereinbefore, there is no expert opinion acceptable to the Court about the correct HS

Code for the Pringles Potato chips imported by the Petitioner. Therefore, as argued

by the learned SSC, if the appropriate HS Code for the product is 1905.90.20 and if the

Petitioner is allowed to continue the importation under that HS Code 2005.20.00, a huge

revenue loss could be caused to the Customs and ultimately to the country. It is

important to mention at this stage that it is the duty of the importer to divulge the correct

HS Code. The Respondent is disputing the HS Code disclosed by the Petitioner in the

instant Application. The Petitioner seeks to issue a writ of Mandamus directing the

Respondent to seek the opinion of the WCO regarding the appropriate HS Code. The

5 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules-1990.

9

learned Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the Petitioner had a legitimate expectation

that the Respondent would seek an opinion from the WCO in Brussels. The learned

SSC argued that there is no statutory provision, Rule or practice to seek clarifications

on HS Codes from the WCO provided that the matters that has international

ramifications could be submitted for determination of the WCO since its a costly

process. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner has failed to refer any statutory

provision, Rule, or practice of referring the disputes in this nature to the WCO. In the

case of T & J Pharma Imports (Pvt) Limited vs. P.S.M. Charles D.G. of Customs and

others6, Obeyesekara, J. (as then he was) observed thus; I must say that this Court does

not have the expertise to engage in the classification of a good imported to the country,

nor would it attempt to do so in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction. That expertise lies

with Sri Lanka Customs, and its Nomenclature Committee, as well as with the World

Customs Organization. In instances where Courts lack such expertise, Courts would

defer to the view of such expert bodies. Therefore, the Court has recognised that the

expertise in classification of goods lies with the Nomenclature Committee as well as

the WCO. Under the above stated circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner has failed to

establish that it had a legitimate expectation that the Respondent would seek an opinion

from the WCO.

Considering the above stated facts and circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner is

entitled to a writ of Mandamus not to the extent that is prayed for in prayer (d) to the

amended Petition dated 11.06.2019 but to the extent that the matter should be referred

to the Nomenclature Committee of the Respondent to determine the appropriate HS

Code.

Therefore, I issue a writ of Certiorari as prayed for in prayer (c) to the amended Petition

quashing the contents of the letters marked as A6, A8 and A11 and a writ of Mandamus

6 Writ Application No. 210/2018.

directing the Respondent to refer the matter to the Nomenclature Committee of the

Respondent for determination of the appropriate HS Code. No costs ordered.
