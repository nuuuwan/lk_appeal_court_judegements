The dispute arises in respect of the devolution of Ukkuthinas rights. Issue no. 2 had been raised on behalf of the Plaintiff on the basis that the entire rights of Ukkuthina should devolve on the Plaintiff, a fact which is disputed by the contesting Defendants. Although the learned District Judge had not answered that issue, he had carefully examined the oral and documentary evidence regarding that dispute and come to a correct finding regarding same. The substituted Plaintiff in his evidence had stated that Ukkuthina had three children namely Rankira alias Ukkuwa, Ukkuhathana alias Upendara and Ukkuwa. Ukkuwa and Ukkuhathana had died issueless and their rights had devolved on Rankira alias Ukkuwa. Rankira alias Ukkuwa was the father of the original Plaintiff. According to the substituted Plaintiff, his grandfather had two names and was called as Rankira as well as Ukkuwa. The contesting Defendants had disputed that fact. Their contention was that Rankira was never called as Ukkuwa. In the Birth Certificate of the original Plaintiff who was known as Saronchiya earlier (marked 3), the name of the father is mentioned as Rankira and not as Ukkuwa. It does not say that Rankira was also known as Ukkuwa. The marriage certificate of Rankira marked 4 does not refer to the name Ukkuwa. It does not refer to the name as Rankira alias Ukkuwa. In the deed marked 51, Rankira is not referred to as Rankira alias Ukkuwa. According to the pedigree of the Plaintiff, Upendara is a son of Ukkuthina and Upendaras rights had devolved on the Plaintiff through Rankira. But according to the Birth Certificate marked 6, Upendara is not a son of Ukkuthina but a son of one Pincha alias Puncha. Therefore, Upendaras rights cannot devolve on the Plaintiff. According to the pedigree of the Plaintiff, Ukkuthina had two children who had the same name Ukkuwa. The Birth Certificates of the two Ukkuwas had been marked as 5 and 7. In both these Birth Certificates, the name of the father is mentioned as Ukkuthina and the mothers name is also the same. One Ukkuwa was born in 1885 and the other in 1895. It was the case of the substituted Plaintiff that 5 was the Birth Certificate of his grandfather Rankira alias Ukkuwa. But in that Birth Certificate, there is no reference to the name Rankira. It does not say that the Ukkuwa mentioned in the Birth Certificate was also known and called as Rankira.

    "text": "of Rankira alias Ukkuwa is Ukkuthina. But in the Marriage Certificate of Rankira marked 4, the name of Rankiras father is mentioned as Puncha and not as Ukkuthina. The substituted Plaintiff had admitted in evidence that Puncha and Ukkuthina were brothers who were living together with the same wife. Later Puncha had contracted a separate marriage and had children out of that marriage. Punchas Marriage Certificate had been marked as 8. The contents of Rankiras Marriage Certificate marked 4 and the contents of the Birth Certificate marked 5 have an important bearing on this issue. 4 does not refer to Rankira as Ukkuwa. It does not say that Rankira was also known as Ukkuwa. In that Marriage Certificate, the name of the father of Rankira is not mentioned as Ukkuthina. It is mentioned as Puncha. In the Birth Certificate marked 5, the name of the informant of the Birth is mentioned as Puncha. According to the evidence of the substituted Plaintiff, Puncha is the brother of Ukkuthina. In 5 it is mentioned that Puncha is informing the birth of his brothers son. In 3, the Birth Certificate of the Plaintiff, the informant is his father, Rankira. But Rankira had not mentioned the fact that he was also known as Ukkuwa. When one takes into consideration all these factors, on a balance of probability of evidence one can come to the conclusion that the substituted Plaintiff had failed to prove that his grandfather Rankira was also known as Ukkuwa and the so called Rankira alias Ukkuwa was a son of Ukkuthina. According to the Marriage Certificate of Rankira marked 4, Rankiras father is Pincha and not Ukkuthina. Therefore, the substituted Plaintiff-Respondent had failed to establish that 5 is the Birth Certificate of his grandfather Rankira. After taking into consideration all these factors, the learned District Judge has come to a correct finding regarding the devolution of title of one of the original owners Ukkuthina and we see no reason to interfere with those findings. Therefore, the answer to the issue no. 02 is obvious although the learned District Judge had not answered it.",

Although the learned District Judge has failed to answer the issue no. 2 which is based on the devolution of title of Ukkuthina, he has considered that question and analyzed the evidence and come to correct conclusion that the Plaintiff does not inherit rights from Ukkuthina. He has also considered the question whether the Plaintiff gets rights from Punchi Rala and has come to the correct conclusion that the Deed marked 2 upon which the Plaintiff claimed the rights of Punchi Rala is a Deed which had been executed after the institution of this partition action and those rights had not accrued to the Plaintiff at the time of the institution of this action. Mr. Sahabandu submitted that once the Plaint and the Statements of Claim are accepted by court, all the parties become Plaintiffs as this is a partition action. Several parties had claimed for undivided rights in the corpus and once the partition action is dismissed those parties get affected. He also submitted that there is no cause of action in a partition case and therefore, in deciding the rights of the parties, the date of the institution of the action is immaterial. Although there is no cause of action in a partition case, the Plaintiff must have undivided rights in the corpus to institute same. According to the provisions of Section 2 of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977, only a co-owner of the corpus can institute a partition action. It refers to a land belonging in common to two or more owners and states that any one or more of them may institute a partition action. At the time of the institution of this partition action, the Plaintiff was not a co-owner of the corpus. He did not inherit rights from Ukkuthina and the rights he had purchased upon the deed marked 2 will accrue to the Plaintiff only after the entry of the final decree of this case. Therefore, those rights cannot be granted to the Plaintiff by the judgment of this case and he was not entitled to those rights at the time of the institution of this partition action. Although several parties had claimed for undivided rights in the corpus, only the 4th, 5th and 6th Defendants had asked for a division of the corpus on the basis of the undivided rights they were claiming. None of the others had claimed for the partition of the corpus. Even the 4th, 5th and 6th Defendants had abandoned their claim for a partition decree. Therefore, it is unnecessary to take into consideration the undivided rights of the other parties and come to a determination on those rights. This is not an action for declaration of title and the court is not bound to declare the undivided rights of the parties when the court decides to dismiss the action. Therefore, one cannot say that the other parties had got affected once the partition action was dismissed. None of them had appealed against the judgment on that basis and they are not entitled for a declaration of their rights.",
