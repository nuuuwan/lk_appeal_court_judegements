JUDGMENT

On 14.11.1974, Plaintiff filed an action in the District Court of Panadura under case No.14192/L.

and prayed for a declaration of title;

- to eject the Defendants from 17.09.1974 and the damages at the rate of Rs.10/- per month,

- to eject the Defendants and hand the peaceful possession to the Plaintiff.

The Plaintiff had mentioned only one schedule to the Plaint, a land situated at Panadura

Thalpitidebathe, Pattiya South the Bulughawatha Kattiya in the extent of 01 Rood and 13 perches.

Only two Defendants were named.

After many amendments to the Plaint, Plaintiff finally amended his Plaint on 15.02.1988. In this

amended Plaint, there are three schedules; the second schedule is identical to the schedule in the

original Plaint. However, in the last amended Plaint, Plaintiff had limited his prayer to the third

schedule, which is only 18 perches of land. His prayers were:

- To declare the land and building described in the third schedule to the Plaint belongs to the

Plaintiff.

- To eject the 1st Defendant and all who holders under her from the premises.

- Until such time, damages of Rs.10/- per month from 01.11.1974

- The possession of the building and land is to be given to the Plaintiff.

According to the amended Plaint first owner of the land described in the first schedule were

Maduma Waduge Elias Fernando and his wife, Anna Salgado. From then onwards, he had

described the pedigree of the land. One Porolis Fernando had inherited 1/3rd of the land. When he

died without leaving a Last Will, it devolved on his wife and the six children. One of the children

was Sisiliya. The wife of Porolis transferred her share to five children and did not leave anything

to Sisiliya. Finally, when all died without marriage or issues, the entire property held by Porolis

devolved into Sisiliyana. In 1970 by Deed No.3699 attested by Ranjith Weerasekera (N.P.)

Sisiliyana gifted the land she held and the two houses to Plaintiff.

Page 6 of 7

Plaintiff had said that the 1st Defendant and his son-in-law were the licensees of Sisiliyana. After

the death of Sisiliyana, Plaintiff allowed the 1st Defendant to stay on the premises as his licensee.

In September 1974, he requested the 1st Defendant to leave the premises. Ending his licensee,

Plaintiff had written to the 1st Defendant through a lawyer.

The 3rd Defendant laid out a different pedigree to the land. According to his pedigree, the 1st owner

was Thevarathantirige Kamal Fernando. He had described the devolution of title and claimed

absolute ownership of the property where the 1st and the 2nd Defendants reside. All parties had

agreed that the 1st and 2nd Defendants were residing in the subject matter of the case.

In Perusing issues, the identity of the corpus was questioned. In his second amended Plaint, he

spoke of a 2 Roods land. The 3rd Defendant-Appellant had agreed that the Plaintiff-Respondent

must establish the identity of the corpus. He must have a clear idea from which land he wants the

1st and the 2nd Defendants ejected. One argument by the 3rd Defendants-Appellant is that the

amended Plaint dated 15.07.1980 refers to two schedules. In the 1st schedule, the extent is given

as 1 Rood and 13 perches and is in Plan No.268 of H.O. Scaniwel, Licensed Surveyor. The 2nd

schedule, 18 perches, is part of the land depicted in Plan No.268.

1st and 2nd Defendants filed their Answer denying the position of the Plaintiff but accepting the

pedigree of the 3rd Defendant. They further took up the position that they entered the premises with

the consent of the predecessor to the title of the 3rd Defendant and now continue possession as

tenants of the 3rd Defendant. Issues were entered, and the trial proceeded. On 22.09.2000, the

judgment was pronounced in favour of Plaintiff.

Aggrieved by that judgment, two appeals were lodged before this court. At the inquiry, all parties

agreed to abide by one judgment in both cases as the matter to be determined is similar. Both the

Appellants had argued that Plaintiff had not identified the corpus. In a re-vindicatio action, the

Plaintiff must prove his title against the Defendants. The Defendants need not prove anything as

the burden of proof lies in the hands of the Plaintiff.

Page 7 of 7

Even though the Appellants argued regarding the corpus in this court, a perusal of the issue

accepted for trial dated 11.01.1989 does not have any issue raised on the identity of the corpus.

Issue No.1 was raised by Plaintiff regarding the schedule to amend the Plaint, which the learned

Judge had answered in the affirmative, giving reasons and referring to documents.

The learned District Judge had discussed the pedigree of the Plaintiff, referring to documents

produced at the trial and emphasising the failure of the Defendants to show any lapses in the

pedigree. He had discussed the plan marked as P3 and identified the 3rd schedule, not the Plaint

in P3, which is as way back as 1904, referring to case No.4817/P. At the District Court of

Panadura, the learned Judge had observed that documents produced in that case by the 3d

Defendant do not depict premises No.333, but the documents of the Plaintiff reveal the existents

of the premises in the documents before that case.

However, referring to case No.4817, the learned Judge had pointed out that the 3rd Defendants

documents do not speak of premises No.333 mentioned in the case. The learned District Judge had

pointed out why the Plaintiffs claim was more substantial than the claim of the 3rd Defendant.

The argument regarding the identity of the corpus placed before the court cannot be gone into

because that was not an issue before the District Court. None of the Appellants had raised such an

issue. However, as pointed out above, the District Judge has identified the corpus.

For the reasons discussed above, I see no reason to disturb the judgment dated 27.09.2000 by the

learned District Judge of Panadura entered in case No.14192/L.

The appeal is dismissed; I make no order for costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

PRESANTHA DE SILVA, J. I agree.
