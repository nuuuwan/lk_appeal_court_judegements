Iddawala J

The matter was supported by the counsel for the petitioner on 24.05.2022

and the Court reserved the order for notice.

The petitioner impugns an averment made by the respondent in his written

objections/affidavit in Case No 878/L/2020 instituted in the District

COC-6-22 Page 3 of 3 18/07/2022 IJ-30-22

Court of Kaduwela whereby the petitioner alleges that the respondent has

made numerous false and contemptuous statements alluding to the

petitioner, engineered to misdirect the Court. It is the petitioners

contention that such fabricated statements are continually maintained

before Court and that such fact amounts to ex facie contempt of Court as

envisioned under Article 105(3) of the Constitution. The counsel for the

petitioner submitted that as he is not a party to the said District Court

case, petitioner has no other means of redress but to invoke the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 105(3) of the Constitution.

This Court is of the view that it should have the benefit of the position of

the respondent before taking a decision on whether or not to formally issue

summons on the respondent. In the circumstances, Court directs the

petitioner to issue notice (all papers) directly on the respondent and

submit proof thereof to the Registry within two weeks hereof.

Notice returnable on 09 August 2022. It is to be noted that Court has not

issued formal notice or summons at this stage.
