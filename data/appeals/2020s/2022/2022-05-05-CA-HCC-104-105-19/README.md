The 1st accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo

on 2 counts of trafficking and possessing 5.11 grams of Heroin. The 2nd

accused-appellant was indicted on 2 counts of trafficking the Heroin

and aiding and abetting the 1st accused-appellant to possess Heroin.

After the trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted both appellants

for the charges against them. This appeal has been preferred against

the said convictions and sentences.

3

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st appellant, the learned

Presidents Counsel for the 2nd appellant and the learned State Counsel

for the respondent made oral submissions at the hearing.

The main complaint of the learned Presidents Counsel for both

appellants was that the appellants were denied a fair trial by not

allowing them to call the defence witness that they wanted to call to

substantiate the defence version. The learned State Counsel submitted

that for the reasons stated by the learned High Court Judge in her order

dated 26.09.2018, and for the purpose of preventing unnecessary delay,

the application to call the last witness for the defence was disallowed

and there is nothing wrong in the said order. The learned State Counsel

contended further, anyhow, that it is not a reason to vitiate the

convictions.

It is to be noted first that Section 4(d) of the International Covenant on

Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007 states that a

person charged of a criminal offence under any written law shall be

entitled to examine or to have examined the witnesses against him and

to obtain the attendance of witnesses on his behalf, under the same

conditions as witnesses called against him.

However, the learned High Court Judge has not given the aforesaid right

to the appellants of this case. Now, it is important to see why the said

right was not given by the learned Judge. Reasons are stated in her

judgment. The learned Judge has come to the conclusion that the

evidence relating to the misconduct of PW1 is not required in this case.

If the appellants wanted to question the acts of misconduct of PW1, the

learned Judge was of the view that those questions could have been

asked when the PW1 was cross-examined. Stating these reasons, the

learned Judge refused the application to call the OIC of the Police

Narcotic Bureau as a defence witness.

4

In perusing the aforesaid order, it appears that the learned High Court

Judge has pre-determined what the defence witness would state if he

was called in evidence. By pre-determining so, the learned Judge

decided that his evidence is not necessary. I am of the view that this is

not only a denial of a fair trial but also an observation that should not

be made by the learned Judge in adjudicating the case impartially.

In addition, it is to be noted that not only the learned Judge, but even

the party who calls the witness cannot say what the witness would say

when he is giving evidence. The party who calls the witness can say for

what purpose the witness would be called, but the party cannot say

what evidence the witness would give. Only when the witness testifies,

the court could know what his evidence is.

In addition, the learned Judge could not be presumed whether the acts

of misconduct of PW1 that are to be elicited by that witness would be

relevant to this case. Whether that evidence is irrelevant to the case or

whether the said evidence is useful to adjudicate the case has to be

decided only after the witness gives evidence. Therefore, undoubtedly,

not giving an opportunity for the appellants to call the said witness

denies a fair trial for the appellants.

Delaying the case unnecessarily by attempting to call this witness is not

a reason stated in the said order of the leaned High Court Judge. But

this court has considered whether there was an unnecessary delay as

the learned State Counsel contended.

The prosecution case was closed on 07.01.2016. The next trial date was

09.02.2016. On that day, the 2nd appellant was not present in court

and a medical certificate was produced on 23.03.2016 to prove why she

was not present on 09.02.2016. Thereafter, the further trial was fixed

on 23.03.2016, 21.06.2016, 23.09.2016, 30.11.2016, 17.02.2017,

21.06.2017, 26.09.2017, 09.01.2018, 22.05.2018 but the case was not

5

taken up for further trial on any of these days. The further trial has

been postponed for more than two years due to lack of time and for

some other reasons but defence witnesses were ready on all those trial

dates.

On 04.09.2018, the 1st and the 2nd accused-appellants made dock

statements. On the next trial date, 26.09.2018, a witness was called on

behalf of the defence and the evidence of the said witness was

concluded. On the same day, an application was made to call the last

witness for the defence. It is the application that was rejected. It is

apparent from the aforesaid circumstances that the delay occurred due

to various reasons but not because of the faults of the appellants.

In addition to the Section 4(d) of the ICCPR Act, the Supreme Court of

India, held in the case of Dudh Nath Pandey vs The State Of U.P,

decided on 11th February 1981, reported in 1981 AIR 911, 1981 SCR

(2) 771 that defence witnesses are entitled to equal treatment with

those of the prosecution. And, Courts ought to overcome their

traditional, instinctive disbelief in defence witnesses. Quite often, they

tell lies but so do the prosecution witnesses.

In the instant action, I see no reasonable cause for the learned High

Court Judge to not to grant one more date to call the defence witness,

when the case had been postponed more than two years for various

reasons without the defence case being heard. The convictions entered

without giving a fair opportunity to present the defence case, could not

be allowed to stand, I hold. Therefore, the convictions and the sentences

have to be set aside.

The next issue to be considered is whether this case should be sent for

re-trial or a decision could be made by this court.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st appellant contended that the

learned High Court Judge has acted upon the vague evidence of PW1,

casting the liability on the appellants to prove their version acting upon

Section 114(f) and thus, convicted the appellants on an erroneous legal

basis.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd appellant contended that

there was no basis to charge the 2nd appellant either for trafficking the

Heroin or for aiding and abetting to possess the Heroin. He contended

that there is no evidence of how the 2nd appellant aided and abetted to

possess Heroin. Also, the learned Presidents Counsel contended that

there is no evidence of how the 2nd appellant trafficked the Heroin that

was in the possession of the 1st appellant. Accordingly, he contended

that the convictions against the 2nd appellant have to be quashed.

The learned State Counsel for the respondent contended that the

learned High Court Judge has correctly evaluated the cogent evidence

of PW1 and the unreliable evidence of the defence and has correctly

come to her conclusions.

This is a case where six police officers including PW1 had gone for the

raid upon information received. PW1 and PC 60485 Mataraarachchi

were there at the time of recovering Heroin according to PW1. However,

only the evidence of PW1 has been led in this case. Although there was

no difficulty in calling PC Mataraarachchi in evidence, he was not called

as a witness. The contention of the learned State Counsel was that

PW1s evidence is sufficient to prove the case beyond a reasonable

doubt.

Apart from the dock statements of the appellants, the daughter of the

2nd appellant was called to give evidence on behalf of the defence. It

appears that the learned trial Judge did not draw her attention to

Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance, when the prosecution did not

7

call PC Mataraarachchi in evidence to corroborate the evidence of PW1.

However, it is strange to see that the learned trial Judge has applied

Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance to defence case and stated in

her judgment that none of the adults were called to corroborate the

evidence of the 2nd appellants daughter.

Whatever evidence has been given on behalf of the defence, if the

evidence of the sole witness of the prosecution could not be believed

beyond a reasonable doubt, the appellants could not be convicted. It is

also strange to see that the learned Judge who did not allow to call the

defence witness who was intended to be called to challenge the sole

prosecution witnesss evidence, was of the view that witnesses should

have been called to corroborate defence witnesss evidence. In the

circumstances, the standard of proof adopted by the learned trial Judge

is in serious question.

In the case of the Attorney General V. Devunderage Nihal S.C. Appeal:

154/10, decided on 12th May 2011 it was held that there is no

requirement in law that the evidence of a police officer who conducted

an investigation or raid resulting in the arrest of an offender need to be

corroborated in material particulars. It was held further that if such

a proposition were to be accepted, it would impose an added burden on

the prosecution to call more than one witness on the back of the

indictment to prove its case in a drug-related offence, however

satisfactory the evidence of the main police witness would be.

The crux of the above observation is that when the sole witnesss

evidence is very satisfactory, there is no need for corroboration. Hence,

it has to be considered whether PW1s evidence is very satisfactory.

However, even if PW1s evidence is very satisfactory, there is no

necessity to corroborate defence evidence because the appellants have

no burden to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt or even on the

balance of probabilities. Creating a reasonable doubt on the

8

prosecution case by the dock statements and the evidence of the

defence witness is sufficient to get an acquittal.

Now, I proceed to consider whether PW1s evidence is cogent to prove

the charges beyond a reasonable doubt without corroborative evidence.

According to the PW1, he received the information. The information

received is vital to consider whether the raid described by him was

carried out according to the way that he testified. PW1 has stated in

cross-examination that a person called Kumara is coming with Heroin

on a motorcycle to hand over the Heroin to some other person. The said

question and the answer appear as follows:

: ?

: WPVP 0407

, .

(Page 115 of the appeal brief)

However, after a short while when he was asked whether the informant

had told him that Soniya Anne Francis is coming with another person,

he answered, he was told that she is coming with another person;

coming with the person called Kumara. The relevant questions and

answers appear as follows:

:

?

: ,

.

(Page 115 and 116 of the appeal brief)

When he described the information received, he clearly stated that only

Kumara is coming to hand over Heroin to some other person. But after

a short while, PW1 says that Kumara is coming with Soniya. Earlier,

only Kumara is coming. Subsequently, Kumara is coming with Soniya.

Another question arises from the latter contradictory answer, if a

woman was also coming with Kumara, why PW1 did not take a woman

9

police officer for the raid. Probably because of the difficulty in dealing

with that question, PW1 changed his position again and stated that the

informant did not tell him that a woman and another person is coming.

The said question and answer appear on page 118 of the appeal brief

as follow:

:

?

: .

Although the learned State Counsel attempted to show it as a mistake,

when the question was put to him with the name of the woman

Soniya, mistakenly he would not say that he was informed that

Kumara is coming with Soniya. Certainly, it is not a mistake. The

doubt creates by these contradictions goes to the root of the case

because the 2nd appellant stated in her dock statement that she was

arrested when she was at home. Her daughter corroborates this

position. When considering the 2nd appellants version with the

aforesaid contradiction, an inference could be drawn that there could

be a truth in the 2nd appellants version. If it is so, a reasonable doubt

creates on the raid described by PW1.

It is to be noted at this stage that the police witnesses have the

advantage of giving evidence by going through their notes. Therefore,

even two police witnesses were called to give evidence regarding the

raid, it is very difficult to mark contradictions. In the instant action,

there is no way of marking any contradiction because only PW1 has

given evidence regarding the raid. The learned trial Judge observed and

made a remark under Section 273(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act that PW1 testifies word to word, the same thing that was in his

notes. The learned Judges observation appears as follows:

.

(Page 87 and 88 of the appeal brief)

10

Even under those circumstances, there are the above contradictions

that affect the credibility of the evidence of PW1. A case does not fail

merely because there are some infirmities and inconsistencies. If the

other police officer who went for the raid was called in evidence, the

court could have examined whether this is a true story and whether the

infirmities or inconsistencies affect the credibility of the prosecution

case. Since the prosecution has decided that the case could be proved

beyond a reasonable doubt with the evidence of one witness, that

opportunity has been lost. The above contradictions go to the root of

the case because the raid has been organized on the said questionable

information received. The aforesaid major contradictions regarding the

information affect the truthfulness of the prosecution story. In the

circumstances, the PW1s evidence could not be considered as cogent

evidence. Therefore, I am of the view that the learned High Court

Judges finding that the evidence of PW1 is cogent is not correct.

There is another issue regarding the probability of the prosecution case.

According to the PW1, the police team went in a vehicle. However, the

vehicle was stopped somewhere and PW1 and PC Mataraarachchi have

reached the appellants without a vehicle. They came in a three-wheeler

to the place where the detection was done and the three-wheeler was

sent off. Two appellants came on a motorcycle. They stopped the

motorcycle but did not get off the motorcycle. At that time, PW1 has

disclosed their identity. At that moment, PW1 says that the 2nd

appellant told the 1st appellant . (Page

88 of the appeal brief) When both appellants were in the motorcycle and

the police officers had no vehicle, they could have easily run away in

the motorcycle without trying to throw the parcel. So, the prosecution

story about the most important moment of the raid casts a doubt on

the probability of the prosecution story.

In addition, no acceptable reason has been stated in the impugned

judgment, why the dock statements of the appellant and the defence

11

evidence have been rejected. Deciding that PW1s evidence is sufficient

to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt and expecting the

defence to call some other witnesses to corroborate defence witnesss

evidence are not in accordance with the fundamental principles of

criminal law according to my view.

It also appears that the learned Judge has not even evaluated the

defence evidence impartially. Analyzing the evidence of 2nd appellants

daughter, the learned judge stated that she has not stated that the

police officers assaulted her mother (page 37 of the judgment). However,

she has clearly stated in her evidence in chief that her mother was

assaulted and she heard her mother shouting. The said answer of the

defence witness appears on page 195 of the appeal brief as follows:

. , ,

. I state with regret that this kind of wrong observations have

been used to reject the defence version.

At this juncture, it is pertinent to note that in the case of James Silva

V. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 Sri L.R. 167 it was held that it

is a grave error for a trial judge to direct himself that he must examine

the tenability and truthfulness of the evidence of the accused in the

light of the evidence led by the prosecution. To examine the evidence of

the accused in the light of the prosecution witnesses is to reverse the

presumption of innocence.

In summarizing, uncorroborated evidence of PW1 is not cogent. There

is a doubt regarding the probability of the prosecution story. There are

no justifiable reasons to reject defence evidence and act upon the

evidence of the sole prosecution witness regarding the raid. In the

circumstances, the conclusion that could be arrived is that the charges

have not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Hence, there is no

necessity to direct a re-trial. For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that the

12

charges against the appellants have not been proved beyond a

reasonable doubt.

Accordingly, the convictions and the sentences imposed on the 1st and

the 2nd appellants are set aside. Both appellants are acquitted of the

charges against them.

Appeal allowed.
