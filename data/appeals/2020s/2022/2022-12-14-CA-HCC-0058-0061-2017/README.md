Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

The five accused persons were indicted before the High Court of Kandy for

committing the following offences.

1. For being members of an unlawful assembly with the intention of

causing injuries to one Gunathilaka Banda on the 30th of June 1995,

and thereby committing the offence of unlawful assembly punishable

in terms of Section 140 of the Penal Code.

2. At the same time and at the same transaction, with the common object

of causing the death of the earlier mentioned Gunathilaka Banda,

caused grievous injuries to him by attacking him with a sharp cutting

instrument, and thereby committed the offence of attempted murder,

an offence punishable in terms of Section 300 read with Section 146 of

the Penal Code.

3. At the same time and at the same transaction, causing the death of

Ekanayake Mudisanselage Walawwe Gunaratne Banda in furtherance

of the common object of the mentioned unlawful assembly, and thereby

committing the offence of murder, punishable in terms of Section 296

read with Section 146 of the Penal Code.

4. At the same time and at the same transaction, causing the death of the

earlier mentioned Gunaratne Banda, and thereby committing the

Page 4 of 15

offence of murder punishable in terms of Section 296 read with Section

32 of the Penal Code.

5. At the same time and at the same transaction, causing injuries to

earlier mentioned Gunaratne Banda, using a sharp cutting instrument,

and thereby committing the offence of attempted murder, punishable

in terms of Section 300 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

As the 2nd accused indicted, namely, Hawamadagedara Premaratne alias Kudde

was dead at the time this matter was taken up for hearing before the High Court

of Kandy, the indictment had been amended accordingly.

The trial against the four accused appellants had been without a jury, and at the

conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge of Kandy found the accused

appellants guilty for the 1st, 2nd and the 3rd counts preferred against them. That

is to say, they were found guilty for the offences of unlawful assembly, attempted

murder and the murder, while being members of the said unlawful assembly.

The learned High Court Judge had not made any order in relation to the 4th and

the 5th counts preferred against them, apparently since he has found the

appellants guilty on the three counts based on unlawful assembly.

Accordingly, the accused appellants were sentenced in the following manner.

On count 1, they were sentenced to 6 months rigorous imprisonment.

On count 2, they were sentenced to 10 years each rigorous imprisonment. In

addition, they were ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 20,000/- each and in default, two

years each rigorous imprisonment.

On count 3, they were sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the accused appellants,

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the appellants) preferred this appeal.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the 1st, 3rd and the 4th

appellants who was the 1st, 3rd and the 4th accused at the trial, formulated the

following grounds of appeal for the consideration of this Court.

1. The learned High Court Judge erred in law when he failed to properly

analyze the evidence placed before the Court.

2. The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the dock statement of

the appellants in its correct perspective.

3. The learned High Court Judge has not considered the possibility of a

sudden fight between the parties in his judgement.

The learned Counsel for the accused appellant Rathnayakage Siripala, who was

the 5th accused at the trial formulated the following grounds of appeal.

4. The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself with regard to the

dock statement of the appellant.

5. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the 1st witness

had deviated from the statement given by him to the police at the trial.

6. There was evidence of a sudden fight.

7. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the

prosecution has not been able to properly establish the identities of the

appellants through the witnesses.

8. The learned High Court Judge has overlooked the contradictions

marked at the trial, especially the contradiction marked as V-03.

Facts In Brief

The injured Gunathilake Banda was the son of the deceased Gunaratne. The

deceased, while being a farmer, also had a boutique in the village called

Waragolla in the Hasalaka area. The appellants, including the 2nd accused who

is now deceased are also fellow villagers well-known to each other.

Page 6 of 15

According to the evidence of Gunathilake Banda, (PW-01) on the day of the

incident, that was on 30th June 1995, he and another relative of him, namely

Athula Bandara (PW-06) was returning towards their boutique after giving tea to

Athula Bandaras mother Biso Manike, (PW-02) who was working in the field. It

was around 1.45 p.m. at that time.

According to his evidence, suddenly the appellants, including the now deceased

Premaratne (2nd accused in the indictment) have surrounded him having various

weapons in their hands and has started assaulting him. It was the 1st accused

appellant who has started assaulting him towards his ear, and threatened him

with a razor knife. He has stated that thereafter, the 1st accused cut him using

the razor knife. While this was happening, his father Gunaratne Banda has come

out of his boutique and has intervened at the place where he was being assaulted

questioning as to why. At that instant, the 5th accused appellant has stabbed

Gunaratne towards his neck. PW-01 has managed to bring his father in front of

their boutique and while they were there, the appellants have again pursued

them. The 5th accused appellant has stabbed the deceased Gunaratne several

times and the 3rd accused appellant also had cut him using a manna knife and

the 4th accused appellant who had a club and a rock in his hand had also

assaulted the deceased.

Explaining the reasons for the attack, the PW-01 has stated that on the previous

day, the 1st accused appellant came to their boutique and wanted to buy

cigarettes. When he informed that cigarettes are not available, he has gone away

after threatening the PW-01. On the same day around 6.00 - 6.30 p.m. while the

brothers of PW-01 and a relative was consuming liquor in front of their boutique,

the 1st three accused indicted, and some others have come and assaulted those

who were present. As a result, the brothers of PW-01 and a relative had sustained

injuries. He has also spoken about a previous enmity because of an alleged illicit

relationship his mother supposed to have had with the 1st accused appellant.

Page 7 of 15

It has transpired during the cross-examination that PW-01 has made two

statements to the police. In the 1st statement, he has stated that while he was

being assaulted, his father came armed with a sword and hit the 5th accused

which hit in his back area. As the witness has denied having said such a thing

to the police, that contradiction has been marked as V-03 at the trial.

PW-02 Biso Manike has confirmed that PW-01 and her son Athula Bandara came

to the field where she was working at around 1.30 to provide tea for her and left.

After hearing a commotion in the direction of PW-01s house, Biso Manike has

gone to inquire. On her way, she has met the four accused appellants and the

now deceased, 2nd accused who are well-known to her. It was her evidence that

she saw the 1st accused appellant carrying a razor knife and Premaratne (2nd

accused indicted) carrying a club in his hand, the 5th accused appellant was

carrying a pointed sharp knife. When she met them, the 5th accused appellant

has sworn at her stating that protect your son ( ).

Subsequently, she has seen Gunaratne fallen on the road and PW-01 being

injured.

PW-06 Athula Bandara was the son of PW-02 Biso Manike, and the person who

was accompanying PW-02 when this incident happened. He has corroborated

the evidence of PW-01 as to how this incident occurred and the way PW-01 and

the deceased received their injuries. He has been the person who has gone and

informed the deceased that Gunathilaka Banda was being assaulted and

returned with the deceased to the place where he was being assaulted. He has

given specific evidence as to the fact that it was the 5th accused who stabbed the

deceased.

The police officers who conducted investigations as to the incident has also given

evidence in this matter and it has been transpired that the 5th accused has been

arrested about a week after the incident.

Page 8 of 15

The District Medical Officer of Hasalaka hospital who has conducted the

postmortem of the deceased and also the doctor who has issued the Medico-

Legal Report in relation to the injuries sustained by PW-01 has confirmed that

the deceased had eight injuries in all. He has described the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and

6th injuries as stab wounds and 5th and the 7th injuries named in his report as

contusions while the 8th injury has been a linear abrasion. His evidence shows

that the stab wounds have penetrated his internal organs, including the heart

cavity which has resulted in internal hemorrhage. He has expressed the opinion

that the cause of death was internal hemorrhage into the pleural cavity due to

the injuries caused to the right lung.

Giving evidence as to the injuries suffered by PW-01, he has observed 6 injuries

in total, 1st, 2nd and 3rd being injuries caused using a sharp cutting weapon. The

1st and the 2nd cut injury has been to the face of the injured. The doctor has

categorized these two injuries under Section 311 (f) of the Penal Code, which is

permanent disfiguration of the head or face.

The Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal

The 1st ground of appeal formulated by the learned Counsel for the appellants

has been a ground in general terms on the basis that the learned High Court

Judge erred in law in his analysis of the evidence placed before the Court. As the

other seven grounds of appeal urged by the learned Counsel are grounds based

on the premise that the evidence before the Court was not considered in its

correct perspective, I will now proceed to consider all the grounds of appeal

together.

The learned Counsel for the 5th accused appellant has raised a ground of appeal

on the basis that the identities of the appellants have not been established

through the prosecution witnesses. I find no merit at all for such a ground of

appeal. The evidence held before the Court clearly establishes that the appellants

as well as the now deceased 2nd accused indicted are well-known to all the

Page 9 of 15

prosecution witnesses as they were fellow villagers. All the witnesses have given

evidence clearly identifying the appellants and the part played by them in the

incident.

The appellants have been convicted on the basis of being members of an unlawful

assembly. The submissions of the learned Counsel for the 1st, 3rd and 4th accused

appellants was that since the evidence suggests that the 5th accused had come

to the scene of the incident later, there was no evidence to establish that five

persons participated in the incident, and therefore no basis for a conviction in

terms of an unlawful assembly.

It was also his submission that since the prosecution has failed to prove that

there was a common intention amongst the appellants, a conviction in terms of

Section 32 of the Penal Code has also not been proved.

In this matter, there is clear evidence to show that when PW-01 was walking

towards the boutique owned by his father, 1st, 3rd and 4th appellants and the

deceased 2nd accused has surrounded and assaulted him. There is clear evidence

that while this assault is taking place, the 5th accused has arrived at the scene

and he also has taken part in the assault. According to the witnesses, it was the

5th accused who has stabbed the deceased initially when he arrived at the scene

of the assault. Evidence also establishes that after the deceased was taken near

the boutique he owned by his son Gunathilake Banda, all the assailants have

come again and attacked the deceased. The most of the injuries have been stab

wounds and the evidence clearly suggests that it was the 5th accused appellant

who caused stab injuries to the deceased. This clearly establishes that the 5th

accused appellant had been a willing participant of the crime.

The offence of unlawful assembly has been described in Section 138 of the Penal

Code in the following manner.

Page 10 of 15

138. An assembly of five or more persons is designated an unlawful

assembly if the common object of the persons composing that

assembly is

Firstly - To overawe by criminal force, or show of criminal force,

Her Majestys Government in Ceylon or the Senate or the House

of Representatives or any public servant in the exercise of the

lawful power of such public servant; or

Secondly To resist the execution of any law or of any legal

process; or

Thirdly To commit any mischief or criminal trespass or other

offence; or

Fourthly By means of criminal force, or show of criminal force,

to any person, to take or obtain possession of any property, or

to deprive any person or the public of the enjoyment of a right

of way or of the use of water or other incorporeal right of which

such persons or public is in possession or enjoyment, or to

enforce any right or supposed right; or

Fifthly - By means of criminal force, or show of criminal force,

to compel any person to do what he is not legally bound to do,

or to omit to do what he is legally entitled to do; or

Sixthly That the persons assembled, or any of them, may train

or drill themselves, or be trained or drilled to the use of arms,

or practicing military movements or evolutions, without the

consent of the Governor-General of Ceylon

Explanation An assembly which was not unlawful when it

assembled may subsequently become an unlawful assembly.

Page 11 of 15

In relation to the facts of this case, I find that the provisions of Section 139 of

the Penal Code should also worth mentioning. Section 139 refers to the effect of

a person being a member of an unlawful assembly, which reads thus;

139. Whoever, being aware of facts which render any assembly an

unlawful assembly, intentionally joins that assembly, or continues in

it, is said to be a member of an unlawful assembly.

This aspect was considered in the case of Kulathunga Vs. Mudalihamy 42 NLR

331, which held that the prosecution must prove that there was an unlawful

assembly with a common object as stated in the charge. So far as each individual

is concerned, it has to prove that he was a member of the assembly which he

intentionally joined and that he knew the common object of the assembly.

If it is proved that a person was a member of an unlawful assembly with a

common object, his action or omissions imputes vicarious liability on other

members of that assembly as provided for in Section 146 of the Penal Code which

reads:

146. If an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful

assembly in persecution of the common object of that assembly, or

such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be

committed in persecution of that object, every person who, at the

time of the committing of that offence, is a member of the same

assembly is guilty of that offence.

It is therefore, necessary for the prosecution to prove whether;

(a) That the offence was committed in the persecution of the common

objective of the unlawful assembly, or

Page 12 of 15

(b) That the members of the unlawful assembly knew that the offence was

likely to be committed in the persecution of the common object. (Vide

Andrayes Vs. Queen 67 NLR 425)

Dr. Gour in Penal Law of India discusses the law in relation to unlawful

assembly in following terms (Volume II, 11th Edition at page 1296);

All persons who convene or take part in the proceedings of an unlawful

assembly are guilty of the offence of taking part in an unlawful assembly.

Persons present by accident or from curiosity alone without taking any part

in the proceedings are not guilty of the offence, even though those persons

possess the power of stopping the assembly and fail to exercise it. Mere

presence in an assembly does not make such a person a member of an

unlawful assembly unless it is shown that he has done something or omitted

to do something which would make him a member of an unlawful assembly

or unless the case fails.

In this regard, it is also necessary to understand the difference between the

common object as mentioned in Section 146 of the Penal Code and the common

intention as mentioned in Section 32 of the Penal Code.

In the case of The Queen Vs. N. K. A. Appuhamy 62 NLR 484 it was held,

1. That a common object in an unlawful assembly is different from a

common intention, in that it does not require prior concert and a common

meeting of minds before the offence is committed. If each member of the

assembly has the same object, then their object would be common, and

if there were five or more with this object, then they would form an

unlawful assembly without any prior concert among themselves.

2. That a person can become a member of an unlawful assembly not only

by doing of a criminal act but also by lending the weight of his presence

Page 13 of 15

and associating with a group of persons who are acting in a criminal

fashion.

3. That the common objects of an unlawful assembly may come in

succession and need not necessarily exist together at the beginning.

It is abundantly clear from the evidence adduced in this matter, that although

the 5th accused appellant may have joined the other four persons in assaulting

the PW-01 at a later stage, he too had the common object in assaulting the PW-

01 as his subsequent actions suggest. The evidence shows that it was he who

has stabbed the deceased when the deceased came to rescue his son. It is my

considered view that the prosecution has led sufficient evidence beyond

reasonable doubt that all five persons mentioned in the indictment have acted

with a common object and had caused injuries to PW-01 and the deceased in

furtherance of the common object.

In the judgement, the learned High Court Judge has considered the contended

contradiction marked as V-3 to find whether it has created a doubt as to the

evidence of PW-01. In his first statement made to the police, PW-01 has stated

that when he was assaulted, his father came out of his boutique with a sword in

his hand and the 5th accused was hit when the deceased used the sword.

However, in his evidence in chief, he has denied that his father came out of the

boutique with a sword.

The evidence led before the trial Court has established that on the previous day

morning, the 1st accused appellant has come to the boutique and there has been

an argument over the selling of cigarettes. As a result, in the evening, the 1st and

the 3rd accused appellants and the deceased 2nd accused along with some others

have come to the boutique and assaulted the family members of PW-01. It clearly

appears that the incident where PW-01 has received injuries and the death of

the deceased has occurred was a continuation of the earlier attack.

As considered correctly by the learned High Court Judge, the actions of the

appellants cannot be attributed to a sudden fight under any circumstances. The

Page 14 of 15

learned High Court Judge has correctly considered the words that have been

uttered by the appellants and their actions to come to a firm finding that there

was no basis to conclude the offence committed by the appellants amounts to

culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

I do not find any basis to conclude that the learned High Court Judge has failed

to consider the dock statements made by the appellants either. In the judgement,

the learned High Court Judge has clearly considered the dock statements and

determined that the statements do not create a doubt in the prosecution case.

The learned High Court Judge has considered the injuries inflicted on the

deceased and has considered the evidence placed before the Court in order to

come to a finding that the appellants have acted with the common objective of

causing the death of the deceased, for which I have no basis to disagree.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the appeals by the

appellants challenging the 1st and the 3rd count preferred against them for which

they were convicted.

However, the same cannot be said about the conviction of the accused appellants

on the 2nd count preferred against them. The 2nd count is related to causing

injuries to PW-01 Gunathilake Banda using a sharp cutting instrument and

thereby committing the offence of attempted murder, punishable in terms of

Section 300 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code.

The evidence in that regard shows that when PW-01 was assaulted initially, the

assault had been physical, where no weapons had been used. According to the

evidence of PW-01, the 1st accused has threatened him, pointing a razor knife

towards his face and later had caused cut injuries by using the same. The cut

injuries had been to the face of PW-01 and the doctor who examined the PW-01

has categorized his injuries in terms of Section 311 (f) of the Penal Code, which

is causing a permanent disfiguration on the face.

There was no evidence placed before the Court that the appellants acted with the

intention of causing the death of PW-01 in terms of Section 300 of the Penal

Page 15 of 15

Code. What has been proved before the Court was that the appellants being

members of an unlawful assembly, caused grievous injuries by using sharp

cutting instruments, which is an offence punishable in terms of Section 317 of

the Penal Code.

Therefore, acting in terms of Section 178 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act No.15 of 1979, I set aside the conviction for attempted murder of the

appellants and convict them for committing an offence in terms of Section 317

of the Penal Code.

Accordingly, I set aside the sentence imposed on them in that regard, and

sentence them for 5 years rigorous imprisonment and to a fine of Rs. 20,000/-

each. I direct that in default of paying the fine, they should serve a rigorous

imprisonment period of one year each.

The appeals are dismissed with the above variance to the conviction and the

sentence on count two preferred against them as mentioned above.
