    "text": "The Petitioners have submitted another Lease Agreement bearing No. 6309 (P16) renewing the validity period of the Lease Agreement until the 31.10.2022, a Grama Niladari Certificate and a letter before the Appeals and Objections Board in addition to the document submitted before the interview panel. As per the Clause 10.3 of the said Guidelines P9, only the documents submitted by an Applicant before the interview panel should be considered by the Appeals and Objections Board and no fresh material should be taken into consideration. Hence, subsequent submission of a new Lease Agreement or any other documents cannot be considered as material in proof of any requirement under P9. In the case of J.M.H. Chandani Jayasundara & Others Vs. Ms. S.S.K. Aviruppola & Others (SC/FR/Application No 58/2018 decided on 25.03.2019) in similar circumstances the Supreme Court upheld a decision of the Appeal Board to refused to entertain fresh document submitted in appeal since the circular prohibits to do so.",
