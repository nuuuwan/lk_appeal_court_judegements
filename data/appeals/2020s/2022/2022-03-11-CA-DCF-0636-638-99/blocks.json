Upon the death of Jayawardhena Bandara his rights had devolved on his son Lenard Kiriella who sold those rights to the 3rd Defendant W. Dissanayake. One Wijehamy who had owned an undivided 1/20th share had died leaving his daughter Ran Ethana as his only heir and the said Ran Ethana had sold all rights to Charles Dissanayake who in turn had transferred same to the 3rd Defendant. Therefore, the 3A Defendant is claiming for an undivided 1/10 + 1/20 share.",

It is the case of the 14th Defendant Appellant that the learned District Judge has failed to analyze the prescriptive rights of the 14th defendant and the learned District Judge has failed to take into consideration the paper title of the 14th Defendant. The 14th Defendant has not come forward to give evidence to prove his pedigree. The three deeds marked 14 1, 14 2 and 14 3 had been marked through the plaintiff in cross examination when the plaintiff had no knowledge of those deeds. Although the 2A Defendant had admitted that the 14th Defendant had purchased an undivided right in the corpus on the deed marked 14 1 none of the defendants including the 2A Defendant had any knowledge about the pedigree disclosed by the 14th Defendant. Therefore, the learned District Judge was justified in coming to the conclusion that the 14th Defendant Appellant has failed to prove the devolution of title disclosed by him. He was also justified in coming to the conclusion that the 14th Defendant Appellant had failed to prove a prescriptive right to the corpus. The learned District Judge has correctly observed that the 14th Defendant has failed to prove that the 14th Defendant and his predecessors had been in possession of this land for a period exceeding 10 years prior to the institution of this action. There is no evidence to show that the predecessors in title in the 14th Defendants pedigree had possessed this land. The 14th Defendant and his father the 5th Defendant had not come forward to give evidence to establish that they were in possession for a period exceeding 10 years prior to the institution of this action. The 4th Defendant giving evidence in 1995 had stated that the 14th Defendant was in possession for 25 years which means that he was in possession since 1970. The 2A Defendant had also stated in 1996 that the 14th Defendant had been residing in the corpus for 25 years which means that the 14th Defendant was residing in the corpus since 1971. Thereafter the 2A defendant had stated the 14th Defendants father, the 5th Defendant had come into occupation 28 years ago. He had stated so in 1996.",

    "text": "Now I will consider the appeal of the 3A Defendant-Appellant. The learned District Judge has come to the conclusion that the 3A Defendant has failed to prove the devolution of title disclosed by him. The 3A Defendant-Appellant in his appeal states that the learned District Judge has failed to take into consideration the deeds marked 31 to 36 and analyze the evidentiary value of those documents and the learned District Judge has erred in law when he unallotted the undivided rights that should devolve on the 3rd Defendant on the deed marked 33 when there was no dispute regarding same. According to the pedigree disclosed by the 3rd Defendant one Anadahamy and Nilhamy had owned a a share in the corpus. Out of that share those two original owners had transferred a 1/10th share to Mohottihamy on the deed marked 31. The learned District Judge has not accepted the fact that those two original owners owned a a share in the corpus, but he has accepted the fact that Anadahamy and Nilhamy had transferred a 1/10th share which they had inherited by paternal inheritance to Mohottihamy on 31. Mohottihamy had transferred those rights to Jayasinghe Bandara on 32. According to the pedigree of the 3rd Defendant, Jayasinghe Bandara has transferred his rights to his three children Jayawardhena Bandara, Richard Bandara and Wijesinghe Bandara on 33. Those rights had devolved on Lenard Kiriella who had transferred same to the 3rd Defendant William Dissanayake on 34. However, the 3A Defendant had failed to produce the original or a certified copy of the deed marked 33. He has only tendered a photocopy of that deed. Therefore, the learned District Judge was justified in unallotting that 1/10th share that would devolve on the 3rd Defendant on that chain of devolution. The learned District Judge has a duty to investigate into the devolution of title of parties in a partition case. Just because there had been no dispute regarding this chain of devolution and no one had challenged this particular deed the learned District Judge cannot deviate from his paramount duty to accept a photocopy of a deed as evidence. As the learned District Judge has left this share unallotted it is always open to the 3A Defendant to produce",

I am of the view that the learned District Judge had made a deep study into all the pedigrees disclosed by the parties in this case and carefully taken into consideration all the deeds produced by the parties and also the oral testimony of the witnesses regarding the devolution of title. Therefore, I see no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned District Judge. Therefore, I affirm the Judgement of the learned District Judge dated 1999.07.23 and dismiss the appeals of the 2A Defendant-Appellant, 3A Defendant-Appellant and 14th Defendant-Appellant. Each Appellant shall pay a sum of Rs. 10,500/- to the Plaintiff-Respondent as the costs of these appeals.",
