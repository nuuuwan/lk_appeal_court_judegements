This of course is well within the time limit and I would go to the extent to state that the Board has been very conscious of early disposal of the appeal. The Board cannot be faulted for getting the appeal fixed for hearing as stated above, since it is the duty and function of the Secretary of the Board to fix a date and time for hearing and to notify the parties. If it was the intention of the legislature that hearing should be concluded within 2 years from the date of filing the petition or that the time period of 2 years begins to run from the date of filing the petition, there could not have been a difficult to make express provision, in that regard. I do agree with the view of the State Counsel. Hearing no doubt commences from the date of oral hearing. I would as such answer this question in favour of the Respondent and endorse the view of the Board of Review. It is not time barred as the Board arrived at the determination within 2 years.

The oral hearing in the present case commenced on 22.03.2012 and the determination was made by the TAC on 14.12.2012 and therefore, the determination of the appeal by the TAC is not time barred in terms of section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 as amended by the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 04 of 2012.",

Generally, in case of a mandatory provision, the act done in breach thereof is void, whereas, in case of a directory provision, the act does not become void, although some other consequences may follow (P.M. Bakshi, Interpretation of Statutes, First Ed, 2008422). But, the use of the word shall does not always mean that the provision is obligatory or mandatory, as it depends upon the context in which the word shall occurs and the other circumstances (Vide-Indian Supreme Court case of The Collector of Monghyr v.

Therefore, it became necessary to amend the law to make the three members appointed to function as a legally and properly constituted body having the jurisdiction to hear tax appeals. Accordingly, the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012 was passed, making certain amendments to the TAC Act, No. 23 of 2011. Therefore, the properly constituted Tax Appeals Commission came into being and thereafter commenced its sittings for the first time on 08.03.2012.",

The rule that the real intention is to be preferred to the ordinary meaning of words where such intention is clear is the first rule of interpretation laid down by Pothier. Where the intention is clear neither grammar nor punctuation will prevail against it, for the language of Blackstone, neither false English nor bad Latin will destroy a deed. Thus, the courts will not attach overmuch importance to the use in a document of such words as agent mortgage or pledge guarantee,kaikili or stridanum or koratuwa, but will examine the transaction in order to determine its true nature. The real intention of the parties has similarly prevailed where the property sold was erroneously described, but its identity was clear, and where a transaction was described by the parties as an exchange but was in reality two sales.

Even if one transposes the words and communicate to such persons in writing the reasons for not accepting the return to the first line of the section after the word return and before the word estimate it will not make it a condition precedent. One has still to read more words into it to have the effect of postponing the rest of the exercise to sometime later. This would be doing violence to the section. The section imposes a duty, but does not impose a time limit within which it should be done. To my mind the section merely states that if the Assessor does not accept a return, he may assess on an estimate. His exercise is not complete till he has also communicated his reasons for not accepting the return. In effect he also justifies his act of assessing on an estimate. The plain meaning of the section is clear. (Emphasis added)",

It was intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly unfair assessments which many Assessors had been making as a protective measure. An unfortunate practice had developed where some Assessors, due to pressure of work and other reasons, tended to delay looking at a return till the last moment and then without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a grossly exaggerated assessment. The law, I think, enabled the department to make recoveries pending any appeal on such assessments. The overall effect of this unhappy practice was to pressurize the taxpayer to such an extent that he was placed virtually at the mercy of the tax authorities. The new law was a measure intended to do away with this practice. Under the amendment when an Assessor does not accept a",

I am not inclined to agree with this interpretation of the Appellant. The words where the Assessor does not accept a return furnished by any person under section 21 .......and makes an assessment or an additional assessment under section 28 or under section 31, the Assessor shall communicate to such person. why he is not accepting the return clearly indicate that the assessment or additional assessment should precede the letter of intimation provided in section 29.

The words used are \"omission or failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year.\" It postulates a duty on every assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment. What facts are material, and necessary for assessment will differ from case to case. In every assessment proceeding, the assessing authority will, for the purpose of computing or determining the proper tax due from an assesses, require to know all the facts which help him in coming to the correct conclusion.
