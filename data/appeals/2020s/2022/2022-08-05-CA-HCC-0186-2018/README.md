JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Anuradhapura on the following charge namely, committing the offence of

rape on Senaviratnage Srimani Senaviratna on or before the 04th November

2011, within the jurisdiction of the court which is an offence punishable

under Section 364(1) of the Penal Code.

After a non-jury trial, the Appellant was convicted as charged and was

sentenced to ten years RI and a fine of Rs.1000/-. In default 03 months

simple imprisonment was imposed. Further, a sum of Rs.50,000/-

compensation was ordered with a default term of 3 months simple

imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

3 | P a g e

pandemic restrictions in place. Also, at the time of argument the Appellant

was connected via zoom platform from prison.

The Counsel for the Appellant advanced the following grounds of appeal:

1. The prosecution has failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that

sexual intercourse took place without the consent of the prosecutrix.

2. The learned trial Judge has grievously erred in law by shifting the

burden of proof to the Appellant thereby reversing the presumption of

innocence and occasioned in a deprivation of a fair trial.

In this case the prosecutrix had been married for three and half months but

had ceased living together with her spouse. At the time of the incident, she

was living with her mother and her elder brother. On the day of the incident,

she was alone at home as her mother and the brother had left to engage in

Chena cultivation. Around noon, when the prosecutrix was collecting her

clothes to go for a bath at Mannakettiya Tank, she had heard the sound of a

motor-bike outside her house. Before she could come out of her room to

check who it was, the Appellant who was well known to her was standing at

the entrance to the room in which the prosecutrix was standing. Although

the prosecutrix had testified that she knew the Appellant very well and he

had visited her home on previous occasions she had denied having any

relationship with him. The Appellant had first adjusted the curtains of the

windows in the room and invited her to have sex with him. The victim had

refused the request and had attempted to exit the room. Then the Appellant

had forcibly covered her mouth with one of her sisters dresses, thrust her

on the bed, removed her under garment, raised her dress up to her chest

level and committed the act of rape on the prosecutrix.

PW2 who was living in the neighbouring house had rushed to the room upon

hearing the cries of the prosecutrix and had seen the Appellant lying on top

of the prosecutrix and had observed that the prosecutrix was without her

4 | P a g e

undergarment. Also, she had observed that the trouser of the Appellant had

been dropped down. After seeing PW2, the Appellant had tried to flee the

scene but PW2 had been able to prevent him by wrenching away his motor

bike keys and keeping it in her custody till the arrival of her father and her

sister-in-law. Then her sister-in-law had made a phone call to the Appellants

mother and handed over the keys of the bike to the appellant only in front of

his mother.

The complaint was lodged on the following day after the arrival of the

prosecutrixs mother and the brother.

After the closer of the prosecution case, the defence was called and the

Appellant made a dock statement denying the incident but admitted that he

used to visit the prosecutrix whenever he came home on holidays and that

due to this he had developed an affair with the prosecutrix.

In the 1st ground of appeal advanced the Appellant contented that the

prosecution has failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that sexual

intercourse took place without the consent of the prosecutrix.

Professor G. L. Peiris in his book Offences under the Penal Code of Sri

Lanka at page 222 states:

It is a fundamental principle that, where the womans consent is an

issue, a conviction of rape will be upheld only in circumstances where

the prosecution has succeeded in establishing absence of consent

beyond a reasonable doubt. If proof of this element is lacking, the cause

of the prosecution is necessarily incomplete. Consequently, no burden

devolves on the defence in these circumstances. Any departure from

this position culminates in a miscarriage of justice.

PW1 in her evidence at page 42 of the brief stated as follows:

The prosecutrixs position was that she was forcibly raped by the Appellant

on the date of the incident. In her evidence she had stated that the Appellant

had adjusted the curtain and had requested her to have sex with him after

coming into her room. Although she had stated that she was about to leave

the room upon hearing the sound of a motor bike the Appellant had arrived

first and had thereby blocked the entrance of the room. But when the

Appellant had started to adjust the curtains in the room the prosecutrix had

not taken any endeavour to escape from the room.

PW1 under cross-examination at pages 59-60 of the brief stated as follows:

Further during cross-examination, the prosecutrix had stated that the

statement was given to police by her brother and she had only signed

thereafter. This position was further aggravated by the evidence given under

cross-examination by the prosecutrix. The said portion of evidence is

mentioned below.

PW1 under cross examination at page 71 of the brief stated as follows:

W ( T'

Considering evidence extracted from the prosecutrixs cross-examination, it

is quite clear that the complaint was lodged due to the insistence of her

brother and also the incident had been witnessed by PW2, Prabashini. These

positions had been very well confirmed by the prosecution in the evidence

given by PW1 in her re-examination.

7 | P a g e

In the re-examination PW1 at page 73 stated as follows:

m% ( ;a;sfha kS;s uy;d fhdackd l,d ;ud fmd,sishg .syska isoah lSf

Hence, the evidence given by the prosecutrix confirms that she lodged the

complaint not only due to the insistence of her brother but also as the

incident was witnessed by PW2 Prabashini.

In the case of Premasiri v. Attorney General (2006) 3 Sri.L.R. 106, Justice

E. Basnayake observed that,

The learned counsel complained that the accused was convicted on

uncorroborated evidence. There is no rule that there must in every case,

be corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand. (Gour on

Penal Law of India 11th Edition page 2567 quoting Raghobgr Singhe vs.

State (2); Rameshwar, Kalyan Singh vs. State of Rajasthan (3). It is well

settled law that a conviction for the offence of rape can be based on the

sole testimony of the prosecutrix if it is reliable, unimpeachable and there

is no infirmity. (Bhola Ram vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (4)). If the

evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon

without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particular. The

testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of

8 | P a g e

the entire case and the trial court must be alive to its responsibility and

be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestation. State

of Punjab vs. Gurmit Singhe (5).

The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a

conviction in a case of rape, but the necessity of the corroboration as a

matter of prudence, except where the circumstances make it unsafe to

dispense with it, must be present to the mind of the judge. (Schindra Nath

Biswas vs. State (6)). In Sunil and another vs. the Attorney General

Dheeraratne J with H. A. G. De Silva and Ramanathan JJ agreeing held

that if the evidence of the complainant is so convincing, they

could act on that evidence alone, even in the absence of her

evidence being corroborated. (Emphasis added).

In the case of State of Andra Pradesh v. Garigula Satya Vani Murthy AIR

1997 SC 1588, it was held that:

the courts are expected to show great responsibility while trying an

accused on a charge of rape. They must deal with such cases with

utmost sensitivity.

When an accused is facing a serious criminal charge it is essential that every

point in favour of the accused, though it may seem trivial, should be placed

before the judge. It may well be that all such matters, if so, placed before the

judge may create a reasonable doubt, the benefit of which should accrue to

the accused.

In this case the learned High Court judge had not considered the evidence

favourable to the Appellant. He had only considered the evidence given by

the prosecutrix and arrived at the conclusion that the evidence given by the

prosecutrix is convincing and reliable and therefore, the prosecution had

9 | P a g e

proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. But considering the portions of

evidence mentioned above and the judgements cited, I conclude it is not safe

to rely on the evidence given by the prosecutrix as it is tainted with doubt

and ambiguity.

In the second ground of appeal the Counsel for the Appellant contended that

the learned trial Judge has grievously erred in law by shifting the burden of

proof to the Appellant thereby reversing the presumption of innocence which

occasioned in the deprivation of a fair trial.

In a criminal trial, as continuously stated by the Appellate Court the burden

of proving a case entirely rests on the hands of the prosecution and this

responsibility never shifts to the defence unless the defence takes up a plea

to a general or special exception of the Penal Code.

In H. M. Mahinda Herath v. The Attorney General CA/21/2003 in

Appellate Court Judgments (Unreported) 2005 at page 35-39 the court held

that:

Where it was held that in a criminal case burden is always on the

prosecution to prove the charge levelled against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt. The trial judge must always bear in mind that the

accused is presumed to be innocent until the charge against the accused

is proved beyond reasonable grounds.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant had cited two paragraphs of the

judgment and argued that the learned High Court Judge had reversed the

presumption of innocence and thereby denied a fair trial to the Appellant.

The learned High Court Judge in his judgment at Pages 194-195 stated as

follows:

The two paragraphs of the judgment cited above clearly demonstrates that

the learned High Court judge had reversed the burden of proof, which is

unknown to the criminal prosecution. As contended by the Counsel for the

Appellant this deviation had denied a fair trial to the Appellant.

The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial is the

observance of the principle of equality of arms between the defence and the

prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed throughout the trial,

means that both parties are treated in a manner ensuring a procedurally

equal position during the course of a trial. It would be difficult to identify in

advance all of the situations that could constitute violations of the fair trial

principle.

Jayant Patel, J. in the case of Jusabbhai Ayubbhai v. State of Gujarat

CR.MA/623/2012 stated that:

..It is by now recognized principles that justice to one party should

not result into injustice to the other side and it will be for the Court to

balance the right of both the sides and to uphold the law.

After careful perusal of the evidence presented in the trial, I am of the view

that the evidence presented by the prosecution is tainted with serious

11 | P a g e

shortcoming and ambiguity. Therefore, it is not safe to act on such evidence

of the prosecution against the appellant.

Hence, considering both the Prosecution case as well as the case advanced

by the Defence, it is concluded that the grounds of appeal forwarded by the

Appellants carry sufficient merit to substantiate awarding the benefit of the

doubt to the Appellant.

I, therefore, set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed on the

Appellant by the learned High court Judge of Anuradhapura. The Appellant

is acquitted from the charge.

The appeal is allowed.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High Court of

Anuradhapura along with the original case record.
