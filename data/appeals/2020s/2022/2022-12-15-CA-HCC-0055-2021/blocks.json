Her mother has been away working in Colombo and used to come and visit them about once a month. The appellant has come over to the PW1s house when her father was away and has committed the alleged sexual abuses on her. Her evidence was that, the appellant used to come over to her house and lift his sarong showing his private parts to her and her sister. On some other occasions, the appellant has got on top of her and placed his penis between her thighs. The PW1 also stated that, the appellant used to give the PW1 and her sister sweets and chocolates on some occasions when he came to their house. When the defence was called, the appellant has made an unsworn statement from the dock. While denying all the allegations against him, he has stated that, he used to wear the sarong short and so he doesnt know whether the victim saw anything or not.",
