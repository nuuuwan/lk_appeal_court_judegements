The Board cannot be faulted for getting the appeal fixed for hearing as stated above, since it is the duty and function of the Secretary of the Board to fix a date and time for hearing and to notify the parties. If it was the intention of the legislature that hearing should be concluded within 2 years from the date of filing the petition or that the time period of 2 years begins to run from the date of filing the petition, there could not have been a difficult to make express provision, in that regard. I do agree with the view of the State Counsel. Hearing no doubt commences from the date of oral hearing. I would as such answer this question in favour of the Respondent and endorse the view of the Board of Review. It is not time barred as the Board arrived at the determination within 2 years.

Generally, in case of a mandatory provision, the act done in breach thereof is void, whereas, in case of a directory provision, the act does not become void, although some other consequences may follow (P.M. Bakshi, Interpretation of Statutes, First Ed, 2008). But, the use of the word shall does not always mean that the provision is obligatory or mandatory, as it depends upon the context in which the word shall occurs and the other circumstances (Vide-Indian Supreme Court case of The Collector of Monghyr v.

The rule that the real intention is to be preferred to the ordinary meaning of words where such intention is clear is the first rule of interpretation laid down by Pothier. Where the intention is clear neither grammar nor punctuation will prevail against it, for the language of Blackstone, neither false English nor bad Latin will destroy a deed. Thus, the courts will not attach overmuch importance to the use in a document of such words as agent mortgage or pledge guarantee,kaikili or stridanum or koratuwa, but will examine the transaction in order to determine its true nature.
