MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the order dated 10.3.2021

of the learned High Court Judge of Matara.

In the instant application suspect respondent (hereinafter referred to as the suspect)

was taken in to custody for allegedly being in possession of 6.54 grams of heroin on

26.5 2020 and remanded on the 27th of May 2020 and in remand custody ever since.

He had been indicted for the same in the relevant High Court according to the Attorney

General under the provisions of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act.

The main contention of the Counsel for the suspect is that the suspect was taken into

custody by the police while he was travelling in a vehicle and in the same vehicle

another woman had been travelling and she too had been arrested for possession of

heroin, a very small amount and was produced before the Magistrates Court and

charged on the next day and she had pleaded guilty and had been sentenced and

released on the same day.

Hence the Counsel for the suspect urged that there is a grave inequality in the

treatment meted out to the two suspects taken in to custody together on the same day,

which he says casts a doubt as with regard to the credibility of the investigations against

the suspect.

According to the provisions of the act under which the suspect has been produced and

remanded bail can be considered under section 83 (1) of the act which reads as follows,

No person suspected or accused of an offence under section 54A or section 54B of this

ordinance shall be released on bail except by the High Court in exceptional

circumstances.

Page 5 of 6

The term exceptional has not been defined in the statute. But in many of our decided

cases the term exceptional has been considered on numerous occasions in relation to

the provisions of the instant act, but the grounds which has been considered as

exceptional vary from case to case and there does not appear to be a definite guiding

principle but the judges have been vested with the power to exercise their judicial

discretion in view of the facts of each case.

As such in the instant case the ground urged by the counsel for the suspect is the fact

that the woman who was taken in to custody was served with speedy justice whereas

the suspect in the instant case- was not.

But this Court takes in to consideration the quantity of heroin which was supposed to

have been recovered from his custody which if found guilty would be life imprisonment

or death.

Therefore the severity of the offence with which the suspect has been charged with,

makes it only fair to look for exceptional circumstances in granting bail as stipulated in

the statute.

Therefore merely because another suspect who has been taken into custody along with

the suspect in the instant matter, being dealt with differently for the reason that it

being a lesser amount of the alleged substance does not make it an exceptional

circumstance to release the instant suspect on bail.

Therefore the exceptional circumstances pleaded by the Counsel for the suspect cannot

be considered as exceptional.

As such this Court sees no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court

Judge.

Hence the instant application for revision is hereby stands dismissed.
