Mayadunne Corea J

When this case was taken up on 05/10/2022, all parties agreed to dispose of this by way of written

submissions. Accordingly, all parties have filed their respective written submissions.

The facts of the case briefly are as follows, the Petitioner is in occupation of a Mahaweli land,

namely, Lot B12 which she says was originally occupied by her late husband, and subsequent to

her husbands death, she had been occupying the said land. The Petitioner states that the said land,

an extent of 10 perches was shown to her late husband by the officers of the 1st Respondent, who

had also given oral authorization to build a commercial property. Subsequently, a construction had

come up and the Petitioner came to the said property in 1985 after marrying the occupier, one

Nandasena Dalugoda. The Petitioner contends that it was considered their matrimonial home and

that both her children were born there. While the Petitioner had made an application to get a permit

for the said land, her late husbands brother, who is the 7th Respondent has also taken a claim to

Before: C.P Kirtisinghe, J Mayadunne Corea, J Counsel: Saliya Peiris P.C with Thanuka Nandasiri and S. Jayawardena for the Petitioner R. Aluwihara S.C for the 1st to 6th Respondents Nihal Jayawardena P.C with R. Herath for the 7th Respondent Written Submissions:

the said land. There had been several litigations between the Petitioner and the 7th Respondent,

which resulted in the Petitioner getting possession of the said land.

Petitioner states that after a land kachcheri, her name was nominated to obtain a permit. However,

1 to 6 Respondents have held several inquiries and taken a decision to award the permit to the 7th

Respondent, hence this application for a writ.

Petitioners complaint to this Court

Petitioner complains that the 3rd Respondent who held the final inquiry had not given the

Petitioner a fair hearing, thereby, violating procedural fairness and principles of natural

justice.

1st to 6th Respondents have disregarded the continuous possession of the property by the

Petitioner and the failure to consider the possession of the Petitioner and granting the

permit for the impugned land to the 7th Respondent, is, therefore, arbitrary, ultra vires

tainted with bias and unreasonableness.

The Petitioner, among other things, has sought the following reliefs from this Court,

(d) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the findings of the

inquiry of the 3rd Respondent contained in P-25

(e) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions contained

in the letter marked as P-26

(f) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision contained

in the letter marked as P-27

(g) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision contained

in the letter marked as P-27A

(h) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 6th

Respondents to regularize the Petitioners possession by issuing a permit to her according to law.

(i) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 6th

Respondents to issue a permit to the Petitioner in relation to the land subjected in this matter.

5

The Respondents in their objections have taken several preliminary objections for the

maintainability of this application, namely,

Misrepresentation of facts,

Suppression of material facts,

Ubberima fides,

The Petitioners application is futile and vexatious and is also misconceived in law.

This Court will consider the said objections.

It is common ground that the disputed land is Lot 12 and has the number 12B New Town

Embilipitiya. The said Lot consists of 10 perches of land. There was no dispute among the parties

that the said Lot belongs to the 1st Respondent, the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka. After several

litigations, presently, the Petitioner is in possession of the said property. In 1981, the Mahaweli

Authority has auctioned the land and people had been allocated Lots. However, it is common

ground that Lot 12B which is the disputed land, had not been included in the said allocation as it

was meant to be a car park. The Respondents contended that in 1984, an amended plan had been

made and among other Lots, the said car park too had been divided into 3 Lots, namely Lot A, Lot

B, and Lot C.

A dispute had arisen between the Petitioner and the 7th Respondent pertaining to Lot 12B as both

have staked claims to obtain a lease for the said land. Both parties contend that they have been

informed by the 1st Respondent that they will be given the lease on different occasions.

The Petitioners version

The Petitioner contends that her husband had been shown the land in the year 1981 and had been

told by the officers of the 1st Respondent to construct a commercial building. However, the

Petitioner has failed to demonstrate the names of the officers or the legal basis on which the said

offer had been made, as state lands cannot be allowed to be occupied by unauthorized occupants.

It is also pertinent to note that state land cannot be alienated the way the Petitioner has submitted.

6

The Petitioner has failed to demonstrate to this Court, with any documents to substantiate her

version of her husband being allocated or how he came to occupy the land.

With the contradictory position taken by the 7th Respondent, the manner in which the Petitioners

husband first came to the land is not clear. Keeping it as it may, it was the contention of the

Petitioner that thereafter, the Petitioners husband had constructed on the land prior to 1985 and in

1985, the Petitioner got married and had shifted to the said premises 12B. The Petitioner pleads

that the said Lot had not only been used as their residence but also as their business premises for

her husbands wholesale business of collecting paddy and also consisted of a rice mill (para 8 of

the petition).

In 1986, in the birth certificate of the Petitioners daughter, the address is given only as Newtown

Embilipitiya by her late husband. In 1988, the Petitioners childs birth certificate marked as P4(a)

depicts the residing address as 12B, the disputed lot in this application the informant had been the

Petitioner herself. In 1987, the Petitioners husband obtained electricity for premises P7(a).

Thereafter the Petitioner has tendered a letter to the electricity board pertaining to a defect in the

electricity meter of the disputed premises. The Petitioner had subsequently attached two electricity

bills which had been dispatched in the year 2015 and the assessment rates for the year 2012, 2013,

2014, and 2015 which were also issued in the name of the Petitioner (P8 (a), (b), (c)). This Court

finds that the oldest document which represents that the Petitioners late husband had been in

possession of the premises, is dated 1987 and that is the year that the 7th Respondent submitted

that he had permitted his late brother to occupy the disputed premises.

It is the contention of the Petitioner, that the Petitioners brother-in-law, namely the 7th Respondent

had subsequently staked a claim to the said land which resulted in the 7th Respondent also

occupying part of the said land. The Petitioner concedes that thereafter, she had leased the land to

a third party and her occupation was through the 3rd party. The lease agreement was tendered

marked (R9). It is observed that as contended by the Respondents, documents marked R10, A, B,

and C, demonstrate that the Petitioner has been leasing out Lot 12B to a third party and obtained

7

lease rentals when she does not have a legal title to the said land, which is owned by the 1st

Respondent.

It is the contention of the Petitioner, that as a result of the 7th Respondents forceful occupation,

there had been several litigations. The 7th Respondent had instituted an action in the District Court

of Embilipitiya. (4559/L). The said action had been dismissed by the District Court and the

subsequent appeal to the Civil Appellate High Court by the 7th Respondent had also been dismissed

(Case No. SP HCA AP 228/2012). Thereafter, the Petitioner has taken steps to eject the 7th

Respondent from the premises through the fiscal.

The Petitioner thereafter made an application to obtain a permit from the 1st Respondent. It was

the contention of the Petitioner, that she had been present for a land kachcheri, and in the said land

kachcheri, she had submitted all the documents to establish that she was residing in the said

premises. The said land kachcheri had been held in the year 2011. The Petitioner had tendered an

affidavit to the said land kachcheri P13, whereby she had submitted that she is in possession of the

said land and that she or her children have no commercial land within the Walawe area belonging

to the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority.

The Petitioner has used the said address of the premises when paying the taxes and also has paid

the assessment rates for the said premises from 2012 to 2015. The Petitioner also tendered the

electricity bills she had paid for the premises (P 7B and 7C) and the assessment rates that had been

issued in her name (P-8A - P-8G) to demonstrate her possession of the land.

It is the contention of the Petitioner, that after the land kachcheri the Petitioner had been named

and selected as an eligible person to hold a permit for the said disputed land. However, the

Petitioner has failed to submit any documentation to establish this ground urged by her. The

Petitioner also conceded that due to certain threats, she is now not in occupation of the premises

in dispute, but she had shifted to Kuruwita Ratnapura.

8

The 7th Respondents Claim.

The 7th Respondent submitted that in the year 1984, certain lots that had not been auctioned in the

year 1981 had been leased out. The auctioned lots and the successful occupants names are

reflected in P1 (b). The disputed premises had been originally left as a car park and due to the

unavailability of lands, the Authority had decided to lease the said Lot after dividing it into three

sub lots as Lot A, Lot B, and Lot C.

It was the contention of the Respondent that subsequent to the auction in 1984, the unauctioned

land had also been allotted and Lot No.12B had been handed over to one H. T. Sarath on November

17th (1R1 annexure 2). Subsequently, the said Sarath had duly paid the lease value for a year to the

1st Respondent in keeping with the Gazette marked as P1 (R2A, R2B).

The 7th Respondent submits that the documents R1 R5 established that from 1984 to 1987, the

original grantee H. T Sarath was in possession, and thereafter t 7th Respondent had been in

possession. The Petitioner strongly contended that H. T. Sarath whom the 7th Respondent claim

was the original recipient of Lot 12B, was never handed over the said Lot. To establish this

position, he relied on document P1B which does not depict an allottee by the name of H. T. Sarath

or by the name of Lot B.

However, this was clarified by the 1st Respondent that the original lot which compromised of Lots

A, B, and C, which was the reserved lot for car parking and was blocked out subsequent to the

auction in the year 1984. Therefore, the said Lot and the name of the recipient H. T. Sarath would

not be reflected in the document the Petitioner relied on. However, this Court observes that there

is a document R1 whereby in the year 1984, the 1st Respondent handed over Lot 12B to H. T

Sarath.

The Respondents also marked the document R7(a) where the Petitioners late husband had sought

to obtain title to another Lot under the Mahaweli Authority in Embilipitiya where he had given his

address as Kurundugasara Thungama and contended that as per the said letter which is dated

9

05.06.1985, the Petitioners late husband specifically stated that he had been living in the said

Kurundugasara Thungama for the last 6 years. It was the contention of the 7th Respondent that his

brother prior to coming to occupation in his land, had made an application to obtain the title to a

land on the basis that he had been in occupation of the said address for a period of more than 6

years, therefore, to transfer the title to him (R7a). It was also the contention of the 7th Respondent

that his deceased brother had always been in Thungama Embilipititya, and not at the disputed

premises. It was his contention, that the Petitioners late husband was allowed to occupy lot 12 B

as he had death threats at the premises he was residing.

As per the documents submitted to this Court, there is a clear dispute pertaining to when the

Petitioners late husband had come to the said premises and the circumstances in which he came

to occupy them. It is trite law that when facts are in dispute this Court is not the forum to canvass

the same.

Thereafter, the original recipient Sarath had entered into an agreement to sell with the 7th

Respondent to vend the disputed Lot B12 to the 7th Respondent. It was the contention of the 7th

Respondent that thereafter, he had constructed the building on the premises and commenced a

business. The recipient Sarath subsequently informed the manager of the 1st Respondent by his

letter dated 25.10.1985 (R3) to transfer the permit that he was to get to the 7th Respondent due to

the improvements that had been done by the 7th Respondent and as he is doing business in the said

premises. The said letter had been acknowledged by the regional manager of the 1st Respondent in

his letter dated 85.10.31 (R4) and also has recommended the same.

The manager of land acquisition had replied to the regional manager in his letter dated 05.11.85

(R5) whereby it had been stated that the contents had been noted to issue a permit to the 7th

Respondent. The said letter states as follows,

12-.

1985.10.31 //6/13 .

10

........

.

In 1989, the regional manager of the 1st Respondent carried out an inspection and had submitted a

report informing the status of the auctioned land and the occupants of the auctioned land. In the

said report, he had lamented that there are unauthorized occupants in some of the lands who are

occupying the lands without payment and had sought permission to regularize the same. In the

said report too, under Lot 12B, it is noted that the 7th Respondent is in occupation of the Lot that

had been given to the original recipient H.T. Sarath (1R1annexure 7).

To substantiate this, the 7th Respondent had submitted R13 J which is a receipt issued by the

Embilipitiya Urban Council in favor of the 7th Respondent for payment made up to the year 2011,

and a letter by the Embilipitiya Pradeshiya Saba marked R14 which certifies that the 7th

Respondent had been in possession of the said land and that he had paid the assessment rates for

the said land. The 7th Respondent had also submitted to this Court, the Assessment notices for the

years 2004, 2009, 2019, and 2011 which had been issued in his name. He also has submitted

receipts for payment of assessment rates marked as R13 A- R13 E and the assessment rates where

his name has been included instead of the original holder of the said premises Sarath. (R12).

In 2009, the 7th Respondent had paid the lease rentals and the fine for the disputed Lot 12B for the

period 1984 to 2009. In their letters in 2005 and 2010, the Divisional Manager had informed the

original recipient that he had illegally transferred the possession of Lot 12B to the 7th Respondent

and had given a warning that if the possession is not taken, the 1st Respondent was going to lay by

the selection of the recipient Sarath, The Acting Director lands had given his consent to the said

recommendation and forwarded the recommendation to the Director General of the 1st Respondent.

The Embilipitya Pradeshiya Sabha had also acknowledged that the 7th Respondent had paid the

assessment rates for the disputed Lot B for the period 1985 to 2005 and a letter issued by the

Embilipitiya Municipal Council states that the assessment rates had been paid till 2015. In perusing

the said documents, this Court finds, that the assessment rates had been paid for Assessment No.

11

307/1. Whether this Assessment number is given to the disputed Lot 12B was not submitted to this

Court.

The 7th Respondent also contended that after the original grantee, H, T. Sarath had informed to

transfer the said land to the 7th Respondent, a special inquiry had been conducted to ascertain the

occupants of the lots and in the said register, under the present occupant column, the name that is

reflected is the 7th Respondents name (R15(a), (b), (c),). He had also been informed by the

regional manager of the 1st Respondent by letter dated 05.05.2005 that since the 7th Respondent is

in occupation of Lot 12B, the 1st Respondent will take steps to cancel the rights of H. T. Sarath

and take steps to issue a permit to the 7th Respondent under the provisions of the Land

Development Ordinance (R15).

It is the contention of the 7th Respondent that he had permitted his brother, the husband of the

Petitioner to occupy the said premises in the year 1987 for security reasons. It was the contention

of the 7th Respondent that he had given the Petitioners husband, permission to carry on a business

on the said premises during the period of 1987, as his brother was under a death threat. The 7th

Respondent did not dispute the fact that his younger brother had obtained electricity under his

name in the year 1987. However, he contended that at the time the deceased husband of the

Petitioner made the application to obtain electricity, what was available to the premises was only

water which had been taken in the name of the 7th Respondent. However, no documents have been

submitted to establish this fact.

In 1989, the Petitioners husband who is the 7th Respondents brother had been killed and it was

the contention of the 7th Respondent that they had permitted the Petitioner to occupy the said land

for some time, but subsequently, the Petitioner had refused to hand over possession of the said

premises.

Objections of the 7th Respondent

The Petitioner submits that by Gazette dated 16/11/1979 (P1(a)), applications had been called from

residents of Rathnapura, Hambantota, and Monaragala to apply for land Lots that were auctioned

12

for purposes of commercial activities. The 7th Respondent submitted that in any event, the

Petitioner is not eligible to seek a lease within the Special Area as the Lots were given to the

people living in certain areas only. They further contended that the Petitioner by her own pleadings

had admitted that she is living in Kuruwita, thus disqualifying her from applying for a Lot under

Gazette marked as P1A.

It was further submitted that even though Kuruwita was within the Ratnapura district, it does not

fall within the Special Area depicted in Gazette P1(a) as Kuruwita is 50km away from the

Special Area. It was also contended that the Petitioner had been disqualified after an inquiry on

the basis that she is not living within the stipulated area of the Gazette and the people who were

eligible to apply should be people who were residing within the commercial area of Embilipitiya.

Thus, the Petitioners application had not been recommended (P7 (a)).

According to P17 D, it had also been stated that the eligibility requirement of residing within the

aforesaid areas had been given due publicity by the newspapers. This Court was not tendered with

any newspaper articles to substantiate this. Also, a plain reading of P1(a) demonstrates that

applicants of Ratnapura, Hambantota, and Monaragala districts are eligible to apply.

Suppression and misrepresentation of facts

It is the contention of the 7th Respondent that the Petitioner has failed to come before this Court

with clean hands. As demonstrated in R8, the 7th Respondent contends that the Petitioner had been

given possession of another lot namely Lot No. 4 by the Mahaweli Authority in the year 1989.

This Court observes that the Petitioner has suppressed this fact, nor has she explained document

R8.

The 7th Respondent also submits that the Petitioner in paragraph 8, specifically said that in 1985

when she moved to the premises in dispute Lot 12B, it contained the paddy collection center and

a rice mill. However, in the objections when the Respondents took the position that to have a rice

mill there was no electricity, the Petitioner contradicted her own position and submitted that there

13

was no rice mill. The Petitioner has failed to give an explanation as to the contradictory position

she has taken on her petition and the counter-objections. Thus, the 7th Respondents contention

that the Petitioner is guilty of suppression and misrepresentation of material facts and also lying

under oath, succeeds.

It was also the contention of the 7th Respondent that in paragraph 26 of the petition, it has been

stated that the Residential Project Manager of Walave Mahaweli Unit Embilipitya had informed

him that they cannot regularize the possession or issue permits to the Petitioner as there is active

litigation. However, the Petitioner has failed to establish this by any documentary evidence.

The Respondents have also submitted to this Court that as per P13, which the Petitioner relied on

to get the land in dispute, she had submitted that she or her children do not have any other

commercial land within the Walave area belonging to the Mahaweli Authority. However, in the

counter affidavit of the Petitioner in paragraph 10, the Petitioner had submitted that she had been

granted a plot of land for residential purposes which again contradicts the contents of her affidavit

marked as P13. Thus, in considering all the material that has been submitted to this Court, the 7th

Respondents submission that there is suppression and misrepresentation of material facts has to

succeed.

The 7th Respondent also has taken up an objection on the basis that the Petitioner has failed to pay

any assessment rates pertaining to the subject premises but she has started paying the assessment

rate only from the year 2012 for the purpose of litigation. It was his contention that his brother the

late husband of the petitioner had not paid the assessment rates because the land nor the building

was owned by him. The contention of the 7th Respondent was that it was he who had paid the

assessment rate prior to that. The 1st to 6th Respondents also conceded and submitted that as per

their inquiries, the 7th Respondent had paid to the Embilipitya Pradeshiya Saba the assessment

taxes for 12B from 1985 to 2005 and from 2006-2011. We find the Petitioner has failed to disclose

this but has submitted that she has paid the assessment rates from 2012 onwards. In our view, it

was the Petitioners duty to disclose the correct facts to this Court to obtain the relief sought in this

petition.

14

In Namunukula Plantation Limited vs. Minster of Land and Others SC Appeal No. 46/2008,

decided on 13/03/2012 it was held as follows; if any party invoking the discretionary jurisdiction

of a Court of law is found wanting in the discharge of its duty to disclose all material facts, or is

shown to have attempted to pollute the pure stream of justice, the Court not only has the right but

a duty to deny relief to such person.

The importance of coming to court with clean hands was recently stressed in Orient Pearl Hotels

vs Cey Nor-Foundation Limited & others CA Writ 226/2018 decided on 02.08.2021 where it

was held It is settled law that a party seeking prerogative relief should come to court with clean

hands. The expression is derived from one of equitys maxims He who comes to Equity must

come with clean hands.

Inquiry held by the 3rd Respondent

This brings us to the main argument of the Petitioner, namely the challenge to the 3rd Respondents

inquiry. It is pertinent to note that the said inquiry had been held in 2016. The report compiled

after the inquiry was tendered to Court marked 1R1. The Petitioner and the 7th Respondent had

been present for the said inquiry. This Court observes that there had been several inquiries held

prior to this inquiry pertaining to the dispute between the Petitioner and the 7th Respondent. As per

the documents available to Court, it appears that the respective inquiries have failed to resolve the

dispute between the parties. This Court has not been provided with the final recommendations of

the said inquiries by either party, thus this Court will not have the benefit to see whether the said

inquiries had ended with a final conclusion or not.

We also find the officers of the 1st Respondent had first acknowledged the 7th Respondents

possession and had informed that he would be given a permit but subsequently also acknowledged

the Petitioners possession and there is a recommendation for the Petitioner to be given a permit.

However, none of the parties have challenged the basis of having another inquiry but all parties

have participated in the said inquiry. Thus, this Court will not venture to ascertain the need for

another inquiry.

The Petitioner by her petition, has attempted to challenge the said inquiry on the basis of it being

biased, arbitrary, unreasonable, and unfair. We do observe that the Petitioner made this allegation

15

only after the inquiring officers recommendations had seen the light of day. However, none of the

parties have tendered the proceedings of the said inquiry to this Court. In the absence of the said

proceedings, this Court is not in a position to come to any conclusion pertaining to the conduct of

the said inquiry.

Further, the Petitioner after having taken part in the said inquiry without any objection, had

submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the inquiry. This Court also observes that the Petitioner

after submitting herself to the inquiry now cannot be heard to complain about the outcome. The

Petitioner has failed to tender any material to demonstrate that she had objected to the manner in

which the inquiry was conducted before the recommendations were made available. This Court is

also mindful of the fact, that this Court cannot and should not assume the power of the inquiring

officer.

Decision in P26

The Petitioner also submits that as per the provisions of the Mahaweli Authority, especially section

22A, the 3rd Respondent does not have the power to arrive at the decision that he had arrived at as

reflected in P26. Thus, the inquiry decision is done in ultra vires. Therefore, it is the Petitioners

contention that the decisions reflected in P 25, 26, and 27A should be quashed. This Court will

now consider the first impugned document P25. We find that by P25, the Director Lands has

reported facts. It appears that the author of P25 has reported facts based on the attached annexures.

In our view, the Petitioner has failed to impeach to the satisfaction of this Court, the findings of

the said report, especially in view of the documents that have been submitted to this Court.

This Court has considered document P26 as well as documents P27, and P27A which are a result

of P26. We do find that all parties have conceded that the title to the said premises in dispute, is

still with the 1st Respondent. It is also not disputed that the Petitioner is occupying the said premises

without any valid authority from the 1st Respondent. It is also pertinent to note that the 7th

Respondent also has no valid permit to occupy the disputed Lot B as both parties are not at variance

on the fact that the rightful owner of the said property is the 1st Respondent. Thus, making the

occupants of the said lot unauthorized occupants of state land.

16

This Court will now consider the Petitioners main objection that in view of section 22(A) of the

Mahaweli Authority Act, the author of P26 does not have the power to arrive at the decision

reflected therein, and accordingly, the said decision is ultra vires. We observe that document P26

is signed by the Director General of the Mahaweli Authority.

Section 22A states as follows,

It shall be lawful for the Minister to whom the administration of this Act is assigned to exercise in,

or with respect to, any special area-

(a) the powers conferred on a Minister by paragraph (b) of the proviso to section 20 of the

Land Development Ordinance;

(b) the powers conferred on a Minister by sections 49, 51, 79, and 80 of the Crown Lands

Ordinance.; and

(c) the powers relating to special grants and leases of State land conferred on a Minister by

any provision of the Crown Lands Ordinance or by any Order or regulation made

thereunder,

as if the reference to Minister in such section, provision, order or regulation were a reference

to the Minister to whom the administration of this Act is assigned; and for so long and so long

only as this section is in force, no Minister other than the Minister to whom the administration of

this Act is assigned shall exercise and such power, in, or with respect to, a special area..

As per section 22A, it is clear that the powers conferred under the sub-paragraph referred to in

22A (a), (b), and (c) are vested with the Minister.

This Court observes that although the legislature has inserted section 22A by Amendment No. 59

of 1993, it has not repealed section 22 in the original Act. Thus, in our view, section 22 is still in

existence and in operation. Section 22 states as follows;

(1) The written laws for the time being specified in Schedule B hereto shall have effect in every

Special Area subject to the modification that it shall be lawful for the Authority to exercise

and discharge in such area any of the powers or functions vested by any such written law

in any authority, officer or person in like manner as though the reference in any such

17

written law to the authority, officer or person empowered to exercise or discharge such

powers or functions included a reference to the Authority.

(2) No authority, officer or person in which or whom any power or function is vested by any

written law for the time being specified in Schedule B hereto shall, in relation to a Special

Area, exercise or discharge any such power or function except for the purpose of executing

or carrying out any arrangement or contract made by the Authority under section 14.

(3) Any power or function which the Authority is authorized by subsection (1) to exercise or

discharge, may be exercised or discharged on behalf of the Authority by any director of

the Authority or by any employee of the Authority as is authorized in that behalf by the

Authority.

(4) Where he considers it expedient to do so for the efficient discharge of the functions of the

Authority, the Minister may, with the concurrence of the Minister concerned and the

approval of the President, by Order published in the Gazette amend, alter or vary Schedule

B hereto.

Section 22 of the Act empowers the 1st Respondent to exercise and discharge the powers and

functions as enumerated in section 22 (1). Section 22 (3) of the Act permits the powers and

functions enumerated in subsection (1) to be exercised or discharged on behalf of the Authority by

any director of the Authority or by any employee of the Authority as authorized on this behalf of

the Authority. It is clear that the decision in document P26 is signed by a director and counter-

signed by the Director General of the 1st Respondent. In our view, the said letter does not violate

the provisions of section 22(3). It is also pertinent to note that Petitioner too has failed to challenge

the contents of the letter for violation of section 22(3). Therefore, in our view, the decision arrived

at and reflected in P26 is done pursuant to the powers vested with the executors of the said

document pursuant to section 22(3). This Court observes that section 22A does not curtail the

powers and functions of the Authority which are enumerated under section 22 (3). Therefore, we

18

cannot agree with the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, that P26 is ultra vires

of the provisions of section 22A.

We also find that document P27 is a communication informing the decision taken in P26. Thus,

since we have decided not to quash P26, the Petitioners prayers (d), (e), and (f) will have to fail.

We also find that the failure to hand the premises pursuant to P27 has resulted in P27A. Thus, in

view of our decisions pertaining to P26 and 27, the prayer (g) also has to fail. It is also pertinent

to observe that in any event, the Petitioner has failed to establish before this Court, that she has

any valid authority to occupy Lot 12B given by the Mahaweli Authority.

In view of the admission by the 7th Respondent as well as the Petitioner, that they do not possess

a valid permit to occupy the premises Lot B, and in view of the fact that Lot 12B is owned by the

1st Respondent, in our view, the 1st Respondent is entitled to send the notice reflected in P27, as

for all purposes, at the time of sending the notice, the Petitioner lacks any legal authority to occupy

the premises owned by the 1st Respondent. Thus, she becomes an unauthorized occupier of state

land and becomes subject to eviction under the State Lands Recovery of Possession Act.

Accordingly, for the aforesaid reasons, we are not inclined to grant the reliefs prayed in the petition

and therefore we dismiss this application without costs.
