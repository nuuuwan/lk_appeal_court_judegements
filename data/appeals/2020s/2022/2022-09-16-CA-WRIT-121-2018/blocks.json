It is alleged that he had found it difficult to cultivate paddy due to the lack ofirrigation facilities. Petitioner is alleged to have made an application to convert a part of the saidpaddy land to a High Land and subsequent to an inquiry, the land had been registered as a HighLand on 22.10.2003 (P5). Thereafter, Petitioner states that he had been cultivating crops in thesaid High Land. He alleges that there had been a misunderstanding between the neighboringfarmers which has resulted in him lodging police complaints against the said farmers. On16.09.2009, the Petitioner received a letter from the 3rd Respondent seeking an explanation forthe failure to cultivate the land and further alleges that the said letter had been sent at theinstigation of the farmers. The Petitioner alleges that the said paddy land is situated in a way thatis difficult to cultivate paddy. He further alleges that he had leased the land to another person forthe purpose of cultivation and subsequent to the lease expiring had gained possession. Thereafterhe alleges that the 2nd Respondent had reactivated the inquiry against him for non-cultivation ofpaddy in the paddy land and had re-registered the land as paddy land. The Petitioner alleges thatthe Respondents decision to hold an inquiry against the Petitioner for non-cultivation of paddyand re-registering the said land as paddy land is unreasonable, arbitrary, and in breach ofprinciples of natural justice. Hence this application for writs of certiorari and mandamus.",

As per the pleadings, it appears thatthe Petitioner without answering the allegation or seeking time to answer the allegations hasattempted to walk out of the inquiry. Thus, he has failed to utilize the opportunity that had beengiven to him to answer the allegation against him and is now complaining that he had not beengiven a hearing and no inquiry had taken place before the decision contained in P22 had beenarrived at. Therefore, the Petitioners contention that the decision in P22 had been arrived atwithout an inquiry has to fail on the Petitioners own admission that he had attempted to walkout of the inquiry. Thus, as contended by the Respondents we find that the decision in P22 is aresult of the inquiry held on 13.12.2017.",
