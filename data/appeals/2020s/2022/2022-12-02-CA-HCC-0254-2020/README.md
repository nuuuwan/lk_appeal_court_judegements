JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam. J,

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted for committing murder of Bulathwattage Nirmala

Manel Nandakeerthi on 06/03/2010 which is an offence punishable under

Section 296 of the Penal Code.

After a non-jury trial, the Learned High Court Judge has found the Appellant

guilty of the charge and sentenced him to death on 19/08/2020. The

prosecution had called seven witnesses and marked productions P1-15 at

the trial. The Appellant had made a dock statement.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellant was connected via

zoom platform from prison.

Background of the Case

According to PW1, he is a small-scale businessman who sells coconuts for

his living. He lives closer to the Pannipitiya Railway Station. Every day, before

he commences his business, as a practice he plucks flowers from a tree

closer to the Pannipitiya railway gate to worship God. On the date of incident

at about 7.00 a.m. when he was plucking flowers, suddenly heard a sound

like cutting of a wood. When he turned his back had seen a person holding

a girl by her hair and dealt a blow on her neck with machete knife. Having

terrified after witnessing this gruesome incident he quickly rushed up to the

duos who were unknown him to prevent the person dealing second blow on

the girl. When he shouted at the person to put down the knife, the person

left the girl who had fallen on the ground facing upwards. As the person had

threatened him not to come closer to him, the witness had run towards a

shop nearby due to fear. In few minutes later when he returned to the place

of incident had seen the deceased was lying on the ground and blood was

oozing from her body. He had also seen the machete knife fallen on the

ground within 03-meter distance from the body. When he looked for the

Appellant, he had witnessed that he was leaving the place through another

road. He had caught the Appellant after a chase. When he was caught, he

drank some red coloured liquid from a bottle in his possession which the

Appellant pretended to be poison. Upon realising that, the witness had

brought the Appellant to the place of incident and the people gathered had

tied him to a lamp post until he was handed over to the police. This witness

had recovered the national identity card of the Appellant and handed over it

to the police. He had identified the knife, the identity card, the clothes of the

deceased and the Appellant at the trial.

According to PW9, Dr. Mahesan, the death has occurred due to

haemorrhagic shock following cut injury of the neck vessels with a sharp

cutting weapon.

The Counsel for the Appellant raising only one ground of appeal contended

that the Learned High Court Judge who continued and wrote the judgment

had not adopted the proceeding as required by Section 48 of Judicature

(Amended) Act No.27 of 1999.

Section 48 of the Judicature Act as amended states:

In the case of death, sickness, resignation, removal from office,

absence from Sri Lanka, or other disability of any Judge before whom

any action, prosecution, proceeding or matter, whether on any inquiry

preliminary to committal for trial or otherwise, has been instituted or

is pending such action, prosecution, proceeding or matter may be

continued before the successor of such Judge who shall have power to

act on the evidence already recorded by his predecessor, or partly

recorded by his predecessor and partly recorded by him or, if he thinks

fit, to re-summon the witness and commence the proceedings afresh:

Provided that where any criminal prosecution, proceedings or matter

(except on an inquiry preliminary to committal for trial) is continued

before the successor of any such Judge, the accused may demand that

the witnesses be resummoned and reheard.

When this case was resumed before the High Court Judge who wrote the

judgment, an application was made by the defence Counsel to re-summon

PW1 for further cross-examination. The reason adduced by the Counsel was

to clear the name discrepancies of PW1. The Application was made under

Section 48 of the Judicature (Amended) Act.

The Learned State Counsel in reply to the application made by the defence

Counsel stated that the defence was trying to delay the smooth function of

the trial by making this application and also submitted to the Court that the

defence was trying to capitalize on the typographical error occasioned in

citing the name of the PW1 in the proceedings. Further, the State Counsel

5 | P a g e

had also submitted that the eye witness PW1 had been subjected to a lengthy

cross-examination by the defence.

The Learned Trial Judge in his Order dated 21/11/2018, after considering

the evidence given by PW1 held that re-calling PW1 for further cross-

examination is not necessary as the defence Counsel had cross examined

the witness regarding his identity adequately.

The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly considered the defences

application under Section 48 of the Judicature (Amended) Act and refused

the said application and continued the trial.

Section 436 of Criminal Procedure Code No: 15 of 1979 states as

follows:

Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment

passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or

altered on appeal or revision on account-

a) of any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons,

warrants, charge, judgment, summing up or other proceedings

before or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceedings under

this code; or

b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

c) Unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has occasioned a

failure of justice.

Article 138 of The Constitution of Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka

states:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions

of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by

the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction

or by any court of First Instance, Tribunal or other institution and sole

6 | P a g e

and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitution in

integrum, of all cases, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things

of which such High Court of First Instance, Tribunal or other

institution may have taken cognizance;

Provided that no judgment, decree, or order of any court shall be

revised or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which

has not prejudiced the substantial right of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice.

As the refusal of the application of the defence is very well within the law and

not prejudiced of substantial rights or occasioned a failure of justice, the

argument advanced by the Counsel of the Appellant has no merit.

The Counsel for the Appellant further argued that the Learned Trial Judge

who continued and delivered the judgment have not adopted the proceedings

as required by Section 48 of the Judicature Act.

It was held in the case of Herath Mudiyanselage Aruyaratna v. Republic of

Sri Lanka CA/307/2006 decided on 17/07/2013 that:

Transfer of a judge to another station covers the words other disability

as stated in Section 48 of the Judicature Act, hence the succeeding judge

has no disability to continue with a trial.

This Court already held in Case No.CA/HCC/0168/2015 decided on

24/02/2022 that:

In the case under consideration, it is clear from the proceedings that

the succeeding High Court Judge has decided to continue with the case

by calling the remaining witnesses as formally adopting the evidence

previously recorded was not a matter that needed the attention of the

Learned High Court Judge, as there was no such requirement and the

provision is for the continuation of the trial.

7 | P a g e

.. although it has been the long-standing practice of our judges to

formally adopt the evidence led before their predecessors, it is not a

mandatory requirement.

Considering above mentioned Judgments and following the same principle,

I conclude that the appeal ground advanced by the Appellant has no merit.

Therefore, the appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.

I agree.
