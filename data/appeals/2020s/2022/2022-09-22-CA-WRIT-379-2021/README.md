Decided on : 22.09.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner has been serving as a senior lecturer Grade II at the University of

Peradeniya (University) since 12.02.2007. The Petitioner was promoted to the post of

Professor (Chair) of Archaeology on 16.05.2019 and thereafter she was appointed to the

post of Head of the Department of Archaeology (Head/Department) on 01.10.2019.

The Vice Chancellor of the University by his letter dated 29.07.2021, marked P17,

informed the Petitioner a decision taken by the Council of the University (Council) at its

506th meeting on 24.07.2021 to relieve the Petitioner from her duties as the

Head/Department. Additionally, by letter dated 30.07.2021, marked P17A, the said

letter marked P17 has been amended to indicate that the Petitioner had been relieved

from her duties until the conclusion of the investigations that will be conducted regarding

the administrative matters of the said Department. In view of the said letter marked

P17A, the Petitioner has been relieved from her duties with effect from 30.07.2021 until

the formal inquiry regarding the non-academic issues of the Department of Archelogy are

over.

Thereafter, Prof. J. M. A. Jayawickrama, the 31st Respondent was appointed as the

Head/Department with effect from 30.07.2021 by letter dated 29.07.2021, marked P18.

The said letter P18 was also amended by the letter dated 20.08.2021 (P18A) by which

the period of the said appointment has been restricted and accordingly it will be operative

Page 6 of 19

as an acting appointment only until the investigations in to the administrative issues of

the said Department are over.

Impugned Decisions.

In this application, the Petitioner is challenging the aforesaid decisions of the Council,

taken at its 506th meeting on 24.07.2021 to relieve the Petitioner from her duties as the

Head/Department of Archaeology and also to appoint Prof. J. M. A. Jayawickrama, the

31st Respondent to act in the post of the Head of the said Department. The Petitioner filed

the instant application on 03.01.2022 seeking, inter alia, for a mandate in the nature of a

writ of Certiorari to quash such decisions reflected in P16B, P17, P17A, P18 &

P18A.

The main question which requires consideration of this Court is whether due process has

been followed by the said Council in relieving the Petitioner from her duties as the

Head/Department. Moving now to consider the facts and circumstances which revolve

around the said question.

Background to the impugned decisions taken by the Council.

The Petitioner by her letter dated 10.05.2020 has submitted an appeal to the Vice

Chancellor of the University requesting for a preliminary investigation to be conducted

regarding the academic and administrative issues prevalent at that time at the Department

of Archaeology (Department). Similarly, few other academic members of the same

Department have lodged two complaints in regard to an alleged unprofessional behavior

of the Petitioner. The Council at its 493rd meeting held on 30.06.2020, appointed a

committee to hold a preliminary investigation. The report of the said preliminary

investigation has been issued by the said committee on 25.08.2020 and it is marked as P9

[A11].

The said Committee has recommended inter alia as follows:

2. The Committee advised the incumbent Head of the Department to demonstrate

professionalism during departmental meetings and other conversations with staff

members, thereby to uphold the unity among the staff of the Department while respecting

the pluralism.

Page 7 of 19

3. The Committee also advised all staff members of the Department to support the

uninterrupted academic programme despite of individual/personal issues.

6. The Committee recommends that the Dean of the Faculty should be requested to closely

monitor the activities of the Department of Archaeology and submit a report to the

Council on the behaviour of four academic staff members of the Department after

implementing the above recommendations, after lapse of 3-6 months.

7. If the Vice Chancellor/Council is of the view that there is no positive change towards

settling the current issues in the Department in 3-6 months after implementation of these

recommendations, the Vice Chancellor/Council could consider appointing an external

senior academic staff member as the acting Head of this Department.

In a subsequent development, the Senior Assistant Registrar/Legal and Documentation

of the University sought approval of the Council by way of the Council paper dated

09.07.2021, marked P16A, to get a new preliminary investigation committee appointed

to look into the non-academic issues of the Department in view of identifying specific

allegations in order to frame charges. The said Senior Assistant Registrar sought such

approval based on the grounds that the former preliminary investigation had dealt only

with resolving the academic and administrative issues amicably within the Department

itself and such committee had not identified any specific allegations against the members

of the Department. The recommendations submitted by the said Senior Assistant Registrar

are as follows;

Accordingly, the governing council may grant approval to appoint the following committee

of investigation to hold a preliminary investigation regarding the non-academic issues of the

Department of Archaeology, Faculty of Arts in order identify whether there is a prima facie

case which warrants holding a formal disciplinary inquiry against the responsible persons;

i. Mr. E. W. M. L. Ekanayake Retired High Court Judge (Chairman)

ii. Prof. A. N. de S. Amaratunga Council member

iii. Prof. S. S. Kodituwakku Head of the Department of Agricultural Economics &

Business Management, Faculty of Agriculture.

The Council thereafter at its 506th meeting held on 24.07.2021 considering the said Council

paper (memorandum), marked P16A, has decided, inter alia, as follows;

Page 8 of 19

The council also decided to proceed with a fresh preliminary investigation to look into the

unresolved administrative matters (it has been reported that the academic matters have been

already settled) in the Department by a preliminary investigations committee in order to

identify whether there is a prima facie case which warrants holding formal disciplinary

inquiries against the responsible persons. (Vide-P16B)

The decision reflected in P17 & P17A to relieve the Petitioner from her duties as

Head/Department, until the investigations into the administrative matters (non-academic)

of the Department are over, has been taken by the Council at the same meeting. The

Council has emphasized that such measure had been taken in view of resolving the conflict

situation that prevailed in the Department at that time. Additionally, the Council has

decided, as mentioned earlier, to appoint the 31st Respondent as the Head/Department

until the investigations are over.

Accordingly, the Council appointed another committee to conduct a preliminary

investigation regarding the unresolved issues at the Department and its Report, marked

as A28(a), was issued on 25.02.2022.

In the said report A28(a) the members of the investigation committee have arrived at the

following conclusions:

5.1 The Committee finds that a prima facie case is disclosed against Prof, Rambukwella

for violating sections 1.5 and 1.7 of chapter XXI of the University Establishments

Code and thereby has committed the offences mentioned in sections 2.2.2, 2.2.5 (a),

(b), (d), (f), (h) and (i), 2.2.7 and 2.2.8 of Chapter XXII of the University

Establishments Code.

5.2 The Committee finds that a prima facie case is disclosed against Dr. Rajapaksha for

violating sections 1.2 and 1.3 of Chapter XXI of the University Establishments Code

and thereby has committed offences mentioned in sections 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.5

((a)), 2.2.7 and 2.2.8 of Chapter XXII of the University Establishments Code.

5.3 The Committee finds that a prima facie case is disclosed against Prof.

Chandrarathne for violating sections 1.2 and 1.3 of Chapter XXI, 1.2 of Chapter

XXV and 3.2 of chapter XXIV of the University Establishments Code and thereby

Page 9 of 19

has committed offences mentioned in sections 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.5 (a) and 2.2.8

of Chapter XXII of the University Establishments Code.

By virtue of letter dated 25.05.2022, marked P31 (which is annexed to the Counter

Affidavit affirmed by the Petitioner on 24.06.2022), the Petitioner has been informed of

the decision of the 514th Council meeting (held on 26.03.2022) to serve a charge sheet

against the Petitioner under Para 18.2 of the Chapter XXII of Establishment Code of the

University (Code). The said decision has been taken based on the grounds that a prima

facie case against her has been disclosed concerning her conduct as the Head/Department.

The period of relieving her duties from the Head/Department was extended until the

formal disciplinary inquiry is over, by the same letter.

Contention of the Petitioner and the Respondents.

Now, I advert to consider the arguments relied on by the Petitioner as well as the

Respondents in this application.

The Petitioner argues that the practice of relieving a Head of the Department of his/her

duties until the conclusion of an investigation is not a mechanism known to law and is

contrary to the University Establishment Code, Universities Act and all other laws and

Regulations governing the function of University academic and non-academic activities.

The Petitioner further argues that her appointment to the post of the Head/Department

was made in terms of Section 51 of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 as amended (Act)

and no provision available in the said section to relieve a Head/Department of their duties.

According to the Petitioner, an appointment of an acting Head/Department could be

made only in two instances as mentioned in the Proviso to section 51(1) and section 51(3)

of the Act.

The Petitioner asserts that there was a recommendation to refer the examination and

academic lapses identified by the 1st investigation committee to a Senate appointed

committee and however such recommendations have been blatantly disregarded.

Accordingly, the Petitioner states that the Memorandum (Council Paper) dated

09.07.2021 marked P16A is illegal, arbitrary and mala fides.

The principal argument of the Petitioner is that there were no disciplinary or criminal

proceedings against the Petitioner and further, there was no mechanism for the Petitioner

Page 10 of 19

to be interdicted pending a preliminary investigation under the provisions of the said Code.

The Petitioner referring to Para 18:7 of Chapter XXII of the Code asserts that the said

Section does not provide for relieving a person from their duties but rather stipulates that

if a person should not exercise the functions of his office in the interest of an investigation

or inquiry, then he should be transferred or placed on compulsory leave in terms of Para

14 of Chapter X. In view of such submissions the Petitioner contends that the decision to

relieve her from her duties has been made without any legal authority and such decision

can be declared a nullity.

The other important facet of the Petitioners argument is that the decision to relive the

Petitioner from her duties is devoid of any reasoning and it is only at the stage of filing the

statement of objections (in this application) that the Respondents have divulged the reason

for relieving the Petitioner from her duties and apparently it was to facilitate conducting

of an impartial investigation.

As opposed to such arguments, the Respondents contention is that although the section

51 of the Act has provided for removal of the Head of the Department, no procedure for

such removal has been mentioned and/or prescribed. The Respondents contend therefore,

that the University has embarked on conducting disciplinary proceedings adhering to the

rules of natural justice to ascertain, according to law, whether there are any strong grounds

to establish the allegations put forward against the Petitioner in respect of her functions as

the Head/Department. The Respondents further submit that although there is no clear

provision in the Act or in the Code to deal with allegations against the Head/Department

in respect of alleged misbehaviour or misuse of authority, it is the common understanding

that a reasonable, valid procedure should be followed to remove the Head/Department;

and the said Act cannot provide for each and every step of the administrative action of a

university.

The Respondents argue that the post of academic Head/Department is not a permanent

post and it is only a temporary administrative post; and further, such position is the same

in relation to the Vice Chancellor and the Deans of Faculties. The Act only provides for

the appointment and the removal of a Head/Department whereas, no procedure for such

removal has been laid down. In that context the Respondents allege that the procedure

stipulated in Chapter XXII of the Code has been considered as the most suitable procedure

to be followed in determining the allegations against the Petitioner.

Page 11 of 19

The Respondents further argue that the Petitioners behaviour as the Head/Department

was in issue as enumerated throughout in this case. Accordingly, the Respondents have

taken a decision that the Petitioners engagement in duties as the Head/Department while

the investigations are pending would be detrimental to gather evidence and statements

from the academic/non-academic members of the staff who are serving under the

Petitioner and elsewhere.

Meanwhile, the Respondents have divulged the fact that the Petitioner had filed a

Fundamental Rights Application bearing No. SC/FR/29/2022, seeking reliefs similar to

the instant application. The said case is still pending in the Supreme Court. Thus, the

Respondents complain that the Petitioner is acting with mala fides and attempting to use

the machinery of justice to obtain undue advantages.

Whether due process has been followed by the said Council in relieving the Petitioner

from her duties.

Having considered the arguments of the Petitioner & the Respondents and also based on

the circumstances of this case, I take the view that the pivotal question that should be

examined at this stage is whether it has been disclosed, prima facie, that the Petitioner had

committed an act of misconduct by the time the Council took the decision to relieve the

Petitioner from her duties.

The members of the committee who conducted the preliminary investigation at the initial

stages have noted in their report marked P9 [A11] that the background to the disputes

in the Department was the long-drawn dispute over the appointment to the cadre chair for

which both the Petitioner and the 32nd Respondent were applicants. Further, the said

committee has noted that there had been personal conflicts between the Petitioner and the

other members of the Department and as a consequence, the Department did not have an

environment conducive for conducting departmental meetings or resolving both academic

and administrative issues amicably.

In an attempt to create a suitable atmosphere in the Department, the said committee has

advised all the members including the Petitioner to cooperate with each other and

maintain cordial relations for the betterment of the Department. The said committee has

advised the Petitioner to demonstrate professionalism during Departmental meetings and

Page 12 of 19

other conversations with staff members; thereby to uphold the unity among the staff of the

Department while respecting the pluralism.

As per the Council minutes marked P16, the Council has, inter alia, noted that there is

some weakness in the behaviour of the Petitioner and she could be removed from the post

of the Head/Department if she is found guilty at the preliminary inquiry. As per the

minutes of the said Council meeting, marked P16B, the Council has observed as follows;

The council after a lengthy deliberation on the ongoing conflict situation in the Department

decided that, to solve the problems, it is important to relieve the present Head of the

Department from her duties until the investigations into the administrative matters (non-

academic) of the Department of Archaeology are over. The council emphasized that this

measure is taken only to resolve the conflict situation that currently prevails in the

Department despite the efforts of the Dean to resolve the same.

It appears with the above wordings that the Council has taken the decision to relieve the

Petitioner from her services after a lengthy deliberation on the conflict situation in the

Department. It is important to ascertain whether the members of the Council had

particular reasons in their mind at the time they took the decision to relieve the Petitioner

from her duties. With the words lengthy deliberation, it can be assumed that the council

must have taken note of the investigation report marked P9 as well as other

communication such as P14, P15 & P16A. Even in the earlier Report, marked P9

[A11], in the month of August 2020, the committee who conducted such investigation

has recommended to consider appointing an external senior academic staff member as the

acting Head/Department, if there is no positive change in 3-6 months after

implementation of the recommendations therein, in view of settling the issues prevailed in

the Department.

The Court observes the minutes of the 452nd [A10b], 493rd [A8c], 497th [A12], 506th

[A24a], 507th [A24b/A36], 508th [A24c], 513th [A14a] and 514th [A28c] meetings

of the Council. The Council having decided to appoint a further preliminary investigation

committee at its 506th meeting, has nominated three members to conduct the said

preliminary investigation. Thereafter, the Council has discussed and approved at its 508th

meeting, the terms of reference of the said committee in order to commence such

investigations. The said terms of reference are marked as P21 [A27].

Page 13 of 19

On a careful perusal of the said terms of reference and minutes of the several meetings of

the Council, I take the view that the members of the Council have identified, prima facie,

grounds against the Petitioner in order to conduct a preliminary investigation. In the said

terms of reference, 8 entries are shown as alleged irregularities committed by the Petitioner

based on the complaints of Dr. A. S. G. Rajapakshe, the 32nd Respondent and the 33rd

Respondent. It appears that the members of the Council and the members of the

committees who conducted the aforesaid inquiries have observed that many disputed

issues relating to the Petitioner had been continuing even after several attempts were taken

to resolve such disputes amicably at various stages.

Therefore, in my view, the fact that the Petitioner had committed an act of misconduct

has been disclosed, prima facie, when the Council took the decision to relieve the

Petitioner from her duties. Furthermore, sufficient material has been made available to the

Council before they took the said decision and I am convinced that the said decision was

taken for the best interest of the University and to ensure smooth functioning of the

Department.

It is important to draw my attention to the statement made on 24.07.2021 at the 506th

Council meeting by the Dean Faculty of Arts who has stated that the Petitioner was a very

good administrator; but the Department could not run smoothly unless the conflicts

among the Petitioner and the other academic staff members would be resolved

satisfactorily.

It is no doubt when one holds an administrator post which requires the management of a

particular department or office, the holder of such post needs to be strict and

steadfast/firm. However much you maintain your honesty and integrity in taking

administrative decisions in favour or against the subordinates and colleagues will not be

sufficient to maintain harmony and efficiency at the work place. In order to exercise the

true leadership, the administrator should be firm as mentioned above, but at the same time

should be polite. The politeness includes respecting others and their views also. The Code

of the University in Para 1.7 of Chapter XXI under General Conduct and Discipline has

identified this notion of being polite, which is in my view, always blends with Good

Governance and Rule of Law. The above social theories, in my view, are utilitarian in

assessing the legal basis for decisions taken by authorities and therefore, I cannot possibly

Page 14 of 19

overlook such norms when reviewing the impugned decision of the Council to relieve the

Petitioner from her duties.

The underpinning of my above finding is braced with the below passage of Frank B. Cross

in his essay titled- Law as Courtesy, published in Tulsa Law Review (Vol.47. Issue 1,

Summer 2011) 1

The rule of law is conceived as a rule of etiquette. Legal procedures are useful pretenses. A

judicial action is simply a form of decorum. As a result, judges can "clothe their claims in

law's independent tests and procedures, lending their views an appearance of importance and

impartiality that may not have much of a connection to underlying substance2."

In the circumstances, when such harmony and efficiency are falling down within the work

place, the higher authorities will eventually be compelled to take remedial measures in

order to overcome such unpleasant occurrences. The Council, to my mind, has acted in a

polite manner by relieving the Petitioner from her services rather than interdicting her or

sending her on compulsory leave although such relieving from duties is not spelled out

in the Code or the Act.

Interdiction cannot be considered as a punishment and it is one of the foremost processes

used to initiate investigations into alleged misconducts at the workplace. Interdiction

would not be a presumption of guilt. To my mind, when an employee is interdicted,

usually the work place will be out of bounds for such employee. However, when an

employee is relieved from his duties of a certain post given to him in addition to his

substantive post, he would not essentially be barred from visiting the workplace and

engaging in work of his substantive post; thus, such employee will be restricted only from

engaging in duties of the relevant post and not the duties of his substantive post. It is

observed, as per the averments of the Petitioner that the post of Senior Lecturer is the

substantive post of the Petitioner at the University.

In terms of Para 18 of Chapter XXII of the Code, where it is considered undesirable that

a person employed in a Higher Educational institution should continue to exercise the

functions of his office, he may be, interdicted forthwith from office provided that

1 https://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/tlr/vol47/iss1/21 2 See, e.g., Richard A. Brisbin, Jr., Slaying the Dragon: Segal, Spaeth and the Function of Law in Supreme Court Decision Making, 40 AM. J. POL. SCI. 1004 (1996).

Page 15 of 19

disciplinary proceedings or criminal proceedings have been or are about to be instated on

charges which if established are sufficiently serious to warrant his dismissal. The Para 18.7

of the said Chapter stipulates that if the person cannot be appropriately interdicted in terms

of this Section, but it is in the interest of the investigation or inquiry that he should not

exercise the functions of his office, he should be transferred, or placed on compulsory leave

in terms of Para 14 of Chapter X. The Chapter X mentioned therein deals with Leave to

University Staff whereas Para 18.1 comes under the Chapter which provides disciplinary

procedure which set forth Disciplinary proceedings or Criminal proceedings.

Therefore, based on the circumstances of this case, what is pertinent here is not to give

unnecessary weight attempting to draw an analogy between the terms such as

interdicting, relieving duties, transferring & placing on compulsory leave, but to

assess whether the purpose of the act of interdicting or relieving duties etc., falls within

the ambit of the said Para 18 of the Code. I take the view that if the act of relieving duties

comes within the required limbs of the said clause, then no substantive prejudice would be

caused to an employee who has been kept away only from a certain post without barring

him attending to his substantive official duties.

It is observed that the Petitioner has been relieved from her duties as the

Head/Department, by letters P17 and P17A, only until the investigations that will be

conducted regarding the administrative matters of the Department are over. Although, the

wordings of the said two letters do not disclose any disciplinary proceedings or criminal

proceedings, I am convinced that the Council at various meetings have deliberated taking

disciplinary actions or commencing disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner. The

several council minutes as mentioned above and the said terms of reference (P21) evinced

that the members of the Council were contemplating to commence disciplinary

proceedings against the Petitioner. In other words, I take the view that the fact that the

Petitioner has committed an act of misconduct has been well disclosed to the Council by

the time the Council took the impugned decisions.

Hence, the Council, in my view, satisfying the requisites of the said Para18 of Chapter

XXII of the Code, has arrived at a rational and reasonable conclusion that;

(a). it is undesirable that the Petitioner continues to exercise the functions of the

post of Head/Department until the investigations against her are over;

Page 16 of 19

(b). disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner have been or are about to be

instated on charges which if established are sufficiently serious to warrant his

dismissal.

The said point of view is accentuated with the terms of reference marked P21 [A27] and

also with the final conclusions of the Report dated 25.02.2022, marked A28(a), wherein

the members of the investigating committee decided that a prima facie case was disclosed

against the Petitioner and two others who had violated provisions of the Code and thereby

committed offences under the Code. In light of the aforesaid, I reject the argument of the

Petitioner that the decision of the Council to relieve the Petitioner from her duties as the

Head/Department is a nullity.

Appointment of the 31st Respondent.

Having examined the issues relating to the main relief prayed for by the Petitioner, I should

now examine the question whether the appointment of the 31st Respondent as the Acting

Head of Department is illegal and ultra vires as claimed by the Petitioner. The 31st

Respondent was appointed as the Head/Department of Archaeology, Faculty of Arts by

virtue of letter dated 29.07.2021, marked P18, in terms of Section 51 of the Act.

Thereafter, within 22 days, the Vice Chancellor issued another letter dated 20.08.2021,

marked P18A, withdrawing the letter marked P18. The 31st Respondent by virtue of the

said letter P18A has been appointed only to act in the post of the Head of the said

Department until the investigations into the administrative issues are over. In view of the

withdrawal of the letter P18, the Petitioner argues that the decision to appoint the 31st

Respondent to act in the post of the Head of Department does not reflect what was actually

decided at the 506th meeting of the Council. The decision in regard to the appointment of

the 31st Respondent has been minuted at the said 506th meeting (P16B) as follows;

Therefore, the Council decided to appoint Prof. J. M. A. Jayawickrama of the Department

of Economics and Statistics, Faculty of Arts as the Head of the Department until the

investigations are over.

The intention of the Council has been emphasized by the literal meaning of the above

words. It is apparent that the Council has intended to make only a temporary appointment

as the said appointment has been restricted only to a period until the conclusion of the

investigations. In light of the above, I take the view that the simple reason that the word

Page 17 of 19

Acting is not reflected in the said minutes of the Council would not pave the way for me

to uphold the Petitioners above arguments.

The Petitioners other contention in regard to the appointment of the 31st Respondent as

the Acting Head/Department is that the appointment of the 31st Respondent by P18A is

contrary to law. The Petitioner asserts that the Section 51 of the Act provides only for the

below mentioned two instances for the appointment of an Acting Head/Department.

1. Proviso to section 51(1):

Provided that, where the Head of a Department of Study has not been appointed

by the Council, the Vice-Chancellor may appoint a Professor, Associate Professor,

Senior Lecturer or Lecturer to act in the post of Head of Department for a period

not exceeding one month reckoned from the date of his appointment.

2. Section 51(3):

Where owing to leave of absence, illness, or other cause, the Head of a Department

is temporarily unable to perform the duties of his office for a period not exceeding

three months, the Vice-Chancellor shall appoint another Professor, Associate

Professor, Senior Lecturer or Lecturer of that Department to act in the post of Head

of Department for such period. Where however a Head of a Department retires or

resigns, or is for other reason unable to perform the duties of his office for a period

exceeding three months, the post of Head of Department shall be deemed to be

vacant, and a new Head of Department shall be appointed in accordance with

subsection (1).

The above proviso to Section 51(1) is not pertinent to this application and however, the

applicability of provisions of Section 51(3) of the Act as amended by Act No. 7 of 1985

should be examined. The first limb of the said sub section deals with an instance where

the Head/Department is temporarily unable to perform the duties for a period not

exceeding three months. In such an instance, subject to the other provisions therein, the

Vice Chancellor can make an acting appointment for such period.

The second limb of the Section 51(3) deals with an instance where the Head/Department

is unable to perform the duties of his office for a period exceeding three months. In such a

situation, the post of Head/Department shall be deemed to be vacant. The said deeming

Page 18 of 19

provision comes into operation where a Head/Department retires or resigns or is for other

reasons unable to perform duties of his office. It appears that the 31st Respondent has been

serving as an Acting Head/Department for a period over three months. What needs

consideration in the instant application is whether the said deeming provision becomes

operative even on a reason where a higher authority takes a decision, pending an inquiry,

against the wish of such Head/Department, preventing him/her from performing duties

of the post of Head/Department. In other words, the question is whether such deeming

provision is applicable to this case as the 31st Respondent has been serving as the Acting

Head/Department for a period over three months.

Lord Walker who has extensively dealt with deeming provisions in DCC Holdings (UK)

Limited vs. Revenue and Customs Commissioners (2011) 1 All ER 537 (at p. 552),

(2010) UKSC 58 has drawn his attention to the following passage in the case of IRC vs.

Metro lands (Property Finance) Limited (1981) 2 All ER 166 ;

When considering the extent to which a deeming provision should be applied, the court

is entitled and bound to ascertain for what purposes and between what persons the statutory

fiction is to be resorted to. It will not always be clear what those purposes are. If the application

of the provision would lead to an unjust, anomalous or absurd result then, unless its

application would clearly be within the purposes of the fiction, it should not be applied.

(Emphasis added)

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the purpose of the deeming provision adopted

in the said Section 51(3) is limited to instances of;

i. retirement or

ii. resignation or

iii. other reasons unable to perform duties of his office.

The retirement and resignation as mentioned above are not material to the instant issue.

Moreover, I am of the view that the Petitioners inability to perform duties cannot fall even

under the above third category as the Council has taken a decision to relieve her from her

duties until conclusion of preliminary investigations. As I have observed earlier, relieving

from duties/compulsory leave/interdiction cannot be considered as a punishment but

those measures are merely in temporary nature until a proper inquiry is being conducted.

Perhaps, the Petitioners term of office may have come to the tail end due to the effluxion

Page 19 of 19

of time. Anyhow, my considered view is that the Petitioner will be gravely prejudiced if

the above deeming provision embodied in the second limb of the Section 51(3) is applied

to this case which would eventually create a permanent vacancy in the post of

Head/Department while a preliminary investigation is pending against her. Thus, based

on the circumstances of this case, I should exercise my discretion to avoid applying the

said deeming provision (in Section 51(3)) to this case since such application does not come

within the intended purpose of the statute and also it leads to injustice.

For the foregoing reasons, the impugned decision to appoint the 31st Respondent as the

Acting Head /Department cannot be considered illegal. Hence, I am not inclined to grant

any reliefs as prayed for by the Petitioner in respect of the said appointment of the 31st

Respondent as Acting Head/Department.

Writ of Mandamus.

I do not proceed to deal with the relief sought by the Petitioner for a writ of Mandamus as

both learned Counsel for the Petitioner and the learned State Counsel conceded that the

main question of the instant application is whether due process has been followed by the

Council in relieving the Petitioner from her duties.

Conclusion on the Reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner.

For the reasons set forth above, I am not inclined to grant reliefs as prayed for in the prayer

of the Petition of the Petitioner. In the circumstances, I proceed to dismiss the application.

No order is made with regard to costs.
