Counsel: Ravindranath Dabare with Savanthi Ponnamperuma, Nilmal

Wickramasinghe and Hansanie Imalka for the Petitioners.

Ikram Mohammed, PC with Clifford Fernando for the 6th Respondent

instructed by S.M. Dissanayake Associates.

Madubashini Sri Meththa, SC for all the Respondents except the 6th

Respondent.

Decided on: 02.03.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioners in support of this application and the learned

Counsel for the Respondents opposing this application.

Court observes that after filing this application, a joint inspection has been carried out in

order to identify the areas in question and to affect remedial measures. The learned State

Counsel has submitted a report after the said joint survey on 19.05.2021. Subsequently,

the learned State Counsel has submitted a comprehensive report along with the motion

filed on 08.10.2021 and accordingly, the learned State Counsel submits that most of the

matters averred in the petition have been looked into by the authorities and remedial steps

have been taken.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioners disagreeing with the position taken by the

Respondents submits that there are many incidents where the authorities have violated the

law.

The reasons in support of a Judgement in a case must be cogent and succinct. The reasons

to exercise the power on the statue should be reflected in the impugned proceedings.

Merely giving a sequence of evidence in the body of the petition is not sufficient as the

Judgement of this case should finally be focused on the prayer of the petition of the

Petitioner.

Page 5 of 5

Petitioners in the prayer of the petition seek for Orders in the nature of Writ of Mandamus

directing Respondents to perform their statutory and regulatory duties under various

sections of several statues, which in our view is a very broad plea to be made in this kind

of judicial review application.

In our view such reliefs always should combine with an actual incident or with a live fact

especially in a judicial review application since this Court makes Orders of specific nature

as empowered under Article 140 of the Constitution. Further, such Orders should be in

relation to a specific decision or act of the authorities identified carefully in the pleadings.

It is not for this Court to consider whether the public authority is right or wrong but the

role of this Court is to consider whether the public authority has exceeded their powers. I

have observed in my Order dated 03.02.2022 in CA/WRIT/45/2022 that this Court

cannot be the Judge of giving directions to a Government intervening to the role of ruling

the country.

In the circumstances, we are of the unanimous view that none of the reliefs prayed for in

the prayer of the petition could be granted even after a full hearing of this case due to the

ill-fated mode of formulating the prayer of the petition of the Petitioner.

Therefore, we are not inclined to issue notice on the Respondents and we proceed to refuse

this application.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

Dhammika Ganepola J.

I agree.
