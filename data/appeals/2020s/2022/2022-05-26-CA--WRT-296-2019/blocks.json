    "text": "It is to be noted that the impugned vesting Order dated 22-03-2019 marked X25 was made by the Minister upon the recommendation dated 19-08-2016 of the Commissioner marked X24. The said recommendation was also made after the death of the tenant. The learned State Counsel for the 3rd and 4th Respondents took up the position that the tenant had passed away in 1992 after the Commissioner had already made a decision under section 17 (1) of the said Law, and therefore, the principle enunciated in Leelawathis case is not applicable to the instant application. Having scrutinized the Leelawathis case it is manifestly clear that the pith and substance of the determination of the Supreme Court was that, before the vesting Order is made by the Minister, if the tenant passed away, his application made under section 13 of the said Act comes to an end.",
