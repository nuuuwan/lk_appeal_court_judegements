Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra), the Court of Appeal held that although the Appellant commenced to make profits in the year of assessment 1996/97, the years of assessments related to 1993/94 and 1994/95 and for the operation of Section 29 (2) (b), it must be assumed that the Appellant made profits in the relevant year of assessment 1993/94. The Court found that the Appellant made profits in the year 1996/97 whereas the years of assessment related to 1993/94 and 1994/95 and thus, the exemption under Section 17C (1) would not be available. For those reasons, His Lordship Janak de Silva, J. held that the losses incurred during the year of assessment 1996/97 would not be deductible in terms of Section 29 (2) (b) of the Inland Revenue Act, 1979.",

It is abundantly clear that the facts of the case in Royal Ceramics v Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra) are different and can be distinguished from this case. In my view, the decision of the Court of Appeal in Royal Ceramics v Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra) is inapplicable to the present case, whereas the decision of the Court of Appeal in the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue v.
