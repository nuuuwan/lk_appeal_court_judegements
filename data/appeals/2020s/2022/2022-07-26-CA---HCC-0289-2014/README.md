R. Gurusinghe, J.

The accused-appellant (the appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Colombo for having committed the murder of Renuka Weerasinghe on or about

the 04th of November 2001, an offence punishable under Section 296 of the

Penal Code. After trial, the learned High Court Judge found the appellant

guilty as charged and sentenced him to death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant

appealed to this court.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows:

The deceased was the wife of the appellant. The appellant and the deceased

lived in a small house close to the Kelani river, in Kelaniya. On the day of the

incident, the appellant stated to PW1 Upatissa, that his wife was lying on the

bed unconscious. Then PW1, the wife of PW1, and another neighbour went

inside the house with the appellant and they noticed that the body of the

3

deceased was lying on the bed as if she was sleeping. They tried to revive the

consciousness of the deceased. However, as the deceased was not responding,

she was taken to the hospital. The doctor, after examining the deceased

pronounced that she was dead.

The doctor who conducted the post-mortem examination was of the opinion

that the deceased had died due to ligature by strangulation. The doctor

questioned the appellant, but the answers which were given by the appellant

were not satisfactory. The doctor then informed the police and the appellant

was arrested.

The appellant gave evidence from the witness stand and was subject to cross-

examination. The position of the appellant was that, his wife committed

suicide by hanging and initially he did not want to reveal the fact that she had

committed suicide, because he thought that it would bring shame on him.

The case against the appellant entirely depends on circumstantial evidence,

especially the evidence of the doctor who conducted the post-mortem

examination of the deceased body.

The main ground of appeal is that there was evidence to say that the death of

the deceased could be suicide by hanging. Therefore, the guilt of the accused

was not the only inference that could be drawn from the proven facts. There is

reasonable doubt of the guilt of the appellant and he is entitled to be acquitted.

After the post-mortem examination, the doctor came to the conclusion that the

cause of death was due to ligature strangulation. Even though the post-

mortem report indicates that the cause of death was ligature by strangulation,

the doctor who conducted the post-mortem examination, was not very firm on

that opinion, when he gave evidence before Court.

As per his evidence, the injuries were more compatible with the strangulation

by ligature. However, he admitted that there were also several injuries on the

4

body of the deceased which can happen in a suicide by hanging. Some of such

answers given by the doctor are re-produced below.

When considering the above evidence of the doctor, it is obvious that there

were injuries that were compatible to indicate that it was a suicide by hanging.

9

Some of the proven facts are consistent with the innocence of the appellant and

also not consistent with the guilt of the appellant.

Under these circumstances, it is necessary for the prosecution to exclude the

possibility of suicide. Failure to exclude this possibility creates a reasonable

doubt in the prosecution case.

In this case, there are no eye witnesses to the incident. The case entirely

depends on circumstantial evidence.

In the case of King vs Abeywickrema 44 NLR 254, it was held that; in order to

base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the Jury must be satisfied that

the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with

any reasonable hypothesis of his innocence.

In the case of Podi Singho vs King 53 NLR, Dias J. held as follows: in a case of

circumstantial evidence, such evidence must be totally inconsistent with the

innocence of the accused and must only be consistent with his guilt.

In the case of Don Sunny vs Attorney General[1998] 2 Sri LR 1, it was held as

follows:

1. When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the proved

items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point

towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence. On a

consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can be arrived at

should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2. If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence if an inference

can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, then one

cannot say that the charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

10

3. If upon a consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence the

only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the offence,

then they can be found guilty.

In the case Kusumadasa vs State [2011] 1 SriLR pg 25,Justice Sisira de Abrew

held that; in a case of circumstantial evidence, if an inference of guilt is to be

drawn, such inference must be the one and only irresistible and inescapable

inference.

In the instant case, as some facts are compatible with the innocence of the

appellant and some facts are not consistent with his guilt,the inference that the

appellant is guilty cannot be drawn.

Hence, I hold that the conviction is not safe and cannot allow to stand.

I therefore, set aside the conviction and the sentence and acquit the appellant

of the charge with which he was convicted.

The appeal is allowed.
