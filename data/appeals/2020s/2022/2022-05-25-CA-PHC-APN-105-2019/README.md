Order

The Applicant being the Additional Agrarian Development Commissioner, had instituted action

bearing No. 60043 in the Magistrates Court of Kaduwela against the Respondent to obtain an

Order restraining the Respondent from filling/removing any soil from/erecting any structure on

Page 3 of 14

the paddy land morefully described in the schedule to the application dated 11.02.2015, under

Section 33(3) of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 as amended.

Consequent to the said application, the learned Magistrate of Kaduwela issued an Interim Order

on 23.02.2015, restraining the Respondent from filling/removing any soil from/erecting any

structure, on the disputed paddy land under Section 33 (4) of the Agrarian Development Act. The

Respondent appeared before the Magistrates Court and moved Court to file objections in respect

of the issuance of the said Interim Order.

After Applicant filed the counter objections, both Counsel were allowed to make oral submissions.

Having considered the oral submissions of both parties, the learned Magistrate pronounced the

Order on 05.12.2016 confirming the said Interim Order issued against the Respondent. Being

aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent had preferred an appeal to the Provincial High Court

of Western Province holden in Homagama.

The Applicant-Respondent had raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the

appeal on the ground that there is no right of appeal available under the Agrarian Development

Act. The said preliminary objection was disposed on written submissions of both parties and the

learned High Court Judge delivered the Order on 29.05.2019, dismissing the said preliminary

objection raised by the Applicant-Respondent. Since no right of appeal is conferred in the Agrarian

Development Act, the learned High Court Judge converted the appeal into a revision application

and decided to proceed with the matter.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned High Court Judge, the Applicant-Respondent-

Petitioner [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Petitioner] invoked the revisionary jurisdiction

of this Court on the following grounds;

I. The learned High Court Judge has erred in Law in determining that settled Law of the

country is to convert appeals into revisions, when there is no right of appeal granted by

the applicable Law.

II. The learned High Court Judge has erred in Law by failing to give any reasons as to

why the appeal of the Respondent required to be converted into a revision.

Page 4 of 14

III. The learned High Court Judge has erred in Law by failing to answer/determine the

specific legal objections raised by the Petitioner pertaining to whether there exists a

right of appeal under the Agrarian Development Act.

It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant-Respondent-Petitioner that revisionary jurisdiction of

the Provincial High Court vis a vis the Agrarian Services Act was strictly limited to Sections 5 and

9 of the Agrarian Services Act and the aforementioned revisionary jurisdiction could only have

been exercised in respect of Orders made under Sections 5 or 9 of the Agrarian Services Act No.

58 of 1979. This reasoning is equally applicable to the new enactment, Agrarian Development Act

No. 46 of 2000. It is a well-known principle of statutory construction that when the words of an

old statute are made part of a new statute, the legal interpretation which has been put upon the

former by Courts of Law is applicable to those same words in the new statute. This principle of

law was emphasized in the cases Nilamdeen Vs. Nanayakkara [76 N.L.R. 169] and Hewaperuma

Kapugamage Champika Jayanath Vs. P. Manamperi, Assistant Co-operative Commissioner

[CA (PHC) 237/2004] C.A.M. 31.05.2018.

In terms of the High Courts of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, a Provincial

High Courts revisionary power in relation to the Agrarian Development Act is restricted to Orders

made under Section 7 of the Agrarian Development Act as Section 7 is the corresponding provision

to the old Section 5. It is pertinent to note that there is no corresponding provision to Section 9 of

the Agrarian Services Act in the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000.

It is to be observed that, Section 7 of the Agrarian Development Act stipulates three types of orders.

I. The first is an Order made by the Commissioner General of Agrarian Services directing a party occupying a paddy land to vacate it. [Section 7(7) (b) (ii)].

II. The second is an Order made under Section 7(9).

III. The third is an Order made by the Commissioner General of Agrarian Services directing a sub tenant cultivator who is occupying a paddy land without the owners consent to vacate the land. [Section 7(10)-second proviso].

Page 5 of 14

According to the Order dated 24.05.2019, the learned High Court Judge set aside the preliminary

objection raised in respect of the jurisdiction and had stated that the said Order has been made in

view of Section 16 of the Agrarian Development (Amendment) Act No. 46 of 2011 which reads

as follows.

The principal enactment is hereby amended by the substitution for the words Court

of Appeal wherever those words appear in the principal enactment, of the words High

Court of the Province.

It appears that the learned High Court Judge has specifically mentioned the Provincial High Court

is empowered through the substitution of the words High Court of the Province in place of the

words Court of Appeal and has stated that the said amendment has become a background fact

which has resulted in the aforesaid Order.

The above Section has no effect/relevance whatsoever with the disputed issue in the instant case

because the provision in terms of which the original order was made does not refer to any

involvement of the Court of Appeal, i.e. Sections 33(3) and 33 (8) of Agrarian Development Act

are the operative Sections in respect of the particular offence placed before the learned Magistrate

in keeping with stipulated procedural requirements.

It was the contention of the Petitioner that as per the facts and circumstances of this matter, the

Respondent has no basis in Law whatsoever to rely on the provisions of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court-notwithstanding the legal objections resorting to the peculiar and

exceptional procedural step available to a Court of Law to convert an appeal before the Court

into a revision application and proceed to hear the same.

This aspect of law has been discussed in the case of Weragama Vs. Eksath Lanka Wathu

Kamkaru Samithiya [(1994) 1 SLR 293]. This modification has been carried out by Section 3 of

the High Courts of the Provinces Act No. 19 of 1990 and Section 5A of the High Courts of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006. Thus, Provincial High Court

has revisionary jurisdiction in respect of;

Page 6 of 14

Convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by Magistrates Courts and Primary

Courts within the Province [Article 154P (3) (b)].

Orders made by Labour Tribunals within that Province and orders made under Section 5

or Section 9 of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58 of 1979 (to be read as also encompassing

Section 7 of the Agrarian Development Act in light of the reasoning of His Lordship Janak

De Silva J. in Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development Vs. Sepala Francis

Perera Vs. Norman Appuhamy [CA (PHC) 168/2013]) in respect of any land situated

within that province (in terms of Section 3 of the High Courts of the Provinces Act No 19

of 1990).

Judgments, decrees and orders delivered and made by any District Court or a Family Court

within such Province [Section 5A of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

(Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006]

It was further submitted in the case of Abeygunesekera Vs. Wijesekera [(2002) 2 S.L.R. 269] and

Kamala Vs. Andris [41 N.L.R. 71] it is trite law that inherent powers of Court cannot be invoked

to disregard express statutory provisions. In this type of situation, the learned High Court judge in

the instant matter could not have invoked the High Courts inherent powers to exercise a

revisionary jurisdiction which goes above and beyond constitutional provisions and the Law

conferring the forum jurisdiction to the Provincial High Court to exercise revisionary powers.

It was contended by the Petitioners that the learned High Court judge in the instant matter has gone

beyond the scope of revisionary powers vested with the Provincial High Court and resorted to a

peculiar procedural measure of converting a petition of appeal to a revision with a view to consider

the merits of an application, the consideration of which is barred by the specific provisions of Law,

as orders under Section 33 (8) of the Agrarian Development Act (as the successor to the Agrarian

Services Act) are not included in the scope of powers conferred upon the Provincial High Court.

Moreover, it is of particular significance that Court has proceeded to exercise the revisionary

jurisdiction purportedly under the inherent powers of High Court which is therefore contrary to

the Constitution and the applicable laws.

Page 7 of 14

In the case of Sunil Chandra Kumara Vs. Veloo [(2001) 3 SLR 91] it has been held that revision

is available even where there is no right of appeal, but not as of a right, and only on the indulgence

of Court to remedy a miscarriage of justice.

Since, revision is a discretionary remedy, it is not available as of right. This power that flows from

Article 138 is exercised by the Court of Appeal, on application made by a party aggrieved or ex

mero motu and this power is available even where there is no right of appeal. The Petitioner in a

revision application only seeks the indulgence of Court to remedy a miscarriage of justice. He does

not assert it as a right. Revision is available, unless it is restricted by the Constitution or any other

Law.

The need for confirming the scope of this exceptional remedy to miscarriage of justice was aptly

reasoned in Dharmaratne and another Vs. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd and others [(2003) 3

SLR 24] in page 29 by His Lordship Gamini Amarathunga J. after considering several authorities

where he expressed the following view:

The requirement of exceptional circumstances for the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction is not a

requirement statutorily laid down anywhere.

As Gunawardana J. himself has referred to Abrahams CJ. in Ameen Vs. Rasheed [38 NLR 288]

explained the rationale for insisting on the existence of exceptional circumstances for the exercise

of revisionary jurisdiction.

According to Abrahams CJ, revision of an appealable order is an exceptional proceeding and a

person seeking this method of rectification must show why this extra-ordinary method is sought

rather than the ordinary method of appeal. As Hutchinson CJ. stated in Perera Vs. Silva [supra],

it is not possible to contend that the power ought to be exercised or that the legislature could have

intended that it should be exercised so as to give the right of appeal practically in every case.

Thus, the existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the Court selects cases

in respect of which this extra-ordinary method of rectification should be adopted. If such a

selection process is not there, revisionary jurisdiction of this Court will become a gateway for

Page 8 of 14

every litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a revision application or to make an appeal

in situations where the legislature has not given right of appeal.

It must be observed that the learned High Court Judge is of the view that since there is no right of

appeal conferred in the provisions of Agrarian Development (Amendment) Act No.46 of 2000, the

appeal preferred by the Respondent-Petitioner to the High Court can be converted into a revision

and proceeded with. It is important to note that in these circumstances, the learned High Court

Judge had not considered whether the Respondent-Petitioner had exceptional circumstances to

invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent had relied upon the recent order delivered in this Court in

case Don Rohana Ranjith Mahawithana and two others Vs. Commissioner of Co-operative

Development of the Southern Province bearing No. CA (PHC) 37/2017 dated 09.07.2021. In the

said case, the Court exercised the inherent jurisdiction and used its discretion to convert an appeal

into revision since there was a miscarriage of justice before the proceedings of the Magistrates

Court case and certain irregularities had occurred which the Court considered as a miscarriage of

justice and also as the interest of justice so demanded. However, in the instant case the Respondent-

Petitioner-Respondent had not been able to show cause that there is an injustice being caused to

the Respondent or that any exceptional circumstances exist to shock the conscience of Court to

show there is a miscarriage of justice.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, the Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent has failed to establish that,

the impugned paddy land was partly filled with the approval of the relevant authorities and/or that

the Respondent had a valid approval by the Commissioner to conduct ornamental fish farming

project.

It is observable that the learned Magistrate of Kaduwela has made the impugned Order in terms of

Section 33 (1) of the Agrarian Development Act which states;

Page 9 of 14

(1) No person shall fill any extent of paddy land or remove any soil from any extent

of paddy land or erect any structure on any extent of paddy land except with the written

permission of the Commissioner-General.

(2) Any person who contravenes the provisions of subsection (1) shall be guilty of an

offence under this Act.

(3) Where the Commissioner-General, or the Additional Commissioner-General or

Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner is informed that

any person is acting in contravention of the provision of subsection (1) the

Commissioner-General or the Additional Commissioner-General or Commissioner or

Deputy Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner may make an application in writing,

substantially in the Form set out in the Schedule to this Act to the Magistrates Court

within whose local jurisdiction such extent of paddy land or any part thereof, is situated

and praying for the issue of an order restraining the person so contravening the

provisions of subsection (1) and his agents and servants from acting in contravention

of the provisions of subsection (1).

(5) Upon receipt of the application the Magistrate shall determine whether an act has

been committed in contravention of this section and upon arriving at such

determination the Magistrate shall make an interim order restraining the person named

in the application and his servants or agents from acting in contravention of subsection

(1) and shall forthwith issue summons on the person or persons named in the

application to appear and show cause on the date specified in such summons, as to why

such person or and servants or agents should not be restrained, as prayed for in the

application.

(8) If after the inquiry, the Magistrate is not satisfied that the person showing cause

has lawful authority to fill the extent of paddy land or remove any soil therefrom or

erect a structure thereon, he shall confirm the interim order made under subsection (5)

Page 10 of 14

restraining such person and his servants and agents from doing any act in contravention

of this section.

In terms of the provisions of the Agrarian Development Act, it appears that the Respondent has to

satisfy Court that he has the lawful authority from the Commissioner-General of Agrarian

Development to fill a paddy land. In this respect, it was submitted on behalf of the Respondent-

Petitioner-Respondent [hereafter sometimes referred to as the Respondent] that the learned

Magistrate has failed to evaluate the documents and evidence tendered by the Respondent at his

show cause. Especially 3 to 11 in the original case record (which are in these proceedings

and marked as A1 to A9) indicate that the disputed paddy land was already filled, and it was

accepted by the officials of the Agrarian Development office.

It was further submitted that the disputed paddy land was already filled, and that the Respondent

obtained permission from the Agrarian Officials according to 12 [A10] to 14 [A12].

However, the learned Magistrate without properly evaluating the evidence placed before him at

the inquiry had made his order in favour of the Applicant-Respondent-Petitioner. As such, it was

the position taken up by the Respondent that the impugned land owned by his predecessor was

entirely different from the land which was described by the Petitioner to this action. The

Respondent further explained that the land owned by his predecessor was already filled and that

the impugned land is not a paddy land as per the Law.

The Respondent had contended that the Petitioner has wilfully concealed the fact that the Petitioner

issued a licence to the Respondent to conduct an ornamental fish project other than cultivation.

The attention of Court was drawn to the documents marked as A13 and A14 produced before

the learned Magistrate, in which the licence given by the Agrarian Development Commissioner

General allowing the Respondent to conduct an ornamental fish project other than cultivation was

included.

It is to be observed that the document 13 [A11] is a letter sent to the Divisional officer [

] of the Agrarian Services Centre-Malabe from District Assistant Commissioner of

Agrarian Development, requesting to inspect the impugned land and calling for the reports and

Page 11 of 14

observations and also recommendations pertaining to the application of the Respondent to develop

an ornamental fish project.

The document 14 [A12] is a committee report undated and issued under the circular bearing

No. 4/2009. The said document states that;

4/2009

.

.

.

In view of the said documents 11 [A11] and 14 [A12], it does not substantiate that the

Respondent was issued a licence to conduct an ornamental fish project.

It was the contention of the Respondent that the learned Magistrate had failed to assess the

evidentiary value of the documents 3 to 11 tendered by the Respondent, which indicates

that the disputed paddy land was already filled and it was accepted by the Officials of the Agrarian

Development Office.

It appears that the documents 3, 4, 5 and 6 are minutes dated 13.10.1999,

19.07.2000 and 19.01.2000 of the meetings conducted by the Divisional Agrarian Committee at

the Divisional Secretariat-Kaduwela. These minutes reveal that despite the promise made by the

Urban Development Authority to remove earth dumped to the Respondents paddy field within

the road reservation, the said Authority had removed a part of it only and not the entirety as

promised. Therefore, it is apparent that the Respondent had attempted to mislead Court by saying

that the impugned paddy land was already filled.

It is pertinent to note that the Respondent got rights to the impugned paddy land on 26.08.2008 by

Deed of Transfer bearing No. 1492 dated 26.08.2008 attested by H.M.Dharmadasa Notary Public.

Page 12 of 14

The impugned paddy field is described in the schedule of the said Deed of Transfer bearing No.

1492 dated 26.08.2008, as 5 Kurunis in extent and the said portion of land was surveyed by

Indatissa Kotabage by plan bearing No. 526 dated 09.12.2000. The impugned paddy field is

depicted in the said plan as Lot 1, described as surrounded by

paddy fields. Thus, it clearly shows that in the year 2008, the Respondent got rights to a paddy

field and not a paddy field already filled.

The Court draws the attention to the follwoing :

,

.....

Although, the Road Development Authority promised to remove the earth filled to the

Respondents paddy field during the road construction, the said authority has removed only a part

of earth disposed to the Respondents paddy fields and not the entirety.

It is interesting to note that document marked 11, is a letter dated 08.09.2009, addressed to

Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development by the Deputy General Manager-Sri Lanka

Land Reclamation and Development Corporation.

The letter 11 dated 08.09.2009 states;

,

According to the said letter 11, the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation

recommended to develop the impugned paddy land subjected to the aforesaid 1-10 conditions. The

Respondent had failed to fulfil the aforesaid conditions. Since the Respondent had failed to fulfil

particularly the said 7th condition within a year beginning from date of approval given under the

7th condition by document 11 dated 08.09.2009, the said recommendations to develop the

impugned land had been invalidated by letter 11 [A9] itself.

Therefore, it is apparent that although developing the impugned paddy land for the setting up of

an ornamental fish project was recommended and permitted, failure to fulfil the conditions

stipulated in letter 11 [A9] within the specified period precluded the Respondent from

developing the paddy land and converting to an ornamental fish project.

The Assistant Agrarian Development Commissioner had informed the learned Magistrate that the

Respondent had been trying to fill 1 rood and 26 perches of an extent of a paddy land, and since

the Respondent has no legal authority to fill the impugned land, the learned Magistrate had very

correctly issued an Interim Order restraining the Respondent, his agents and servants from filling

Page 14 of 14

the paddy land and after the due inquiry had confirmed the Interim Order made within the

provisions of law. Since there is no injustice caused to the Respondent, no exceptional

circumstances exist for the Respondent to show cause that any miscarriage of justice which shock

the conscience of court.

In view of the aforesaid reasons, it is apparent that this is not a case fit to be converted from appeal

to revision. Thus, I hold that the learned High Court Judge has erred in law by rejecting the

Applicant-Respondent-Petitioners preliminary objections to converting an appeal to revision and

allowing to proceed with the case.

Therefore, we set aside the Order dated 26.08.2019 by the learned High Court Judge and affirm

the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 05.12.2016. Hence, the application of the Applicant-

Respondent-Petitioner is allowed. Petitioners are entitled to cost of the application fixed at Rs.

25,000.
