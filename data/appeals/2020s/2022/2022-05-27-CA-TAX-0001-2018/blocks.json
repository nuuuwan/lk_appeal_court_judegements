The learned State Counsel for the Respondent submitted in his written submission17that to claim capital allowance under Section 25 (1) (a) of the IR Act, two conditions have to be met i.e., that the asset should be owned by the person or the company and that the asset should be used in any trade, business, profession or vocation carried out by the person. It was submitted that by claiming the depreciation allowance for two years of assessment, the Appellant is estopped from denying its ownership of the building.

Yet, in my view, in the instant case, the transfer of the building appearing in the accounting entries is not an activity carried on as a business or trade or an adventure or concern in the nature of a trade.",
