It is significant to remember that a company registered under the Companies Act as an overseas company is very different from an offshore company. An offshore company is not an overseas company, but it is a company incorporated outside Sri Lanka and registered in Sri Lanka under Part XI of the Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007. For those reasons, I hold that a company with offshore activities is very different from an offshore company but the crucial question that arises in the present case is whether or not the Appellant being a non-resident company is involved in offshore business to qualify for the tax exemption under Section 13 (b)(ii) of the Inland Revenue Act. No. 10 of 2006 read with DTAA between India and Sri Lanka.",

It is not in dispute that the benefit under double taxation avoidance treaty can be claimed only by any person or company resident in any of the Contracting States. Under the domestic tax law of Sri Lanka, the test is whether the non-resident company is carrying on business in Sri Lanka through a branch or agency, and if so, the Sri Lankan tax will apply. Where a double taxation treaty applies, the test is replaced by the permanent establishment criterion-i.e., does the foreign trader has sufficient presence in Sri Lanka to constitute a permanent establishment. The test then is whether the branch is a permanent establishment of the non-resident company (Firestone Tyre Rubber Co. v. Lewellin [(1957) 1 All E.R. 561].",

It was held that although the main contract was located outside the U.K. Akron was trading in the U.K. through Brenford as its agent.
