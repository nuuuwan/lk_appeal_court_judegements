Decided on: 16.03.2022

D.N. Samarakoon, J

The appellant ACL Cables PLC who is aggrieved by the order of the Tax Appeals

Commission has suggested the questions of law stated below for the opinion of

this court.

(1) Whether the aforementioned determination of the Tax Appeals

Commission on the relevant appeals, which were deemed to be

transferred to the Tax Appeals Commission under Section 10 of the Tax

Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011 is out of time?

(2) Whether the assessments in question were made within the time

provided under section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006?

(3) Whether the phrase industrial and machine tool manufacturing

appearing in section 17 of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 can be

interpreted as industrial manufacturing and machine tool

manufacturing ?

(4) Can the interpretation of industrial manufacturing as determined by the

Tax Appeals Commission be rejected on the ground that it has a very

wide connotation?

The appellant submitted that he is not pursuing the first question of law and

therefore the scope of argument is limited to second to fourth questions of law.

Section 163 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 is as reproduced

below.

where any person who in the opinion of the Assessor is liable to any

income tax for any of assessment, has not paid such tax or has paid an

2 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

amount less than the proper amount which he ought to have paid as

such tax for such year of assessment, an Assessor may, subject to the

provisions of subsection (3) and (5) and after the fifteenth day of

November immediately succeeding that year of assessment, assess the

amount which in the judgment of the Assessor ought to have been paid

by such person, and shall by notice in writing require such person to pay

forthwith.

Section 163(5) reads as reproduced below,

Subject to the provisions of section 72, no assessment of the income tax

payable under this Act by any person or partnership

(a) Who or which has made a return of his or its income on or before the

thirtieth day of September of the year of assessment immediately

succeeding that year of assessment, shall be made after the expiry of

eighteen months from the end of that year of assessment; and

(b) ..

The two years of assessment relevant to this appeal are year of assessment

2006/2007 and year of assessment 2007/2008

Hence the first relevant year of assessment begins on 01.04.2006 and ends on

31.03.2007. The period of 18 months stipulated in section 163(5) of the Act has

to be calculated from 31.03.2007 and hence ends on 30.09.2008.

The position of the appellant is that the Notice of Assessment for 2006/2007

which was received by the appellant on 06.10.2018 is out of time. It is not

disputed by the respondent that the said Notice of Assessment was received as

above. The Tax Appeals Commission also has accepted the said position in its

determination.

There is an amendment Act No.19 of 2009 which amended section 163(5) (a)

which substituted eighteen months by two years.

3 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

The Inland Revenue (amendment) Act No. 19 of 2009 was endorsed by the

Speaker on 31st March 2009. The 18-month period for the first year of

assessment relevant to this case ended before that on 30.09.2008.

The year of assessment 2007/2008 begins on 01.04.2007 and ends on

31.03.2008. The period of 18 months given in section 163(5) prior to its

amendment is calculated from 31.03.2008 and therefore ends on 30.09.2009.

The position of the appellant is that the Notice of Assessment for 2007/2008

which was received by him on 14.10.2009 is out of time.

As Inland Revenue (amendment) Act No.19 of 2009 was endorsed by the

Speaker on 31.03.2009, it has come into operation within the second year of

assessment relevant to this case.

In CA (TAX) 23/20131 decided by another division of this court on 25.05.2015.

the respondent, the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (who is also the

respondent in this appeal) had taken a two fold argument. It is said at page 3

of the said case. one argument is that the amendment came into force within

the eighteen month period where the assessor was entitled to send the

assessment against the assessee and therefore the extension of time period is

applicable. The other argument is that it is a procedural law and any change in

the procedural law can be considered as an amendment with retrospective

effect.

The first argument aforesaid, if correct, will apply to the second year of

assessment in this appeal because the first 18 month period ended anyway

before the commencement of the amendment by Act No.19 of 2009. In the said

case CA (TAX) 23/2013 it was decided at page 5.

1 Seylan Bank PLC vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue4 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

As I have pointed out earlier, the Speaker has endorsed the bill on 31st

March 2009. As per section 27(6) of the Amendment Act, section 163 of

the principal enactment is amended from 1st of April 2009. The amended

section does not apply retrospect. It operates only from the date specified

in it. The law of the country has changed from that date. Therefore, from

that date onwards, the new law shall apply.

However the court in that case accepted the second argument of the

respondent in that case on procedural law and held in page 5 itself,

The section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act is a procedural law. It

regulates the procedure of sending an assessment against the assessee

by an assessor in the event that the tax return sent by the assessee is

not accepted by the assessor. Even if the amendment has a retrospective

effect, it applies, if the amendment is only on procedural law. No party

can have vested right on procedure.

The appellant has submitted at paragraph 64 of his final written submission

because of CA (TAX) 23/2013 it is possible that the respondent may submit

that the amendment to section 163 (5) (a) by Act No.19 of 2009 has amended

the time period to two years. It was submitted in the course of oral

submissions made by learned Presidents Counsel for the respondent that

court has to rely on Dehideniya Js judgment. This is the judgment in CA

(TAX) 23/2013.

The appellant contends that the amendment by Act No.19 of 2009 does not

apply to any year of assessment relevant to this appeal because of the title of

the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 which says,

AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE IMPOSITION OF INCOME TAX FOR

ANY YEAR OF ASSESSMENT COMMENCING ON OR AFTER APRIL 1,

2006. (emphasis is in the final written submission of the appellant)

5 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

Hence it is submitted at paragraph 66 of the said final written submission that

the applicability of the Act is year on year. (emphasis is in the final written

submission of the appellant)

Hence it is further submitted that since the amendment Act 19 of 2009 was

certified on 31.03.2009, the amendment to section 163(5) (a) was brought into

force prospectively with effect from 01st April 2009 which is the date on which

the year of assessment 2009/2010 begins.

This is an acceptable argument because the title to the Inland Revenue Act

No.10 of 2006 says FOR THE IMPOSITION OF INCOME TAX FOR ANY YEAR

OF ASSESSMENT COMMENCING ON OR AFTER APRIL 1,2006.

Hence it appears that the operations of Act is year on year. The intention of

the legislature appears to be to enact the law on the basis of separate years of

assessment.

Hence this court cannot accept the argument on procedural law which was

accepted in CA TAX 23/2013. In fact, in that case itself at page 6 it is stated,

Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th edition page 222 says;

The presumption against retrospective construction has no

application to enactments which affect only the procedure and practice of

courts. No person has a vested right in any course of procedure, but only

the right of prosecution or defence in the manner prescribed for the time

being by or for the Court in which he sues, and if an Act of Parliament

alters that mode of procedure, he can only proceed according to the

altered mode. Alterations in the form of procedure are always

retrospective, unless there is some good reason or other why they

should not be . (emphasis added in this judgment)

In that case the court also has said at page 6 itself,

6 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

Bindra at page 1469 refers to Grander v. Lucas [1878] 3 AC 582 p. 603

and cites;

It is perfectly settled that if the legislature intended to frame a new

procedure that instead of proceeding in this form or that, you should

proceed in another and a different way, clearly then bygone transactions

are to be sued and enforced according to the new form of procedure.

Alterations in the form of procedure are always retrospective, unless

there is some good reason or other why they should not be .

(emphasis added in this judgment)

It is further stated in that page, Then he goes to explain the citation;

In other words, if a statute deals merely with the procedure in

an action, and does not affect the rights, the new procedure will prima

facie apply to all such proceedings as well as future. No party has a

vested right to a particular procedure or to a particular forum. All

procedural laws are retrospective, unless the legislature expressly says

that they are not. Hence, when a suit of or proceeding comes on for

hearing or disposal, the procedural law in force at that time must be

applied. (emphasis added in this judgment)

The Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 operating year on year is a good

reason as to why an amendment which was certified on 31.03.2009 would

operate from 01 st April 2009 to the year of assessment 2009/2010 and not to

the former years of assessment. Furthermore, due to this year on year

operation of the Act it cannot be said that it deals merely with the procedure

because within the year of operation it vests rights.

7 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

In appeal to the Supreme Court in respect of C.A. (TAX) 23/2013, the Supreme

Court in the judgment of S.C. Appeal No. 46/2016 dated 16.12.2021 has said

at page 17,

As stated above, the purpose of the amendment made to section 163(5)

(a) read with section 106(1) of the principal Act was not only to grant

additional time for an assessor to consider the return of income filed by

the taxpayer and make an assessment (if necessary), but also to grant

additional time for a taxpayer to prepare a return of income in

compliance with the said Act.

If the amendments made to section 163(5)(a) read with section 106(1) of

the principal Act are interpreted to apply to the year of assessment

2007/2008 with retrospective effect, the taxpayers are deprived of filing

income tax returns for such year of assessment within the extended time

period, as such extended time period has passed by the time the said

amendments came into operation. Thus such an interpretation defeats

the purpose of the aforesaid amendment.

Accordingly it is necessary to give prospective effect to both of the

aforesaid amendments in order to give effect to the purpose of

legislation.

The Supreme Court has therefore set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal

in C. A. (TAX) 23/2013.

The extension given to the assessor by an amendment not being afforded to the

assessee, will not arise, if it is decided that the application of the Act is year on

year.

In the present case the respondent has taken another argument which it

appears had not been taken in CA (TAX) 23/2013. That is that the question of

law focuses on the date of making the assessment and not sending the

8 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

assessment. It is stated in the final written submission of the respondent that

the Act provides separate provisions for making of assessments and sending of

Notice of Assessments and whereas the legislature has intentionally provided a

time frame for making the assessment it has intentionally not provided a time

frame for sending the Notice of assessment.

If this argument is accepted, it means that the assessor only has to make the

assessment within the stipulated time but he can indefinitely delay the sending

of the Notice of Assessment.

But as it was seen section 163(1) refers to assess the amount and shall

by notice in writing require such person to pay forthwith .. section

163(1) also says subject to the provisions of subsection (3) and (5).

This shows that the duty to assess is not only coupled with the duty to serve

notice in writing but both are subject to the provisions of subsection (3) and

(5) of section 163 of the Act.

If not the assessor will be able to make an assessment even after the stipulated

period and send Notice of Assessment to the assessee. If the assessee takes the

position that the assessment was not made within the prescribed time the

assessor will be free to produce a document made after the prescribed time but

incorrectly bears a date within the prescribed time as evidence of making the

assessment.

The appellant in paragraph 55 and 56 of the final written submission refer to

section 194 (2) proviso and section 194 (3). Those provisions are as reproduced

below.

194 (2) Every notice given by virtue of this Act may be served on

a person either personally or by being delivered at, or sent by post to, his

9 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

last known place of abode or any place at which he is, or was during the

year to which the notice relates, carrying on business:

Provided that a notice of assessment under section 163 shall

be served personally or by registered letter sent through the post to any

such place as aforesaid.

(3) any notice sent by post shall be deemed to have been served on the

day succeeding the day on which it would have been received in the

ordinary course by post.

Hence the appellant argues that the provisions demonstrate the timing when

the Notice of Assessment is deemed to be served and it is so because the time

of service is material. The appellant questions that if it were otherwise why

would the legislature make such specific provisions relating to the deemed time

of serving Notice of Assessment. If it were not intended to be adhered to and if

the assessment was not to be made and served simultaneously there is no

reason for the existence of such provisions.

This shows that the contention of respondent that once the assessment is

made Notice of Assessment can be served at any time later is not valid.

Furthermore, at paragraph 57 of the final written submission the appellant

cites E.Goonaratne, INCOME TAX IN SRI LANKA, first edition at page 393,

where he says Making an assessment culminates in the notice on the

person assessed. An assessment is made when the assessment is sent.

The appellant also cites C.I.T. Bombay vs. Khemchand Ramdas (1938) 6 ITR

414,423 (PRIVY Council) which is cited in Law and Practice of Income Tax by

Dinesh Vyas, 9th edition, Volume II at page 1741 where it says,

The method prescribed by the Act for making an assessment to

tax- using the word assessment in its most comprehensive sense as

including the whole procedure for imposing liability upon the taxpayer-

10 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

consists of the following steps. In the first place, the taxable income of

the assessee has to be computed. In the next place, the sum payable by

him on the basis of such computation has to be determined. Finally, a

notice of demand in the prescribed form specifying the sum so payable

has to be served on the assessee.

The parties have also referred to case No. C. A. (TAX) 17/20172 decided by

another division of this court on 15.03.2019. In that case the appellant had

filed his return for the year of assessment 2009/2010 by 30th November 2010.

It appears that the said division of this court had two questions to be

determined in regard to the question of time bar pertaining to the making of

the assessment. One is whether the applicable date for time bar is the date of

making the assessment or the date of notice of assessment. The other is

whether the two year period [unlike in the present case where the period of

time bar is eighteen months, in that case it was two years since the Amending

Act No. 19 of 2009 had come into force] end in counting two periods of 365

days or on two calendar years.

In regard to the first question the court decided that the applicable date for the

time bar is the date of making the assessment. It said at page 08 of the

judgment,

The time bar to making an assessment is set out in section 163(5)

of the 2006 Act. The section clearly states that no assessment shall be

made after the time specified therein. Given that the 2006 Act recognizes

a distinction between an assessment and a notice of assessment, it

would have been convenient for the legislature to refer to the notice of

assessment rather than assessment in section 163(5) of the 2006 Act.

On the contrary it has been made effective for the making of an

assessment. Therefore court rejects the submission that the date of

posting of the notice of assessment is the relevant date for the purpose

2 Stafford Motor Company (Private) Limited vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue11 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

of determining the time bar for making an assessment. Court determines

that the date of making the assessment is the relevant date for the

purpose of determining the time bar.

The court cited Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Chettinad Corporation

Ltd., 55 NLR 553 at 556, where Gratiaen J., said,

The distinction between an assessment and a notice of assessment

is thus made clear: the former is the departmental computation of the

amount of tax with which a particular assessee is considered to be

chargeable and the latter is the formal intimation to him of the fact that

such an assessment has been made.

Perusal of that judgment of Gratiaen J., shows that the aforesaid passage

merely refer to an assessment and a notice of assessment whereas it is clear

even without citing the said passage that there are two distinct words as

assessment and a notice of assessment. In other words, to say that

assessment is different from notice of assessment the aforesaid passage is

not required. But whether an assessment to be a valid one it should actually

accompany with a notice of assessment is a deeper question.

As the court said in C. A. (TAX) 17/2017 aforesaid, it found Chettinad

Corporation judgment, from reference made to it in Ismail vs. Commissioner

of Inland Revenue (1981) 2 SLR 78, cited in that case by the appellant. That

is a case decided by the Court of Appeal on a writ application where the main

question for decision was whether reasons must be mandatorily given for the

rejection of a return of income tax. The appellant in that case had also cited the

appeal of Ismail vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue 1981 to the Supreme

Court which is D.M.S. Fernando and another vs. Ismail 1982 1 SRL 222.

The Supreme Court by a majority of 03 to 02 held that such reasons are

mandatory upholding the decision of the Court of Appeal, on that point.

12 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

The division of this court in C. A. (TAX) 17/2017 then cited Cross on

Precedents and another authority on ratio decidendi and obiter dictum and

decided that neither the Court of Appeal in Ismail vs. The Commissioner of

Inland Revenue 1981, nor the Supreme Court in D.M.S. Fernando vs. Ismail

1982 have decided any question that came for decision in C. A. (TAX) 17/2017

and hence those cases are not binding authorities. This is correct on a

perfunctory analysis. But those two cases decided in early 1980s are

important since in those cases the superior courts of this country

examined in detail the procedures followed by the Inland Revenue

Department in estimating, assessing, sending notice of assessment and

giving reasons for non acceptance of the return.

The division of this court in coming to the aforementioned decision in C. A.

(TAX) 17/2017 that the effective date for the commencement of the time bar is

the date of assessment has based its decision on the English case of Honig

and others vs. Sarsfield (Inspector of Taxes) (1986) BTC 205.

The division of this court observed, having referred to that case, that Fox L.J.,

drew a distinction in making of an assessment and the notice of assessment

and held them to be different, the assessment being no way dependent on the

service of notice. The division of this court said, He (Fox L. J.) held that giving

of the notice is independent of the making of a valid and independent

assessment.

As already said in the present judgment, the passage quoted from the

Chettinad case having shed no additional light to the decision contained in C.

A. (TAX) 17/2017, it appears that the entire decision to base the effective date

for the commencement of time bar on the date of assessment has been based

on Honig and others vs. Sarsfield (Inspector of Taxes) (1986) BTC 205.

In the law report of Honig and Others (administrators of Emmanuel Honig)

vs. Sarsfield (H. M. Inspector of Taxes) Reported (Ch.D) [1985] STC 31;

(CA) [1986] STC 246 it is said,

.A back duty enquiry was instituted in 1970 and, on 16th March

1970, an Inspector of Taxes signed a certificate in volume 1 of his

District Assessment books stating that he had made assessments on the

administrators for the years 1960-61 to 1966-67 inclusive. The notices of

assessment were issued on 16th March 1970, but did not reach the

administrators until after 07th April 1970. It was common ground that

the assessments would be out of time unless made before 06th April 1970

by reason of the provisions of section 34 and section 40(1) of the Taxes

Management Act of 1970. The administrators appealed.

The Special Commissioners held that (1) the assessments were made

on 16th March 1970, when a duly authorized Inspector signed the

certificate in volume 1. They were therefore not out of time; (2) the

increases to the assessments contended for by the Inspector were

supportable. They did not accept the oral evidence of the son, M. Honig,

one of the administrators, that the increases in capital disclosed by the

statements were attributable to rental income arising to the son, not the

deceased.

The Chancery Division, dismissing the appeal, held that on the first

point, it was clear on a proper construction of sections 29 and 114 of the

Taxes Management Act of 1970, that the making of the assessment was

not dependent on the service of the notice of assessment. The Special

Commissioners were plainly right to hold that the assessments were

made on 16th March 1970 and so within the time limit prescribed by

sections 34 and 40 (1) of that Act. On the second point, there was no

possible ground on which the court could hold that the Special

14 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

Commissioners conclusion was perverse; there was ample evidence

before them on which to make their findings of fact.

The administrators appealed to the Court of Appeal on the first point

only, namely the date when the assessments were made.

Held, in the Court of Appeal, dismissing the appeal, that the

assessments were made on 16th March 1970 when the Inspector of Taxes

signed the certificate in volume 1 of the assessment book.

Thus it is clear that the procedure in England was different. The assessment

was made when the Inspector of Taxes authorized to make such assessment

signs the certificate in the assessment book. It is because under the Taxes

Management Act of 1970 the Inspector of Taxes was obliged to maintain an

assessment book. In this country the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 does

not require the assessor or the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to maintain

such a register.

Hence the argument of the respondent in the present case that the effective

date for the commencement of the time bar is the date of making the

assessment and not the date of sending the notice could have been accepted

if there was a book or a register maintained by the Commissioner of Inland

Revenue which will be evidence of the date of making of assessment.

It is said at page 09 of C. A. (TAX) 17/2017 that,

The question that arose for determination in Ismail vs. Commissioner

of Inland Revenue and D.M.S. Fernando and another vs. Ismail is

whether the duty imposed on the assessor in terms of section 93(2) of the

Inland Revenue Act No. 04 of 1963 as amended is mandatory and

whether that duty has been complied with. The relevant provision is

similar to section 163(3) of the 2006 Act which requires an assessor to

15 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

give reasons in writing to a person whose return has not been accepted

by him. Both courts held that it was mandatory. The Supreme Court (by

majority) held that the reasons must be communicated at or about the

time the assessor sends his assessment on the estimated income.The

question of whether the time bar for making an assessment applies to

the making of assessment or the notice of assessment did not arise for

determination in those cases.

Section 93(2)3 provided that where a person has furnished a return of

income, wealth or gifts, the assessor may.if he does not accept the

return estimate the amount of assessable income, taxable wealth or

taxable gifts of such person and assess him accordingly. (page 166 of

Ismail vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue 1981)

But as the passage quoted from C. A. (TAX) 17/2017 said, section 163(3) of the

2006 Act requires the assessor, if the return of income tax was not accepted, to

give reasons in writing. Section 93(2) of Act No. 04 of 1963, as it originally

stood, did not require the assessor to give reasons. It was by an amendment

brought by Law No. 30 of 1978 that sections 93(2)(b) and 96(c)(3) were

amended thus including a requirement of giving reasons when the assessor

decides to reject a return of income tax.

It was said that in C. A. (TAX) 17/2017 the division of this court decided that

Ismail vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue 1981 has not decided the

question of time bar. But that case has analysed the procedure to be followed

when an assessor decides not to accept a particular return.

Justice Victor Perera in Ismail vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue 1981

said,

Before I deal with the changes brought about by the amendment of the

Revenue Law, No. 30 of 1978, I would refer to the bounds within which

3 Of Act No. 04 of 196316 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

an Assessor could have rejected and substituted his own assessment

under section 93 and section 94 of the Inland Revenue Law prior to

1978. The courts have considered the far reaching arbitrary powers

granted to an Assessor under the existing law in several cases and have

from time to time commented on the improper approach made by

assessors in exercising those powers. The areas of dispute between an

assessor and assessee would necessarily revolve around the reasons

of the Assessor for, and the basis of his making the arbitrary

assessment of income or wealth. But the assessee was completely in

the dark in regard to the reasons or basis for not accepting the return

even when the notice of assessment was served on him under section 95.

An assessee, when he filed his appeal could therefore not formulate his

grounds of appeal except in general terms. However, under the

provisions dealing with the appeal in section 97 (2) he was obliged to set

out the precise grounds of such appeal and necessarily he had to confine

himself to such grounds when the appeal was considered by the

Commissioner. (page 94-95 of the judgment4)

Although Justice Victor Pereras reasoning, that reasons for not accepting the

return should precede sending of the notice of assessment was refuted by the

learned Chief Justice in appeal, in D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail, the

learned Chief Justice expressed similar views as to the purpose of giving

reasons, which was introduced by amendment of revenue law effected by law

No. 30 of 1978. His Lordship said,

The primary purpose of the amending legislation is to ensure that the

Assessor will bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite

determination whether or not to accept it. It was intended to prevent

arbitrary and grossly unfair assessments which many Assessors had

been making as a protective measure". An unfortunate practice had

4 Copy available in Lawnet website17 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

developed where some Assessors, due to pressure of work and other

reasons, tended to delay looking at a return till the last moment and then

without a proper scrutiny of the return, made a grossly exaggerated

assessment. The law, I think, enabled the department to make recoveries

pending any appeal on such assessments. The overall effect of this

unhappy practice was to pressurise the tax payer to such an extent that

he was placed virtually at the mercy of the tax authorities. The new law

was a measure intended to do away with this practice. Under the

amendment when an Assessor does not accept a return, it must mean

that at the relevant point of time he has brought his mind to bear on the

return and has come to a decision rejecting the return. Consequent to

this rejection, the reasons must be communicated to the Assessee. The

provision for the giving of reasons and the written communication of the

reasons, contained in the amendment, is to ensure that in fact the new

procedure would be followed. More particularly the communication of the

reasons at the relevant time is the indication of its compliance. The new

procedure would also have the effect of fixing the Assessor to a definite

position and not give him latitude: to chop and change thereafter. It was

therefore essential that an Assessor who rejects a return should state his

reasons and communicate them. His reasons must be communicated at

or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated income. Any

later communication would defeat the remedial action intended by

the amendment.

It may be noted that when the learned Chief Justice said, His reasons must be

communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated

income, His Lordship referred as sends his assessment to the sending of the

notice of assessment, since the assessment without the notice, [the document

in the possession of the assessor] which is just the estimate itself is not sent.

Justice Victor Perera in the Court of Appeal said,

18 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

Up to 1978, therefore, the position was that an Assessor could under

the law act arbitrarily though he was expected to act according to the

principles of justice and fair play, honestly to come to a conclusion on

the basis of existing material and to exercise his judgment with

responsibility. When the Assessor did form such a judgment, the

burden is shifted on the assessee to displace the assessment he had

decided to make, according to his judgment. But still as the law

stood, the taxpayer was given no opportunity to know beforehand the

reasons for not accepting a return or the basis of an estimate made

against him nor had he an opportunity of setting out the grounds of an

appeal precisely, if he decided to lodge an appeal. (page 975)

Hence when there was no obligation to give reasons also, once the assessor

forms his judgment, the burden shifted on the assessee.

The learned Chief Justice also said,

Furthermore one has to consider this amendment in the light of the

law as it then existed. The Assessor was then not bound to disclose any

reasons either on the file or by communication to the Assessee. All was

left to the good sense of the Assessor and his sense of justice and

fairness. The Assessee could only appeal against the quantum of

assessment and the onus of proof lay on the Assessee. He could only

speculate on the reasons for such assessment for the purposes of his

appeal. The picture is now different. A duty is now imposed on the

Assessor not only to give reasons for non-acceptance of a return but also

to communicate them to the Assessee.

Justice Victor Perera further said,

The amended section 93, sub-section (2) imposed a duty on the

Assessor who rejected a return furnished by any person to communicate

to such person in writing the reasons for not accepting the return. This

section clearly dealt with the assessment of income, wealth and gifts, the

rejection of a return and a communication had to be done before the

notice of assessment stating the amount of the assessment of income,

wealth and gifts and the amount of the tax charged is sent under section

95. (page 99)

The learned Chief Justice said,

At this stage it would be convenient to deal with the opinion of Perera

J. that the amending law clearly contemplated that the notice

communicating the reasons for not accepting of a return should be an

exercise before the actual assessment of income, wealth or gifts is made

for the purpose of sending the Statutory Notice of Assessment referred to

in Section 95. I have quoted him verbatim because it appears to me that

he considered this communication to be a condition precedent to making

an estimate of assessable income. Perera J. was of the view that the

intent of the provision was to give the Assessee an opportunity to meet

the Assessor-so as to convince him, if possible, that his non-acceptance

was erroneous.

Justice Victor Perera continued,

The amending law clearly contemplated that the notice

communicating the reasons for not accepting of a return should be

an exercise before the actual assessment of income, wealth or gifts

is made for the purpose of sending the statutory notice of

assessment referred to in section 95. No useful purpose would be

served if the notices communicating the reasons for non-acceptance

20 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

of a return are sent simultaneously or at any time after the notice of

assessment is issued under section 95. The purpose of communicating

the reasons for the rejection of a return could only be for the

purpose of giving the taxpayer an opportunity before he receives the

statutory notice of assessment under section 95, to put the assessee in

possession of full particulars of the case he is expected to meet, in

order that he could assist the Assessor if he does not accept the

return to reconsider his rejection if satisfactory reasons are urged

by the assessee before the final assessment is made. (page 99-1006)

It is to be noted that Justice Victor Perera uses the term notice

interchangeably to mean notice communicating the reasons and the notice of

assessment sent under section 95, which he sometimes referred to as

statutory notice of assessment. Whenever he referred to the notice of

assessment, in the aforequoted passage it is reproduced in plain (not bold)

letters. The notice in bold italics has referred to the notice of giving reasons.

Why Victor Perera J., has opined that notice of giving reasons must be before

the notice of assessment was to give an opportunity for the tax payer to fully

enlighten the assessor, prior to the charge sent in the statutory notice of

assessment. It is correct that this position of having to send notice of giving

reasons prior to the statutory notice of the assessment [which appears to be

based on very sound logic] was changed in the Supreme Court. But even the

decision of the majority in the Supreme Court, where the lead judgment was

written by the learned Chief Justice shows that the Supreme Court also

appreciated the difference between the notice of giving reasons and the

statutory notice of the assessment, without which there is only an estimate

and not a valid assessment.

The learned Chief Justice also said,

6 Copy available in Lawnet website21 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

Even if one transposes the words and communicate to such persons

in writing the reasons for not accepting the return to the first, line of the

section after the word return and before the word estimate it will not

make it a condition precedent. (page 227)

His Lordship continued,

The section imposes a duty but does not impose a time limit within

which it should be done. To my mind the section merely states that if the

Assessor does not accept a return he may assess on an estimate .

In the aforequoted two passages one can see the learned Chief Justice did not

accept the proposition of Justice Victor Perera that the notice of giving reasons

should precede the statutory notice of assessment. But what is significant is to

note that the learned Chief Justice said, To my mind the section merely states

that if the Assessor does not accept a return he may assess on an estimate .

What is an estimate was defined by the judgment of Justice Victor Perera. It

is given below. It was not altered by the majority judgment of the Supreme

Court.

Justice Victor Perera defined the term estimate as,

According to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary 'estimate' means an

'approximate calculation based on probabilities' and therefore the

'estimate' becomes the basis of the assessment of the taxable income.

This was the definition adopted by Canakaratne, J. in the case of Silva v.

Commissioner of Income Tax, ! 1) at page 340.

Thus, if the assessor does not accept a return he may assess on an estimate,

means he may make an approximate calculation based on probabilities. It can

become the basis of the assessment of the taxable income, as the passage of

Justice Victor Perera further said. But it can never become an assessment [in

22 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

the sense of a valid assessment] without it being sent with the statutory

notice of assessment.

Hence it appears that although the learned Chief Justice did not agree with

Justice Victor Perera, that giving reasons must be prior to the sending of notice

of assessment, both justices agreed on several salient points, such as,

(a) An assessor could arrive at an arbitrary decision since he was not bound

to disclose any reasons,

(b) The assessee was kept in the dark and hence was in a position of

disadvantage when he has to appeal against a notice of assessment,

(c) Once the assessor forms his judgment, the burden shifts on to the

assessee,

(d) The purpose of the amendment brought by law No. 30 of 1978 was to

remedy the aforesaid position,

(e) Both Judges considered that the making of an assessment is

synonymous with the giving of statutory notice (not the reasons) of

assessment. [Eg. the actual assessment of income, wealth or gifts is

made for the purpose of sending the statutory notice of assessment

referred to in section 95]

(f) In any event, the giving of reasons cannot be after the sending of notice of

assessment,

(g) If giving reasons is after the sending of notice the purpose of the

amendment by law No. 30 of 1978 will be defeated

Hence whereas Justice Victor Perera said giving reasons should precede

sending notice of assessment, the learned Chief Justice said His reasons must

be communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment oiT'an-

estimated income7. He further said, Any later communication would defeat

the remedial action intended by the amendment. Hence whereas the Court

of Appeal said giving reasons must precede notice of assessment and the

7 Statutory Notice 23 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

Supreme Court said reasons can be given at the time of the notice of

assessment, both courts agreed that giving reasons cannot be after the sending

of the notice of assessment, which both courts considered as synonymous

with making the assessment.

Hence although it is correct to say that both the aforesaid cases [Ismail vs.

Commissioner of Income Tax, as well as D.M.S. Fernando vs. Ismail] were not

on the point whether making the assessment as well as giving notice of

assessment, must be within the stipulated time period, they both took it for

granted, in their analysis of the procedure, that making the assessment is

same as giving notice of assessment. Whereas Justice Victor Perera said that

giving reasons for non acceptance of the return should precede the notice of

assessment, the learned Chief Justice said that reasons should be sent at or

about the time of giving notice of assessment and any later communication

would defeat the remedial action intended by the amendment.

Therefore both Justice Victor Perera and the learned Chief Justice have

based their judgments on the premise that making the assessment is

same as giving notice of assessment. This was why it had been argued in

C.A. (Tax) 17/2017 that no lawfully valid assessment can be made without first

serving a valid notice of assessment. The Division of this court in C.A. (Tax)

17/2017 thought that this is a practical impossibility. A letter cannot be sent

without it being written. But what was meant is not this. The argument of the

appellant is that an assessment becomes valid only when the notice is

given. This position was the basis of Ismail vs. Commissioner of Income Tax

as well as D.M.S. Fernando vs. Ismail , despite those two cases were

concerned with the duty to give reasons. The position of the appellant is that

an assessment is no assessment until notice of assessment is given. The

position could have been otherwise, viz., an assessment could have been a

valid assessment, as soon as an estimate is made, if like in Honig

(administrators of Emmanuel Honig) vs. Sarsfield (H.M. Inspector of

24 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

Taxes) the Commissioner of Inland Revenue also maintained a register in

which an assessment is entered. In the absence of such a procedure in this

country, it cannot be accepted that the making of an assessment without

giving notice of assessment is a valid assessment. Hence notice of assessment

must be given to make the assessment validly made for the purpose of the

stipulated time period.

The case of Philip Upali Wijewardene (Appellant) vs. C. Kathiragamer and

another (Respondent) decided in 1992, although not cited by any of the

parties, also has to be considered. The facts and the decision in that case is

summarized as given below.

Assessment for the years of assessment 1972/73, 1973/74, 1974/75,

1975/76 were dated 29.03.1979 and received by the assessee on 04.04.1979.

Section 96 (c) of the Inland Revenue Act as amended by Act 30 of 1978 states

that no assessment of income tax or wealth tax or gift tax for the Y/A 01st April

1972 01st April 1973 and 01st April 1974 shall be made after 31st March 1979.

The aforesaid assessments were dated 29.03.1979. Therefore they were made

within the stipulated time.

Purportedly following the Supreme Court case of D.M.S. Fernando vs. Ismail

1982 (1) SLR 272, W.N.D. Perera J., said,

Communication of reasons for rejecting a return is mandatory and has to be

done at or about the time, an assessment is made on an estimated income. In

the instant case the assessments have been sent to the assessee at or about

the time, the assessments were made. There is therefore substantial compliance

with the requirement of the law.

The said judgment cannot be accepted for two reasons, one is intrinsic whereas

the other is extrinsic. D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail 1982 and the

Court of Appeal decision on which it was based, Ismail vs. Commissioner of

Income Tax 1981, dealt with the question whether giving reasons for not

25 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

accepting a return is mandatory. Both courts decided that it was mandatory.

The Court of Appeal decided that reasons must be given before sending the

notice of assessment. The Supreme Court decided that the reasons can be

given at or about the time when the notice of assessment is sent. It is from

that decision the court in Philp Upali Wijewardene (appellant) vs. C.

Kathiragamer and another in 1992 has taken the phrase at or about the

time. The Supreme Court in D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail 1982 did

not say that notice or the assessment can be sent at or about the time.

This intrinsic defect is even seen in the last quoted passage from Justice

W.N.D. Pereras judgment. In the aforequoted passage the first sentence refers

to reasons while the second sentence refers to the assessment. This is, with

respect, the inherent defect in that decision. The extrinsic reason for the

inability of this court to apply that decision lies in the difference between the

relevant revenue legislations then and now. The case of Philp Upali

Wijewardene (appellant) vs. C. Kathiragamer and another (respondent)

1992 was decided on Inland Revenue Act No. 04 of 1963 as amended by Inland

Revenue (amendment) Law No. 30 of 1978. The said amendment dealt with the

duty to give reasons for not accepting the return which was not a requirement

in the law as existed prior to the said amendment. Giving of the notice was

referred to in section 95(1) of the Act which said,

(1) An Assessor shall give notice of assessment to each person who has been

assessed stating the amount of income, wealth or gifts assessed and the

amount of tax charged.

Hence a separate provision dealt with the duty to give notice of assessment.

But in the present Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, the same provision

deals with the making of the assessment and giving notice of assessment while

both requirements operate subject to the provision that stipulate the time limit.

The early case of COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX v. SAVERIMUTTU CHETTY (1937) 39 NLR 01,

offers evidence of how the process of assessment worked in practice, at a

time when Income Tax Ordinance No. 02 of 1932 was only four years old and

also at an age where there was no duty to give reasons for non acceptance of

the return. The judgment of Abrahams C. J. said,

This is a case stated by the Board of Review under section 74 of the

Income Tax Ordinance, No. 2 of 1932. The facts, so far as they are

material to the consideration of the point of law on which the case has

been stated, are as follows:- M. Saverimuttu Chetty, who may be called

for convenience the assessee, was originally assessed for Income Tax for

the year of assessment 1934-1935 on the basis that his assessable

income was Rs. 9,413, and his taxable income was Rs. 4,913. Upon his

taxable income he was called upon to pay Rs. 245.65 as income tax. His

taxable income was reached by deducting certain allowances amounting

to Rs. 4,500. The assessee appealed against this assessment of the

Commissioner of Income Tax under the provisions of section 69 (1) of the

Ordinance, which enable any person aggrieved by an assessment made

under this Ordinance to appeal to the Commissioner within twenty one

days from the date of the notice of such assessment. This must be done

by what the section calls a "notice of objection". The Commissioner,

acting under section 69 (2) of the Ordinance, directed the assessor to

make further inquiry. By virtue of the provisions of this sub-section an

agreement may be reached as to amount at which the assessee is liable

to be assessed, and this in fact happened, and, as a result, the

assessable income was assessed at Rs. 8,745, the taxable income at Rs.

2,496, and the income tax payable was reduced to Rs. 124.80 This

revision was effected by an allowance to the assessee of the sum of Rs.

1,749 as earned income allowance under the provisions of section 16 (1)

(b) of the Ordinance.

27 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

The judgment further said,

Section 69 of the Ordinance contemplates the following procedure

whereby an assessee who has been wrongly assessed in any respect can

obtain a redress of his grievance. He can file an objection in writing to

the assessment. This done, the Commissioner may direct an assessor to

make further inquiry and the assessor and the assessee may between

themselves settle the matter or, in the language of sub-section (2) to

section 69, make the "necessary adjustment" as a result of their

agreement. If no agreement is reached, the Commissioner hears the

appeal and decides accordingly. There is therefore a contrast drawn in

the body of section 75 between an agreement as to the amount of the

assessable income and the determination of the assessable income on

appeal.

Therefore, it appears that there was a practice of the Commissioner of Income

Tax directing the assessor to reconsider and the assessee can make

representations to the assessor. If they can arrive at an adjustment that will

expedite the process of recovering the tax. As per Justice Victor Pereras

judgment too, if reasons are given before sending the notice of assessment,

the tax payer has an opportunity of fully enlightening the assessor. However as

the learned Chief Justice refuted this position, as at today there is no

compulsory requirement to send reasons prior to the notice of assessment.

However the question in the present case is not as to when reasons has to be

given, but as to whether an assessment becomes a valid one only when notice

of assessment is given. Hence what was said in this passage was said in

orbiter.

Hence it is clear that giving reasons (letters of intimation as they are sometimes

referred to in arguments) is ideally before making an assessment. Hence

further there is no assessment at the time of giving reasons, unless, as

28 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

opined by the learned Chief Justice, reasons accompany the statutory notice.

As per section 163(5) the time bar has to be counted from the assessment.

This is a valid assessment, not an estimate. Therefore it cannot be the letter

giving reasons or a letter of intimation, because there cannot exist an

assessment at the stage of the said letter. The assessment comes later after

the taxpayer, is given the statutory notice of assessment.

The same principal adopted in Ismail vs. Commissioner of Income Tax and

D.M.S. Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail, that assessment becomes valid only

when statutory notice of assessment is given, was followed in the Indian Case

of The Secretary of State for India in Council vs. Seth Khemchand

Thaoomal and others, 1923 decided in the Court of the Judicial

Commissioner, Sind, Reports of Income Tax cases, Vol. I (1886-1925) printed

at the Madras Law Journal press, Maylapore, Madras, 1926. (A copy of the said

judgment is attached to the present judgment)

The summary of the case said,

Where the notice of demand in respect of an assessment to super tax

for the year 1918-1919 was served on the assessee in May 1919 after the

expiry of the year charged for and the assessee instituted a suit to

recover the tax collected from him on the ground that the assessment

was illegal:

Held, that there was no charge, recovery or payment of super tax within

the year of assessment as laid down by section 03 of the Super tax Act

and consequently there being no assessment under the Act, section 39 of

the Income Tax Act was no bar to the suit. (page 26)

Except for the name super tax in the said kind of tax involved, there is no

difference in the principal applicable.

The court said,

29 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

The main point for consideration is whether the assessment of super

tax was an assessment under the Act, for it is only in that event the

jurisdiction of the civil court is barred..(page 27)

As observed in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 04th Edition

page 429 : Statutes which impose pecuniary burden are subject to the

rule of strict construction. It is a well settled rule of law that all charges

upon the subject must be imposed by clear and unambiguous language,

because in some degree they operate as penalties..(page 27)

Section 06 of Act VIII of 1917 provided that when in the collectors

opinion a person is chargeable with super tax a notice shall be served

upon him calling upon him to pay the amount specified therein or to

apply to have the assessment reduced or cancelled. The only way that

an assessee could be said to be charged is by a demand notice issued

by the income tax officials, for till then it cannot be argued that he

has been charged with the payment of any tax. But the respondents

admittedly received notice of demand only in May 1919, that is after the

year 1918-1919 was over and even if he was chargeable with super tax

he ceased to be so after the expiry of the year. The demand notice,

therefore, having been issued after the year was over, there was neither

payment nor recovery of the super tax within the year 1918-1919. (page

27)

The lucidity in the aforequoted passage is characteristic of the age in which it

was written. The tax payer could have instituted a suit and recovered the tax

paid because there was no assessment. There was no assessment because

there was no notice, a demand, a charge, within the limited period. This shows

that an assessment becomes a valid assessment only when notice of

assessment is given. For the application of the time limit what must be there is

30 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

a valid assessment. Such an assessment cannot come into being without there

being notice of assessment.

The court further said,

Mr. Elphinston [who appeared for the state] attempted to invoke the

aid of a confidential note dated the 23rd March 1919 wherein the

Mukhtiarkar had made the calculation of the assessment and as this

was done before the expiry of the year, he argued that the tax was

charged within the year. This argument has no substance in it. It is

unarguable that the contents of a confidential document were

communicated to the assessee, nor is it even alleged that the latter

was aware before the end of the year that he was chargeable with

any super tax. (page 27)

Similarly, the argument for the respondent in the present case that when the

assessment is made it is an assessment for the purposes of the time limit and

there is no time period within which notice of assessment must be given,

cannot succeed.

The court also said,

Mr. Elphinston pressed upon us the serious prejudice to the Crown, if

section 03 were interpreted literally but in a fiscal statute we must look

to the letter of the law and cannot introduce equitable considerations.

(page 27)

There is a patent error of law in the assessment of the super tax and

therefore, the assessment was not one under the Act ; the suit therefore

is not barred. (page 27)

Hence the court considered the failure to give notice of assessment as a

patent error in the assessment which makes the assessment invalid.

It further shows that when notice of assessment is not given within the time

limit, the tax payer obtains a vested right not to be taxed, the reason why in

that case he was able to successfully sue for tax illegally paid.

The position therefore is that in the present case there is no tax validly

imposed for both the years of assessment in question. Hence question of law

No. 02 has to be answered in favour of the appellant.

Question of law No. 03 is,

Whether the phrase industrial and machine tool manufacturing

appearing in section 17 of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 can be

interpreted as industrial manufacturing and machine tool

manufacturing ?

In regard to this question, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant

has argued in oral submissions that, an industrial tool does not mean only a

screwdriver or a wrench, etc., but it includes cables. Certain notes from the

internet have been produced to show that cables and wires are also classified

as tools.

The learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for the respondent has argued

in his oral submissions that the aforesaid position of the appellant regarding

an industrial tool, is not what is in the case stated.

This appears to be correct because question of law No. 03 attempts to interpret

the phrase industrial and machine tool manufacturing as industrial

manufacturing and machine tool manufacturing.

32 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

The plain reading of the phrase shows that it means, industrial tool

manufacturing and machine tool manufacturing.

Section 17 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 reads thus,

17(1) The profits and income within the meaning of paragraph (1) of

section 3 (other than any profits and income from the sale of capital

assets) of any company from any specified undertaking referred to in

subsection (2) and carried on by such company after 01st April 2002,

shall be exempt from income tax for a period of five years reckoned from

the commencement of the year of assessment in which the undertaking

commences to make profits or any year of assessment not later than two

years reckoned from the date on which the undertaking commences to

carry on commercial operations whichever is earlier.

(2) For the purpose of sub section (1) specified undertaking means

(a) An undertaking carried on by a company-

(i)incorporated before 01st April 2002, with a minimum

investment of rupees fifty million invested in such

undertaking; or

(ii) incorporated with a minimum investment of rupees ten

million invested in such undertaking,

and which is engaged in agriculture, agro processing,

industrial and machine tool manufacturing, machinery

manufacturing, electronics, export of non traditional products, or

information technology and allied services.

33 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

Even the Tax Appeal Commission has decided this question in the same way. It

says at page 09 of its determination,

It is to be noted that in section 17(2)(a)(ii) even though some terms

such as agriculture, agro processing, non traditional products and

deemed export are defined, the phrase industrial and machine tool

manufacturing is not defined. Therefore it is necessary to look for a

meaning to be attributed to this phrase industrial and machine tool

manufacturing. It would appear that in the phrase industrial and

machine tool manufacturing the main item referred to is the term tool

and the words tool manufacturing is qualified by the words industrial

and machine. Therefore in this phrase industrial and machine tool

manufacturing the term tool can be understood to mean either an

industrial tool or a machine tool.

But having correctly understood the question, the Tax Appeal Commission

erred in looking at the meaning of the term tool in dictionaries whereas it

should have considered the meaning of the phrase industrial tool

manufacturing.

It considered the meaning of the term tool in the Oxford Dictionary, which it

gave as an instrument such as a hammer, screw driver, saw, etc., that you

hold in your hand and use for making things, repairing things, etc. garden

tools, cutting tools or power tools (using electricity).

Hence it concluded at page 10 of its determination,

However, fire guard cable is only a wire with an improved capability

used in the construction of buildings, houses, for the purpose of

transmitting electrical current or used for telecommunication

34 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

signals..The important difference is that the fire guard cables once

used in buildings or houses it remains embedded in the building or in

the house permanently.

But this would not have happened had the Tax Appeal Commission considered

the meaning of the phrase industrial tool manufacturing, which shows that

fire guard cables are such tools. All tools, especially industrial tools need

not be hand held tools in the popular meaning, as the Tax Appeal Commission

said.

The Tax Appeal Commission said, In this regard, it is a very useful rule in the

interpretation of a statute, to adhere to the ordinary meaning of the word used

and to the grammatical construction, unless that is at variance with the

intention of the legislature, to be derived from the statute itself.

Here using the word in its ordinary meaning was in variance with the intention

of the legislature, which was to be derived from the statute itself, because the

term used was not tool as the Tax Appeal Commission thought but

industrial tool manufacturing.

The use of the prefix industrial before the term tool manufacturing alters its

ordinary meaning.

Therefore it is clear that the appellant is entitled to the exemption from tax

because it is engaged in industrial tool manufacturing which is a specified

undertaking.

However, the question of law No. 03 is not correctly formulated, in the sense, it

should have referred not to industrial manufacturing, but to industrial tool

manufacturing. Hence while the said question of law has to be answered in

35 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

the negative, the answer must accompany with an explanation that the term

industrial and machine tool manufacturing can be interpreted as industrial

tool manufacturing and machine tool manufacturing, in which the

appellants product comes within the former.

The question of law No. 04 is,

Can the interpretation of industrial manufacturing as determined by

the Tax Appeals Commission be rejected on the ground that it has a

very wide connotation?

But it would appear that now this question will not arise because the answer to

question of law No. 03 is not that it is industrial manufacturing but

industrial tool manufacturing.

Hence this question has to be answered as Does not arise, in view of the

answer given to question of law No. 03.

Hence questions of law are answered as below,

(1) Whether the aforementioned determination of the Tax Appeals

Commission on the relevant appeals, which were deemed to be

transferred to the Tax Appeals Commission under Section 10 of the Tax

Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011 is out of time?

No. The appellant did not pursue on this question.

(2) Whether the assessments in question were made within the time

provided under section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006?

No. The assessments are time barred.

(3) Whether the phrase industrial and machine tool manufacturing

appearing in section 17 of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 can be

interpreted as industrial manufacturing and machine tool

manufacturing ?

No. It has to be interpreted as industrial tool manufacturing and

machine tool manufacturing. The appellants product comes within the

former.

(4) Can the interpretation of industrial manufacturing as determined by the

Tax Appeals Commission be rejected on the ground that it has a very

wide connotation?

This question does not arise in view of the answer given to question of

law No. 03.

If the reasons given in this judgment are summarized they would appear as

given below,

(1) The applicability of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 is year on

year. Therefore amendment Act No. 19 of 2009 certified on 31st March

2009 will apply only from 01st April 2009. Hence the time limit in Act

No. 19 of 2009 is not applicable to years of assessment in question in

this case which are 2006/2007 and 2007/2008.

(2) The Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 operating year on year is a

good reason as to why Act No. 19 of 2009 will not apply retrospectively.

Therefore the judgment in CA (TAX) 23/2013 dated 25.05.2015 is

distinguished.

(3) The Supreme Court by its decision dated 16.12.2021 in S.C. 46/2016

has set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal in CA (TAX) 23/2013.

(4) Section 163(1) of the Inland Revenue Act refers to assessing the

amount and shall by notice in writing requiring the tax payer to pay

forthwith, in the same section. Furthermore section 163(1) is subject to

sub sections (3) and (5). Subsection (5) is the time bar and hence giving

notice of assessment too has to be done within the time bar.

(5) The Court of Appeal in C.A. (TAX) 17/2017 dated 15.03.2019 referred

to the judgment in Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Chettinad

Corporation Ltd., 55 NLR 553 to say that there is a distinction between

an assessment and a notice of assessment. While the passage from

that case quoted has superficially distinguished an assessment from a

notice of assessment, whether an assessment to be a valid one

should accompany with a notice of assessment is a deeper question.

(6) In Ismail vs. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1981) 02 SLR

78 and in D.M.S. Fernando vs. Ismail 1982 01 SLR 222, although

C.A. (TAX) 17/2017 said they are not relevant, the superior courts of

this country have examined the procedure followed in the Inland

Revenue Department in estimating, assessing, sending notice of

assessment and giving reasons for non acceptance of the return.

(7) The decision in C.A. (TAX) 17/2017 is based on the English case of

Honig and others vs. Sarsfield (inspector of Taxes) (1986) BTC 205.

(8) As it is clear from the perusal of the judgment in Honig and others

(administrators of Emmanuel Honig) vs. Sarsfield (H.M. Inspector

of Taxes) reported (Ch.D) [1985] STC 31; (CA) [1986] STC 246, the38 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

procedure in England was different because the assessment was

made when the Inspector of Taxes signs the certificate in the

assessment book. There is no such register maintained under the

Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006.

(9) The argument of the respondent in the present case that the effective

date for the time bar is the date of making the assessment but not the

date of sending the notice of assessment could have been accepted if

there was a book or a register maintained as aforesaid.

(10)The judgment in Ismail vs. Commissioner of Inland Revenue

1981 has although not decided the question of time bar in respect of

an assessment, it has analysed the procedure to be followed when an

assessor decides not to accept a return.

(11)It said, The areas of dispute between an assessor and assessee

would necessarily revolve around the reasons of the assessor for

and the basis of his making the arbitrary assessment of income or

wealth.

(12)Although the reasoning of Justice Victor Perera, that reasons for

not accepting the return should precede sending of the notice of

assessment was refuted by the learned Chief Justice in D.M.S.

Fernando vs. Mohideen Ismail 1982, the learned Chief Justice

expressed similar views as to the purpose of giving reasons, which was

introduced by amendment of revenue law effected by law No. 30 of

1978.

(13)The learned Chief Justice said, His reasons must be

communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an39 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

estimated income. Any later communication would defeat the remedial

action intended by the amendment.

(14)Justice Victor Perera said, When the assessor did form such a

judgment, the burden is shifted on the assessee to displace the

assessment he had decided to make, according to his judgment.

(15)The learned Chief Justice said, .and the onus of proof lay on

the Assessee.

(16)Justice Victor Perera as well as the learned Chief Justice

appreciated the difference between the notice of giving reasons and the

statutory notice of the assessment, without which there is only an

estimate and not a valid assessment.

(17)The learned Chief Justice said, To my mind the section merely

states that if the assessor does not accept a return he may assess on

an estimate.

(18)Justice Victor Perera followed the definition of estimate given in

the Shorter Oxford Dictionary which is an approximate calculation

based on probabilities. He said, the estimate becomes the basis of

assessment of the taxable income.

(19)Both courts agreed that giving reasons cannot be after the sending

of the notice of assessment, which both courts appear to have

considered as synonymous with making the assessment.

(20)Hence both Justice Victor Perera and the learned Chief Justice

have based their judgments on the premise that making the40 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

assessment is same as giving notice of assessment. This was why it

has been argued by learned Counsel in C.A. (TAX) 17/2017 that no

lawfully valid assessment can be made without first serving a notice of

assessment. The court in C.A. (TAX) 17/2017 considered that this is a

practical impossibility such as a letter cannot be sent until it is written.

But what was meant is not that. An assessment becomes valid only

when the notice of assessment is given.

(21)The early case of Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Saverimuttu

Chetty decided by Abrahams C.J., when the first Tax Ordinance No. 02

of 1932 was only 04 years old, shows that there was a procedure under

section 69(2) where the Commissioner can direct the assessor to make

further inquiry and there can be an adjustment between the assessor

and the assessee. This procedure would expedite the recovery of tax by

the state, without having to wait on the uncertain outcome of a lengthy

litigation. This is what Justice Victor Perera meant when His Lordship

said reasons for not accepting the return should precede the statutory

notice of assessment under section 95, so that the assessee can make

representations to the assessor.

(22)Hence it is clear that giving reasons (a letter of intimation) is

ideally before making an assessment. Hence further there is no

assessment at the time of giving reasons, unless, as decided by the

learned Chief Justice, reasons accompany the statutory notice of

assessment.

(23)The said principle that an assessment becomes valid only when

statutory notice of assessment is given, was followed in the Indian

case of The Secretary of State for India in Council vs. Seth

41 | C A ( T A X ) 0 7 2 0 1 3 J u d g m e n t J u s ti c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n a n d J u s ti c e B . S a s i M a h e n d r a n .

Khemchand Thaoomal and others, 1923 decided in the Court of the

Judicial Commissioner, Sind.

(24)The court in that case said, The only way that an assessee

could be said to be charged is by a demand notice issued by the

income tax officials, for till then it cannot be argued that he has

been charged with the payment of any tax.

(25)In that case, the tax payer could have instituted a suit and

recovered the tax paid because there was no assessment. There was

no assessment because there was no notice, a demand, a charge

within the limited period. This shows that an assessment becomes a

valid assessment only when notice of assessment is given.

(26)The court held that an attempt made by the state to invoke the aid

of a confidential note, within the stipulated time, cannot be tax charged

within the year and that the said argument has no substance in it.

Similarly, the argument of the respondent in the present case that the

assessment [which is actually an estimate in the legal sense] made

without sending notice of assessment can be the assessment fails.

(27)The court considered the absence of notice of assessment as a

patent error of law in the assessment.

(28)The plain reading of the term in question in section 17(2) of the

Inland Revenue Act which is industrial and machine tool

manufacturing shows that it means industrial tool manufacturing

and machine tool manufacturing.

(29)Having correctly understood the aforementioned position, the Tax

Appeal Commission erred when it looked at the dictionary meaning of

the term tool, whereas it should have considered the meaning of the

phrase industrial tool manufacturing.

(30)Here using the word in its ordinary meaning was at variance with

the intention of the legislature, which was to be derived from the

statute itself, because the term used was not tool as the Tax Appeal

Commission thought but industrial tool manufacturing.

(31)While the product of the appellant comes within the definition of

industrial tool manufacturing, the question of law No. 04 will not

arise.

In the circumstances, the appeal in the form of a stated case is allowed.
