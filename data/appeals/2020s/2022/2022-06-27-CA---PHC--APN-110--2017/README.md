MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant revision application has been filed to revise the Order dated

05.01.2017 of High Court of Avissawella. In the instant matter the accused

respondents were indicted in the High Court under Section 315 of the Penal

Code.

In the High Court the victim had stated that he is not interested in pursuing the

matter as it has taken seventeen years after the incident to reach the current

Page 3 of 6

status. Therefore, both accused respondents have pleaded guilty, and they

have been convicted with a fine of Rs. 10,000 and two years simple

imprisonment. Thereafter, they have been ordered to pay Rs.30,000 as

compensation to the victim, in default two years of imprisonment.

The first accused respondent who has had a previous conviction has been fined

Rs.25,000 in default one year simple imprisonment for the case which had been

at Kesbeewa Magistrates Court.

The first accused respondent has had a another previous conviction from the

Magistrates Court of Rathnapura for which he had been once again fined

Rs.25,000 and in default one year simple imprisonment.

The second accused respondent also has had a previous conviction and he had

been also fined Rs.25,000 and in default one year simple imprisonment.

The main grievance of the counsel appearing for the petitioner is that the

sentence imposed on the second accused respondent for the previous

conviction is inadequate because at the time of sentencing, he had been

convicted with a death sentence.

There was no appearance for the first accused respondent. But the counsel

appearing for the Attorney General did not seriously canvass a case against him.

But she vehemently objected to the sentence imposed for the previous

conviction of the second accused respondent because according to her its a

death sentence and the High Court judge should have been more careful and

stringent in imposing the sentence.

The counsel, who appeared for the second accused respondent, took up the

position that the victim in the instant matter had not been interested in

Page 4 of 6

pursuing the matter, because a long period of seventeen years has lapsed since

the incident. The victim in open court had stated that he did not even want

compensation but he was only interested in concluding the matter. It is actually

this statement of the victim which had prompted the accused respondents to

plead to the indictment.

But the counsel for the Attorney General stated that the statement of the

victim does not take away the severity of the sentence imposed on the second

accused respondent by the trial judge for the previous conviction and the High

Court judge in the instant matter should have taken the matter more seriously

and acted accordingly.

The counsel appearing for the second accused respondent further stated that

the petitioner had not,

1) averred exceptional circumstances 2) has not exercised the right of appeal 3) had not complied with Rule 3(1)B of the Court of Appeal Rules 1990 and

Rule 46 of the Supreme Court Rules , as such the instant application should be dismissed in limine.

On considering the submissions of both parties it is very settled law that when

a party files a revision application, the party filing the same must plead the

exceptional circumstances.

It is so said in Darmarathne and another v Palm paradise Cabana Ltd and

others 2003 3SLRpage 24and in many other cases.

In the instant matter, this Court observes that counsel for the petitioner did not

aver exceptional circumstances per say but she brought to the notice of this

Page 5 of 6

Court the inadequacy of the sentence imposed by the High Court judge in

respect of the previous conviction of the second accused respondent.

Therefore, this Court has to decide whether it is exceptional enough to shock

the conscious of this Court. According to the submissions of both parties, the

second accused respondent had been sentenced to death but on appeal and

had been indicted in the High Court of Avissawella for a charge of Section 315

of the Penal Code which sets out a sentence of imprisonment of either

description for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with

both. In the instant matter, the High Court judge had imposed an imprisonment

and fine and it is a sentence which is entirely within the law. Thereafter he had

proceeded to consider the previous convictions of the accused respondents and

have acted under Section 303 (13) (iv) of the Criminal Procedure Code which

says make no order with respect to the suspended sentence, and may in

addition, impose a fine not exceeding twenty-five thousand rupees on such

person.

But the sentence and the fine imposed for the previous conviction of the

second accused respondent is within the framework of Section 303(13) (iv) of

the Criminal Procedure Code. Therefore, there is no illegality in the said

sentence, but of course there are certain guidelines which have been laid

down under Section 303(1) (a) to (l) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code

which are not imperative on the judge but is discretionary. Therefore, as there

is no illegality but only exercising the discretion laid down under Section

303(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, this Court sees no exceptionality

which amounts to an illegality to exercise the powers of revision of this Court.

This Court also takes into consideration the principles laid down in AG v

Walgama Kodithuwakkuge decided on 05.08.2014 CA 306/2012 in which

Page 6 of 6

another division of this bench has decided that the Court has the discretion

to impose a suspended sentence.., if a trial judge wishes to impose a

suspended sentence reasons to be stated in writing and the judgment refers

to a quote of his Lordship BasnayakeA.C.J which says in determining the

proper sentence, a judge should look at both sides of the picture

In the case of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka vSamantha Kumara

Pandithase and others decided on 13.06.2016 CA (PHC) APN 35/2015 which

says Section 303 (1) of Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 as

amended by Act No.47 of 1999 requires the learned judges to record the

reasons for proceeding to suspend the sentences imposed.

In the instant matter the trial judge has recorded his reasons for acting under

Section 303 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Hence, this Court sees no exceptional reason to allow instant application for

revision. As such the Order dated 05.01.2017 is affirmed and the instant

application for revision is dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree
