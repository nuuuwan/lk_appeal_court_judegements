Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner was elected a member of the Katana Pradeshiya Sabha in the Gampaha

District at the Local Government Elections held in 2018 and later was elected as the

Chairman of the said Pradeshiya Sabha by its members. The Petitioner was required to

submit a budget for the succeeding year i.e., year 2022 (budget), in terms of the

Pradeshiya Sabhas Act No. 15 of 1987, as amended (the Act). The issues emanating in

this application revolves around the said budget.

The Petitioner seeks, inter alia, for orders in the nature of writs compelling 1st to 7th

Respondents to accept and acknowledge the alleged fact that the budget submitted by the

Petitioner for Katana Pradeshiya Sabha (Pradeshiya Sabha) has been duly passed at the

special meeting held on 15.12.2021. Furthermore, the Petitioner seeks orders preventing

the 1st to 7th Respondents from deeming that the Petitioner has resigned from office as the

Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha in terms of the proviso to section 169 of the Act.

The sequence of salient events relevant to this application

The sequence of relevant events derived from the pleadings are laid down in the following

manner due to the special circumstances of this case.

Date Events

22.10.2020 Western Provincial Council & 1st Respondent promulgated rules

relating to procedure for the conduct of business at meetings of the

Pradeshiya Sabha marked P2 (Rules)

09.09.2021 The 6th Respondent Secretary of the Pradeshiya Sabha by way of a

notice informed the Pradeshiya Sabha to forward proposals regarding

the budget on or before 25.09.2021.

05.11.2021 The Petitioner summoned a meeting of the joint Committee of the

Pradeshiya Sabha to discuss the matters relating to the draft budget.

09.11.2021 A meeting of the Finance and Policy Planning Committee of the

Pradeshiya Sabha was summoned to obtain their recommendations for

the budget.

10.12.2021 A notice was circulated to summon a meeting to be held on 15.12.2021

in order to adopt the budget for the year 2022.

15.12.2021 Special meeting of the Pradeshiya Sabha was held.

Page 8 of 19

The 9th, 16th, 26th, 27th and 36th Respondent members proposed several

amendments to the said budget. The Petitioner agreed to such

amendments.

A vote was taken. 17 members voted for and 25 voted against the

budget.

16.12.2021 The Petitioner informed the 1st Respondent that there was no basis to

reject the budget as the Petitioner had accepted the amendments

proposed. (Vide - P5)

22.12.2021 The 3rd Respondent informed the 1st Respondent through the 2nd

Respondent that there is a necessity to advice the Council as to whether

the budget should be re-submitted in a situation where the Chairman

has accepted the amendments and however, it had not been passed by

the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha (Members). (Vide - P6)

23.12.2021 The 2nd Respondent by letter marked P7 has communicated the 1st

Respondents opinion, that in terms of section 168 & 169 of the Act read

together with section 17 of Local Government Special Provisions Act

No. 21 of 2012 and also in terms of the said Rules, the Council should

take a decision in respect of the budget.

The concise argument of the Petitioner.

i. The 1st to 6th Respondents appears to be acting under a misapprehension with

regard to the provisions of the Meeting Rules marked P2 and the provisions of

proviso to section 169 of the Act.

ii. In terms of the said Rules and in conjunction with the provisions of section 169 of

the Act, the budget of the Pradeshiya Sabha is deemed to be duly adopted

irrespective of the fact whether it has been approved or not by its Members.

iii. The statue only requires the Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha to consider and agree

to any amendment or modification proposed by the Members; Further, since the

Petitioner has accepted the amendments proposed, there is no requirement for

further consideration of the budget.

iv. The Rules provide that if a Pradeshiya Sabha is to reject any item in a budget then

an alternative has to be proposed; Therefore, the consideration of budget of a

Pradeshiya Sabha does not in any manner has the nature and tenor of a no

confidence motion against its Chairman.

Page 9 of 19

v. The Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha is required to resubmit the budget for

further consideration only when the Chairman rejects modification or additions

proposed by the Members.

vi. The deeming provision in the proviso to section 169 to the Act will be triggered

only in the event the Chairman does not agree to any modifications or amendments

proposed by the members.

vii. As the Petitioner has accepted all the amendments proposed to the budget in the

first instance at the meeting held on 15th December 2021, the said deeming

provision does not apply to the instant matter and therefore, the Petitioner will not

be deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman;

viii. When there is no alternative proposal by the Members, the Petitioner cannot be

deemed to have resigned from his post.

ix. The Petitioner has accepted and agreed to all amendments and additions proposed

by the Council and accordingly, he should not be penalized when he has not

disregarded the amendments or modifications proposed by the Members;

x. As such, the relevant statutory provisions considered in conjunction with the Rules

promulgated by the Gazette Notification marked P2 clearly establishes the fact

that the provisions of the proviso to section 169 of the Act cannot be applied to the

Petitioner;

The contention of the Respondents

The learned Counsel who represented several Respondents strenuously argued that, the

questions relating to this application have already been resolved by his Lordship Justice

Arjuna Obeyesekere with the agreement of his Lordship Justice Mayadunne Corea in 4

separate cases of this Court, i.e., CA/Writ/24/2021, CA/Writ/51/2021, CA/Writ/

57/2021 and CA/Writ/61/2021.Accordingly, Respondents moved that this application

be dismissed in limine.

In the circumstances, it is necessary to ascertain whether the Petitioner has submitted a

case which is suitable for full investigation and a hearing after issuing notice on all the

Respondents. In the backdrop of the above orders made by this Court and upon the

circumstances, the Court should be satisfied that there is a prima facie case that ought to

be resolved after full argument.

Page 10 of 19

The arguments advanced by the Senior State Counsel (SSC)

In response to the contentions of the Petitioner, the learned SSC appearing for the 1st to 4th

Respondents submitted that it is necessary to be familiar with the three alternative

situations, as mentioned below, which will follow the submission of a budget to the Local

Authority by a Chairman;

i.

A. The budget is adopted by the majority

B. The budget is defeated and in defeating the budget the Council will make

certain counter proposals for the Chairmans budget. The counter proposals

may take the form of a modification, rejection or additions to the budget.

C. The budget is defeated and no counter proposals are presented.

ii. In the case of A, there is absolutely no controversy as the budget has been passed,

in case of B, i.e., where counter proposals are made, the Chairman will have to

decide whether he agrees or disagrees with the counter proposals and in the case of

C, i.e., where in defeating the budget no counter proposals are made, the question

of agreement or disagreement does not logically arise (as there is nothing to agree

or disagree with)

The Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha has absolute autonomy over the budget for the first

two years of the tenure of the Local authority, but from the third year the position changes

and therefore, the learned SSC submits that the applicable provision in the instant

application is the proviso to section 169 as the first two years have lapsed since the

commencement of the term of the office of the Council.

The learned SSC rejecting the arguments of the Petitioner that there is no requirement to

re-submit the budget upon its defeat, asserts that the Chairman is required to re-submit a

budget for the approval of the Members when the same has been defeated. According to

the learned SSC, the concept of a budget being deemed to have been passed cannot be

accepted and in every case the budget has to be actually passed and if the Chairman does

not take steps to submit an alternative budget, the Chairman be deemed to have resigned.

Previous orders of this Court on the issue

The following reasoning and the conclusions of His Lordship Justice Obeyesekere in

Manodara Aacharige Chaminda Sugath vs. Anuradha Yahampath, Governor, Eastern

Province & others (CA/Writ/51/2021 decided on 10.06.2021) are very much relevant

Page 11 of 19

to the circumstances of this case, although the sections referred to are from the Urban

Council Ordinance;

The ability of the Council to carry out its statutory functions in the following year is

intrinsically linked to having a budget duly passed by the members of the Council, and

demonstrates the ability of the Chairman to command the confidence of the majority of the

Council and have the necessary finances to attend to the day to day operations and the vital

developmental activities of the Council.

.As submitted by the learned Senior State Counsel for the 1st Respondent and the learned

Counsel for the 7th - 17th Respondents, the Petitioner has thrown all democratic norms out

of the window.

Once the budget is submitted to the Council and debated and whatever the modifications or

additions that a Chairman may agree during or after such debate, the budget must be

submitted by the Chairman to the Council for its decision. This is mandatory and is

confirmed by the use of the word, decision in the proviso to Section 178A. In terms of Section

26(2), a decision would mean a vote. I am therefore of the view that the Chairman agreeing

to any modifications or additions that may be proposed by one or more or even all members

does not suffice in order to claim that the budget has been passed. The claim that the

Chairman agreed with the modifications and amendments and therefore the budget has been

passed is a red herring. The budget must be passed by a majority vote if the Chairman wishes

to avoid the deemed resignation being triggered.

In my view, the crux of the matter is that the Chairman must ensure that he has in place a

budget duly passed by the Council by the due date. If he fails in this regard at whatever point

of the process, he is deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman by operation of law.

A Chairman who does not take a vote cannot be in a better position than a Chairman who

has resubmitted the budget and taken a vote, only to have the budget defeated by the Council.

His Lordship Justice Obeyesekere has taken a similar viewpoint in Wellawattage Sarath

Peiris vs. Katunayake Seeduwa Urban Council, Seeduwa & others (CA/Writ/24/2021

decided on 10.06.2021), H.M. Lalantha Sumith Seneviratne vs. Pradeshiya Sabhawa

of Padiyathalawa & others (CA/Writ/57/2021 decided on 10.06.2021) and A.P.

Ranasinghe Bandara, Chairman vs. Anuradha Yahampath, Governor of Eastern

Province & others (CA/Writ/61/2021 decided on 10.06.2021).

Page 12 of 19

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the above four cases of

this Court, discussed above, should be distinguished from the instant application on the

below mentioned grounds;

i. the facts of the cases bearing No. CA/Writ/57/2021 and CA/Writ/24/2021 show

that the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha & Urban Council respectively has not

assented to the amendments proposed to the budget and incorporated same to the

proposed budget. Further, in the said cases the presentation and/or modification

and/or amendment and/or rejection of a budget is not governed by the Rules

marked P2;

ii. the presentation and/or modification and/or amendment and/or rejection of a

budget, in the applications bearing No. CA/Writ/61/2021 and CA/Writ/51/2021

is not governed by Rules marked P2

Accordingly, the learned Presidents Counsel argued that;

a. the proviso to section 169 of the Act must be read in conjunction with the main

part of section 169;

b. the plain reading of the main part of section 169 clearly sets out that a budget for a

Pradeshiya Sabha is deemed to be the budget of that Council irrespective of the fact

whether it is adopted or not by a majority of the Council.

Submissions on behalf of the 7th, 8th, 10th to 15th, 17th, 18th and 20th to 24th Respondents. The submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the above Respondents in a

nutshell is that the Petitioner has not re-submitted the budget to stand the test of vote to

ascertain whether the majority support the budget and to see whether he has the

confidence of the Council.

The learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the reasons or motivations as to why a

Council or a majority would defeat a budget is not a matter which can be in the epi-center

of the inquiry before this Court in as much as the law does not admit of the vagaries of

these motivations or the vicissitudes of time and man. He further submitted that the law

and the statue book only looks in to the legal and the related factual question whether a

Chairman failed to comply with the provisions stipulated in the proviso to section 169 of

the Act.

Page 13 of 19

He further submitted that in an instance where a Chairman of an Urban Council submits

a budget or a supplementary budget under section 169 of the Act after a period of two

years from the commencement of the period of the office of the Council and then in an

event of the Council rejecting the budget in its entirety or part thereof and if the Chairman

then fails to have it duly passed within the stipulated time period, the Chairman of the

Pradeshiya Sabha, by operation of the law, will be deemed to have resigned from the

office.

Rules.

The Petitioner relies upon Rules 23 to 26 of P2 which has been promulgated by the

Western Provincial Council and the 1st Respondent-Governor and submits that he has

complied with all the provisions of those Rules and the Court of Appeal has not referred

to or taken in to consideration such Rules at the time of issuing the orders in the aforesaid

four cases.

In response to the Petitioners contentions on Rules, the Respondents intimate that

CA/Writ/24/2021 relates to the Katunayake Seeduwa Prasdeshiya Sabha which is more

or less similar to Katana Prasdeshiya Sabha since both are situated in the Western

Province.

It is well observed that the Rules marked P2 have been enforced to regularize the

procedure for conducting business at meetings of Pradeshiya Sabha and to repeal Rules of

1998. Therefore, the Rules 23 to 26 described under the sub-heading Council approval

relating to Budget documents are nothing more than the procedure and such procedure

cannot possibly outweigh the relevant written law specifically mentioned in section 168

and section 169 of the Act. In Rule 28, the procedure in relation to voting and recording

of votes has been laid down and particularly prescribed how to conduct the voting when

the Pradeshiya Sabha expresses its consent or when a member calls for a division.

The scope of section 168 & 169 of the Act

The important question in this case is whether the Petitioner is entitled to declare the

budget which was defeated by a majority as duly adopted under section 169 of the Act

based on the alleged reason that he had accepted the amendments proposed by Members.

Further, it is essential to examine whether the Petitioner is deemed to have resigned from

the office of Chairman when he has failed to re-submit the budget for a vote.

Page 14 of 19

His Lordship Justice Obeyesekere has exhaustively addressed questions similar to the

instant application in A.P. Ranasinghe Bandara, Chairman vs. Anuradha Yahampath,

Governor of Eastern Province & others (CA/Writ/61/2021 decided on 10.06.2021),

where His Lordship has stated as follows;

The effect of Section 169 is that by operation of law, the budget submitted by the Chairman

shall be considered as the duly adopted budget of a Pradeshiya Sabha, even though the said

budget has not been passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha and therefore does not have the support

of the majority of the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha. The law therefore has provided a

concession to a Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha to function for a period of two years,

notwithstanding that he may not have the support of the majority of the Pradeshiya Sabha

to pass the budget. It must be kept in mind that notwithstanding the above deeming

provision, the obligation placed on the Chairman by Section 168 to submit the

budget to the Pradeshiya Sabha must still be complied with, and that the

concession under Section 169 extends only to a Chairman who submits a budget

to the Pradeshiya Sabha and permits the members to vote on the said budget.

(at page 5)

Thus, with the introduction of the proviso in 2012, the concession provided to a Chairman

by Section 169 to continue in office notwithstanding his inability to have the budget passed

by a majority of the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha has been limited to the first two

years of office. After the first two years, it is not only imperative that the budget is submitted

to the Pradeshiya Sabha, it is also imperative that the budget is passed by a majority

decision.

In my view, Section 169 and the proviso contemplates two decisions of the Pradeshiya Sabha which

attracts the provisions of Section 14 and therefore requires a vote by the Pradeshiya Sabha. The first

is the decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha to modify, add or reject the budget. The acceptance of a

modification and/or an addition, or the rejection of the budget as a whole, should be by way of a

majority vote of the Pradeshiya Sabha. The second is the decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha whether

to pass the budget that has been re-submitted by the Chairman, which too must be taken by a vote of

the members present at the meeting. (Emphasis added)

The rationale of the decision of the Court in all the above cases in addition to the said

section 168 & 169, is mainly based on section 14(1) of the Act, which stipulates that;

Page 15 of 19

All matters or questions authorized by this Act or by any other written law to be decided by

a Pradeshiya Sabha shall be decided upon by the majority of members present at any meeting

of the Pradeshiya Sabha held in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

The crux of the dicta in all above four cases, as succinctly illustrated by His Lordship

Justice Obeysekere, is that a Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha must ensure that his budget

should be duly passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha with a majority vote, by the due date,

irrespective of the fact that the budget is being presented during the first two years of the

Council or after. If he fails in this regard at whatever point of the process set out in the

proviso to section 169, he shall be deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman

by operation of law.

One cannot distinguish the words adopted and passed embodied in section 169 of the

Act to circumvent the real effect of the said section. The Sinhala text of the section 168 (2)

is as follows:

, ,

,

. (Emphasis added)

Even though the English text of the section 168 (2) referred to word adopt as well as the

word passed, the Sinhala text of section 168 & 169 uses only one word and that is

. I am of the view that the said word is equivalent to the connotation

of the word pass which requires the majority votes of the Council. In terms of section

18 of the Local Government Special Provisions Act No. 21 of 2012 by which the proviso

to section 169 has been introduced stipulates that when there is an inconsistency between

the Sinhala and Tamil text of the Act, the Sinhala text shall prevail.

I am of the view that, the debating, the discussions and voting is a paramount feature in a

democratic representative body such as the Pradeshiya Sabha. The Parliament of Sri

Lanka is the apex body of all representative bodies and it is the sovereign legislature in the

country. The Provincial Councils introduced by the 13th Amendment to the Constitution

also exercise limited legislative powers. After the Central Government and Provincial

Councils, the Local Government bodies are the third tier of the Government of Sri Lanka.

Pradeshiya Sabha has been established by the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act No. 15 of 1987 and

Page 16 of 19

the Members of the Pradeshiya Sabha are elected under the provisions of Local Authorities

Elections Ordinance.

Dr. Subhash C. Kashyap, a Consultant in Constitutional law, in his book Anti-defection

law and Parliamentary Privileges, (Universal Law Publishing Co. Third Edition, p.

10), queries if votes are not going to be altered by speeches, what is the relevance or

rationale of parliamentary democracy and he further continues to state as follows;

Debates and discussions are expected to be and often are helpful in swaying the

voting pattern in legislatures. For example, the Indian Independence Bill, 1947 was

opposed by the Conservative Party of England. Since the Labour Government had a big

majority, the Bill passed through all the stages in the Commons easily. But in the House of

Lords, there was Conservative majority. The Conservatives could have defeated the Bill, it

was, however, Conservative Lord Halifaxs speech that changed the mood of the Lords and

the Bill was passed. In India itself, story is told how Jawaharlal Nehru tried to defend the

provisions of a Bill he was himself piloting and at the end remarked that the majority in the

House was with him on that issue. C. Rajagopalachari who was known for his sharp wit,

demolished all of Nehrus arguments and concluded by saying that on that day majority

might be with Nehru but logic was with hm. Nehru gracefully yielded and accepted

Rajagopalacharis view. Parliamentary democracy can have meaning, only if

debates are allowed to sway the voting pattern in the legislature.

It is also pertinent to note the Preamble of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act No. 15 of 1987

which reads;

An Act to provide for the establishment of Pradeshiya Sabhas with a view to provide greater

opportunities for the people to participate effectively in decision making process relating to

administrative and development activities at a local level; to specify the powers, functions and

duties of such Sabhas; and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto

The above Preamble specifically reflects the representative political will of the

constituents. In other words, Members of the Pradeshiya Sabha represent their

constituents in the Pradeshiya Sabha and act as their agents. Accordingly, democracy and

the good governance eventually follow with the functioning of the Pradeshiya Sabhas.

That is the rationale behind the provisions of the Section 14(1) of the Act. Therefore, I am

of the view that taking a vote in the house of the Pradeshiya Sabha is merely to protect the

said democracy and good governance and as a whole the rule of law of the country.

Page 17 of 19

In the circumstances, I take the view that the deeming provision should be carefully

interpreted in the above lines of the basic principles of democracy and good governance

without curtailing the consent or the division of the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

On a careful examination of the provisions of section 169 of the Act emanates that the

proviso to the section (introduced by Section 17 of the Local Authorities [Special

Provisions] Act No. 21 of 2012) is limited to the period after two years since the

commencement of the term of office of the Council. Both the proviso as well as the 1st

portion of the section 169 stipulates the words is not passed & has not been passed

and that implies the peremptory requirement of submitting the budget for the vote of the

members irrespective of the fact that the budget us being presented during the first two

years of the Council or after.

Petitioners contention is that the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha is required to re-

submit the budget for further consideration only when the Chairman rejects modification

or addition purported by the Members. However, in line with the precedent set in the

aforementioned cases, it is a mandatory duty of the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha to

submit the budget for a vote although he accepts modifications or additions and further, it

is mandatory for him to re-submit the budget in the event it is defeated at the first

submission.

No question arises, if the budget is passed at the first instance. If it is defeated, the deeming

provisions in the proviso to section 169 will come in to limelight after the first two years,

when the budget is defeated or when it is not submitted for a vote irrespective of the fact

that the Chairman has accepted the amendments. This is because the proviso to section

169 is also subjected to mandatory provisions laid down in section 168 (2) as discussed in

above case CA/Writ/61/2021. Another important ingredient to give due effect to the

proviso of section 169 and 1st portion of the said section is the stipulated time period i.e.,

two weeks. In this regard it is very much important to draw attention to the following

paragraphs in the said CA/Writ/61/2021 (at pages 7 & 8);

e) In the first two years however, even if the budget is not passed, by operation of law, the

budget submitted by the Chairman is the duly adopted budget of the Pradeshiya Sabha

vide Section 169;

f) After the first two years, the Chairman must have the budget passed by the Pradeshiya

Sabha, for which he has been provided two opportunities vide the proviso to Section

169;

g) After the first two years, the failure on the part of the Chairman to have the budget passed

on either of the two occasions afforded to him would attract the consequences set out in

the proviso to Section 169 i.e., the Chairman is deemed to have resigned from office.

Relief

The Petitioner has prayed for in the prayer of the Petition, inter alia, for an order in the

nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions contained in the document marked

P7.

By letter dated 16.12.2021 marked P5, the Petitioner has informed the 1st Respondent

that when he had acted in compliance with Rules 23 to 26 of P2, no party is entitled to

declare that the budget has not been duly passed. Moreover, by P5 he requests the 1st

Respondent to consider the budget as been duly passed. In response to the said letter P5,

the 2nd Respondent has communicated the decision of the 1st Respondent to the Petitioner

as follows;

1987 15 168 , 169

2012 21 ( ) 17

2022

.

Accordingly, the 1st Respondent-Governor has opined that the affairs relating to the budget

should be decided by the Council in compliance with the provisions of the sections 168 &

169 of the Act.

In view of the foregoing, I am of the view that the 1st Respondent Governor has given due

effect to the provisions of sections 14, 168 and 169 of the Act and lawfully decided that

the matters pertaining to the budget should be decided by the Council.

Irrespective of the fact whether the Petitioner in the instant case has accepted the

amendments and modifications, he has failed to secure the majority votes in favour of the

budget on 15.12.2021. The budget was defeated on 15.12.2021, and that was during period

after 2 years since the commencement of the term of office of the Council and accordingly,

in my view, the Petitioner has failed to adhere to a cardinal requirement of re-submitting

the budget after the defeat. It is necessary to draw my attention to Rule No. 12 of P2

which deals with the mandatory provisions how the business of the Pradeshiya Sabha shall

be transacted. In view of Rule 12(a), the confirmation of minutes of previous meeting is

Page 19 of 19

mandatory and however, no evidence has been made available to show that the said step

has been duly followed by the Pradeshiya Sabha.

For the aforementioned reasons, I have no ground to disagree with the legal analysis

established in those four cases, discussed above, pertaining to the issue of the Chairman

of a Pradeshiya Sabha deeming to have resigned from the office of Chairman.

I am mindful of Basnayake CJ.s statement on the cursus curiae that developed over the

years in this country. He has observed in Bandahamy vs. Senanayake 62 NLR 313 (p.345)

as follows;

Two Judges sitting together also as a rule follow the decisions of two Judges. Where two

Judges sitting together find themselves unable to follow a decision of two Judges, the practice

in such cases is also to reserve the case for the decision of a fuller bench, although the Courts

Ordinance does not make express provision in that behalf as in case of a single Judge.

In the circumstances, I take the view that the questions raised by the Petitioner in the

instant application have been resolved in the above orders of this Court by which those

cases had been dismissed at the threshold stage itself. Therefore, based on the arguability

principles that should be adopted in respect of matters relating to issuance of notice in a

juridical review application, I arrive at the conclusion that there is no arguable case for

this Court to issue formal notice on the Respondents in this application. Therefore, I refuse

this application.
