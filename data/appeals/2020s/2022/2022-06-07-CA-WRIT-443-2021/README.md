Decided on : 07.06.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner owns and has been residing at the land depicted in Plan No. 5/1984

marked P1(a) as Lot 2, for approximately 19 years with his family. Around December

2017, the 7th Respondent Vesta Homes Pvt Ltd (Vesta Homes) commenced

constructing a condominium apartment complex at No.4, Beach Road, Mount Lavinia,

which is the land on the western boundary of the Petitioner's land. The original building

plan for the proposed construction was approved by the Urban Development Authority

(UDA) on 16.11.2017.

The Petitioner learned of the proposed construction of a transformer room for the

installation of an electric transformer on location 'A' (as depicted in the sketch marked

P7), which is 0.5 feet away from the Petitioner's boundary wall. Therefore, the

Petitioner complained to the Mount Lavinia Police and the Ceylon Electricity Board

(CEB) objecting the proposed construction due to the purported threat posed to the

Petitioner's family and property. The Divisional Secretariat then conducted a field

inspection with the participation of the CEB on 25.02.2021 resulting in Vesta Homes

agreeing to install the electricity transformer at an alternate location. The Divisional

Secretary thus wrote the letter dated 08.03.2021 to the CEB recommending the

installation of the electricity transformer at the alternate location 'B' (as depicted in the

sketch marked P7), which was agreed upon by Vesta Homes.

However, location 'B' contravened the Urban Development Authorities Regulation

37(1)c, for being a proposed construction which was within the boundary line.

Therefore, the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Municipal Council and UDA did not grant

approval for the installation of the electricity transformer at the proposed location 'B'.

Moreover, the Divisional Secretary by the letter dated 19.05.2017 requested the CEB to

consider an alternative location for the installation of the electricity transformer. Further,

on 05.07.2021, the Divisional Secretary informed the CEB by the letter marked P9 to

consider and take necessary steps to install the electricity transformer at a suitable

location, which the Divisional Secretariat did not have the necessary technical

knowledge to determine.

On the first date of support of the instant application, it was submitted on behalf of the

Respondents that the transformer room has been proposed to be constructed at the new

location 'C' (as depicted in the sketch marked 1R1), which is 2 feet away from the

Petitioner's boundary wall, maintaining a distance of 9.5 feet between the electricity

transformer and the Petitioner's boundary wall. Though the proposed location 'C' was

recommended by the CEB and approved by the UDA, the Petitioner asserts that the

location 'C' proposes building the transformer room on the originally objected location

'A' with a slight change in dimensions.

The Petitioner objected to the CEB on 12.08.2021 against the construction of the

transformer room and the installation of the electricity transformer, requesting it to be

installed beyond 10 meters from his residence. The said objection was also forwarded to

the Chairman of the UDA, the Chairman of the Condominium Management Authority

and the Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission. As a result, the CEB informed the

Divisional Secretary of the Petitioner's objection, requesting the Divisional Secretary to

conduct a field inspection and submit her recommendations on 19.08.2021. Further, on

30.08.2021, the CEB informed Vesta Homes that the installation of the electricity

transformer has been suspended until the receipt of the Divisional Secretariat's

recommendations. However, the Divisional Secretary by her letter marked P13,

referred to her letter dated 05.07.2021 marked P9 and informed the CEB that it is the

CEB that possesses the necessary technical knowledge to make such recommendation

thus, the CEB may take the appropriate steps in that regard. Accordingly, the CEB now

recommends the installation of the electricity transformer at location 'C'.

The Petitioner in the instant application seeks for a Writ of Certiorari quashing the

decision of the 5th Respondent granting approval for Vesta Homes to install the electricity

transformer at location 'A'. The Planning and Building Regulations 2008-2020 (marked

R23) of the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Municipal Council Area in Regulation 10(b)xi of

Part I provides:

10. A plan of any land submission, land development or building or building

works submitted under the Law shall, include following details

recommended columns and symbol.

(b) A floor plan of each storey and flat roof of the building containing or showing-

xi. the position of parking bays, ramps, landings, standby generators, electrical

transformers, security huts etc. and in the case of building categories of

intermediate rise and above, it shall be provided with a space for LP Gas

central distribution point.

Thus, it is mandatory to identify the location proposed for the installation of an

electricity transformer in a building plan, and no such location was identified by Vesta

Homes in the building plan marked P22. In the above circumstances, I am of the view

that not including the location of the electricity transformer in P22 and including the

location after the 5th Respondent approved P22 is unlawful and accordingly, the

approval granted in favour of P22 is irregular. In the circumstances, I issue a writ of

certiorari as prayed for in Prayer (f) of the Petition of the Petitioner.

Now I advert to the events that transpired at the hearing of this Application. The CEB

now recommends the installation of the electricity transformer at location 'C' of the

sketch marked 1R1 and the Respondents, particularly Vesta Homes (7th Respondent),

submit that a distance of 9 feet will be maintained between the Petitioner's boundary wall

and the edge of the electricity transformer. The amended building plan

No.03/CO/DMMC/BA/49/17 marked 5R1 was authorized by the UDA by the

building permit issued on 28.03.2022 marked 5R2. The said amended building plan

(which was issued after filing this Application) provides for a fully insulated transformer

room with 27cm thick walls to be built at location 'C'. However, in light of the

Petitioner's objection, Vesta Homes has agreed, in open court, to increase the thickness

of the eastern wall of the transformer room from 1 foot to 1 feet. The court makes an

Page 6 of 6

observation that if the Respondents do not follow the said amended building plan and

not fulfill the assurance in respect of the thickness of the wall, a prejudice would be

caused to the Petitioner. In view of the assurance given by the Respondent in open court

there is no need to consider issuance of a writ of mandamus as prayed for in the prayer

of the Petition.

Application is partly allowed.
