Judgment

The Officer-in-Charge of Police Station Katugastota filed an information on the 30.03.2014 in

terms of Section 66 (1) (a) of Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 in the Magistrates

Court of Kandy, pertaining to a dispute on the possession of premises No. 359 in Navayalatenne

Katugastota between Party of the 1st Party-1st Respondent and Party of the 2nd Part-2nd Respondent

under case bearing No. 72264.

It appears that Tennakoon Mudiyanselage Anura Gunathilake has been subsequently added as the

2nd Party-2nd Respondent. After following the procedure stipulated in Part VII of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act the case had been taken up for inquiry. Consequently, parties have filed

their respective affidavits, counter affidavits and documents.

After, the conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge

delivered the Order on 29.09.2014 concluding that Party to the 1st Part-1st Respondent had failed

to satisfy Court that he has been forcibly dispossessed within a period of 2 months immediately

before the date on which the information was filed.

Furthermore, since the learned Magistrate has not been satisfied with the evidence placed before

Court by 1st Party and 2nd Party-Respondents in respect of their claims of possession to the disputed

Page 4 of 9

premises, the learned Magistrate had decided that he is unable to make a determination in terms of

Section 68(1) of the said Act. Moreover, the learned Magistrate, having observed the dispute is

already before the District Court of Kandy, rejected the claims of both parties and advised them to

resolve the dispute through a competent Court and warned them to maintain peace.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, Party of the 1st Part-Respondent-

Petitioner has invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Kandy in case

bearing No. 100/14. The said application was heard by learned High Court Judge and the learned

High Court Judge had concluded that theres no error of Law or facts fit enough to revise the order

of the learned Magistrate and had dismissed the said revision application.

Having been dissatisfied with the determination of the learned High Court Judge, the Party to the

1st Part-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has preferred

this appeal seeking to set aside the orders made by the learned Magistrate dated 24.09.2014 and

the learned High Court Judge by his order dated 06.03.2017.

It was the contention of the Appellant that the orders made by learned Primary Court Judge and

Judge of the Provincial High Court do not comply with Section 66 and 68 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act. Since the learned Primary Court Judge has opted to make a determination under

Section 68 of the said Act, the failure to make such a determination amounts to a miscarriage of

Justice.

The Appellant had contended that the learned Magistrate should have considered the title to the

premises in dispute in his favour. The Party to the 2nd Part -1st Respondent-Respondent and added

Party-2nd Respondent-Respondent had taken up the position that learned Magistrate has not

misdirected himself in concluding he is not satisfied of the fact that Appellant has been

dispossessed from the property within 2 months prior to the filing of the information.

Subsections (1) and (3) of Section 68 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act state as follows;

1) Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part thereof it shall be the duty

of the Judge of Primary Court holding the inquiry to determine as to who was in possession

Page 5 of 9

of the land or the part on the date of filing of the information under Section 66 and make

order as to who is entitled to possession of such land or part thereof.

(3) Where at an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right to the possession of any land or any

part of a land the Judge of the Primary Court is satisfied that any person who had been in

possession of the land or part has been forcibly dispossessed within a period of two months

immediately before the date on which the information was filed under Section 66, he may make

a determination to that effect and make an order directing the party dispossessed be restored to

possession and prohibiting all disturbance of such possession otherwise than under the

authority of an order or decree of a competent Court.

Accordingly, the main issue for the determination under Section 68(1) is, as to who was in

possession of the land or part thereof on the date of filing the information under Section 66.

However, when there is an allegation of a forcible dispossession, the Court can act under Section

68(3) and make a determination as to whether such dispossession has been affected within two

months prior to filing of the information.

It was the contention of the Respondents that the Appellants claim is entirely based on forcible

dispossession. It is apparent that in such circumstances, Section 68(3) of the Act applies and

therefore, the learned Magistrate has quite correctly proceeded to inquire whether requisites of

Section 68(3) have been met.

It was submitted on behalf of Respondents that it is settled law that Section 68(3) becomes

applicable only if the Judge of the Primary Court can come to a definite finding that some other

party had been forcibly dispossessed within a period of 2 months immediately before the date on

which the information was filed under Section 66 of the Act (Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah 1982

2SLR 693). This position has been cited in many recent Judgments such as Ranjith Mervyn

Ponnamperuma Vs. Warahena Liayanage Viraj Pradeep Kumara De Alwis and Others CA

PHC/71/2008, decided on 12.06.2020.

According to Section 68(3), satisfying himself (by the Judge) of such forcible dispossession within

the said time period is a necessary and mandatory pre-requisite when making a determination to

Page 6 of 9

that effect. It is only if such a determination could be made, the Judge of the Primary Court is

empowered to make an order of restoration of possession. In other words, the Section bears no

ambiguity, hence if the Judge of the Primary Court is not satisfied that there has been such forcible

dispossession within two months of the filing of information, he is neither expected to make a

determination, nor a subsequent order of restoration of possession.

According to Section 68(3) of the Act, it emphasizes on the need for a Judge to satisfy with

elements of a forcible dispossession. Since the Primary Court Judge is empowered to make an

order of restoration of possession, it could be made only after a determination of forcible

dispossession.

It was further submitted by the Respondents that the learned Magistrate has analyzed and evaluated

the evidence placed before him by both parties and has concluded stating the learned Magistrate

has not been satisfied of the Appellant being forcibly dispossessed within the relevant period.

Thus, learned Magistrate decided not to make any determination in terms of Section 68(3).

Therefore, the learned Magistrate refraining from making a determination in terms of Section 68(3)

bears no illegality or irregularity.

Be that as it may, in terms of Section 68(1) of the Act, it is a duty of the learned Primary Court

Judge to determine as to who was in possession of the premises in dispute.

In terms of Section 72 of the Act,

A determination and order under this part shall be made after examination and consideration of

(a) the information filed and the affidavits and documents furnished;

(b) such other evidence on any matter arising on the affidavits or documents furnished as the

court may permit to be led on that matter; and

(c) such oral or written submission as may be permitted by the Judge of the Primary Court in his

discretion.

It is to be noted that the affidavit dated 19.05.2014 filed by the 2nd Party-2nd Respondent (Added

Respondent ) states in paragraph 3;

Page 7 of 9

03.

.

Thus, the added Party-2nd Respondent-Respondent affirmed that the Party to the 2nd Part-1st

Respondent-Respondent was in possession of the disputed premises on the relevant date.

However, the 2nd Party-1st Respondent-Respondent in his affidavit dated 19.05.2014 and counter

affidavit dated 23.06.2014 had not claimed the possession of the disputed premises, instead had

prayed to have it declared that the added 2nd Party-2nd Respondent is entitled to the possession of

the premises in dispute.

The Court observes that the 2nd Party-1st Respondent-Respondent had vaguely stated in his

affidavit dated 19.05.2014, in paragraph 4 that he possessed the premises on behalf of the added

2nd Party-2nd Respondent in his absence.

It is relevant to note the complainant made on 25.02.2014 to the Police Station Katugastota by

the Appellant, which states;

. . 58 / . .. 44/1,

..: 550173174V. .

. 359 ( .)

. .

. .

According to the said complaint, unknown person had entered the premises No. 359,

Navayalatenne and had parked few vehicles in the said premises.

Page 8 of 9

On 27.02.2014, P.C Kumarasinghe had gone to investigate the said premises No. 359

Navayalatenne and had recorded a statement from the 2nd Party-1st Respondent-Respondent,

Malwalage Thushara Pieris.

.

According to the said statement, it is pertinent to note that the 2nd Party-1st Respondent was in

possession of the premises No. 359 Navayalatenne, the disputed premise, on 27.02.2014. It was

further established by the observation notes of the investigating officer, which states;

. .

. . . . .

. .

In view of the statement of the 2nd Party-1st Respondent-Respondent and the investigating officers

observation notes, it is observed that not only the 2nd Party-1st Respondent-Respondent but also

the wife of the added Party-2nd Respondent was in possession of the premises in dispute on

27.02.2014.

Furthermore, the said Vajira Bogahawatta is not a party to the instant action and the possession of

the added 2nd Party-2nd Respondent has not been established.

Page 9 of 9

Since, the information was filed on 31.03.2014, it is apparent in terms of Section 68(1) of the Act,

that the 2nd Party-1st Respondent-Respondent was in possession of the premises in dispute as at the

date of filing of the information under Section 66 of the Act.

Therefore, the learned Magistrate has erred in law and facts by failing to determine the possession

of the 2nd Party-1st Respondent-Respondent and by not making any order in respect of the 2nd Party-

1st Respondents entitlement to the possession of the premises in dispute in terms of the provisions

of Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979.

In view of the foregoing reasons, I hold that the order of the learned Primary Court Judge is

erroneous. Since the learned High Court Judge has affirmed the said order of the learned Primary

Court Judge, I hold that the learned High Court Judge too was wrong. Thus, we set aside both

orders of the Primary Court as well as the High Court Judge.

Hence, I hold that the 2nd Party-1st Respondent-Respondent is entitled to the possession of the

premise bearing No. 359, Navayalatenne, in terms of Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

Therefore, we set aside the order dated 29.08.2014 made by the learned Magistrate and the order

dated 06.03.2017 by the learned High Court Judge and decide this appeal in favour of the Party of

the 2nd Part-1st Respondent-Respondent. No cost of appeal is awarded. Parties have to bear their

own costs.
