R. Gurusinghe, J.

The Accused was convicted in the High Court of Colombo for having committed

the offence of trespass, punishable under Section 433 of the Penal Code and

robbery, punishable under Section 383 of the Penal Code.

The appellant was sentenced to three months rigorous imprisonment for

trespass and three years rigorous imprisonment for robbery. A fine of Rs.

2500/- was imposed, and he was also ordered to pay Rs. 425,000/-, as

compensation.

The appellant does not contest the conviction. He only seeks to have a

reduction in the sentence that was imposed on him. Counsel for the appellant

submitted that the appellant deserves a suspended sentence.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent pointed out that at

least two conditions set out in Section 303 (1) a to Section 303(1) l of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act as amended by Act No. 47 of 1999 must be there to

impose the suspended sentence. Those conditions are as follows:

(a) the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence in respect of which

the sentence is imposed ;

(b) the nature and gravity of the offence ;

(c) the offenders culpability and degree of responsibility for the

offence ;

(d) the offenders previous character ;

(e) any injury, loss or damage resulting directly from the commission

of the offence ;

(f) the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor concerning the

offender ;

(g) the need to punish the offender to an extent and in a manner

which is just in all of the circumstances ;

(h) the need to deter the offender or other persons from committing

offences of the same or of a similar character ;

(i) the need to manifest the denunciation by the court of the type of

conduct in which the offender was engaged in ;

(j) the need to protect the victim or the community from the offender ;

4

(k) the fact that the person accused of the offence pleaded guilty to the

offence and such person is sincerely and truly repentant; or

(l) a combination of two or more of the above.

Having regard to the above-mentioned stipulated circumstances, I consider the

facts put forward for the appellant, seeking a reduction of sentence.

The offence was committed in 2004. The appellant had been in remand custody

for more than three years and the appellant did not have any previous

convictions. Counsel for the appellant also submitted that there were no

subsequent offences other than the offence for which he was convicted. The

appellant is married and he has two children. One daughter who is 17 years

old, is sitting for the exams.

The appellant is now on bail.

This case has constantly been worrying him for the last 18 years. As he had

not committed any subsequent offences, it could be considered that he had

reformed since then. He had been in remand custody for over a period of 3

years. In many jurisdictions, the time that is spent in custody prior to the trial

is taken into account when imposing a sentence. Example Section 428 of the

Code Of Criminal Procedure, India.

428. Period of detention undergone by the accused to be set off against

the sentence or imprisonment. Where an accused person has, on

conviction, been sentenced to imprisonment for a term, not being

imprisonment in default of payment of fine, the period of detention, if

any, undergone by him during the investigation, inquiry or trial of the

same case and before the date of such conviction, shall be set off against

the term of imprisonment imposed on him on such conviction, and the

liability of such person to undergo imprisonment on such conviction

5

shall be restricted to the remainder, any, of the term of imprisonment

imposed on him.

Section 24 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 of NSW is as follows:

24. In sentencing an offender, the court must take into account-

(a) any time for which the offender has been held in custody in

relation to the offence, and

I think that sending him to jail after 18 years of the offence, is not appropriate.

Having regard to the above circumstances, I set aside the sentence of three

years rigorous imprisonment and, therefor, substitute a sentence of two years

rigorous imprisonment on the accused-appellant, suspended from the date of

conviction for a period of seven years. The three months imprisonment is also

suspended for seven years from the date of conviction.

The fine and compensation imposed on the appellant remain the same.

Subject to this variation in the sentence, the appeal is dismissed.

I agree.
