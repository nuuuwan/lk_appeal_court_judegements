In that case, the Aitken Spence Travels (Pvt) Ltd provided travel related services to foreign tour operators who organised tours to tourists visiting Sri Lanka, and foreign tourists in Sri Lanka, and claimed a tax exemption under section 13 (dddd) of the Inland Revenue Act. The tax exemption was rejected by the Assessor and the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue on the basis that the services were provided to foreign tourists who are physically present in Sri Lanka. On appeal, the TAC allowed the appeal and held that that the services were rendered to foreign tour operators who are outside Sri Lanka within the meaning of the exemption in section 13 (dddd) of the Inland Revenue Act.",
