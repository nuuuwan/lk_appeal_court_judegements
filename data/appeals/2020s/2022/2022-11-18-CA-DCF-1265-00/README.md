K.K.A.V. SWARNADHIPATHI, J.

JUDGMENT

The Plaintiff-Respondent instituted a partition action under case No.441/P. at the District Court of

Marawila to partition the land described in the schedule to the Plaint.

Page 4 of 6

In the Plaint, he had named eleven Defendants 1st to 10th Defendants were his family members and

the 11th Defendant was an outsider. When the matter was taken up to trial, only the 11th Defendant

contested the pedigree of the Plaintiff. All parties to the action admitted the corpus.

Learned District Judge, in her judgment, held in favour of the Plaintiff. Aggrieved by judgment

dated 5.12.2000 11th Defendant Appealed, praying to set aside the judgment of the District Court

and to answer the points of contest raised on behalf of the 11th Defendant in the affirmative.

In this court, since the parties agreed to have the judgment on written submissions, dates were

given for each party to file their respective submissions.

On 16.06.2022, on behalf of the Appellant, moved for additional time and time was given to file

written submissions. Even though the Respondents filed their written submissions, the Appellant

failed to file his submissions. Therefore, the court decided to study the entire District Court case

and come to a conclusion.

The Plaintiff-Respondent had filed the partition case based on prescriptive rights. In such a case,

he must prove uninterrupted possession for over ten years.

Kuranage Joseph Fernando, father of the Plaintiff-Respondent, came into the occupation of the

land in 1944, and from that date, he had occupied with undisturbed and interrupted possession. By

the time he died in 1988, he had gained independent title and had transferred the property by Deed

No.1796, which was marked as "P1" to his wife, the 10th Defendant. This was duly registered in

the Land Registry.

She had gifted the property by Deed No.496, marked as "P2". "P2" was attested in February 1995.

From 1988 to 1995 it is about eight years. There is no mention of a civil case filed to cancel either

of the Deeds by the 11th Defendant-Appellant. Even in this case, he had not prayed for a prayer to

cancel those deeds. He had not led any evidence to prove that he had complained to any Police

Station regarding illegal transfers to institute criminal action.

The two cases filed by the 11th Defendant-Appellant were filed in 1975 and 1978. Even though the

11th Defendant-Appellant had got judgment in his favour, he had not succeeded in exercising the

judicial mechanism to oust the Plaintiff or 1st to 10th Defendant-Respondents.

If he was keen, he could have exercised his rights, prayed for relief from a court or filed contempt

papers against the party who objected to carrying out the court orders. This clearly indicates that

the 11th Defendant slept on his rights if he had any.

The present case was filed in 1995. The Appellant had not taken steps within one year and a day

from the date of judgment in the cases mentioned above. Therefore, the judgment in those cases

gets abated. As the Learned District Judge points out, from 1978 to 1995, there were nearly 20

years.

The Deeds marked as "11V (10)" and "11V (11)" were Deeds written in 1957 and 1971. Again,

the question arises what had the 11th Defendant-Appellant done When he had deeds and judgments

in his favour, he had been sleeping on his rights.

The 11th Defendant-Appellant, in his evidence, had admitted that Kuranage Joseph Fernando was

in occupation of the land in the 1970s. He admitted that from the 1940s, said father of the Plaintiff

and the 1st to 9th Defendants had lived in the premises.

A case filed in 1985 in the primary court of Wennapuwa, marked as "P16", was discussed by the

learned District Judge, and in Appeal, it was marked as "11V (14)". In the primary court, the order

was against the Appellant. His Appeal to the Court of Appeal failed due to a technical error

resulting in the primary court order being affirmed. When the order is in favour, the prescription

does not suffer.

The Appellant had not paid enough vigilance to his case at the District Court. He had not taken

steps to safeguard his rights when the judgment of the case filed in the 1970s was in his favour.

Even in this court, the Appellant had not been vigilant after obtaining an extra three weeks to file

his submissions. He had not filed his submissions.

In English law, such negligence was discussed as follows: -

"Equity does not relieve a person of the consequences of his or her carelessness". "Equity will not

grant relief from a self-created hardship." These English principles have been adopted in many

cases in Sri Lanka.

Even though the Appellant had judgments in his favour, negligence to obtain the land has made

the prescription of the Defendant-Respondent gain their rights. It is settled law that the Appellate

court must be careful in taking decisions where the learned District Judge had observed the

demeanour of the witnesses.

The learned District Judge had carefully considered this case's aspects in delivering the judgment.

The answers to the issues are clearly explained in the judgment.

We see no reason to disturb the judgment dated 05.12.2000 delivered by the learned District Judge

of Marawila in the case bearing No.441/P.

We dismiss the Appeal with a cost of LKR 10,000/-.

PRASANTHA DE SILVA, J.

I agree.
