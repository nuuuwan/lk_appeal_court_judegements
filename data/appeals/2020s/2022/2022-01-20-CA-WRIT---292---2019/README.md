Factual Matrix

The Petitioner was appointed as an English Language Assistant Teacher by

the Secretary of the Educational Service Committee of the Public Service

Commission with effect from 06.04.1988 (P1) to the Galearawa Primary

School in the Monaragala District. Accordingly, the Petitioner assumed

duties in the said school on 07.06.1988 (P2 and P3). Thereupon, the

Petitioner was transferred to Kiribanwewa Maha Vidyalaya, Embilipitiya in

the year 1988 and thereafter to Sri Pathi Maha Vidyalaya in Ambalangoda

in the year 1991. On 03.07.1995, the Petitioner was transferred to Sri

Dhammakusala Primary School within the Ambalangoda Educational Zone

(P4). Thereafter, the Petitioner was transferred to Kandegoda Maha

Vidyalaya as an Assistant Teacher with effect from 30.11.2011 (P6 and P7).

The Petitioner states that a preliminary investigation was initiated against

him regarding his period of service at Sri Dhammakusala Primary School.

Subsequently, by letter dated 06.03.2012 marked P12, the Petitioners

services were suspended in terms of the Establishment Code on 12 charges

of financial misappropriation by the 3rd Respondent. The Petitioner in his

letter dated 16.03.2012 dispatched to the Educational Secretary of

Southern Province, took up the position that the Petitioner is not coming

within the Provincial Educational Service and the Provincial Education

Secretary, not being his disciplinary authority, has no authority to suspend

his services (P13). However, Educational Secretary of Southern Province

has issued the charge sheet dated 04.04.2012 to the Petitioner. The

Petitioner raised the same objections in his letter dated 18.04.2012.

Despite the said objections, the Educational Secretary of Southern

Province, acting as the disciplinary authority of the Petitioner appointed an

inquiring officer to conduct a disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner.

After the inquiry being held, the Educational Secretary of Southern

Province issued the disciplinary Order dated 18.12.2017 by which the

Petitioner was terminated from service with effect from 06.03.2012 on the

basis that he was found guilty for 8 charges out of 12 charges (vide P17

and P18).

Page 6 of 10

The Petitioner preferred an Appeal to the Provincial Public Service

Commission, Southern Province against the said Order marked P17.

Having considered the said Appeal, the Provincial Public Service

Commission of the Southern Province, on sympathetic grounds, decided to

send the Petitioner on compulsory retirement, with effect from the date of

termination (P20). Being aggrieved by the decision marked P20, the

Petitioner preferred an appeal to the Governor of the Southern Province on

27.11.2018 which was dismissed by the Governor on 29.04.2019.

Contention of the Petitioner

The Petitioner was appointed to the public service by the Public Service

Commission with effect from 06.04.1988, and thereafter, he was

transferred to different schools in Uva and Southern Provinces and at no

time he was absorbed to the Provincial Public Service by the Public Service

Commission of the Southern Province. As such, the contention of the

Petitioner was that the Educational Secretary of the Southern Province is

not the Petitioners disciplinary authority.

In the circumstances, the Petitioner states that the suspension letter dated

06.03.2012, issued by the Secretary, Ministry of Education of Southern

Province (3rd Respondent) marked P12, the letter of termination dated

18.12.2017 issued by the 3rd Respondent marked P17, the Order of the

Southern Provincial Public Service Commission dated 07.09.2018 marked

P20 for a compulsory retirement of the Petitioner and the Order dated

29.04.2019 of the 11th Respondent, the Governor of the Southern Province

marked P22, dismissing the Appeal preferred by the Petitioner are ultra

vires, bad in law and illegal. Accordingly, the Petitioner prays that the

aforesaid Orders are liable to be quashed.

Contention of the Respondents

The Respondents in their objections categorically stated that the Provincial

Educational Secretary who is the 3rd Respondent in this Application is the

disciplinary authority of the Petitioner. Moreover, the Respondents move

for a dismissal of this Application on the basis, inter alia, that the Petitioner

Page 7 of 10

failed to challenge the inquiry held against him on the same footing

advanced by the Petitioner in this Appplication, the objection raised by the

Petitioner is a technical nature and as per the document marked P23 the

Petitioners services falls within the purview of the Ministry of Education of

the Southern Province.

Observation and findings

We heard the learned Counsel on both sides. We have perused the

impugned Orders and other materials placed on record as well.

The central issue to be determined in this Application is as to whether the

Provincial Educational Secretary (3rd Respondent) is the disciplinary

authority of the Petitioner.

Admittedly, the Petitioner was appointed to the public service by the Public

Service Commission with effect from 06.04.1988. Thereafter, the Petitioner

was appointed to the Galearawa Primary School in the Monaragala District.

Subsequently, by the document marked P4, the Petitioner was transferred

to Sri Dhammakusala Primary School within the Ambalangoda Educational

Zone. Having scrutinized the documents tendered by the Petitioner and the

Respondents it is abundantly clear that there is no evidence before Court

to establish the fact that the Petitioner has been absorbed to the Southern

Provincial Public Service.

The attention of this Court is drawn to the letter dated 01.10.2018 marked

P27, dispatched by the Regional Educational Director of Ambalangoda to

the Assistant Educational Director of Ambalangoda wherein it was

manifestly stated that the Petitioner has not been absorbed to the

Provincial Public Service.

Furthermore, by the letter dated 28.12.2018, sent by the Secretary of the

Ministry of Education of Southern Province to the Educational Director of

the Southern Province marked P23 and the letter dated 10.08.2012

dispatched by the Regional Educational Director to the Petitioner marked

Page 8 of 10

P24, it has been substantiated that the Petitioner has not been absorbed

to the Provincial Public Service.

The document marked P37 is a letter dated 29.08.2019 sent by the

Regional Educational Director of Ambalangoda (1st Respondent) to all

Principals of the schools within his region requesting to take steps to

absorb all teachers who were initially appointed to schools outside the

Southern Province.

Taking the totality of the evidence adduced into consideration, it is

manifestly clear that the Petitioner in this case continues to be an employee

under the Public Service Commission of the Central Government who was

his appointing and the disciplinary authority as well.

The contention of the learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondents is

that the Petitioner is estopped from taking up the position that he has not

been absorbed to the Southern Provincial Council on the basis that the

Petitioner had already accepted transfers, salaries, and benefits from the

said Provincial Council. It is the considered view of this Court that

accepting transfers, salaries, and benefits from the Southern Provincial

Council, will not confer authority or power to the said Provincial Council

what the latter did not have.

The doctrine of estoppel or waiver cannot in any event be employed to

enlarge the powers of a public authority. In Public Law the most obvious

limitation on the doctrine of estoppel is that it cannot be invoked so as to

give an authority power which it does not in law possess. ln other words,

no estoppel can legitimate an action which is ultra vires [vide Prof. Wade,

Administrative Law (Tenth Ed.) at p. 200; Abeywickrema v. Pathirana

and Others (1986) 1 Sri LR 120, p. 153 per Sharvananda, C.J.].

I also decline to accept the position advanced by the learned Senior State

Counsel that the Petitioner is not entitled to a remedy by a prerogative writ

on the footing that the Petitioner failed to raise his said objection at the

earliest opportunity. It is evident that the Petitioner in his letter dated

16.03.2012, dispatched to the Educational Secretary of Southern Province,

Page 9 of 10

categorically took up the position that the Petitioner is not coming within

the Provincial Educational Service and the Provincial Education Secretary,

not being his disciplinary authority, has no authority to suspend his

services (P13). Moreover, it is pertinent to be noted that both the Appeals

made to the Southern Province Public Service Commission and to the

Governor of the Southern Province, the Petitioner took up the position that

the 3rd Respondent was not his disciplinary authority.

The objection raised by the Petitioner stating that the 3rd Respondent has

no power and/or authority to take disciplinary action against the Petitioner

leads to the root of this case, and therefore, I do not agree with the

argument of the learned Senior State Counsel that the said objection of the

Petitioner is a technical objection.

Professor Wade in Administrative Law (Tenth Edition), at page 31,

emphasizes that,

Any administrative act or order which is ultra vires or outside

jurisdiction is void in law, i.e. deprived of legal effect. If it is not within

the powers given by the Act, it has no legal leg to stand on. The

situation is then as if nothing has happened, and the unlawful act or

decision may be replaced by a lawful one.

In the case of Edirisooriya and Others v. National Salaries and Cadre

Commission and Others [2011] 2 Sri LR 221, it was observed that,

The Central principle of Administrative Law, - ultra vires - simply

means acting beyond one's power or authority.

The Court of Appeal, in Gunaratne v. Chandrananda de Silva [1998] 3

Sri LR 265 observed that,

Per Gunawardena, J.

it is an inflexible and deep rooted principle of law that no act or

decision which is void at its inception can ever be ratified . . . further

statutory power must be exercised only by the body or officer in whom

Page 10 of 10

it has been reposed or confided unless sub delegation of the power is

authorized by express words or Necessary Implication . . . further one

cannot act or decide on his own account when in fact one is devoid of

power to so act or decide and seek to validate that act or decision

thereafter under the colour of the concept of ratification.

In the case in hand, the 3rd Respondent taking disciplinary action against

the Petitioner is ultra vires due to the fact that the Petitioner has never been

absorbed to the Provincial Public Service but remains under the

disciplinary control of the Secretary of the Educational Service Committee

of the Public Service Commission of Central Government. The 3rd, 4th and

11th Respondents failed to consider this fact. As such, the impugned Orders

made by the 3rd Respondent are ultra vires and illegal. The impugned

Orders made by the 4th and 11th Respondents recognizing the ultra vires

and illegal Orders of the 3rd Respondents are also bad in law.

For the foregoing reasons, writs of Certiorari are issued as prayed for in

paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the prayers to the Petition dated

25.10.2019. Accordingly, the impugned Orders marked as P12, P17, P20

and P22 are quashed.

Application allowed. No costs.
