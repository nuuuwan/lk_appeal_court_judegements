This is an appeal filed on 27.12.2013 against the order of the

Provincial High Court of Uva holden in Badulla in Case No Rev-

31/2013 delivered on 11.12.2013, which affirmed in revision a

sentencing order pronounced on 05.03.2013 by the Magistrate

Court of Badulla. The 2nd Accused Appellant-Petitioner (hereinafter

CA-PHC-186-2013 Page 3 of 10 19/05/2022 IJ- 24-22

referred to as the petitioner) has invoked the appellate jurisdiction

of this Court to set aside both orders.

The petitioner was charged in the Magistrate Court of Badulla with

four others for six counts of offences punishable under the Penal

Code. The case involved the forgery of the Geological Survey and

Mining Bureau seal, whereby the accused had forged and used

several licenses purportedly issued by the Bureau and caused

significant loss to the State. All five accused, including the

petitioner, pleaded guilty to their respective charges. As such the

learned, Magistrate imposed the following sentence on the petitioner

on 05.03.2013: Count 01: imposed 6 months imprisonment and an

additional fine of Rs. 1,500/-, each carrying a default sentence of 1

month imprisonment.

Count 02: imposed 6 months imprisonment for Count 02

suspended for 2 years. Additionally, a fine of Rs. 1,500/- imposed

carrying a default sentence of 1 month imprisonment.

Count 03: 6 months imprisonment and additional fine of Rs.

1500/- carrying a default sentence

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed a revision

application in the Provincial High Court of Uva holden in Badulla. The

learned High Court Judge delivered the impugned order on 11.12.2013

varied the sentencing order of the Magistrate.

Count 01: imposed 06 months of Rigorous Imprisonment and the

fine of Rs. 1,500/- to carry a 1-month default sentence of simple

imprisonment

Count 02: imposed 6 months of Rigorous Imprisonment

suspended for 5 years.

CA-PHC-186-2013 Page 4 of 10 19/05/2022 IJ- 24-22

Count 03: released the petitioner from the sentence as he was

not charged under Count 03 of the indictment.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant preferred the instant

appeal to the Court of Appeal, urging that the sentence imposed on the

petitioner is excessive. The petitioner seeks a suspended sentence for

his conviction under Count 01 and Count 03 by relying on Section 303

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No.15 of 1979 as amended

(hereinafter the CPC). The petition submits that the petitioner was a

first-time offender with no previous convictions, and such fact qualifies

him under Section 303of the CPC for a suspended sentence.

Section 303 of the CPC provides for a suspended sentence of

imprisonment. The trial judge is endowed with the discretion to decide

against imposing a custodial sentence on a convicted person. Section

303 (1) of the CPC clearly lists 12 criteria that a trial judge ought to

regard in deciding whether a satisfactory case for a suspended sentence

has been made out. The criteria so provided by the legislature is as

follows: the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence in respect of

which the sentence is imposed; the nature and gravity of the offence:

the offender's culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence:

the offender's previous character; any injury, loss or damage resulting

directly from the commission of the offence: the presence of any

aggravating or mitigating factor concerning the offender; the need to

punish the offender to an extent, and in a manner, which is just in all

of the circumstances; the need to deter the offender or other persons

from committing offences of the same or of a similar character; the need

to manifest the denunciation by the court of the type of conduct in

which the offender was engaged in; the need to protect the victim or the

community from the, offender; the fact that the person accused of the

offence pleaded guilty to the offence and such person is sincerely and

CA-PHC-186-2013 Page 5 of 10 19/05/2022 IJ- 24-22

truly repentant; or a combination of two or more of the above. In its

essence, Section 303(1) acts as somewhat of a guideline for a trial judge

in exercising his discretion to impose a suspended sentence instead of

a custodial sentence. Section 303(2) specifies the instances where a

trial judge is barred from imposing a suspended sentence. The crucial

point is that Section 303 of the CPC does not give to the offender, by

way of a right, an entitlement for a suspended sentence for the section

refers to the phrase a court may make an order suspending....

Hence, the primary contention to be decided by this Court is whether

the facts and circumstances of the instant appeal warrant imposition

of a suspended sentence as per Section 303 of the CPC.

The most pertinent fact relevant to this Courts examination is that the

petitioner has been convicted of forging the seal of a government

institution, i.e., the Geological Survey and Mining Bureau. The act of

forging a license purported to have been legally issued by the Bureau

and allowing persons to carry out mining outside the legal framework

has the effect of far-reaching consequences. Apart from the loss

incurred by the State in terms of government revenue, the act has a

significant effect on the environment. When one regards the criteria set

out in Section 303 of the CPC in light of such a context, it is evident

that the petitioner had committed the offences with premeditation,

much deliberation, and planning to gain profit, depriving the revenue

of the State. Hence, the nature and gravity of the offence committed by

the accused including the petitioner are severe, and the loss and

damage caused by the petitioner's acts are by no means trivial. The

Geological Survey and Mining Bureau has the sole authority to issue a

license to explore, mine, process and trade minerals such as sand. As

a regulatory mechanism for such natural resources, the Bureau is

tasked with issuing licenses in appropriate cases keeping in mind the

CA-PHC-186-2013 Page 6 of 10 19/05/2022 IJ- 24-22

need to balance the interests of mineral-based industries and the safety

of the environment. The petitioners action necessarily vitiates the very

purpose for which the Geological Survey and Mining Bureau has been

constituted, whereby he has issued licenses at his own will. In praying

for a suspended sentence, the petitioner contends that he had pleaded

guilty, that he was a first-time offender and that he has no previous

convictions ought to stir leniency concerning his sentence. At this

juncture, it is pertinent to echo a quote from Karunarathne v The

State 78 NLR 413: the Courts should not give the impression that when

they commit these offences, they can get away with it by getting a

suspended sentence and going scot free.

The petitioners actions cannot be viewed within a vacuum as it has far-

reaching implications on the community and the environment. Such a

holistic approach has been endorsed by several reported cases

concerning State institutions. The Attorney General v H. N. De Silva

57 NLR 121 concerned a case where an accused who was a clerk in the

Food Control Branch of the Kandy Kachcheri pleaded guilty for three

charges of forgery of surrender certificates. The trial judge was

extremely lenient in his punishment that the accused was ordered to

enter into a bond. Basnayake A. C. J. set aside the said sentence and

imposed a term of one-year Rigorous Imprisonment. in doing so, the

following observations were made: In assessing the punishment that

should be passed on an offender, a Judge should consider the matter of

sentence both from the point of view of the public and the offender.

Judges are too often prone to look at the question only from the angle of

the offender. A Judge should, in determining the proper sentence, first

consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from the nature of the

act itself and should have regard to the punishment provided in the Penal

Code or other statute under which the offender is charged. He should

CA-PHC-186-2013 Page 7 of 10 19/05/2022 IJ- 24-22

also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent and consider to

what extent it will be effective. If the offender held a position of trust or

belonged to a service which enjoys the public confidence that must be

taken into account in assessing the punishmentIt should be

remembered that the public are entitled to place their trust in professional

men by virtue of the fact that they belong to honourable professions

which enjoy public confidence. It would be extremely detrimental to the

public interest that the betrayal of that trust should not be met with such

punishment as will safeguard the interests of the public and the honour

of the profession to which the offender belongs. The reformation of the

offender in so far as it appears as a matter of practical consideration and

such extenuating circumstances as appear from the evidence, though

proper considerations in the assessment of punishment, are not

overriding considerations.

The Attorney General v Mendis (1995) 1 SLR 138 involved a case

where the accused pleaded guilty to having defrauded a premier State

Bank for a sum of Rs. 3.25 million. In the said judgment the Court of

Appeal refers to the gravity and seriousness of white-collar crimes and

its implications on society. Hence, the Court of Appeal refers to the

considerations a trial judge ought to make observing that he (trial

judge) has to consider the point of view of the accused on the one hand

and the interest of society on the other. In doing so the Judge must

necessarily consider the nature of the offence committed, the manner in

which it has been committed the machinations and the manipulations

resorted to by the accused to commit the offence, the effect of committing

such a crime insofar as the institution or organisation in respect of which

it has been committed, the persons who are affected by such crime, the

ingenuity with which it has been committed and the involvement of

others in committing the crime.. Thus, the Court of Appeal enhances

CA-PHC-186-2013 Page 8 of 10 19/05/2022 IJ- 24-22

the sentence imposed by the High Court from a inter alia term of two

years Rigorous Imprisonment to a term of four years Rigorous

Imprisonment per Count.

Learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that as per the provisions

of Section 303 (1) and (2) of Code of Criminal Procedure Code, a

custodial sentence is not warranted for a sentence not exceeding six

months. To buttress this argument, Counsel for the petitioner relies on

following reported cases.

1. A.M.S. Sampath Vs AG SC Appeal 17/2013 SC minutes

dated 12.03.2015,

2. Maraba Liyanage Rohana Vs. AG SC Appeal 89A/2009 SC

minutes dated 13.05.2011,

3. SC Appeal 03/2008 SC Minutes dated 15.10.2008 & 2008

BLR 160 ,

4. Kumara Vs AG 2003 1 SLR 139.

The facts of cases 1, 2 and 3 above are a stark contrast to the instant

application where they dealt with cases of statutory rape. By relying

on the said cases, the petitioner is attempting to equate the use of

discretion concerning a minimum mandatory sentence to the

instant case. In the said cases, the Court has imposed suspended

sentences despite the stipulated minimum mandatory sentences by

basing their rationale on the facts and circumstances of each case.

Case no 4, relied on by the petitioner, involves a murder case

whereby several mitigatory circumstances led the Court to be lenient

on the accused of a murder trial whereby a suspended sentence was

imposed. No such mitigatory circumstances have been divulged in

the instant appeal.

CA-PHC-186-2013 Page 9 of 10 19/05/2022 IJ- 24-22

At this juncture, it is pertinent to refer to CA PHC-184/2013 CA

Minutes 15.03.2019, cited by the State Counsel on behalf of the

respondents, which was a revision application filed by a co-accused

of the petitioner. The said revision application impugned the same

order by the High Court of Badulla dated 11.12.2013, praying for a

suspended sentence as the petitioner is praying for now. The Court

of Appeal in CA PHC 184/2013 (supra) has comprehensively

analysed the facts of the case against the law governing suspended

sentences and has refused the application for revision. Several

observations made in the said application are relevant to the instant

appeal: it can be construed that Court is vested with discretion to

suspend a sentence according to the circumstances of each case

subject to the limitations stipulated in aforesaid section 303 of the Act

(the CPC). Therefore, the Learned High Court Judge was correct in

refusing to interfere with he Learned Magistrates decision to impose

a custodial sentence since the Learned Magistrate was exercising the

discretion vested on her. Further we observe that there is no rigid rule

as to a first-time offender who has not faced a previous jail term shall

not be imposed a custodial sentence unless it falls in any of the

conditions specified under Section 303(2) we are of the view that

Court should impose a sentence which is proportionate to the crime

committed and the damage caused. In the instant case, it is vital to

consider not merely the financial loss caused to the Bureau but also

the damage caused to the environment. The Bureau has authority in

regulating mineral exploration, mining, processing, transport, trade-

in, storing and export of minerals by the issue of licenses. As a

country, we have seen several natural disasters including landslides

in recent past which could have been possible consequences of illegal

mining as well. Now it has been recognised that the environmental

CA-PHC-186-2013 Page 10 of 10 19/05/2022 IJ- 24-22

risks of mining include the formation of sinkholes, the contamination

of soil and groundwater, loss of biodiversity and chemical leakages

which are long term consequences. Therefore, issuing illegal licenses

without proper expert supervision should not be treated as alight

crime given the fact that we are already suffering from devastating

consequences of environmental pollution globally

Based on the above exposition, it is the Court's considered view that

the facts of the instant appeal do not warrant a suspended sentence

to be imposed on the petitioner.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs and affirmed the

judgment of the Learned High Court Judge.
