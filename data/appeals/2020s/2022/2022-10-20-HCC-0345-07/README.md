The appellant was tried in absentia and sentenced to life imprisonment for the

first charge and sentenced to one-year rigorous imprisonment for the second

charge.

The appellant was arrested later and produced before the Court in 2017. After

an inquiry under section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the said

punishment was made effective from 19.02.2018.

The appellant preferred an appeal against the said conviction and sentence.

The appeal was filed years after the conviction and obviously was out of time.

Counsel for the appellant and the respondent conceded that it was out of time.

Counsel for the appellant invited this Court to act under sections 364 and 365

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and consider the appeal as a revision

application.

Facts of the case

A team of police officers attached to the Pesale police guard post was on petrol

duty on 13.03.2002. Between 8.00 and 8.45 p.m., they were on the Kiwi road

in Pesale that leads to a place called Gal Palliya. They saw three people coming

towards them. When one of the police officers flashed the torch, one person ran

away, and the other two who remained were arrested. One person was clad in

trousers and a shirt, while the other person was in a sarong and a shirt. The

person wearing a sarong and shirt had a fertilizer bag in his hand. When the

police officers checked the bag, they found one T56 assault rifle and three

magazines. In the three magazines there were 45 cartridges. The two arrested

persons, the T56 gun and the ammunition were handed over to PW9 the

Reserve Officer at the Pesale police guard post. PW1 and PW2, who were in the

team of the police officers who arrested the appellant, gave evidence in court.

PW9, PW10, PW11, PW12 and PW13 also gave evidence regarding the chain of

4

custody of the productions. The court interpreter gave evidence and marked

the Govt. Analyst report. The judgment was pronounced on 15.3.2007. An

open warrant was issued to arrest the appellant.

The fact that the appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment would itself be

an exceptional ground to consider this appeal as a revision application.

Therefore, I would consider the merits of the appeal as a revision application.

When the appellant was produced before the High Court, the Counsel who

appeared for him had not called the appellant to testify as to why he did not

turn up for the trial. Counsel could have done a better job in the High Court.

On behalf of the appellant, no documentary evidence or any other evidence

relevant to this matter was produced before the High Court Judge in order to

vacate the judgment. There must have been sufficient evidence to satisfy the

learned High Court Judge to vacate the judgment entered in absentia.

However, the High Court Judge also noted that there was no evidence to show

that the appellant was absconding. The learned High Court Judge had refused

to vacate the judgment on the basis that the appellant should have come before

court and made an application. As the appellant had not testified before the

High Court Judge, there was no evidence for the learned High Court Judge to

consider and vacate the judgment entered, without the presence of the

appellant.

The learned High Court Judge who had decided to proceed with the trial

against the appellant in his absence had not considered the fact that whether

the appellant was absconding. At the inquiry, no witness said or indicated that

the appellant had purposely evaded the Court. Three witnesses stated that the

appellant was living in an uncontrolled area, and they had no information

about the appellant. This was during the time when there was ongoing fighting

between the Sri Lanka Army and the LTTE. When considering the evidence led

before the learned High Court Judge, there was no sufficient ground to say that

the appellant was absconding. In the case of CA.NO.96/2013, decided on

5

10thJuly 2015, H.N.J.Perera J.(as he was then) stated that a Judge should

satisfy himself on evidence that whether in fact the accused was absconding

and set aside the conviction and send the case back for a re-trial. Therefore,

the decision to proceed with the trial in the absence of the appellant was

irregular.

I now consider whether it is appropriate to order a re-trial.

As per the evidence of the prosecution, the police team saw three people. One

person ran away, and the other two were arrested. Detailed evidence was not

elicited in the High Court. PW2, the person who arrested the appellant, had

given a statement to the police regarding the arrest of the appellant. In his

statement, he said as follows;

, .

.

The prosecution's position is that the appellant was carrying a fertilizer bag;

inside it, there was a T56 gun and three magazines containing 45 live

cartridges. The evidence is that the gun and the live cartridges were handed

over to PW9 Weerasekera. Weerasekera then handed them over to PW10

Dayananda. Dayananda handed over the same to PW11 Kithsiri. Kithsiri then

handed them over to an officer at the reserve on 14.3.2002. PW11 did not

state to whom he referred to as the Reserve Officer. PW11 said that he handed

over the production numbers PR95 and PR96. There was no evidence, led

before the High Court, as to what happened to the gun and cartridges during

the period between14.3.2002 and 29.07.2002. The custody of the items

mentioned above was therefore an issue during the said four months period,

which is considerably a longer period of time.

Then PW13 stated that he served at the Mannar police station in July 2002. He

took the productions under production no. 109 (not under 95 and 96). He

6

handed them to the Magistrate Court of Mannar on 29.07.2002. On

30.7.2002, with a letter from the Magistrate Court of Mannar, he handed them

over to the Govt. Analyst Dept.

From 14.3.2002 to 27.7.2002, there was no evidence as to who was entrusted

with the gun and the ammunition during that period. Therefore, the chain of

production is broken, and the four months period can be considered as a

massive gap in the chain of production. This gap creates a reasonable doubt in

the prosecution case, and it is sufficient to acquit the appellant on that ground.

As per the evidence, there were three people. One of them immediately ran

away when the torch was flashed, and the other two remained.

Out of those two, one person was discharged by the Magistrate on the

instruction of the Hon. Attorney General. The discharged persons position was

that the LTTE summoned him in connection with non-payment of some money,

due on a dry fish business. He stated to the police that he, the appellant and

one of the LTTE cadre came with them. The LTTE cadre was sent to get money.

When they saw the police, the LTTE cadre had run away. The appellant also

stated that when they saw the police, the LTTE cadre had shoved the fertilizer

bag at him and had run away.

The evidence is that there were three people, and one of them had immediately

run away when they saw the police. Therefore, there is doubt as to who was

carrying the fertilizer bag with the gun and the cartridges at that time.

The officers who arrested the appellant had recorded a statement from the

appellant to the effect that the LTTE cadre shoved the bag at him and ran

away. If there be a re-trial, the appellant would repeat the same story that

was already recorded in the police statement, and that would itself suffice to

create a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case, as one out of three people

had run away by shoving a bag at the appellant.

7

In these circumstances, it is not expedient to send the case for a re-trial,

especially when there is a considerable lacuna in the chain of custody of the

production. The prosecution cannot be given a second chance to fill the gaps in

the prosecution case. Furthermore, the stance of the appellant to the police, if

it comes as evidence, would create a reasonable doubt. The appellant has

already been in custody for more than four years. At the time of the arrest, the

appellant was 45 years. Now, after twenty years, he should be 65. Counsel for

the appellant stated that the appellant is 72, and as the appellant had not

given evidence, we cannot ascertain his age. However, it seems that he is an

older man. Considering all the circumstances, sending this case back for a re-

trial will not serve a useful purpose.

Considering the above circumstances, I, acting in revision, set aside the

conviction and sentence.

The appellant is acquitted.

Appeal is allowed
