Before : Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Dhammika Ganepola J.

Counsel : Petitioner appears in person.

Sumathi Dharmawardane PC, ASG with Sehan Soyza for the

Respondents.

Supported on : 27.12.2022

Decided on : 27.12.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The substantive relief sought by the Petitioner is for a writ of Certiorari to quash the

Extraordinary Gazette Notification No. 2208/13 published on 30.12.2020 (marked P8)

by which a rule, among others, has been made by the Council of Legal Education (1st

Respondent) to conduct all study courses of Sri Lanka Law College in English medium

and to hold examinations gradually from year 2022 in English medium as reflected in its

Rule 28A.

Although, the Petitioner claims that he is a law student enrolled in the year 2021, he has

failed to successfully complete the 1st year examination of the said Law College. The

Petitioner has filed this application on 20.12.2022 and it can be assumed that he had the

knowledge of the impugned Gazette Notification P8 even at the time of his enrolment as

a law student in the year 2021.

It appears that the Petitioner has entered Sri Lanka Law College based on the Rules

promulgated by the Council of Legal Education including the Rules published in the

impugned Gazette Notification in 2020. Thereafter, he has applied to sit for the 1st year

examination in October 2021 and subsequently he has withdrawn the said application.

Further, in April 2022, he has sat again at the 1st year examination in which he was

unsuccessful. I take the view that the conduct of the Petitioner amounts to his acquiescence

to his demands in this application.

The Petitioner has not taken any interest to challenge the impugned Gazette Notification

P8 before entering Sri Lanka Law College or at least before sitting at the Examination as

described in the Petition. The Petitioner filing this application on 20.12.2022 has moved

that an interim order be issued suspending the ongoing Examination which is being

conducted according to the timetable, marked as P10. The said timetable reflects that the

said Examination was due to commence on 02.12.2022 and by now, it has been held on 4

days in the month of December.

What is the special right bestowed upon the Petitioner to seek for such an interim order

causing hardship to the majority of students who have undergone probably many sleepless

nights in preparing for examinations and who have completed answering some question

papers by now? The Petitioner has waited even until this examination was partly

concluded to file this Application. In order to justify his delay, the Petitioner has tendered

the documents, marked P17, P18 and P19. The document P17 looks like a medical

treatment book for treatment taken for a shoulder pain. P18 seems to be a private medical

certificate issued by a medical officer recommending one week leave from 03.12.2022 to

09.12.2022 and whereas P19 is a photograph to illustrate purported wounds. Those

evidence cannot be accepted to justify the delay of the Petitioner to come to this Review

Court which exercises the jurisdiction of prerogative writs. Hence, I use my discretion to

hold that the Petitioner is guilty of laches.

At this stage, I refer to the judicial dicta in the cases of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and

others vs. Dayanthi Dias Kaluarachchi, SC Appeal 43/2013; Seneviratne vs. Tissa

Bandaranayake and another (1999) 2 Sri. L.R. 341 at p. 351; Issadeen vs. The Commissioner

of National Housing and others (2003) 2 Sri. L.R. 10 at p. 15; Collettes Ltd. vs. Bank of Ceylon

(1984) 2 Sri. L.R. 254; Pradeshiya Sabawa, Hingurakgoda and others vs. Karunaratne and

others (2006) 2 Sri. L.R. 410; Ratnasiri and others vs. Ellawala and others (2004) 2 Sri. L.R.

180

In the above case of Seneviratne vs. Tissa Bandaranayake and another (1999) 2 Sri. L.R. 341

at p. 351, Amerasinghe J. adverting to the question of long delay, commented that; if a

person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law refuses afterwards to lend

him any assistance to enforce his rights; the law both to punish his neglect, nam leges

vigilantibus, non dormientibus, subveniunt, and for other reasons refuses to assist those who

sleep over their rights and are not vigilant.

In light of the above, I proceed to refuse this application as it is not possible for this Court

to arrive at a decision whether the Petitioner has satisfied the minimum threshold

requirement which warrants this Court to issue formal notice of this Application on

Respondents.

Application is refused.
