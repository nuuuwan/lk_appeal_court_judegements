Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

The accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Gampaha for causing the death of one Rajapaksha

Pathirannahalage Munasighe alias Gamini on 30th November 2006, an offence

punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, he was found guilty by the learned High Court Judge

of Gampaha by the judgment dated 23-09-2019 and was sentenced to death

accordingly.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant

preferred this appeal.

The facts in brief are as follows.

The appellant and the deceased are known to each other. According to the

evidence of PW-01, while he was travelling home from Veediyawatta junction

the deceased had got into his foot bicycle in order to get down near his house.

He was travelling on the front bar of the bicycle. After they had travelled about

200 meters the witness has seen the appellant whom he referred to as Baby

Aiya crossing the road from his right side and approaching them. As soon as

Page 3 of 12

they saw him the deceased has alighted from the bicycle and the witness has

seen appellant stabbing the deceased. He has seen the deceased holding on to

his stomach and later he has seen both of them scuffling. The PW-01 has

paddled to the house of the deceased, which was about hundred meters away,

and informed his sister Manel what was happening. Although it was around

7.30 in the night of 30th November 2006 when the incident happened, the

witness has had no difficulty in identifying the appellant as he was a person

well known to him and with the use of nearby lights. It was his evidence that

could not properly see the knife that was used, and cannot identify it.

PW-02 is the sister of the deceased with whom he and his wife had lived. After

being informed by Thanuka (PW-01) that Gamini was stabbed by Baby, she

and the wife of the deceased has hurried towards the place where they were

informed the incident happened. While on their way, their neighbour

Sumanawathi (PW-04) too had come and informed that the deceased was found

fallen in the backyard of her house. It was her evidence that he was able to

speak to her and informed that baby stabbed her. After two days in the

hospital, the deceased has succumbed to his injury. PW-03, the wife of the

deceased and the neighbour Sumanawathi has given evidence as to the

respective events unfolded before them.

Police inspector Bandula Wijesiri was the officer who has arrested the appellant

on the same day around 11 p.m. and had recovered the manna knife marked

P-02 based on the statement of the appellant.

PS Ashoka Jayaweera (PW-08) was an officer attached to the hospital police

post of Gampaha hospital and was the first police officer who had spoken to

the deceased. When questioned as to what happened, the deceased has

informed him that Baby stabbed me, which information he has passed on to

Weeragula police at 21.25 hours on the 30th of November 2006.

As the Judicial Medical Officer Priyanjith Perera, who has conducted the post

mortem was not available to give evidence, it was Dr. Wijewardena who had the

possession of the reports of the postmortems conducted by the said JMO who

has produced the postmortem report of the deceased marked P-03 and

confirmed that the death was due to the stab injury suffered by the deceased.

When called for a defence at the conclusion of the prosecution case, the

appellant has chosen to remain silent.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

(1) The learned High Court Judge failed to evaluate the dying deposition

relied upon by the prosecution in accordance with the principles laid

down for the evaluation of dying depositions.

(2) Since there was only one injury to the deceased, the learned High

Court Judge failed to consider the possibility of knowledge as against

the intention to cause death of the deceased.

(3) Whether the cause of death establishes the nexus between the

injuries and the death.

(4) The learned High Court Judge failed to consider all the infirmities in

the evidence.

In his submissions before this Court, it was the contention of the learned

Counsel for the appellant that PW-02 Chandrawathi who claimed that the

deceased made a dying declaration to her was not a reliable witness. It was his

position that the postmortem report does not establish that the death was due

to a stab injury and no proper cause of death has been given. There was no

nexus between the death and the injuries mentioned in the postmortem report

was another argument advanced by the learned Counsel.

Page 5 of 12

Citing the judgment in the case of Ranjith Vs. The State (2000) 3 SLR 46

where it was stated that ordinarily it is not safe to base a conviction for murder

solely upon a dying declaration, it was his contention the learned High Court

Judge should have drawn his attention to whether this was a case that falls

under the ambit of section 297, that is culpable homicide not amounting to

murder.

The view of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) was that there can be

no basis to any of the arguments adduced on behalf of the appellant.

He points out that this was not a conviction that relied solely on a dying

declaration, but by an eyewitness account as well as dying declarations made

to several persons at different times before his death which occurred two days

after the stabbing. He was of the view that the cause of death has been well

established in this matter and ambiguity as to the evidence of the doctor who

produced the postmortem report whether the knife marked P-02 may be the

weapon used has not created any doubt as to the cause of death and to the fact

that the deceased had a stab wound which resulted in his death.

It was his position that there was no evidence before the trial Court to come to

a finding that the act of the appellant amounts to culpable homicide not

amounting to murder and the evidence was that this was a preplanned attack

on the deceased and nothing else. He points out that the motive to a crime of

this nature is not a matter that necessarily needs to be proved.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

As the grounds of appeal are interrelated, all the grounds urged will be

considered together.

As contended correctly by the learned DSG, this was not a matter where the

prosecution relied solely on a dying deposition to prove the case against the

appellant. PW-01 was an eyewitness to the incident. Although he has given his

evidence later in the case due to the fact that he was overseas when the case

Page 6 of 12

commenced, that has not caused any prejudice to the appellant. His evidence

has been cogent and trustworthy. There are no material omissions or

contradictions in his evidence. The contradiction marked P-06 was not a

material contradiction as to his evidence on the incident where the appellant

stabbed the deceased. His evidence clearly establishes that this was not a

chance meeting between the appellant and the deceased, but the appellant had

been waiting for the deceased about hundred meters away from the house of

the deceased. The evidence establishes the fact that the scuffle between the two

was after the deceased was stabbed by the appellant, which goes on to

establish that there was no sudden fight.

Apart from the eyewitness account, the prosecution has led the evidence of the

sister of the deceased PW-02 and that of the police officer who spoke to him

(PW-08) when he was first admitted to the hospital, to establish that the

deceased had made two dying declarations as to who caused the fatal injury on

him.

The law in relation to the applicability of statements made by persons who

cannot be called as witnesses as relevant under certain conditions are clear in

our judicial system. Section 32 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance, which refers to

the relevancy of a statement of a person who is dead as to the transaction

which resulted in his death reads as follows;

32 (1) When the statement is made by a person as to the cause of

his death, or to any of the circumstances of the transaction which

resulted in his death, in cases in which cause of death of that

persons death comes into question.

Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them

was or was not, at the time when they were made, under

expectation of death, and whether may be in the nature of the

proceedings in which the cause of his death comes into question.

Page 7 of 12

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his book The Law of Evidence, Volume I, at

page 466 gives the summary of conditions of admissibility under section 32(1)

in the following manner;

In Sri Lanka, the conditions of admissibility may said to be:

(1) Death of the declarant before the proceedings.

(2) The statement must relate to the cause of his death or any of the

circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death.

(3) The case must be such that the cause of the declarants death must

come into question.

(4) The competency of the declarant to testify may have to be established,

depending upon circumstances of each case, but strict rules of

competency do not apply.

(5) The statement must be a complete verbal statement, though it may

take the form of question and answer or appropriate gestures. It must

be complete in itself and capable of definite meaning.

At page 469, citing several decided cases, Coomaraswamy discusses the

probative value of evidence, infirmities of such evidence, the necessary

directions, in the following manner;

The probative value of dying declarations relevant under section 32(1)

would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But there is

no doubt that such evidence suffers from certain intrinsic infirmities.

Two of these defects are the fact that the statement was not made under

oath and the absence of cross-examination of the deponent of the

statement.

The following matters require consideration in regard to the proper

directions:

Page 8 of 12

(1) The deceased not been before the court as a witness, and not

having made the stamen under oath, this is an infirmity in the

evidence in the evidence of the statement.

(2) The statement has not been tested by cross-examination.

(3) The weight that should be attributed to the statement admitted

in the circumstances of a given case.

(4) If in a dying declaration, there is material favorable to the

accused, the judge should refer to it.

(5) Corroboration is not always necessary to support a dying

declaration.

In the case of The King Vs. Asirvadan Nadar, 51 NLR 322;

Where in a trial for murder, the dying deposition of the deceased was led

in evidence against the accused under section 32(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

Held: That the attention of the jury should have been specifically drawn

to the question how far the other facts and surrounding circumstances

proved in evidence might be said to support the truth or otherwise of the

deposition.

It needs to be noted that the appeal under consideration is not a matter that

had been decided only on the dying depositions of the deceased. In this matter,

the main evidence was an eyewitness account as to what happened. As I have

discussed before, the evidence of the sole eyewitness to the incident was cogent

and trustworthy. Therefore, the dying deposition, which was not the main piece

of evidence relied upon by the prosecution to prove the charge against the

appellant only has a corroborative value in my opinion.

When it comes to the question whether it would have been possible for the

deceased to relate what happened to him to his sister and the police officer,

Page 9 of 12

and the question whether the evidence in relation to that can be accepted as

accurate and probable are matters that attract consideration.

When considering the evidence of PW-01 who was the eyewitness to the

incident, it has been established that as soon as he informed the sister of the

deceased (PW-02) about the incident she had hurried to the place where the

deceased was found fallen. The evidence clearly establishes that although he

had stab wounds in his stomach area, he was able to speak. Naturally, anyone

would question an injured person as to what happened when sees with stab

wounds or even if no such question was asked the natural tendency is to relate

what happened to him when an injured sees someone close to him.

The alleged contradictions marked when the PW-02 gave her evidence are

markings that cannot be considered as contradictions in any manner, although

the trial Court has allowed them to be marked. The argument by the learned

Counsel for the appellant that the evidence as to the dying declaration was an

afterthought, has no basis as considered above.

The deceased has succumbed to his injuries two days after his admission to

the hospital. According to the evidence of PW-08, the police officer who

questioned the deceased at the time of his admission to the hospital, the

deceased was conscious and spoke to him stating that it was the baby who

stabbed him. I find this quite probable as it is the duty of a police officer who

was assigned to a police post of a hospital to ascertain what happened from an

injured if it was possible.

This shows that the deceased had made these dying declarations to the two

witnesses independently to each other, and on two different occasions.

The evidence led in this matter has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the

deceased had in fact made such statements to the two witnesses, and his

statement was true and accurate as to what happened to him. There is no

doubt that the deceased was in a position to identify the appellant at the time

Page 10 of 12

of the attack. It has been proved that the evidence of the witnesses is truthful

and trustworthy in that regard. I am unable to find any basis to the argument

that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the evidence as to the

dying depositions in its correct perspective. I am of the view that the learned

High Court Judge had well considered the evidence with a clear understanding

of the relevant legal principles.

I find no basis at all in the ground of appeal that the nexus between the injury

and the cause of death has not been established. The postmortem report

marked P-03 clearly establishes that the death had been a result of the stab

wound received by the deceased. The evidence clearly establishes that the

injury was inflicted on the deceased by the appellant using a knife. The doctor

who produced the postmortem report not expressing a clear opinion that the

knife marked P-02 may be the weapon used is not a reason to doubt the cause

of death.

I do not find any merit in the argument that the appellant had no knowledge

and the intention to kill when the attack took place either. The evidence shows

that the appellant has been waiting for the deceased knowing very well that the

deceased has to go pass the place to reach his house. He had come prepared to

attack the deceased. Although it was one wound, according to the post mortem

report, it has cut through several vital organs of the body, which has caused

his death. I find that the appellant had the knowledge and the intention when

he inflicted the fatal stab wound on the deceased.

The law is clear that the motive for a crime is not a matter that needs to be

proved in a criminal trial.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, in his book The Law of Evidence Volume I at

page 224 states thus;

But even in criminal cases, it is not necessary for the prosecution to

prove a motive or the adequacy of the motive, if any, in order to establish

Page 11 of 12

the charge. The motive which induces a man to do a particular act is

known to him and him alone. Therefore, the prosecution is not bound to

prove a motive for the offence, though it can suggest a motive, and when

it does so, the judge or jury can examine it. Where there is clear evidence

that a person has committed an offence, it is immaterial that no motive

has been proved, or that the evidence of motive in not clear. (See-

Emperor Vs. Balaram Das 49 Cal. 358).

Therefore, it is not necessary to prove the motive at all. A conviction is

possible without any motive being disclosed.

(See- Naresh Singh Vs. Emperor A.I.R. (1935) Oudh 265, 154 I.C.

691 and Rabari Ghila Fadav Vs. state of Bombay, A.I.R. (1960) S.C.

748)

It is trite law that even if an accused did not take up an exception in terms of

section 294 to contend that his action amounts to culpable homicide not

amounting to murder, it is the duty of a trial judge to consider whether there

was evidence before the Court to come to such a conclusion.

In the case of King Vs. Belana Withanage Eddin 41 NLR 345 Court of

Criminal Appeal held;

In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury, the

alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder when there is any basis for such a finding in the

evidence of record, although such defence was not raised nor relied upon

by the accused.

In King Vs. Vidanalage Lanty 42 NLR 317 the Court of Criminal Appeal

observed the following;

There was evidence in this case upon which it was open to the jury to say

that it came within exception 04 of section 296 of the Penal Code and that

Page 12 of 12

the appellant was guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. No

such plea, however, was put forward on his behalf. In the course of his

address the presiding judge referred to this evidence as part of the defence

story, but not as evidence upon which a lessor verdict might possibly be

based.

Held: It was the duty of the presiding judge to have so directed the jury

and that in the circumstances, the appellant was entitled to have the

benefit of a lesser offence.

In the instant action, the appellant has not taken any stand at the trial. He has

remained silent when he was called for a defence. There was no evidence before

the trial court to suggest that the action of the appellant amounts to culpable

homicide not amounting to murder, to enable the learned High Court Judge to

consider such a proposition, and a basis for the contention of the learned

Counsel for the appellant.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the relevant facts

and the legal principles that need his attention to come to a firm finding as to

the guilt of the accused for the offence of murder, which needs no interference

from this Court for the reasons aforementioned.

Therefore, the appeal is dismissed, as it is devoid of any merit. The conviction

and the sentence affirmed.
