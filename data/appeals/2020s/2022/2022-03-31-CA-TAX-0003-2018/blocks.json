Commissioners (hereinafter referred to as Heart of Variety),14 and held that the fact that a company receives nothing more than the reimbursement of sums paid out by the company, did not prevent the amounts paid or reimbursement received from being consideration for the supply of the services in question. Upon a careful scrutinization of the case of Heart of Variety, I observe that there are material differences in the facts of the two cases. In the case of Heart of Variety, the appellant was a charitable organization which ran a scheme for showing cinema films in childrens homes. The driver-projectionists who operated the scheme, although they worked exclusively for and under the direction of the appellant in that case, were for administrative reasons nominally kept on the pay-roll of the commercial company of film exhibitors, EMI Cinemas and Leisure Ltd (EMI). The conditions of service of the driver-projectionists were fixed by the appellant but, the salaries, expenses, national insurance contributions, PAYE tax etc. were all paid and dealt with by EMI, to be reimbursed monthly by the appellant in that case. The amounts reimbursed were only the payments actually made and nothing more. Even in the case in hand, the amount reimbursed was the exact amount paid by the Appellant. In Heart of Variety, it was held that receiving nothing more than reimbursement of sums paid out does not prevent the amounts paid by way of reimbursement from being a consideration for a supply of the services in question.",

However, in the instant case, it is an undisputed fact that the employees whose salaries were reimbursed by the Appellant are employees of Straintec.

In fact, the Assessor, exercising his powers under Section 21 (4) of the VAT Act could easily have called for the letters of appointment of the employees etc., and cleared any doubt as to whether the Appellant had, in effect, supplied their employees to Straintec and got a reimbursement for the services supplied by the Appellant to Straintec. However, the Assessor has failed to exercise such powers with due diligence.
