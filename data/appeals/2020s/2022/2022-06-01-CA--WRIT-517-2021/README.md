The Ministry of Health published a bid notice under the caption of Supply of Cleaning

Services for Hospitals and Health Institutions under National Competitive Bid Invitation-

2021/2022 appeared in the Daily Newspaper on 04.05.2021, marked P5. By virtue of

Page 6 of 12

the said Bid notice, the Ministry of Health invited bids from registered institutions for the

supply of cleaning services in respect of the hospitals and institutions mentioned in the

said notice for the year 2021/2022. The Petitioners submitted a bid in respect of the area

including the Epilepsy building and surroundings of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka

(Tender No. MH/PB/CL/09/2021) and it is among other bids that they submitted in

respect of the other hospitals and institutes under the same bid notice.

The Petitioners challenging the award of the tender to the 13th Respondent, seek from this

Court inter alia, a writ of Prohibition restraining the 1st to 12th Respondents from issuing

the Letter of Award and also entering into a contract in respect of the subject tender for

year 2021/2022 with the 13th Respondent. The Petitioners are seeking for a writ of

Certiorari even to quash the decisions of the Procurement Committee (PC) and the

Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC).

The Petitioners state that as per the information taken down at the opening of the bids, the

following bidders (including the Petitioners) have quoted the prices mentioned below for

the said tender No. MH/PB/CL/09/2021 in relation to the provision of Janitorial

Services for the year 2021/2022 for the area including the Epilepsy building and

surroundings of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. (Vide-paragraph 19 of the Petition)

Tenderers Bid Value (Rs.)

M/S Rakna Arashaka Lanka Ltd 27,082,999.45

13th Respondent - M/S Super Shine Services 27,224,245.00

14th Respondent - Lakro Janitorial and Manpower Services 29,192,400.00

Petitioners - Amal Janitorial Services 29,208,850.00

Ultrakleen (Pvt) Ltd 32,236,259.44

It is noted that that the table named 1.0 reflected in the written submissions of the

Petitioners is completely different to the above information.

The Bids submitted by M/S Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited, which was the lowest, has

been rejected at the Appeal stage for non-compliance of Tender Conditions. Consequently

the 13th Respondent who submitted the 2nd lowest bid, was awarded the subject tender. It

is important to note here that the Petitioners are not the 3rd lowest bidder but they are the

Page 7 of 12

4th lowest and that the Petitioners state that the instant application is also in the public

interest.

The Petitioners main contention in this application is two-fold and accordingly, they raise

questions on worth certificate & the banks letter submitted by the 13th Respondent.

Although, the Petitioners alleged in their pleadings that the 13th Respondent has failed to

comply with 8 Tender Conditions, the Petitioners supported at the hearing only the issues

relating to the failure of the 13th Respondent to comply with the Clause 1.VIII (Worth

Certificate) and the Clause 1.IX (Banks letter) of the Tender Conditions.

The Petitioners assert that to the best of their knowledge, the original Worth Certificate in

Form Gen.170 has not been provided by the 13th Respondent and the said 13th Respondent

is required to submit a Worth Certificate for the value of Rs.8.4 million. The 1st to 12th

Respondents have annexed a Worth Certificate No. A132440 (marked R13) to the

statement of objections and thereafter an additional Worth Certificate No. A132003

marked X1 has been submitted along with the motion dated 22.03.2022.

The Petitioners argument that no Worth Certificate has been tendered by the 13th

Respondent is not tenable as the 1st to 12th Respondents have submitted to Court the

aforesaid Worth Certificates of the 13th Respondent. However, the Petitioners still

maintain their argument on the value of the Worth Certificate. I have dealt with a similar

question on Worth Certificates in K.G.D. Walter Abeysundara and others vs. Dr. S.H.

Munasinghe, Secretary Ministry of Health and others, CA/Writ/514/2021 (decided

on 28.01.2022) where I have focused my mind to the aspect whether the successful bidder

in respect of the relevant impugned tender of that case, has become successful even in

his/her bids in respect of the hospitals other than the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, under

the same bid notice marked P5. It is not a disputed fact that if the bidder is submitting

bids for several hospitals/institutes that the Worth Certificate should be for the total value

or more of such hospitals/institutes. In the said case I have observed, by examining the

wordings in the Clause 1.VIII of Tender Conditions that the requirement of submitting a

Worth Certificate for the total value of all hospitals and institutions arises only if the bidder

submits bids in respect of hospitals other than the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. The

contention of the learned State Counsel for the 1st to 12th Respondents in this regard is that

the 13th Respondent has appended separate Worth Certificates to separate bids (of the 13th

Respondent) in respect of those respective hospitals (including the National Hospital of

Sri Lanka) with which the 13th Respondent had been successful.

Page 8 of 12

The above Worth Certificate marked X1 (dated 29.07.2021) is for the value

Rs.300,000.00 and the Certificate marked X2 (R13) (dated 11.10.2021) is for the value

of Rs.1,000,000.00. The required value as per the Bid notice for the impugned tender is

Rs.1,000,000.00. Therefore, the 13th Respondent has prima facie fulfilled the basic

requirement on the Worth Certificate in respect of the impugned tender.

The closing date for receiving bids in view of the Bid notice marked P5 was 21.05.2021.

The Petitioners Worth Certificate No. A140711 also has been annexed to the Petition

among other documents. Accordingly, it is noted that the Petitioners as well as the 13th

Respondent have obtained Worth Certificates from the respective Divisional Secretaries

on dates after the above closing date and the reason for that has not been divulged to Court.

In terms of the Tender Conditions, prima facie Worth Certificate is a document that

should be annexed to the respective Bid.

This is although more why I have decided in K.G.D. Walter Abeysundara and others

vs. Dr. S. H. Munasinghe, Secretary-Ministry of Health and others,

CA/Writ/518/2021 (decided on 31.05.2022) that introducing a requirement of submitting

a Worth Certificate as per Form Gen.170 which has not been duly and lawfully interpreted can

create ambiguity and also it is an antiquated procedure. I have further observed in the above

case that the procurement entity has a major role in formulating criteria in the Tender

Conditions by providing fair, equal and maximum opportunity for eligible interested

parties to participate in Procurement. Therefore, the instant application also, I am not

inclined to bestow the Petitioners with the benefit of doubt in respect of the criteria of a

Worth Certificate, based on all the circumstances of this case.

Now, I advert to the second main contention of the Petitioners raised at the argument

stage. The Petitioners assert that the 13th Respondent has failed to tender a letter issued by

the Bank (which with the contractor is engaged in transaction) to the effect that bank

overdraft facilities could be provided for the amount mentioned in the relevant table for

each of the hospitals/institutes in terms of Clause 1.IX of Tender Conditions. The

particular letter issued by the bank on behalf of the 13th Respondent has been annexed to

the statement of objections marked as R15. In view of the Bid notice marked P5, the

required amount of loan facilities which is required to be obtained by the Bank in respect

of the impugned tender is Rs.515,446.13. Although the said document R15 does not

reflect any figure as such, the learned State Counsel argues that the R15 has been

exclusively issued in respect of the impugned tender. Referring to the heading of the said

Page 9 of 12

letter, the learned State counsel submits that the absence of the particular figure required

by the said Bid notice in no way renders the said letter R15 defective on the basis of non-

compliance of the Tender Conditions. The learned State Counsel further argues that the

said letter R15 does not impose any condition or restriction on the overdraft facilities that

could be drawn by the 13th Respondent.

On a careful examination of the said letter marked R15, the relevant bank has only

indicated that arrangements could be made to provide overdraft facilities as and when

required in relation to the relevant current account maintained by the 13th Respondent.

However, the relevant Bank has failed to express categorically whether a sum of

Rs.515,446.13 could be released as an overdraft in respect of the relevant current account

and that creates, in my view, a lacuna on the part of the relevant Bank. Therefore, I accept

the Petitioners arguments on principle that the 13th Respondent has failed to submit a

bank letter reflecting the exact amount mentioned in the Bid notice. Moreover, even if it

is assumed that the 13th Respondent has failed in submitting a Bank letter consisting the

said exact figure, a question arises as to whether the Petitioners are reasonably capable of

being successful in their claims in the instant application, based on the extraordinary

circumstances of this case.

In this context, I wish to draw my attention to the objections raised by the 13th Respondent

in the above case No. CA/Writ/518/2021. I am of the view that I am not transcending

the scope of the jurisdiction of this Court by drawing my attention to the submissions made

on behalf of a Respondent in another case due to the reasons that;

a) the above Petitioners filed four other applications before this Court, namely,

CA/Writ/514/2021 , CA/Writ/515/2021 , CA/Writ/516/2021 ,

CA/Writ/518/2021 along with the instant application bearing No.

CA/Writ/517/2021;

b) all above five applications have been filed based on the same Bid notice published

by the Ministry of Health under the caption of Supply of Cleaning Services for

Hospitals and Health Institutions under National Competitive bid invitation-

2021/2022 marked as P5;

c) this Court after a full hearing has already dismissed the applications Nos.

CA/Writ/514/2021 , CA/Writ/515/2021 , CA/Writ/516/2021 and

CA/Writ/518/2021;

Page 10 of 12

d) although the successful bidders are different, the questions discussed in all above

four cases are more or less similar;

The learned Counsel who appeared for the successful bidder in CA/Writ/518/2021

pointed out that the Bid document submitted by the above Petitioners contained several

major deviations in terms of Clause 7.8.4 of the Procurement Guidelines making their bid

unacceptable in law.

On a careful perusal of the said Bid document P8, it is observed that the;

a) clause 45 of the Bid of the Petitioners (page 36 of the brief);

b) 3rd, 6th & 8th columns in the list of chemicals submitted by the Petitioners (page 47

of the brief);

c) 3rd column in the list of equipment (to be provided annually) submitted by the

Petitioners (page 48 of the brief); and

d) 3rd & 6th columns of the list of equipment (to be provided monthly) submitted by

the Petitioners (page 49 of the brief)

have not been filled by the Petitioners.

I have observed that the identical lapses on the part of the Petitioners existed in the bid in

relation to the case No. CA/Writ/518/2021 as well. The Petitioners contention in this

application is also that the Petitioners are only possessed with the document P8 which is

supposed to be an office copy. The 1st to 12th Respondents, in their statement of objections

filed in respect of this application also, have admitted P8 as the bid received by the

Procurement Entity. Petitioners have not taken effective measures for this Court to make

an order in view of paragraph (o) of the prayer of the Petition.

The pertinent questions arising at this stage in this application (which are similar to that

of case No. CA/Writ/518/2021) are as follows;

a) whether a party could claim relief in a judicial review application against another

whilst the claiming party is also at fault or his/her conduct is wrongful within the

same impugned process.

b) whether this is a fit case to adopt the doctrine of clean hands which is a root cause

of unreasonableness.

Page 11 of 12

I have dealt extensively on the principle of clean hands in my above judgement

CA/Writ/518/2021, where I have decided as follows;

I take the view that a party claiming relief against an irregularity of another stakeholder, in

a judicial review application, should come to Court with clean hands without having a record

of committing a similar irregularity within the same impugned process. I have approached

the said opinion as I strongly take the view that a person who applies for judicial review

should come to Court with clean mind & clean heart expressing the true conscience on the

objective which are, in my view, part and parcel of the doctrine of clean hands. My said

findings cannot be considered as imaginary as the policy of good governance is well

embodied in the objectives of the said Procurement Guidelines. There cannot be effective good

governance without good conscience, transparency & accountability within the relevant

government authorities and even within all the stakeholders. The theory of good governance

cannot be confined only towards the decision maker but it is an essential element on the part

of all the relevant stakeholders

I need to reiterate my above findings in this judgement as well and I hold that this is a fit

case to adopt clean hands doctrine. Furthermore, I take the view that my said findings

on the applicability of the doctrine of clean hands outweigh the asymmetry of the

document marked R15 which was discussed earlier. Additionally, I see that no material

prejudice has been caused to the Petitioners in respect of the said incomplete document

R15 as Petitioners rights have not been directly affected due to the reason that the

Petitioners are not the next lowest bidders among who submitted bids. As I have observed

above, the Petitioners have alleged in paragraph 83 of the Petition that the instant

application is also in the public interest.

At this stage, I am reminded of the judgement in Public Interest Law Foundation vs.

Central Environmental Authority and others, CA/Writ/527/2015 (decided on

24.02.2020), where His Lordship Justice Mahinda Samayawardhena J. held as follows;

Public interest litigation is a hallowed concept. Nevertheless, public interest litigation shall

not be converted to public vexatious litigation. Frivolous and vexatious applications cost the

judiciary and Government agencies dearly. Such applications inter alia impede the efficacy

of the Courts by detracting from the limited time and resources available to devote to cases

which legitimately deserve attention. Public interest litigation shall be a boon not a bane.

Page 12 of 12

I further observed that the Petitioners have failed to challenge the evaluation &

examination of TEC and of MPC at the Appeal stage and has not challenged the eligibility

of the 13th Respondent at the said Appeal stage. It is essential for this Court to adhere to

the norm which focuses in obtaining financially the most advantageous and qualitatively

the best services and supplies for the benefit of the country as a whole in view of the

Procurement Guidelines of 2006. Admittedly, the Ministry of Health already has awarded

the subject tender and also entered in to an agreement with the 13th Respondent. Even if

the Court is to consider the relief for a writ of Mandamus sought by the Petitioners,

directing the 1st to 12th Respondents to award the impugned tender to the Petitioners, I see,

there is no legal right existing for the Petitioners to call upon the judicial intervention of

this Court in that regard. Even if the Court decides to issue a writ of Certiorari as prayed

for in the prayer of the Petition, the next lowest bidder has a greater opportunity to be

successful as the Petitioners are not the next lowest bidders. Therefore, I take the view that

no substantive prejudice has been caused to the Petitioners by awarding the subject tender

to the 13th Respondent. In that event the probable damages that would be caused to the

Ministry of Health by changing the supplier of janitorial services at this crucial juncture in

the country should be seriously taken in to consideration vis--vis the respective indistinct

claim on public interest litigation by the Petitioners.

Bearing in mind such unnecessary prejudice that could be caused to the 1st and 2nd

Respondents and also on a careful consideration of the whole matter, I have come to the

conclusion that by reason of the special circumstances of this case, I should exercise my

discretion to refuse the application.

Application is dismissed. I order no costs.
