In construing rights this court cannot throw into jeopardy the entire fabric and administration of law and justice, nor can it condone or encourage accused persons who choose to be fugitives from justice seeking to invoke the law only when it suits their advantage. Fundamental concepts and duties must be preserved at all costs and one such fundamental concept is that the appellant must submit to the law and the courts and not abscond from them. Rights cannot be separated from duties enjoined by the law as to do so would lead to a disruption of the Rule of Law and the Administration of Justice.",

It is still evidence of a lesser weightage recognized in our law. Credibility of a witness may be impugned by employing the tests of probability and improbability consistence and inconsistence, interestedness and disinterestedness and spontaneity and belatedness. It is important to note that evidence must be weighed and never countered, in reviewing the veracity of a witness appellate Courts enforce certain rules and guidelines as they do not have the benefit of observing and questioning the witnesses first hand. We should not forget that credibility is a question of fact, not of law. The acceptance or rejection of evidence of witnesses is therefore a question of fact for the trial Judge.",
