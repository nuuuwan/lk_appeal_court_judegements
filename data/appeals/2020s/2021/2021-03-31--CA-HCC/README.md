This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence imposed on him

by the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle.

The accused was indicted before the High Court of Kegalle for having in his

possession an automatic firearm on or about 31 st March 2012, thereby

committing an offence punishable under section 22(3) read with section 22(1)

of the Firearms Ordinance.

After trial, the appellant was found guilty as charged by the learned High Court

Judge by his judgment dated 09-10-2019, and was sentenced to life in prison.

This is an action instituted based on an alleged recovery of a T-56 weapon from

the possession of the appellant. According to the evidence led on behalf of the

prosecution, the recovery has been made by a team of Police Officers of the

Criminal Investigation Department (CID) led by the PW-01 namely IP Nishantha

2

, -

De Silva. It was the position of the PW-Ol that on receiving information of the

T-56 weapon, he went to the house of the appellant on the morning of 31-03-

2012 with his team and recovered the mentioned weapon based on the

statement made to him by the appellant. The main piece of evidence relied on

by the prosecution has been the said recovery based on the alleged section 27

statement made by the appellant under the provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance marked p-o 1 at the trial. It has been stated that the weapon was

recovered about 35 meters away from the house of the appellant in a Habarala

thicket and it would not have been recovered if not for the statement of the

appellant.

It has been the consistent stand of the appellant that he was arrested in the

early hours of the 30th of March and not on the 31 st. It was his position that he

being a worker at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, was taken into a vehicle by a

group of persons around 4 am on the 30th while awaiting a bus to go for work,

and blindfolded, questioned, and taken to various places along with two other

persons a male and a female. According to his version of events he was taken

to Rambukkana and from there to Polonnaruwa where another person was

arrested and only on the morning of the 31 st that he was brought to his house

in Kegalle. The appellant has made a total denial that any weapon was

recovered from his custody on a statement made by him.

Interestingly, while under cross examination by the defence, PW-Ol has

admitted that he and his team of officers left their station in order to

investigate the information they received on possession of weapons on the 29th

of March and spent the night in Kegalle, and although they went in search of

the appellant around 6 am on the next day, namely on the 30th , he came to

know that the appellant was not in his home. It was his position that in order

to further investigate the matter, they went to Rambukkana and arrested a

female called Hansika and her father and along with them left to Polonnaruwa

looking for one Sam path but could not find him. According to the evidence

3

gIven by Pw-o 1 under cross examination, it was only after returning from

Polonnaruwa on the 31 st the recovery of aT-56 weapon was made from the

appellant's possession and his arrest was made.

PW-02 too, who has allegedly assisted the PW-Ol has denied that the

appellant was arrested on the 30th and the version of events as suggested by

the defence.

The defence has also brought to the notice of the Court of the fact that the wife

of the appellant has lodged a complaint with the Kegalle Police on the 30th

evening of her husband's failure to report to work at his place of work in

Colombo.

When called for a defence at the end of the prosecution case, the appellant has

chosen to give evidence and has also called his wife to substantiate his

evidence. She has marked as V-Ol, the complaint she made to the Kegalle

Police on the disappearance of her husband.

At the hearing of the appeal, it was the contention of the learned counsel for

the appellant that the evidence made available before the learned High Court

judge has failed to prove the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable

doubt. It was his position that in the High Court, the appellant has given

evidence and called a witness to testify on behalf of him and has faced the test

of cross examination before the Court. Therefore, it was his position that the

learned High Court Judge should have looked at the totality of the evidence in

its correct perspective and come to a firm finding as to the probability of the

version of events placed before the Court, which in his view stands in favour of

the version of the appellant. It was his position that the prosecution has failed

to divulge the material facts to the Court until raised by the defence and has

chosen to suppress evidence which would otherwise favour the appellant's

stand. He found fault with the prosecution for failing to call the father and the

daughter who was admittedly in the custody of the Police and had been present

at house of the appellant at the time of the alleged recovery of the weapon, 4

",

whose evidence would have revealed the actual truth and also would have

rebutted the evidence of the appellant if he was not telling the truth.

It was his contention that it was the duty of the prosecution to prove its case

beyond reasonable doubt and an accused person has no obligation as such

and it is enough for an accused person in a criminal trial to create a reasonable

doubt as to the prosecution case or to provide a reasonable explanation which

the appellant has done and the appellant should have been given the benefit of

the doubt.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General making submissions on behalf of the

Attorney General was gracious enough to admit that the prosecution has failed

to lead evidence on several factual matters which came to light during the

hearing of the appeal, and was of the view that he is no longer in a position to

defend the conviction in view of the same, for which the Court is thankful to

the learned Deputy Solicitor General.

In the instant action, in view of the total denial of the appellant that a weapon

was recovered from his possession or based on a statement made by him, the

onus was with the prosecution to prove that fact beyond reasonable doubt in

order to ensure the conviction of the appellant.

In the case of the Queen Vs. Sumanasena 66 NLR 350 it was stated that;

~In a criminal case suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt. Nor

does the proof of any number of suspicious circumstances relieve the

prosecution of its burden of proving the case against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt and compel the accused to give evidence or call

evidence.

Although section 31 of the Firearms Ordinance provides that any occupier of

any house or premises in which any gun shall be found shall for the purposes

of the Firearms Ordinance be deemed to be the possessor of the gun unless he

proves that he had no knowledge or some other person had the possession, as

5

contended correctly, I am of the view that the provisions of the section becomes

applicable only if the Court believes the evidence as to the recovery of the

Firearm as stated by the prosecution.

It was held in the case of Pantis Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 148

that;

"As the burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove its case

beyond reasonable doubt and no such duty is cast on the accused and it's

sufficient for the accused to give an explanation which satisfies the Court

or at least is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. "

There cannot be any argument that there is a duty cast upon the prosecution

witnesses to divulge the full truth as to what happened and not the

suppression of facts which they may think that are not favourable to the case

of the prosecution.

According to the facts revealed during the argument of the appeal, a female

called Hasanthi and her father has been in the custody of the PW-Ol when he

and his team allegedly visited the house of the appellant on the 31 st, a fact PW-

01 or PW-02 for that matter, failed to mention until questioned by the defence.

PW -01 has given his evidence in chief to show that it was only on the 31 st that

he visited the house of the appellant and recovered the weapon. But under

cross examination, it has been revealed that in fact, the Police team has visited

the area looking for the appellant on the morning of the 30th as well. The

evidence of PW-02 suggests that they have gone looking for the appellant

around 5 am, which fits the appellant's evidence as to the time he was taken in

by a group of people in civilian clothing.

According to the evidence of PW -01, when the alleged detection was made, the

weapon was found covered by plastic sheets and inside a black coloured bag. I

find that these items would have been vital pieces of evidence if produced in

Court to boost the prosecution version of events. Although the counsel for the

6

defence has asked about the black coloured bag and where it is now, other

than saying that it is available, it has never been produced as a production. I

find that it was important for the prosecution to clarify these matters at least

while during the re-examination of the witnesses since the stand of the

appellant has been that nothing was recovered based on a statement by him

and that he was taken into custody not on the 31 st but on the 30th.

Under the circumstances, the complaint made by the wife of the appellants is

also of vital importance. She has made the complaint marked V-01 at 5.40 pm.

on the 30th, the day the appellant alleges that he was taken in to custody. The

wife has given a clear reason to Kegalle Police as to why she is making the

complaint. There cannot be any reason for the wife to make such a complaint

expecting an imminent arrest as the prosecution evidence has been that they

went to the house of the appellant for the first time on the 31 st morning.

As mentioned before, the appellant has given evidence under oath in this trail

and has stated his defence. It is clear from the cross examination of the

appellant by the prosecution that, at no point the prosecution has challenged

the version of events as told by the appellant. I find that even the evidence of

the wife of the appellant has not been challenged on the material points, if the

prosecution wanted the Court to disbelieve them.

In the case of James Silva Vs. republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 SLR 167 at

176 it was held:

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider

all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by

the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and, ask himself

whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he

believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty. "

When considering the evidence as a whole, it is clear to me the stand taken by

the appellant as to his arrest on the 30th and the events that unfolded

7

thereafter IS more probable than that of the versIOn of events presented in

Court by the prosecution witnesses. I find that the prosecution witness

Number 01 and 02 was not truthful about the arrest of the appellant which is a

matter that goes into the root of the prosecution case against him. I am of the

view that a reasonable doubt has been created and a reasonable explanation

has been provided by the appellant in this action, which should have been

viewed in favour of him by the learned High Court Judge.

I am also of the view that since this an action instituted based solely on an

alleged section 27 statement made by the appellant to PW-Ol, it would be

unsafe to convict the appellant for the charge against him under the above-

mentioned circumstances.

Therefore, allowing the appeal, I set aside the conviction and the sentence

imposed, as it cannot be allowed to stand and acquit the appellant of the

charge.
