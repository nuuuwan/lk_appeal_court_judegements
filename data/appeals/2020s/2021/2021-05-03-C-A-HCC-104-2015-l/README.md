JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam J

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing murder of

Samarakoon Mudiyanselage Gunabanda on 23/12/2000 which is an

offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

The 2nd accused was charged under Section 198 of Penal Code for

concealing the dead body of the deceased Samarakoon Mudiyanselage

Gunabanda. At the initial stage of the trial the 2nd accused had pleaded

guilty to the charge and he was sentenced to 02 years RI suspended for 07

years.

After a non-jury trial, the Learned High Court Judge has found the

Appellant guilty of the charge and sentenced him to death on 24/07/2015.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the

Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellant was

connected via zoom from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself by concluding

the principal witness as an accomplice by accepting that

his testimony consisted of visible improbabilities that

does not match the standard of an accomplice or in

conflict with definition of an accomplice; however,

assessed the prosecution version accordingly and

4 | P a g e

thereby a conviction of Murder carrying capital

punishment solely based on such testimony is unsafe

and bad in law.

2. The Learned Trial Judge has misdirected himself by

placing total reliability on the most important witness

Wijetunga who had displayed a complete lack of

creditworthiness when defence counsel highlighted

several material omissions and thereby a conviction for

murder is not safe based on his testimony.

3. The Learned Trial Court Judge misdirected himself by

admitting and accepting inadmissible evidence specially

when Identity card was not produced before the court

and the Katty was recovered beyond the information

provided by the accused appellants evidence led under

section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance to arrive at the

conclusion that the accused appellant has a nexus to the

alleged offence, is bad in Law and thereby the conviction

is also unsafe and becomes bad in Law.

4. The Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself by not

considering that the prosecution has failed in their duty

to establish a nexus between gun recovered being the

one that accused appellant used to kill the deceased with

and thereby the evidence led at the trial fall short of the

standard required to prove its case beyond reasonable

doubt.

5. Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself by failure to

observe and consider that the prosecution has failed to

establish the time of death of the deceased which is vital

to prove the liability of the accused appellant since two

different and conflicting versions emerged in the

5 | P a g e

prosecution case and thereby the conviction is unsafe

and bad in Law.

6. Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself while analysing

the evidence by completely failing to consider the Dock

Statement of the accused appellant and its evidentiary

value failed to afford substance of a fair trial and adhere

to established Legal principles when arriving at the

conclusion of convicting the accused appellant caused

Miscarriage of Justice and thereby the conviction is

unsafe and bad in Law. (Learned Deputy Solicitor

General too conceded of this misdirection of the Learned

Trial Judge).

In this case PW01, K.M.Wijetunga was arrested along with the Appellant

and was remanded till he was granted a conditional pardon by the Hon.

Attorney General under Section 256 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979.

Background of the Case

According to PW01 on the date of the incident while he was in his chena

cultivation with his wife and children, around 9.00am heard a report of a

gun some distance away from his chena. At that time son of the Appellant

PW06 had come to his place and requested him to inquire about the gun

sound as he suspected that his fathers trap gun may have gone off. He had

accompanied the son of the Appellant and his son to the place of incident

and saw one of his uncles namely Gunabanda had sustained gunshot

injuries on his leg and fallen on the ground. As the hospital is situated very

far from the place of incident, he had first gone in search of a tractor to

take the deceased to the hospital. Having failed to find a tractor he had

gone with his wife to meet the Appellant and conveyed the message. The

6 | P a g e

Appellant was attending a funeral with his wife at that time. The trap gun

which had gone off was the trap gun set up by the Appellant.

After he informed the incident, the Appellant had told him not to worry as

he would take care of the injured and ordered him not to reveal the

incident to anyone. Thereafter, the Appellant armed with a gun and a

Katty, had accompanied him to the place of incident and fired shots at the

deceased after seeing him alive. At the same time the Appellant had dealt

several blows on the deceased with the Katty. This had happened around

6.30pm on that day.

On the following day, the Appellant, the 2nd accused and the witness had

gone to the place where the deceased was lying, the Appellant again dealt

several blows on the deceased and put his body into a gunny bag and

disposed it in a stream with the assistance of the 2nd accused. The

Appellant had also concealed the belongings of the deceased.

Thereafter he had stayed with the Appellant for about 03 days due to fear

and warning given to him. After that he had voluntarily gone to the police

station with PW04 Gramasevaka Premaratna on 28/12/2000 and divulged

the incident to the police and assisted the police to recover the dead body

and the belongings of the deceased.

After the conclusion of the prosecution case, the defence was called and the

Appellant made a dock statement. In his dock statement he had taken up

the position that he was attending the funeral on that day and denied the

incident. He further said that he suspects that the PW01 would have killed

the deceased.

In the first ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the Learned Trial

Judge misdirected himself by concluding that the principal witness as an

accomplice by accepting that his testimony consisted of visible

improbabilities that does not match the standard of an accomplice or in

conflict with definition of an accomplice; however, assessed the prosecution

7 | P a g e

version accordingly and thereby a conviction of murder carrying capital

punishment solely based on such testimony is unsafe and bad in law.

According to sec. 114 (b) of the Evidence Ordinance, accomplice is

unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material particulars.

According to sec. 133 of the Evidence Ordinance an accomplice shall be a

competent witness against an accused person and a conviction is not illegal

merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an

accomplice.

In the case of De Saram v The Republic of Sri Lanka 2002 SLR Vol 1 page

296 the Honorable Judge states that sec. 133 of the Evidence Ordinance is

an absolute rule of evidence while sec. 114 (b) is a rule of guidance.

Additionally, in the aforementioned case it is stated that in order to take a

witness in light of S. 114(b) and S. 133 of the Evidence Ordinance, the

court should first clarify whether the said witness can be considered as an

Accomplice.

In the case of King v. Peiris Appuhamy 43 NLR 412 it is was held:

Even assuming that after the murder had been committed the witness

had assisted in removing the body to the pit and that he could have

been charged with concealment of the body under S.198 of the Penal

Code that was an offence perfectly independent of the murder and the

witness could not rightly be held to be either a guilty associate with

the accused in the crime of murder or liable to be indicted with him

jointly. The witness was therefore not an accomplice and the rule of

practice as to be corroborated had no application to the case.

8 | P a g e

Similarly, in Queen v E.H Ariyawantha 59 NLR 241 it was stated that,

burden of proving a witness to be an accomplice for the purpose of

inducing jury to presume that he is unworthy of credit unless

corroborated in material particulars, is upon the party alleging it.

According to E.R.S.R.Coomaraswamy in his book titled The Law of

Evidence Vol. II, Book I at page 364, it is stated with approval the following

passage from Wharton on Criminal Evidence 11th Ed. Vol. II at page 1229

An accomplice is a person who knowingly, voluntarily and with common

intent with the principal offender unites in the commission of a crime. The

term cannot be used in a loose or popular sense so as to embrace one who

has guilty knowledge or is morally delinquent or who was an admitted

participant in a related but distinct offence. To constitute one an

accomplice, he must perform some act or take some part in the commission

of the crime, or owe some duty to the person in danger that makes it

incumbent on him to prevent its commission.

In this case PW01 had only witnessed the sequence of events until the

concealment of the dead body and the belongings of the deceased. He has

not taken part in committing the offence or concealing the dead body. He is

the person who had furnished information to police and helped to recover

the dead body and other productions. He had kept silent for a few days due

to fear for the Appellant. Further he had only informed the Appellant upon

his failure to find a tractor to transport the deceased to a hospital. When he

went to inform the incident to the Appellant, he had accompanied his wife

who was named as witness No.PW07 by the prosecution.

Considering the above cited judicial decisions, especially King v. Peiris

Appuhamy (supra) PW01 is not an accomplice in this case. Therefore, no

necessity arises to corroborate his evidence by the prosecution in this case.

9 | P a g e

Even though, no necessity arises to corroborate the testimony of PW01 his

testimony has been corroborated not only by the medical and police

evidence but also with other additional corroborative evidence.

In this case PW01 K.M.Wijetunga is an eye witness. His evidence is not

tainted with improbabilities or with any visible ambiguity. Therefore, acting

on PW01s evidence will not prejudice the Appellants rights.

In his second ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the Learned

Trial Judge has misdirected himself by placing total reliability on the most

important witness Wijetunga who had displayed a complete lack of

creditworthiness when defense counsel highlighted several material

omissions and thereby a conviction for murder is not safe based on his

testimony.

PW01 in his evidence stated that when he saw the deceased with the leg

injury, he had dressed up the wound using his sons T-shirt. But the

defence highlighted this as an omission as the witness had not said this in

his statement to police.

The second omission highlighted is that the failure to inform police that he

went in search of a tractor after leaving the two children at the place of

incident.

The third omission highlighted is that the failure to testify in the non-

summary inquiry that the Appellant had struck the deceased with the butt

of the gun.

The fourth omission highlighted is that the failure to inform the police that

the Appellant had suggested to dispose the dead body as the deceased had

passed away.

The fifth omission highlighted is that the failure to inform the police that

the Appellant had struck the deceaseds body with a Katty.

10 | P a g e

The importance of an omission in criminal trials has been discussed in

several judicial decisions by the Appellate Courts of our country. It is

pertinent to discuss whether the above-mentioned omissions have any

adverse effect on the evidence given by PW01 in this case.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgement on the nature of the

inconsistency or contradiction and whether they are material to the

facts in issue. Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter

and assail the basic version of the witness cannot be given too much

importance.

Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling

discrepancies and omissions. When contradictions are marked, the

Judge should direct his attention to whether they are material or not

and the witness should be given an opportunity of explaining the

matter.

Now I consider whether the aforementioned omissions are material and

affect the trustworthiness and creditworthiness of the evidence of PW01.

The incident happened on 23/12/2000 and the PW01 had given evidence

before the High Court on 27/01/2011 after about 10 years of the incident.

Considering the omissions and the passage of time passed after the

incident a reasonable court cannot expect hundred percent accurate

evidence from a witness. The Appellate Courts have repeatedly endorsed

this position in several decided cases.

11 | P a g e

Justice Thakkar in Bhoginbhai Hirigibhai v State of Gujarat 1983 AIR SC

753 stated:

Discrepancies which do not go to the matter and shake the basic

version of the witnesses therefore cannot be annexed with undue

importance. More so when the all-important probabilities-factors

echoes in favour of the version narrated by the witnesses.

Considering the totality of evidence of PW01 the omissions highlighted by

the Appellant do not go to the root of the prosecutions case. It is

noteworthy to mention that the defence was unable to mark a single

contradiction from the evidence of PW01.

The third ground urged by the Appellant is that the Learned Trial Court

Judge misdirected himself by admitting and accepting inadmissible

evidence specially when the Identity card was not produced before the

court Katty was recovered beyond the information provided by the accused

appellant evidence led under section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance to

arrive at the conclusion that the accused appellant has a nexus to the

alleged offence, is bad in Law and thereby the conviction is also unsafe and

becomes bad in Law.

At the High Court trial PW15 CI/Wedagedera giving evidence stated that

upon the statement of the Appellant he had recovered several items

including a Katty and an Identity card. The relevant extract of the

statement of the Appellant was marked as P08. The same was already

marked at the non-summary inquiry as P04. The relevant portion

pertaining to recover of the Katty was marked as P4(b) and the relevant

portion pertaining to recover the Identity card was marked as P4(e).

Although he mentioned about the recovery of the Identity card belonging to

the deceased at the High Court Trial, the prosecution has failed to mark

the same in the proceedings. Hence the Appellant argues that the learned

12 | P a g e

High Court Judge has placed much reliance on inadmissible evidence in

his judgment.

In Queen v Kularatne 1968 NLR 529 it was held that:

We wish to observe that in a criminal case, the identity of the

productions must be accurately proved by the direct evidence which is

available and not by way of inference.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge has not fully relied on the

evidence pertaining to the recovery of the identity card but he has placed

greater reliance on other evidence to come to his decision. Hence no

prejudice has been caused to the Appellant by only referring to the recovery

of an identity card.

The Appellant also argues that considering evidence pertaining to recovery

of the Katty under section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance raises doubt

and therefore the conviction is bad in law.

The investigating officer PW15 had narrated how he has conducted the

investigation and arrested the Appellant. In his evidence he clearly

mentioned that the Katty was recovered in consequence of the statement

made by the Appellant. The Katty was marked as P01 and the relevant

portion of the statement of the Appellant was marked as P8 under Section

27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

The admissibility of an accuseds statement under section 27(1) of the

Evidence Ordinance had been discussed in several cases by the superior

court of this county.

Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows:

Provided that, when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of

information received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody

of a police officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to a

13 | P a g e

confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered may be

proved.

In De Saram v The Republic of Sri Lanka [2002] 1 SLR page 288 held

that:

for the basis of admissibility of the accused statement was not that

the accused confessed to the crime but the fact that he knew where the

deceaseds body was buried. Evidence of the accuseds information

was therefore admissible under section 27(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

In this case after the arrest of the Appellant the investigating officer had

properly followed the necessary requirements under section 27(1) of

Evidence Ordinance and had recovered a Katty and presented it to court

properly to establish nexus to the alleged offence by the Appellant. As no

improper procedure has been followed to adduce this evidence in the trial,

the Learned High Court Judge had very correctly considered this as

admissible evidence in his judgment. Hence no prejudice has been caused

to the Appellant.

The fourth appeal ground urged by the Appellant is that the Learned Trial

Judge misdirected himself by not considering that the prosecution has

failed in their duty to establish a nexus between the gun recovered being

the one that accused appellant used to kill the deceased with and thereby

the evidence led at the trial fall short of the standard required to prove its

case beyond reasonable doubt.

The gun which had been marked as P02 was recovered upon the statement

made by the Appellant. PW01 giving evidence very correctly had identified

the gun as belonging to the Appellant which had been used to shoot the

deceased. This evidence was never challenged during cross examination by

the defence. As this evidence was not challenged or contradicted the

Learned Judge had very correctly considered this evidence in his judgment.

14 | P a g e

In his fifth ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the Learned Trial

Judge misdirected himself by failure to observe and consider, that the

prosecution has failed to establish the time of death of the deceased which

is vital to prove the liability of the accused appellant since two different and

conflicting versions emerged in the prosecution case and thereby the

conviction is unsafe and bad in Law.

The PW01 in his evidence stated that when he accompanied the Appellant

to the place of incident after informing the incident, the deceased was still

alive and he had again insisted that the deceased should be taken to the

hospital. But contrary to his request the Appellant had opened fire and

dealt several blows with a Katty on the deceased and killed him. After that

the Appellant had told him that the deceased was dead and requested his

assistance to dispose the body. According to PW01 the time was around

6.30pm. Due to his refusal the body was disposed on the following day with

the assistance of the 2nd accused. Hence with this evidence the prosecution

without any contradiction established the time of death in this case.

Further, the doctor who had performed the post-mortem examination on

03/01/2000 had observed that the dead body was swollen and had

reached complete putrefaction. He also opined that the deceased would

have died before his body was dumped into the water.

Hence with the eye witnesss evidence and the medical evidence considered

above, the prosecution has clearly proved that the deceased had died on

23/12/2000 around 6.30pm.

In the final ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned

Trial Judge misdirected himself while analysing the evidence by completely

failing to consider the Dock Statement of the accused appellant and its

evidentiary value failed to afford substance of a fair trial and adhere to

established Legal principles when arriving at the conclusion of convicting

the accused appellant caused Miscarriage of Justice and thereby the

15 | P a g e

conviction is unsafe and bad in Law. (Learned Deputy Solicitor General too

conceded of this misdirection of the Learned Trial Judge).

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant had fortified his argument by citing

number of judgments on this point.

On perusal of the High Court Judgment, it is not correct to say that the

Learned High Court Judge had not considered the Dock Statement of the

Appellant in his judgment. At page 220 of brief the Trial Judge had fully

mentioned the contents of the Dock Statement and at page 227 of the brief

he had analysed one point after considering the same. But no further

consideration of the Dock Statement is present thereafter in his judgment.

In Dharmadasa v Director General, Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and Another [2003] 1 Sri.L.R 64

Gunesekera J after examining the evidence of the Appellant in some details

held:

I am of the view that no credence whatever could be given to the

evidence of the Appellant.

Following the above-mentioned Supreme Court Judgment now I consider

whether a substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred due to the failure

to consider the Dock Statement of the Appellant in its entirety. In the High

Court Trial, the Appellant had taken up the defence of total denial by

suggesting that the PW01 was the person who committed the murder of the

deceased. In his Dock Statement he had taken up the defence of alibi

which had never been put to the prosecution witnesses. Considering his

dual standard defence taken up during the trial, in my view will not

substantially shake the prosecution case. Hence, I conclude that no

substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred in this case.

For the reasons stated above, we are of the view that there is no merit in

any of the appeal grounds urged by the counsel for the Appellant. The

evidence presented by the prosecution establishes beyond reasonable

16 | P a g e

doubt that the Appellant is guilty of the charge with which he has been

convicted.

Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed and

dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
