JUDGEMENT

Plaintiff-Respondent instituted a partition action to partition two allotments of land, shown as

Lot 4A, 4B, 4C, 5A, 5B, 5C and 5D in the Preliminary Plan NO.846 dated 12.07.1997. The

5th Defendant of the partition case claimed the prescriptive right to Lot 5D of the preliminary

plan and prayed to exclude that from the partition. The 6th Defendant, with his father, the 7th

Defendant claimed Lots 4A, 4B, 4C, 5B and 5C on prescription. The 8th Defendant claimed

Lot 4B.

After the trial at the District Court, District Judge delivered the judgment on 28.11.1996 and

held that the land described in the preliminary plan should be partitioned among the Plaintiff

and 1st to 4th Defendants and exclude Lot 5D. Accordingly, District Judge had dismissed the

claim of the 6th Defendant.

While the case was proceeding, the 8th Defendant had settled with Plaintiff and the 1st to 4th

Defendants. Therefore, on payment of Rs.1000/=, Lot 4B was given to the 8th Defendant.

However, the judgment was silent on anything regarding 8th Defendant. This settlement is

found in the proceedings of the 20th day of June 1984.

Aggrieved by the judgment, the 6th Defendant had filed this Petition of Appeal. On the written

submissions and at the argument, the 6th Defendant-Appellant took the stand that the learned

District Judge had not adequately analyzed the Plaintiff's pedigree.

According to Plaintiff, his pedigree arises from the interlocutory decree in case No.11922.

Further, the Plaint states that Charles Appuhamy and Davith Appuhamy bought Lot 4 and Lot

5 in case No.11922 by a certificate of sale marked as [P1]. Charles Appuhamy sold his share

by Deed No.6111 attested by N.U.A. Wijesiriwardena, N.P. on 11.01.1960 to the 1st and the

2nd Plaintiffs. Thereby, the Plaintiffs become co-owners to share of Lots 4 and Lot 5 of case

No.11922. Davith, who bought the balance share, died leaving his heirs as 1st to 4th

Defendants.

The 6th Defendant-Appellant argues that the order in case No:11922 was to divide the land

among 24 co-owners. The interlocutory decree does not hold an order to sell; it only speaks of

a partition of the corpus among co-owners. The idea of a sale was introduced after entering the

interlocutory decree, which came into the case much later, on 19th June 1928. It was on 19. 06.

1928 an order was made to sell the land in blocks according to Plan No.5495. As the law does

not allow for amending the decree in a partition case, the decree to sale becomes null and void.

The 6th Defendant-Appellant contends that there were no provisions in the partition law to sell

in blocks as of 1928.

When perusing the contest points, the case record carries no points on behalf of the 6th and 7th

Defendants. Even though an argument is formed in this court regarding points raised by the6th

and 7th Defendants, it is not fair to say that the learned District Judge had not given his mind to

points that were not raised for his consideration.

Furthermore, the 6th Defendant had opted to be silent regarding the earlier partition case. No

points were raised and discussed regarding case no 1192 at the District Court. Therefore, the

other party had no opportunity to address those points. Even in the Petition of Appeal dated

24th January 1997, there is no mention of facts spoken in the argument and written submission

by the 6th Defendant-Appellant regarding the earlier partition case.

The Appellant had overlooked to inform this court of the points that had not been evaluated in

the judgment. Instead, it appears that the Appellant was trying to make a new case.

The main reason for settling points of the contest is for parties to build up the case on those

points. According to law, points of the contest can be raised at any point in the case. If

Appellant brought to the notice of court at any point of the trial regarding the point he is trying

to argue now, District Judge would have raised and answered a point when writing the

judgment.

On the other hand, if what had happened in partition case No.11922 needs to be challenged, it

should be in an appeal against any order or judgment entered in; that case and not in this case.

Whatever happened in case No.11922 is a deciding factor and as it is a judgment in rem. All

parties, including the learned District Judge who entered the present case's judgment, are bound

by that final decree. As no appropriate court had altered the judgment and final decree in case

No.11922, it cannot be challenged now.

Therefore, there is no reason to set aside the judgment entered by the learned District Judge in

this case. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
