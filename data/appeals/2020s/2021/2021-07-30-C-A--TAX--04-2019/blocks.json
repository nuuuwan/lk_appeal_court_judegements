I am of the opinion that the provisions of Article 126 (5) are directory and not mandatory.

That matter was decided in favour of the Respondent, with the Court holding the latter to be the case.",

Furthermore, to declare that the TAC is functus officio upon expiry of the time frame would be unreasonable to both parties for the reasons enunciated above. However, that is not to say that this Court endorses significant delays on the part of the TAC, rather, it is merely acknowledging that the construction most agreeable to justice and reason is that the time frame prescribed in Section 10 of the TAC Act it is merely directory. The duty of this Court is not to legislate, but to interpret legislation. Legislation is the prerogative of the Legislature. It is therefore the duty of the Legislature to specify what penal consequence or remedy,",

Firstly, criterion (ii) of Section 7 (1) (c) and criterion (iv) of Section 7 (1) (b) (vi) (as detailed above in this judgement) both address the need for the service to be supplied to a client/person outside Sri Lanka. Secondly, criterion (iii) of Section 7 (1) (c) requires the service to be consumed or utilised outside Sri Lanka. Thirdly, criterion (i) of Section 7 (1) (c) and the entire Section 7 (1) (b) (vi) taken together require this Court to determine whether the Appellant supplies a client support service. Finally, criterion (iii) of Section 7 (1) (b) (vi) requires that the Appellant company be an enterprise set up exclusively for the provision of client support services.",

The Counsels argument has some merit, though it is ultimately flawed. Aitken Spence involved three parties, namely a Foreign Tour Operator outside Sri Lanka (analogous to AIPL in the instant case), foreign tourists (who the Appellant submits are analogous to the subscribers in the instant case), and the resident company Aitken Spence Travels Limited (which is analogous to ALANKA).",

This would allow for the foreign client to cater to its customers at a lower cost, for the Sri Lankan business concerned to be set up, thus creating employment opportunities, and most importantly of all, for the Sri Lankan Government to receive revenue owing to the receipt of foreign currency through a bank.",
