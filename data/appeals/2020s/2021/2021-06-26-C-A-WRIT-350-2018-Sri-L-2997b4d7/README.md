Argued on: 20th October 2020 Written Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 5th October 2020 and 15th Submissions: December 2020

Decided on: 7th June 2021 Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The Petitioner, Sri Lankan Catering Limited has filed this application seeking inter alia

the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the arbitral award dated 17th August 2018 marked

X10 delivered by the 6th Respondent under and in terms of the Industrial

Disputes Act, as amended (the Act);

(b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the publication of the said award in Extraordinary

Gazette No. 2090/43 dated 28th September 2018 marked X10a.

In terms of the said award, the Petitioner was required to pay the 1st 4th

Respondents a sum of Rs. 1,016,199, Rs. 1,419,836, Rs. 844,410 and Rs. 847,183

respectively, being the bonus, salary increment and the extra gratuity that the

3

Arbitrator had decided that the 1st 4th Respondents are entitled to in terms of a

Collective Agreement that the Petitioner had entered into with Sri Lanka Nidahas

Sevaka Sangamaya on 28th November 2014.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner admits that it entered into a Collective Agreement on 28th September

2010 marked X7(R4) (the 2010 Collective Agreement) with the Sri Lanka Nidahas

Sevaka Sangamaya, a registered Trade Union for the period 1st April 2010 to 31st

March 2013.

In terms of Section 5(1) of the Act, a collective agreement means an agreement

(a) which is between

(i) any employer or employers, and

(ii) any workmen or any trade union or trade unions consisting of

workmen, and

(b) which relates to the terms and conditions of employment of any workman,

or to the privileges, rights or duties of any employer or employers or any

workmen or any trade union or trade unions consisting of workmen, or to

the manner of settlement of any industrial dispute.

Section 5(2) goes onto state that:

Reference shall be made in the collective agreement to the parties and trade

unions to which, and the employers and workmen to whom, the agreement

relates.

According to Clause 4.2 of the 2010 Collective Agreement, the Sri Lanka Nidahas

Sevaka Sangamaya represented at least 51% of the Graded Staff employed on a

permanent capacity in Grades 1-7 at the Petitioner company. It is admitted that the

2010 Collective Agreement had expired on 31st March 2013 and that the parties did

not enter into a fresh Collective Agreement soon thereafter.

4

The Petitioner states that pursuant to negotiations with the Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka

Sangamaya, the Petitioner entered into a fresh Collective Agreement on 28th

November 2014 marked X7(R5), with the effective date of the new Agreement

being back dated to 1st April 2013. The new Agreement (the Collective Agreement)

was valid for a period of three years from 1st April 2013 to 31st March 2016.

The 1st 4th Respondents, having joined the Petitioner between 1982 1991, had

retired from service on the following dates:

Respondent Date of retirement

1st Respondent 27th August 2014

2nd Respondent 26th August 2014

3rd Respondent 04th March 2014

4th Respondent 23rd September 2014

It is therefore admitted that by the time the new Collective Agreement was entered

into, all four Petitioners had retired from service, on the aforementioned dates.

In terms of Clause 3.2 of the Collective Agreement, all paid up members of the said

Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya who are employees of the Petitioner in a

permanent capacity in Grades 1-7 of the Graded Staff structure were covered by the

said Collective Agreement. In addition, in terms of Clause 3.4 thereof, the said

Collective Agreement was extended to Other individual employees who are

employed on a permanent capacity in Grades 1-7 of the Graded Staff structure who

are not members of the SLNSS but who nevertheless wish to accept the terms and

conditions of this Agreement by signing on an individual basis. It is admitted that the

Petitioner complied with Clause 3.4 and that even the President and the Secretary of

the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya, the trade union to which the 1st 4th Respondents

belonged had accepted the terms and conditions of the Collective Agreement vide

declarations marked X7-R6a and X7-R6b signed a few days after the Collective

Agreement had been signed.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner also submitted that the said Collective

Agreement has been published in the Gazette by the Commissioner General of

5

Labour in terms of Section 6 of the Act. She submitted that as provided for in the

proviso to Section 6, the Commissioner shall not cause such agreement to be so

published unless he is satisfied that those terms and conditions are not less

favourable than those applicable to any other workmen in the same or a similar

industry in such district.

It is admitted that those employees of the Petitioner who were members of the Sri

Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya and those who had agreed to the terms of the said

Collective Agreement were eligible to the following benefits:

a) Clause 10.1 Guaranteed salary increments from 2013 2016;

b) Clause 11 Payment of bonus

c) Clause 12 Payment of allowances

d) Clause 19 Payment of overtime.

As the 1st 4th Respondents had retired from service by the time the said Collective

Agreement was executed, the question of them agreeing to the terms and conditions

of the said Collective Agreement did not arise. Thus, on the face of it, the said

Collective Agreement did not apply to the 1st 4th Respondents. However, the 1st

4th Respondents claimed that they are eligible to the payment of the above benefits

provided for in the said Collective Agreement and to have their gratuity re-calculated

on the revised salary that they should have received, on the basis that they were

employees of the Petitioner during the operative period of the said Collective

Agreement i.e. the period starting from 1st April 2013 until the date that each of

them retired from service of the Petitioner.

This claim of the 1st 4th Respondents had been rejected by the Petitioner. The 1st

4th Respondents had thereafter lodged a complaint with the Department of Labour in

this regard. In the absence of a resolution of the said dispute, the Minister of Labour,

acting in terms of Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act and by an Order dated

2nd September 2016, referred the following dispute for resolution by arbitration:

6

Whether the claim made by Mr. T.D. Sunil Dayaratne, Mr. K.D.K.Jagath

Kamalpem, W.N.P.Fernando and Mr. W.A.A. Donald Raaj Kumar who worked at

Sri Lanka Catering Limited to be given bonus, increases in salary and arrears of

gratuity for the period 1st April 2014 to the retirement date of each employee,

following the backdating of the Collective Agreement signed on 28th November

2014 to 1st April 2013 is just, and if so, to what reliefs each of them is entitled.

The inquiry before the 6th Respondent arbitrator had been held over several days,

with each of the Respondents and an employee of the Petitioner giving evidence. By

his award marked X10 the 6th Respondent had directed the Petitioner to pay the 1st

4th Respondents the aforementioned sums of money. Aggrieved by the said award,

the Petitioner filed this application seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said

award and the award that had been published in the Gazette.

Before I proceed to consider the arguments presented to this Court by the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner, it would be useful to lay down the role of the arbitrator,

as provided for in Section 17(1) of the Act in the following manner:

When an industrial dispute has been referred under section 3(1)(d) or section

4(1) to an arbitrator for settlement by arbitration, he shall make all such

inquiries into the dispute as he may consider necessary, hear such evidence as

may be tendered by the parties to the dispute, and thereafter make such award

as may appear to him just and equitable.

In Brown & Company v. Minister of Labour1, the Supreme Court, having analysed

the duty conferred on an arbitrator to make an award which is just and equitable

held as follows:

Arbitration under the Industrial Disputes Act is intended to be even more

liberal, informal and flexible than commercial arbitration, primarily because the

Arbitrator is empowered to make an award which is "just and equitable". When

an industrial dispute has been referred under Section 3 (1)(d) or Section 4(1) of

the Industrial Disputes Act to an Arbitrator for settlement by arbitration, Section

17(1) of the said Act requires such Arbitrator to "make all such inquiries into the

1(2011) 1 Sri LR 305; Marsoof, J.

7

dispute as he may consider necessary, hear such evidence as may be tendered

by the parties to the dispute, and thereafter make such award as may appear to

him just and equitable". In my view, the word "make" as used in the said

provision, has the effect of throwing the ball into the Arbitrator's court, so to

speak, and requires him to initiate what inquiries he considers are necessary.

The Arbitrator is not simply called upon "to hold an inquiry", where the ball

would be in the court of the parties to the dispute and, it would be left to them

to tender what evidence they consider necessary requiring the arbitrator to be

just a judge presiding over the inquiry, the control and progress of which will be

in the hands of the parties themselves or their Counsel. What the Industrial

Disputes Act has done appears to me to be to substitute in place of the rigid

procedures of the law envisaged by the "adversarial system", a new and more

flexible procedure, which is in keeping with the fashion in which equity in English

law gave relief to the litigants from the rigidity of the common law. The function

of the arbitral power in relation to industrial disputes is to ascertain and declare

what in the opinion of the Arbitrator ought to be the respective rights and

liabilities of the parties as they exist at the moment the proceedings are

instituted. His role is more inquisitorial, and he has a duty to go in search for the

evidence, and he is not strictly required to follow the provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance in doing so. Just as much as the procedure before the arbitrator is not

governed by the rigid provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, the procedure

followed by him need not be fettered by the rigidity of the law.

In Municipal Council Colombo vs Munasinghe2 it was held by Chief Justice

H.N.G.Fernando as follows:

I hold that when the Industrial Disputes Act confers on an Arbitrator the

discretion to make an award which is 'just and equitable', the Legislature did not

intend to confer on an Arbitrator the freedom of a wild horse. An award must be

'just and equitable' as between the parties to a dispute; and the fact that one

party might have encountered 'hard times' because of personal circumstances

for which the other party is in no way responsible is not a ground on which

justice or equity requires the other party to make undue concessions. In

addition, it is time that this Court should correct what seems to be a prevalent

misconception. The mandate which the Arbitrator in an industrial dispute holds

under the law requires him to make an award which is just and equitable, and

not necessarily an award which favours an employee. An Arbitrator holds no

licence from the Legislature to make any such award as he may please, for

nothing is just and equitable which is decided by whim or caprice or by the toss

of a double-headed coin.

In Ceylon Tea Plantations Company Limited vs Ceylon Estate Staff Union,

Rajaratnam, J held that:3

A just and equitable order must be fair by all parties. It never means the safe

guarding of the interest of the workman alone.

I shall now proceed to consider the arguments of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner in order to decide whether the award made by the Arbitrator is supported

by the evidence that was available to him and whether the award is just and

equitable by both parties.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the 1st 4th Respondents are

not eligible to receive any benefits under the said Collective Agreement, as they were

not employees of the Petitioner on the date that the said Agreement was executed

and therefore was not in a position to accept the terms thereof, as provided by

Clause 3.4. As noted earlier, the position of the 1st 4th Respondents was that

irrespective of the date of execution of the Collective Agreement, they were

employed at the Petitioner for periods extending from 11 18 months during the

validity period of the said Collective Agreement, and therefore they are eligible to

receive the benefits conferred by it.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner thereafter drew my attention to the following

clauses of the Collective Agreement, which are re-produced below.

Clause 6.4 This agreement shall specifically exclude all those who have ceased to

be employees of the company prior to the date of signing this Agreement.

3 SC Appeal 211/72; SC Minutes of 15th May 1974.

9

Clause 9.3 - The above salary scales, applicable allowances and other enhanced

benefits given in this Agreement will be applicable to those staff who are in

employment at the date of signing the Agreement.

Clause 9.4 (Eligibility) All permanent employees (confirmed as well as probationers)

actively in service as at 1st April 2013 and who are still actively in service on the date

of signing of the agreement are eligible to enjoy the benefits of the CBA.

Clause 10.2 The actual individual monthly basic salaries after the performance

based increment in April each year for all employees who are covered by this

Agreement and in active service at the time of execution of this Agreement will be

increased as per the schedule below effective 1st Aril 2013 ....

Clause 10.3 - The above salary scales and grades will only be applicable to

employees covered by the Agreement and in employment as at the date of signing of

the Agreement....

To my mind, the above provisions make it extremely clear that the 1st 4th

Respondents, who admittedly were not in active service on the date of execution of

the Collective Agreement are not eligible to receive any benefits thereunder, even

though the 1st 4th Respondents may have served a period covered by the said

Collective Agreement.

The above provisions are consistent with the provisions of Section 8 of the Act, which

reads as follows:

(1) Every collective agreement which is for the time being in force shall, for

the purposes of this Act, be binding on the parties, trade unions, employers

and workmen referred to in that agreement in accordance with the

provisions of section 5(2); and the terms of the agreement shall be implied

terms in the contract of employment between the employers and workmen

bound by the agreement.

(2) Where there are any workmen in any industry who are bound by a

collective agreement, the employer in that industry shall, unless there is a

10

provision to the contrary in that agreement, observe in respect of all

other workmen in that industry terms and conditions of employment which

are not less favourable than the terms and conditions set out in that

agreement.

I shall now consider the reasoning of the Arbitrator that prompted him to grant relief

notwithstanding the above clauses.

The first ground relied upon by the Arbitrator is the following definition of workman

in the Act:

workman means any person who has entered into or works under a contract

with an employer in any capacity, whether the contract is expressed or implied,

oral or in writing, and whether it is a contract of service or of apprenticeship, or

a contract personally to execute any work or labour, and includes any person

ordinarily employed under any such contract whether such person is or is not in

employment at any particular time, and includes any person whose services

have been terminated.

It is not only correct but also logical that the definition of a workman extends to a

person whose services have been terminated. If not, an employee whose services

have been terminated cannot invoke any of the provisions of the Act to seek relief

for unlawful termination. The definition must however be applied to a particular

context. In this application, the context is, who are the workmen to whom the

Collective Agreement would apply. To answer this question, one needs to examine

the provisions of the Agreement. Once that is done, it would become clear that the

Agreement does not apply to those who were not in employment on the date the

Collective Agreement was executed. In such circumstances, I am of the view that the

fact that the definition of a workman extends to a person whose services have been

terminated does not assist the 1st 4th Respondents. The Arbitrator has therefore

clearly erred when he extended the applicability of the Collective Agreement to the

1st 4th Respondents.

The next ground relied upon by the Arbitrator to hold that the Collective Agreement

applied to the 1st 4th Respondent is his finding that the Petitioner deliberately

11

delayed the execution of the said Collective Agreement in order to victimise the 1st

4th Respondents who belonged to a union affiliated to a rival political party. This

finding is erroneous for the following three reasons:

a) The 2nd Respondent has admitted in cross examination that the delay was due

to the inefficiency of the Unions;4

b) The Petitioner has presented evidence that a total of ten employees had retired

during the period commencing 1st April 2013 and ending on 28th November

2014, as well as that 104 employees had ceased employment during that period

due to a variety of reasons;5

c) The Petitioner had permitted members of the Trade Union to which the 1st 4th

Respondents belonged, to agree to the terms and conditions of the said

Collective Agreement.6

It is therefore clear that the justification that the Arbitrator has sought to give to his

conclusions is not supported by the evidence that was before him.

Whether a Court can intervene when there is no evidence to support the finding of

the administrative body has been discussed in Administrative Law by Wade and

Forsyth7 in the following manner:

No evidence does not mean only a total dearth of evidence. It extends to any

case where the evidence, taken as a whole, is not reasonably capable of

supporting the finding; or where, in other words, no tribunal could reasonably

reach that conclusion on that evidence. This no evidence principle clearly has

something in common with the principle that perverse or unreasonable action is

unauthorised and ultra vires. It also has some affinity with the substantial

evidence rule of American law, which requires that findings be supported by

substantial evidence on the record as a whole.

In Heath and Company (Ceylon) Limited vs Kariyawasam,8 the Supreme Court held

that in the assessment of evidence, an arbitrator appointed under the Industrial

Disputes Act must act judicially. Where his finding is completely contrary to the

weight of evidence, such a finding can only be described as being perverse and his

award is liable to be quashed by way of Certiorari.

This position has been confirmed in several other decisions of this Court as well as

the Supreme Court. In All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union vs

Nestle Lanka Limited9 this Court held as follows:

The arbitrator to whom a reference has been made in terms of section 4 (1) of

the Industrial Disputes Act as amended is expected to act judicially. He is

required in arriving at his determinations to decide legal questions affecting the

rights of the subject and hence he is under a duty to act judicially. Although such

arbitrator does not exercise judicial power in the strict sense, it is his duty to act

judicially.

It has been stressed that such an arbitrator's function is judicial in the sense that

he has to hear parties, decide facts, apply rules with judicial impartiality and his

decision is objective as that of any court of law, though ultimately he makes

such award as may appear to him to be just and equitable. Vide the decision

in Nadaraja Limited and 3 others. v. Krishnadasan and 3 others10.

Thus, there is no evidence or material which has been adduced which could

support the aforesaid inference and findings reached by the fourth respondent.

Findings and decisions unsupported by evidence are capricious, unreasonable or

arbitrary.

The Supreme Court, in Singer Industries (Ceylon) Limited vs The Ceylon Mercantile

Industrial and General Workers Union and others11 agreeing with the observations

in Municipal Council Colombo vs Munasinghe12 held as follows:

8 71 NLR 382 9 (1999) 1 Sri LR 343 at page 348. 10 78 NLR 255. 11 SC Appeal No. 78/08; SC Minutes of 7th October 2010.

13

It is a cardinal principle of law that in making an award by an arbitrator there

must be a judicial and objective approach and more importantly the

perspectives both of employer as well as the employee should be considered in a

balanced manner and undoubtedly just and equity must apply to both these

parties.

The Arbitrator has lost sight of the provisions of the Collective Agreement which

demonstrates a clear intention on the part of the parties to the Collective Agreement

to apply the said Agreement only to those in active service on the date that the

Agreement was executed. While the 1st 4th Respondents as well as one hundred

other employees of the Petitioner have lost monetarily as a result of the delay in

concluding the Collective Agreement, the Arbitrator must not allow that to colour

the judicial and objective approach that he is required to adopt. The Arbitrator

appears to have forgotten that he must consider the matter from the perspective of

the employer as well as the employee in a balanced manner and that just and equity

must apply to both these parties.

Taking into consideration all of the above circumstances, I am of the view that the

Arbitrator has exceeded his mandate and arrived at a finding which cannot be

supported by the evidence placed before him. I therefore issue a Writ of Certiorari

quashing the Award marked X10 and the publication of the Award marked X10. I

make no order with regard to costs.
