Kanishka Rajakaruna SC for the State.

Argued On 26.10.2021

Decided On 02.11.2021

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for bail has been filed to obtain bail for the suspect in the

case nu B397/20 of Kurunegala Magistrates Court under the Assistance to and

Protection of Victims and Witnesses Act nu 4 of 2015.

The suspect was initially taken in to custody for allegedly displaying nude pictures

of one K. M Serela Sithumini on 2.3.2020 under the B report nu 885/2020 and

remanded till he was enlarged on bail on 16.3.2020.

The same K.M.Serela Sithumini makes yet another complaint against the suspect

on 28.5.2020 for threatening her to withdraw the above mentioned complaint.

The said statement of the complainant reveals at length as to how she was

physically harassed to withdraw the complaint.

On the said complaint another report was filed under the above mentioned act

and an investigation had commenced and the suspect had been arrested and is in

remand ever since according to the petitioner.

According to the submissions of the Counsel for the respondents the telephone

details of the suspect substantiate the fact that he had made contact with the

complainant during the alleged period of threats mentioned by the complainant.

The position of the learned Counsel for the suspect is that the details submitted

by the respondents do not cover the entire period and that according to a social

media platform cited by the suspect the complainant has made contact with the

suspect right through out.

The learned Counsel appearing for the respondents further submit that the

indictment against the suspect has been dispatched to the relevant High Court,

and the suspect had taken steps to obtain a new sim card to make the threatening

calls to the complainant while his initial sim had been in the custody of the police,

which is indicative of the fact that the suspect had clearly meddled with the due

process of administration of justice while being on bail.

According to the object of the act under which the suspect had been produced

and indicted for, is to

Set out, uphold and enforce the rights and entitlements of victims of crimes and

witnesses and to provide for a mechanism to promote protect enforce and

exercise such rights and entitlements.

Furthermore under the said act a suspect taken in to custody can be enlarged on

bail only upon exceptional circumstances while safe guarding the objects of the

act. The term exceptional has been widely analyzed in our legal system and lately

it had been decided that the exceptionality will vary from case to case, keeping

the same in mind this Court observes that the suspect in this matter has meddled

with the due administration of justice to an extent that when his initial sim card

and the mobile phone was taken into custody he has gone to the extent of

purchasing a new number while being on bail and had threatened the

complainant. The extent of the treats is explicitly explained by the statement of

the complainant and the suspect has blatantly violated the bail conditions, which

shows his scant disregard for the judicial system.

According to the provisions of the act under which the suspect has produced and

indicted for, the trials under this act must be speedily concluded and disposed of,

and according to the submissions of the Counsel for the respondents the

indictment of the suspect is already dispatched to the High Court, which is

indicative of the fact that due administration of justice is taking place against the

suspect without delay as laid down by the act.

The position taken up by the suspect that the suspect was remanded without an

inquiry this Court is unable to agree with, because by that time the telephone

details of the suspect were available with the police ,which corroborated the

position of the complainant.

The suspect further averred that the complainant was in constant contact with

the suspect according to a social media platform but the complainant has not

denied the fact that she had an affair with the suspect, and furthermore this Court

also observes that there is no proof as to the authencity of the details submitted

with regard to the details of the social media platform submitted by the suspect.

Therefore in view of the submission made by both parties this Court sees no

exceptional circumstance to enlarge the suspect on bail.

Hence the instant application for bail is dismissed.
