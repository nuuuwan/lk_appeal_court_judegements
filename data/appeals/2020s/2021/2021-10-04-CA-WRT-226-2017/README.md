K.K.A.V. SWARNADHIPATHI. J.

In November 2011, Revival of Underperforming Enterprise or Underutilized Assets

Act No. 43 of 2011 was passed. The primary purpose of this Act was to vest all

underperforming Enterprises and underutilized Assets set out in schedules I and II

to the Act for and on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka in the 1st Respondent.

The Petitioner, Seylan Bank PLC states that item No. 14 to Schedule II, known as

Ceylinco Leisure Properties, was also vested on the 1st Respondent under Act No

23 of 2011. Accordingly, the 6th Respondent was appointed as the competent

Authority to the property mentioned above.

Further, the cabinet of ministers appointed 3rd 5th Respondents as the

compensation tribunal. At the time of vesting, the Petitioner Bank had granted a

loan in the form of a mortgage to the property, which belongs to the Urban

Development Authority who had leased out the property to Ceylinco Homes

International Limited (Lotus Tower). The said lessee had borrowed money as a loan

from the Petitioner bank with the consent of the Urban Development Authority. To

prove the lease between the Urban Development Authority and the Ceylinco Homes

International (Lotus Tower) Limited, the Petitioner had produced documents P5

and P6, the consent of the UDA for the loan. The Mortgage Bond was marked as

P7.

As of 31st December 2011, a sum of LKR 3,410,654,094.65 was due from Ceylinco

Homes International (Lotus Tower) on the mortgage for this amount, the Petitioner

made a claim under Act No. 43 of 2011 to the 3rd to 6th Respondents. After an

inquiry, the 3rd - 6th Respondents awarded compensation to the Petitioner in the sum

of LKR 2,146,415,239.80 on 20th November 2013. In proof of awarding of the

compensation, document P14 was produced by the Petitioner.

In terms of Act 43 of 2011, it is the duty of the 1st Respondent to pay the

compensation awarded for and on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka. The 3rd

5th Respondents too are liable to settle the compensation awarded. Therefore, the

Petitioner requester from 1st and 3rd -5th Respondents by letter dated 29th January

2014 to pay the money. The said letter was addressed to the Chief Valuer.

Meanwhile, the Petitioner had intervened in case No: SC/FR262/2009 as some

issues was contested in the said case.

In the above said case, the Supreme Court, by an order dated 23rd July 2014, directed

the compensation Tribunal to make immediate payment in settlement of the claim

that the tribunal has determined.

According to the documents forwarded to this Court and considering the written

submissions of the Petitioner, 3rd -5th Respondents is evident that the 3rd-5th

Respondents and the predecessor to the 1st Respondent had failed to comply with

the Supreme Court order. The Petitioner states that after repeated inquiries by the

petitioner, the1st and 3rd - 5th Respondents agreed to pay the compensation by or

Page 5 of 6

about January 2015. However, the Petitioner states that the 1st, 3rd -5th Respondents

failed to comply with the Supreme Court order, gravely prejudicing the Petitioner

Bank and its stakeholders.

In the above, the Petitioner contended that the 1st, 3rd 5th Respondents have a

statutory duty to pay the Petitioner the sum of LKR 2,146,415,239.80. Accordingly,

the Petitioner inter alia seeking the following relief:

b) a mandate - writ of mandamus compelling the 1st and or 3rd to 5th

Respondents to pay the Petitioner bank a sum of LKR 2,146,415,239. 80

together with legal interest from the 20th of November 2013 onward till

payment in full.

c) an interim order a sum of LKR 2,146,415,239/80 and accruing interest in

a separate account for and on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka

pending the defer mention of this application.

By an affidavit dated 27th August 2019, a Senior Manager of the Recovery

Department of the Petitioner Bank informed Court that the Petitioner was in receipt

of the following payments in respect of the monies due to the Petitioner Bank by

way of correspondence addressed by one M.L. Suresh Tharanga, Secretary to the

Office of the Compensation Tribunal:

a. LKR 500,000,000/- by correspondence dated 27th September 2017

b. LKR 250,000,000/- 7th November 2017

c. LKR 50,000,000/- 7th December 2017

d. LKR 250,000,000/- 31st December 2017

e. LKR 15,309,389.57 - 31st December 2017

f. LKR 100,000,000/- 14th March 2018

g. LKR 14,628,000/- 31st December 2018

(Vide documents marked P24 to P30).

Therefore, a total of LKR 1,179,937,389.87 has been paid out of LKR

2,146,415,239.80. At the time of the argument, parties concerned agreed that the

above-mentioned money had been settled. No party disputed the fact that the

compensation awarded was for a sum of LKR 2,146,415,239.80.

Page 6 of 6

When all parties had agreed on the sum to be paid, there remains no question that

the money should be paid. In this instance, the Petitioner himself has acknowledged

receiving a sum of LKR 1,179,937,389.57. It was argued that if a part is paid, it is

the duty to pay the balance. The part payment was made after filling this case.

Therefore, the balance should also be paid. The Respondents have not denied the

responsibility of the payment, or the amount awarded.

Therefore, I am of the view that the writ of mandamus compelling the 1st and, 3rd

to 5th Respondents to pay the Petitioner bank a sum of LKR 966,477,849.93. should

be issued.

Accordingly, this Court issue a writ of mandamus against the 1st and, 3rd to 5th

Respondents to pay the Petitioner bank (limiting to) a sum of LKR 966,477,849.93.

Application allowed.
