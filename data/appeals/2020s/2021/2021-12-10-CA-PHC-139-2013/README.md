Judgment

The Officer in Charge of the Welikada Police station filed an information on 29.10.2010 in

terms of Section 66(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No.44 of 1979, against the 1st

Party-Respondent- Respondent and the 2nd Party-Petitioner-Appellants in this Appeal, on the

basis of a breach of the Peace being threatened over the possession of a property in dispute.

After following the procedure stipulated in the Primary Courts Procedure Act, Parties have

filed their respective Affidavits, Counter Affidavits and the documents marked and produced

as 11-126 and 21-228 by both the 1st Party and the 2nd Party.

Page 4 of 8

Consequently, the learned Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge having considered all

the Affidavits and the documents placed before Court at the inquiry, held that the 1st Party-

Respondent- Respondent [hereinafter referred to as the Respondent] was in possession of the

disputed portion of land two months prior to the date of filing of the information and decided

in terms of Section 68(3) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act to restore the Respondent into

the possession of the disputed portion of land.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the 2nd Party-Petitioner- Appellants had invoked the

Revisionary Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in

Colombo. It appears that the learned High Court Judge after hearing of both parties and having

considered the Pleadings, Proceedings and the Written Submissions filed by them, held that

the learned Magistrate had come to the correct findings of fact and Law and decided that the

1st Respondent was in possession of the disputed portion of land, two months prior to the date

of filing of the information, thus affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate.

Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 04.10.2013 by the learned High Court Judge, the 2nd

Party-Petitioner-Appellants [hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Appellant and the 2nd

Appellant] have preferred this Appeal to this Court.

In terms of Section 68(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, it is the duty of Court to

ascertain who was in possession of the land in dispute, on the date of filing of the information

under Section 66 of the Act.

If there is a forcible dispossession of a Party, the Court has to determine, when that

dispossession took place and if it was within two months immediately prior to the date of

institution of the Action, thus, it is a duty of Court to make an Order to place him back in

possession of the disputed land under Section 68(3) of the Act.

However, it appears that at the inquiry before the Judge of the Primary Court, the Plaintiff

submitted the documents such as the Complaint made by the 1st Party-Respondent and their

Affidavit, Counter Affidavit and the documents marked as 11-126 and the Affidavit and

Counter Affidavit of the 2nd Party- Appellants with the documents marked as 21-228 and 22

(1)-22 (9).

In addition to those documents, the Plaintiff filed a sketch which depicts the disputed portion

of land, and the observation notes of the Inquiring Officer. After the conclusion of the inquiry,

both the 1st Party-Respondent and 2nd Party- Appellants had filed Written Submissions.

Apparently, the learned Magistrate acting as the Primary Court Judge, having considered all

the materials placed before Court had come to the conclusion that,

1) The disputed portion of land was identified by Plan No. 5274 of Lot 15C prepared by

Surveyor Liyanasuriya.

2) The 1st Party-Respondent was in Possession of the disputed Land until the date on

which the dispute arose.

It was observed by the learned Primary Court Judge that on or about 23.11.2010 the 2nd Party-

Appellant had attempted to dig the ground and put up poles to build a Garage to repair three-

wheelers, and this is where the dispute between the Appellants and the Respondent had started.

Consequently, the 1st Party-Respondent was dispossessed by the 2nd Party- Appellants from the

disputed portion of land.

Both the Appellants and Respondent admitted that the disputed portion of land is depicted in

Plan bearing No 5274 made by Licensed Surveyor Mr. Siri Liyanasuriya as Lot 15C.

It is to be noted that the said Gnanawathi Munasinghe the 2nd Party-Petitioner- Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Appellant) in her Affidavit dated 21.02.2011 affirmed as

follows;

15C

. .

.

The Court draws the attention to the statement made by Sanjana Aravinda Kumara the 2nd

Party-Petitioner- Appellant on 25.11.2010 to the Police Station Welikada.

,

23......................................................................... ......... .

Page 6 of 8

According to the said statement made by the said Sanjana Aravinda Kumara, the 1st Appellant

has been running a Garage to repair three-wheelers for the last 10 years. Since the 1st Appellant

was 23 years old at the time of making a statement to the Police, this means he was running a

Garage to repair three-wheelers, since he was 10 years old.

It is pertinent to note that the 1st Complaint made by the 1st Party-Respondent- Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent), Don Ariyawathi Munasinghe has stated as

follows.

. 01.11.2010 01

555 .

. .

. .

..............................................................................................................

The 2nd Appellant denied the said position of the 1st Respondent and submitted a letter marked

as 210 dated 10.01.2000 which states that .

.. .248

10.01.2000

.........................................................................................

It is worthy to note that the learned High Court Judge has considered the said letter 210 and

stated in his Order that.

10.01.2000

,

.

It is observable that the said letter 210 does not specify a portion of land, as such, it is not clear

whether the uncle of the 1st Appellant, Piyadasa Munasinghe promised to give the disputed

portion of land to the 1st Appellant.

On the other hand, it is to be noted that at the time of writing the said letter 210 in the year

2000, the 1st Appellant was 10 years old. Thus, it is questionable that the said Piyadasa

Munasinghe promised to give the disputed portion of land to his nephew. However, the 1st

Appellant had not established that he was given the possession of the disputed premises to carry

Page 7 of 8

out a business on the land in question. It is observable that the said Piyadasa Munasighe did

not transfer the property in dispute to the 1st Appellant for the last 10 years after such promise

to the 1st Appellant. Nevertheless it was transferred to his sister the said Respondent Ariyawathi

Munasinghe on 03.11.2010.

As such, it is apparent that the uncle of the 1st Appellant did not intend to transfer his rights of

the disputed portion of land to the 1st Appellant. Thus, there is no evidentiary value of the said

letter 210 to the instant Case.

Therefore, it is imperative to note that the contents of the Affidavits of the Appellants are

disproved by the evidence placed before Court by the Respondents. In view of the material

placed before Court, it is evident that the dispute arose among the Parties when the 2nd

Appellant attempted to dig the ground and put-up poles to build a Garage to repair three-

wheelers on 23.11.2010. Thus, it is apparent that the possession of the land in dispute was with

the said Piyadasa Munasinghe and the 1st Respondent Ariyawathi Munasinghe until the dispute

arose on 21.11.2010.

The said position was clearly established by the observation notes dated 21.11.2010 of the

investigating officer. It appears that the said observation notes stated that the land in dispute is

a bare land, 1 Perch in extent and the 1st Appellant [] was engaged in a construction, digging

the ground and setting up poles.

...................................

.

As such, it clearly proves that there was no existing Three-wheeler repairing garage run by the

1st Appellant in the disputed premises. If the 1st Appellant had been running a Three-wheeler

repairing garage for the last 10 years, it should be visible to the investigating officer. Since the

investigating officer observed that its a bare land, the learned Primary Court Judge had come

Page 8 of 8

to the correct findings of fact and had come to the conclusion that the 1st Respondent was

dispossessed by the 1st Appellant on the date the dispute arose among the parties.

In this instance, Court observes that the documents 214-228 submitted by the 1st Appellant

are the letters obtained from various people to establish that the 1st Appellant had been running

a Three-wheeler repairing garage at the disputed premises. Since it was established that the 1st

Appellant had not been carrying on a business, running a Three-wheeler repairing garage, it is

seen that there is no evidentiary value of those letters 214-228.

Thus, it seems that those letters were obtained by the 1st Appellant for the sake of getting an

advantage in the instant Case in his favour.

Apparently, upon the evidence placed before the Primary Court Judge, it is patently clear that

the facts of the instant case are properly evaluated in the correct perspective thus the Order of

the Primary Court Judge is well-founded.

As such, it is not necessary to interfere with the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge,

who affirmed the Order of the learned Primary Court Judge.

In view of the aforesaid factual and legal matrix, I uphold the impugned Orders of the learned

Primary Court Judge dated 27.04.2011 and the learned High Court Judge dated 04.10.2013.

Accordingly, the Appeal is dismissed with costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL Khema Swarnadhipathi, J.

I agree.
