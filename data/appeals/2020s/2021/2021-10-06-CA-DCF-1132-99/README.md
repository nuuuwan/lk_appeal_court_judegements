MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th Defendant-

Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the respective Appellants)

from the judgment of the learned District Judge of Kalutara dated

06.10.1999.

The facts, briefly, in this case are as follows. The Plaintiff-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) instituted

action in the District Court of Kalutara in case No. 6197/P, seeking

to partition the land more fully described in the schedule to the

plaint amongst the co-owners as set out in paragraph 09 of the

plaint. The Appellants, having filed their statements of objection

moved for a dismissal of the action on the footing that they have

obtained prescriptive title to the land sought to be partitioned. After

trial, the learned District Judge of Kalutara, declined to accept the

contention of the Appellants and pronounced the impugned

judgment to partition the subject matter as prayed for in the plaint.

Being aggrieved by the judgment, the instant appeal has been

preferred by the appellants.

The Corpus:

Admittedly, the lot 9 in the final partition plan bearing No. 344 in

case No. 5666/P in the District Court of Kalutara marked 1V10 is

the corpus sought to be partitioned in this case. The subject matter

is properly depicted as lot No. 9 in the preliminary plan bearing No.

294 dated 13.09.1993 made by K.D.L. Wijeynayake, Licensed

Surveyor marked X. The report of the commissioner is produced as

X1. It is pertinent to be noted that, having superimposed the title

plan 1V10 on the preliminary plan X, the commissioner has given

his opinion under section 18 (1) (a) (iii) of the Partition Law, No. 21

of 1977 (as amended), stating the land depicted in plan X is the

corpus described in the schedule to the plaint. It is pertinent to be

noted that there is no dispute as to the identification of the subject

matter.

Pedigree:

By virtue of the final decree in case No. 5666/P marked P1, the

corpus in this case was allotted to Anthonidura Gunehamy and

Peththandy Ordiris Silva (3/5), and Anthonidurai Helenis (2/5). On

the demise of the aforesaid Anthonidura Gunehamy and Peththandy

Ordiris Silva, those rights devolved on their children, namely

Wimalawathi and Mithraratne. The said Wimalawathi and

Mithraratne by deed No. 14004 dated 04.10.1960 marked P6/1V9,

conveyed their rights to Wedikkara Dayawansa Silva and upon his

demise those rights devolved on his heirs, namely the surviving

spouse Hemawathi (3/10) who is the 1st Appellant in this case and

children, the 2nd Appellant Chithra (3/20) and 3rd Appellant Mala

Kaanthi (3/20).

The aforesaid Anthonidura Helenis conveyed his undivided 2/5

shares to Anthonidura Jemis Silva by deed bearing No. 05 dated

10.05.1933 marked P2, who transferred the same to Ruby Mendis

Page 5 of 12

Abeysekera by deed No. 26812 dated 22.01.1938 marked P3, who

conveyed those rights to Charlis Silva by deed No. 32265 dated

04.07.1944 marked P4. The said Charlis Silva by deed bearing No.

246 dated 28.02.1964 marked P5 transferred his rights to the

respondent in this case, namely Anthonidurain Bastian Silva (2/5).

Accordingly, the learned trial Judge has allotted shares to the co-

owners as follows:

The Respondent : 8/20

The 1st Appellant : 6/20

The 2nd Appellant : 3/20

The 3rd Appellant : 3/20

It is to be noted that there is no dispute as to the pedigree set out in

the impugned judgment. It appears to this Court that the learned

trial Judge has rightly examined the title of each, and every co-owner

as spelt out in section 25 of the Partition Law.

Dispute:

Having framed the points of contest No. 4 to 8, the Appellants took

up the position that the plaint is liable to be dismissed on the footing

that they have obtained prescriptive title to the subject matter. The

finding of the learned trial Judge was that the Appellants failed to

establish the purported claim of prescriptive title to the corpus.

Thus, the question for determination in this appeal is whether the

learned trial Judge erred in law and facts in deciding that the

Appellants failed to establish the claim of prescriptive title to the

land sought to be partition.

Law related to the dispute:

Undisputedly, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Appellants are co-owners of the

subject matter. Generally, one co-owner is in possession of common

Page 6 of 12

land on behalf of other co-owners. If a co-owner claims prescriptive

title against other co-owners, it is necessary to prove ouster in

addition to the requirements set out in section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance, No. 22 of 1871 (as amended).

In Corea v. Appuhamy [1911] 15 NLR 65, it was held that,

A co-owner's possession is in law the possession of his co-

owners. It is not possible for him to put an end to that

possession by any secret intention in his mind. Nothing short of

ouster or something equivalent to ouster could bring about that

result.

In the case of Wickramaratne and Another v. Alpenis Perera

[1986] 1 Sri LR 190, the Court of Appeal observed that,

In a partition action, for a lot of land claimed by the plaintiff to

be a divided portion of a larger land, he must adduce proof that

the co-owner who originated the division and such co-owner's

successors had prescribed to that divided portion by adverse

possession for at least ten years from the date of ouster or

something equivalent to ouster. Where such co-owner had

himself executed deeds for undivided shares of the larger land

after the year of the alleged dividing off it will militate against

the plea of prescription. Possession of divided portions by

different co-owners is in no way inconsistent with common

possession.

A co-owner's possession is in law the possession of the co-

owners. Every co-owner is presumed to be in possession in his

capacity as co-owner. A co-owner cannot put an end to his

possession as co-owner by a secret intention in his mind.

Nothing short of ouster or something equivalent to ouster could

bring about that result.

Page 7 of 12

In Thilakaratne v. Bastian [1918] 21 NLR 12, the full bench of the

Supreme Court considered the meaning of adverse possession in

an exhaustive manner, which reads thus:

Possession by one co-owner is presumed as the possession on

behalf of all of the co-owners. For one co-owner to acquire

prescriptive title against the other co-owners, he shall prove ten

years exclusive possession after changing the nature of the

possession to one of adverse to the title of others.

In the case of Maria Fernando and Another v. Anthony Fernando

[1997] 2 Sri LR 356 (CA), Wigneswaran J clearly and briefly simplified

the requirements to acquire prescriptive title among co-owners as

follows:

Long possession, payment of rates and taxes, enjoyment of

produce, filing suit without making the adverse party, a party,

preparing plan and building house on land and renting it are

not enough to establish prescription among co-owners in the

absence of an overt act of ouster. A secret intention to prescribe

may not amount to ouster.

In Maria Perera v. Albert Perera [1983] 2 Sri LR 399 (CA), B.E. De

Silva J and G.P.S. De Silva J (as he then was), observed that,

An amicable partition can be a starting point of prescription

even though no deed of partition or cross deeds or other

documents have been executed. But inclusive possession by a

co-owner for a period of 10 years alone cannot give rise to

prescriptive title. There must be the further important element

of all change of circumstances from which an inference could

reasonably be drawn that such possession is averse to and

independent of "all other co-owners. There must be proof of

circumstances from which a reasonable inference could be

drawn that such possession had become adverse at some date

Page 8 of 12

ten years before action was brought. Mere exclusive possession

for 20 years (by taking the natural produce of the land) on a

plan not signed by any of the co-owners to whom the plaintiff

claimed lots were allotted cannot constitute proof of ouster. The

possession of a co-owner would not become averse to the rights

of the other co-owners until there is an act of ouster or

something equivalent to ouster.

K.D. De Silva J and H.N.G. Fernando J (Basnayake CJ dissenting),

in the case of Abdul Majeed v. Ummu Zaneera [1959] 61 NLR 361,

decided that,

Proof that one of the co-heirs let out the premises and

appropriated to himself the entire rent (which was not much) for

thirty-seven years was insufficient, by itself, to bring the case

within section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

In Chelliah v. Wijenathan [1951] 54 NLR 337 at 342, Gratien J

stated that,

Where a party invokes the provisions of Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an

adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof

rests squarely and fairly on him to establish a starting point

for his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights.

In the light of the above legal literature, it is abundantly clear that a

considerable prudence is always necessary to recognize prescriptive

title as undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party having

paper title. Therefore, it is to be reiterated that when a party invokes

the provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to

defeat the true ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable

property, the burden of proof rests fairly on him to establish the

adverse possession by strong and cogent evidence.

Page 9 of 12

When a co-owner claims prescriptive title against other co-owners,

proof of undisturbed, uninterrupted, adverse, or independent

possession for more than ten years explicitly adverted to in section

3 of the Prescription Ordinance itself is not sufficient. In a co-owned

property, every co-owner does not need to enjoy the property to have

the co-ownership intact. The possession of one co-owner is in law

the possession of other co-owners. Nothing short of ouster or

something equivalent to ouster by an overt act as opposed to a covert

act is absolutely necessary to make possession adverse and end co-

ownership (vide CA/549/2000/F, CA Minutes of 04.12.2018 per

Samayawardhena, J).

When a co-owner claims prescriptive title to the entirety of the

subject matter against the other co-owners such as in the instant

case, there is an onus cast on them to establish the fact that they

had prescribed to the entire corpus by adverse possession against

other co-owners for at least ten years from the date of ouster or

something equivalent to ouster.

It is salient to note that the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Appellants relied upon

the title deed marked 1V9/P6, wherein their predecessor in title,

Wedikkara Dayawansa Silva had purchased undivided rights from

the corpus in 1960. Hence, the position took up by these Appellants

(Point of contest No. 05. Vide p. 132 of the Appeal brief) stating that

Wedikkara Dayawansa Silva was in exclusive possession of the

entirety of the subject matter from 1960 is devoid of merits. Since

the predecessor in title of the Appellants had purchased undivided

rights from the corpus, the Appellants are precluded from claiming

prescriptive title to the entirety of the subject matter in the absence

of expressed intention of ouster of the other co-owners. Vide

Wickramaratne and Another v. Alpenis Perera (supra).

It is pertinent to be noted that the 2nd Appellant in cross-

examination had categorically admitted the fact that they claim

Page 10 of 12

entire corpus upon the deed marked 1V9/P6 (vide Appeal brief page

182, 183 & 194).

In Juliana Hamine v. Don Thomas [1957] 59 NLR 546, it was held

that,

When a witness giving evidence of prescriptive possession

states I possessed or We possessed, the Court should insist

on those words being explained and exemplified.

In the case of Sirajudeen and Two Others v. Abbas [1994] 2 Sri LR

365, the Supreme Court, in an exhaustive manner explained how a

claim of prescriptive title could be established before the court of

law, which reads thus,

Where the evidence of possession lacked consistency, the fact

of occupation alone or the payment of Municipal rates by itself

is insufficient to establish prescriptive possession.

Where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an

adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof

rests squarely and fairly on him to establish a starting point for

his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights.

A facile story of walking into abandoned premises after the

Japanese air raid constitutes material far too slender to found

a claim based on prescriptive title.

As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere

general statements of witnesses that the plaintiff possessed the

land in dispute for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive

period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse

possession necessary to support a title by prescription. It is

necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific facts and

Page 11 of 12

the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by

Court.

One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as

provided for in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance is proof

of possession by a title adverse to or independent of that of the

claimant or plaintiff. The occupation of the premises must be of

such character as is incompatible with the title of the owner.

The attention of this Court is drawn to the fact that the Appellants

had submitted the voters list from 1965 to 1994 marked 1V2-1V10

in order to prove the fact that they were in possession of the subject

matter. Indeed, the Appellants were in possession as co-owners, but

the requirements of adverse possession and the ouster against the

other co-owners have not been established with those documents.

Moreover, the Appellants totally failed to establish any overt act as

far as the common co-owned rights are concerned. As it is

enunciated in Sirajudeen (supra), mere bare statement of the 2nd

Appellant stating that the Appellants had acquired prescriptive title

to the subject matter is inadequate to succeed in their purported

claim of prescriptive title.

Further, this Court, in its order dated 29.11.2019, permitted the

Appellants to produce fresh evidence in appeal. Accordingly, the

appellants submitted the entire case record of a partition action

bearing No. 6202/P in the District Court of Kalutara. It is apparent

that the said partition action was instituted to partition lot 8 in plan

344 marked 1V10 which is situated adjacent to the corpus in this

case. As such, it appears to this Court that the aforesaid fresh

evidence submitted by the Appellants is not relevant to substantiate

the claim made by the Appellants in this case.

It is to be noted that the 5th Appellant is not a co-owner to the subject

matter. However, the 5th Appellant has not adduced evidence to

establish his claim of prescriptive title to the subject matter.

Conclusion:

For the foregoing reasons, in my view, there is no basis to interfere

with the judgment of the learned District Judge of Kalutara dated

06.10.1999. Thus, the appeal is dismissed, and the impugned

judgment is affirmed.

It is the considered view of this Court that the Respondent in this

case could not reap the fruits of the impugned judgment for the last

22 years due to the instant frivolous appeal. Therefore, the

appellants are ordered to pay a sum of Rs. 45,000/- to the

Respondent as costs of this appeal.

The Registrar is directed to dispatch the judgment along with the

original case record to the District Court of Kalutara.
