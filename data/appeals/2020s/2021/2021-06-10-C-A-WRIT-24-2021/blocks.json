By his letter of the same date marked 4R2, the 4th Respondent has informed the 2nd Respondent that steps may be taken in terms of Section 19(6) of the Ordinance as the facts reveal that the Petitioner is deemed to have resigned from his post.11 The Petitioner states that the 2nd Respondent had informed him that the 4th Respondent had instructed her to issue a letter to the 3rd Respondent, the Vice Chairman of the Council to act in the office of Chairman. Aggrieved by the above communication of the 2nd Respondent, the Petitioner filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief: a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the purported authorization granted by the 4th Respondent to the 3rd Respondent to act as Chairman of the 1st Respondent; b) A Writ of Prohibition restraining the 3rd Respondent from acting as Chairman of the 1st Respondent; c) A Writ of Prohibition restraining the 1st 3rd and 6th 22nd Respondents from obstructing and/or interfering with the exercise of the powers and functions of the Petitioner as Chairman of the 1st Respondent. The question that I must consider is whether the Petitioner is deemed to have resigned from the Office of Chairman of the 1st Respondent. The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that whatever way the budget is presented or whichever way the Petitioner acts towards the budget the budget was destined to be defeated in view of the written instructions given by the 5th Respondent. He submitted that the decision to reject the budget is illegal as it is not supported by any cogent reasons and is for a collateral purpose of removing the Petitioner from office.",

I am in agreement with the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Respondent that this Court cannot consider the intentions or motives of the members of the 1st Respondent when they exercise their vote at the Council. The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted further that on both occasions i.e. on 18th December 2020 and 31st December 2020 - the Petitioner had agreed to the proposals and suggestions made with regard to the budget, and therefore the proviso will not be applicable in its entirety, and the proviso will have to be departed with as regards to this matter. It is not disputed that the concession granted by Section 178A to enable a Chairman of an Urban Council to function in office even where a duly submitted budget has not been passed by a majority comes to an end after two years of being elected as Chairman, and that the provisions contained in the proviso to Section 178A is applicable thereafter. Once the budget is submitted to the Council and debated and whatever the modifications or additions that a Chairman may agree during or after such debate, the budget must be submitted by the Chairman to the Council for its decision. This is mandatory and is confirmed by the use of the word, decision in the proviso to Section 178A. In terms of Section 26(2), a decision would mean a vote. I am therefore of the view that the Chairman agreeing to any modifications or additions that may be proposed by one or more or even all members does not suffice in order to claim that the budget has been passed. The claim that the Chairman agreed with the modifications and amendments and therefore the budget has been passed is a red herring. The budget must be passed by a majority vote if the Chairman wishes to avoid the deemed resignation being triggered. Where the Chairman decides to re-submit the budget for further consideration of the Council, he must have the budget passed by a majority vote of the Council. In my view, the crux of the matter is that the Chairman must ensure that he has in place a budget duly passed by the Council by the due date. If he fails in this regard, he is",
