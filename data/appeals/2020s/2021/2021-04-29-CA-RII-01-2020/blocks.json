Thereafter the Fiscal had reported that Eraman Singho (a son of Daniel and the predecessor in title of 1st, 2nd and 3rd petitioners) had passed away. Sometime later it was reported that Eraman Singho was living and the Fiscal had reported that he had handed over the notice to Eraman Singho. According to journal entry no. 86 it is recorded that Eraman Singho had appeared in court on 25.05.2015. It appears from the journal entry that Eraman Singho was not represented by an Attorney -at Law on that day and the court had failed to check the identity of the person who appeared on that day as Eraman Singho. According to what is recorded in that journal entry the person who had appeared as Eraman Singho had mentioned the court that he was not contesting the plaintiffs case and he had signed the record. It is the case of the petitioners that Eraman Singho never went to court to participate in this case as he was seriously ill at that time. When applying the test of probability it is highly improbable that Eraman Singho would have made such a statement to court to give up the portion of land in which he was in possession and to which he had litigated earlier and to which he was declared a prescriptive right. Therefore one can accept the version of the petitioners that their predecessor in title Eraman Singho who was a son of Daniel was never noticed by court. According to the journal entries it is obvious the other heirs of Daniel also had not been noticed by court although the court had directed the plaintiffs to take steps to notice the parties who are in possession of lot 01. The Plaintiffs had failed to comply with that direction. Therefore it is obvious that the plaintiffs had acted in collusion to deprive the rights of the petitioners to lot 01.",

    "text": "unnecessary hardship to the parties. There is no pedigree dispute in this case. The petitioners are not challenging the pedigree of the plaintiffs and they are not claiming for undivided rights in the corpus. They are only asking for an exclusion of the disputed lot no. 01. The District Court had decided that the predecessor in title of the petitioners had prescribed to this disputed portion of land and at the time of the preliminary survey there was a well - established live fence separating the disputed lot 01 from the rest of the corpus. The commissioner has reported to court that the disputed lot 01 is annexed to the adjoining land to which the predecessor in title of the petitioners became entitled under the final decree in the earlier partition action which means that the disputed lot is possessed as a portion of that adjoining land and not as a part of the corpus. There is no evidence to show that the possession had changed into a third party. No one other than the petitioners have come forward to claim for this disputed lot which means the possession had not changed into a third party. Therefore on a balance of probability one can come to the conclusion that Daniels heirs continued to be in possession in this disputed lot after the death of Daniel. In those circumstances it is not necessary to direct the learned District Judge to hold an inquiry to see whether the possession had changed during the course of a very long period of time since the judgement in case no. 17128 pronounced in 1975. Such a course would cause delay and unnecessary hardship to all the parties. Accordingly it would meet the ends of justice if without setting aside the interlocutory decree it is only amended by excluding from the corpus the disputed lot no. 01 in the preliminary plan no. 2005P. Therefore I make order excluding the disputed lot 01 from the corpus and direct the learned District Judge to amend the interlocutory decree accordingly. The final decree and the proceedings leading up to it from the stage of the interlocutory decree are set aside. The application for revision is allowed and the plaintiffs - respondents shall pay the petitioners Rs. 31,500.00 as the cost of this application.",
