Subsequently, on 09.10.2020, an Extraordinary Gazette No.1834/24 dated 30.10.2013 was

filed in this Court by the State Counsel appearing for the 1st-3rd and 10th Respondents. The

Petitioner objected to this document. This Order is in respect of the said Objection.

A Gazette is a public document of which all must take cognisance. The Court must take judicial

notice. of government Gazzerts. Further by producing the document in question carries no

harm to any party. On the contrary, this document will enlighten the position more clearly.

Therefore, I overrule the Objection of the Petitioner. Accordingly, the Gazette mentioned above

is accepted in proceeding with this writ application.
