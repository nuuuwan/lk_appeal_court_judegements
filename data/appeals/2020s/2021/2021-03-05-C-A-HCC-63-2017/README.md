The Accused-Appellant (Appellant) had been indicted in the High Court

of Kurunegala on 14 counts framed under Section 298 of the Penal Code

for causing the death of 14 persons named in those counts by rash and

negligent driving of the bus No. 62-8390 on 4th July 2003 and on 28

counts framed under Section 329 of the Penal Code for causing grievous

hurt to 28 persons by the same act of rash and negligence driving.

The prosecution has called a large number of witnesses. The Appellant

had admitted all the Post-mortem Reports, Medico Legal Reports and the

Report of Examiner of Motor Traffic. The Appellant has made a dock

statement and also called a witness from Kurunegala North CTB depot

and produced in evidence the daily control report which shows that the

bus had started from Madagalla at C).:20 a.m. on 4th July 2003. The

accident happened at about 11 .00 0' clock. The bus had taken one hour

and forty minutes to go that distance

After trial, learned High Court Judge convicted the Appellant of all14

counts framed under Section 298 of the Penal Code and of the 19 counts

framed under Section 329 of the Penal Code and then imposed a term of

two years rigorous imprisonment for each count 1 to 14 and a term of 6

months rigorous imprisonment for re8t of the counts. The aggregate of

the sentences is 37 and half years of rigorous imprisonment.

The grounds of appeal argued for t.he Appellant are that there were

defects in the bus as per report of the Examiner of the Motor Vehicle and

that fact was totally ignored by the trial Judge, there was no analysis of

the evidence and the dock statement of the Appellant was not

considered.

2

The report of the Examiner of Motor Vehicles was produced in evidence

and it was admitted by the prosecution and the defence as well.

According to that report there were few defects in the bus. It is true that

the learned trial Judge has said in the Judgment that there were no

defects in the bus. Since the report of Examiner of the Motor Vehicles

was admitted, we have to admit it without reservation. According to the

report, the bus was running with a cracked leaf spnng. The

shortcomings of the bus are listed in the ;eport as follows:

We have considered whether the reason for the accident was the above-

mentioned defects and the Accused-Appellant could be exonerated of the

charges for the above short comings. However, having considered the

evidence as a whole we are compelled to decide against it.

The Examiner of the Motor Vehicle was of the opinion that if the bus had

driven at a moderate speed the accident could have been avoided. This

opinion should be considered with the evidence of the witnesses who had

faced the accident.

According to the evidence, Appellant had driven the bus at a moderate

speed up to a certain place. Thereafter he started to drive at excessively

high speed. Most of the witnesses testified that the bus had been driving

at excessive speed at the time of the accident. Some witnesses say they

raised concerns and told the conductor to ask the driver to slow down.

The answer of the conductor was to 'hold tight'. Even the seated

passengers had feared that they would be thrown out from it. One

witness stated that the manner in which the bus had driven, she feared

that an accident could happen any moment.

When considering the evidence of the passengers in toto, it is clear that

the Accused-Appellant had driven the bus at an excessively high speed.

This cannot be treated as mere speeding. According to the evidence there

were about 80 passengers in the bus. He totally forgot that the lives of

many were in his hands. He tried to take a bend at the same speed. As

he was taking the bend there was a sound and the bus went out of

control of him and went to the right side, toppled and crashed into a tree.

4

In view of the evidence the accident cannot be attributed for the defects

in the bus. The evidence is sufficient to establish the fact that the

Accused-Appellant drove the bus In a rash and negligent

manner. Therefore, the learned trail Judge cannot be faulted for the

conviction. We affirm the conviction.

Now we consider whether the punishment imposed upon Accused-

Appellant is excessive. The Accused-Appellant is sentenced to a total

term of 37 and half year rigorous imprisonment. Section 16(2) of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Code Procedure Act is as follows:

"16(2) for the purpose of appeal aggregates sentence under

subsection (i) in the case of conviction for several offences at one trial

shall be deemed to be a single sentence".

The term of 37 and half year rigorous imprisonment we consider as

single sentence for the purpose of the appeal.

In the case of Bandara Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka [2002J 2 Sri LR 277 the

Court of Appeal increased the total period of imprisonment 30 months to

60 months stating that the a.(;cused in that case deserved a longer period

of imprisonment. In that case 14 persons had died as a result of an

accident. Two other persons were injured.

In this case also 14 passengers died. A number of persons injured.

However, in Bandara's case, the accused-appellant was more negligent

than the Appellant in this case. In Bandara's case the Appellant had

driven the bus after consuming liquor. It was a hilly road with sharp

bends. The accused had taken his hands off the steering wheel and

clapped whilst looking at the passengers through the mirror. The

Accused- Appellant in this case has not done such negligent acts similar

to the above.

5

The Appellant has admitted all the Post-Mortem Reports, Medico-Legal

reports and the Report of the Examiner of Motor Vehicles without

burdening the prosecution to call the doctors and the other officers as

witnesses. The Accused-Appellant expressed his willingness to plead

guilty to the charges before the trial started expecting a lenient

punishment for which the State did not agree. The Accused-Appellant

has no previous convictions.

Although the crack in the leaf spring was not the cause of the accident, it

could have some bearing in aggravating the result of the accident.

In view of the above, we are of the opinion that 37 and half year sentence

imposed upon the Appellant is too harsh and excessive. Therefore, the

sentence imposed by the learned trial Judge is set aside. We impose a

term of 05 years rigorous imprisonment on the Accused-Appellant to

take effect from the date of conviction, namely 20th March 2017.

Subject to the variation of the sentence, the appeal of the Appellant is

dismissed.
