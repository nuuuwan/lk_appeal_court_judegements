Both parties agreed to get the argument disposed by way of written submissions. Anyhow none of the parties have filed the written submissions. There are several connected matters that were taken up together with this matter. The court observers that the facts relating to each are different. The Petitioner states that he was a sailor attached to Sri Lanka Navy and that while he was serving the Sri Lanka Navy, he was provided a house in Daanyagama Housing Scheme, China Bay, Trincomalee, upon a Lease Agreement P3 entered into between the Petitioner and the Food Commissioner. The Petitioner states that he has complied with all terms and conditions of the said agreement including payment of rent. The Petitioner further claims that once the war came to an end, the Food Commissioner took steps to recover the possession of the said house and that as a pretext to such move, refused to accept rent. Subsequently, the Food Commissioner had instituted proceedings against the Petitioner before the Magistrate s Court of Trincomalee in terms of the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act and the same had been later withdrawn. Thereafter, the Respondent has issued the purported quit notice dated 18.02.2019 (P5) against the Petitioner demanding him to hand over the vacant possession of the said premises alleged that the Petitioner has acted in breach of the Lease Agreement. In spite of such circumstances, the Petitioner has made this application before this Court moving for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit notice marked P5 stating that the purported quit notice is bad in law for the reasons mentioned below.",
