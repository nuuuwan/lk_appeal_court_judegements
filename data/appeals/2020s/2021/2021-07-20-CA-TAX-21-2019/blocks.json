I do think that the intention of the legislature in introducing the last sentence of Section 33 (2) is to remedy a situation where the assessor is unable to spilt the income for each taxable period accurately to the best of his judgment due to the failure of the taxpayer to disclose fully and truly all the material facts necessary to determine the amount of tax for each taxable period.",

There is some support for this proposition from decisions made by the UK Courts in recent times and hence, I shall refer to them in this judgment. In the United Kingdom, at one time, gave rise to a proposition that it was not possible for Customs to make an assessment other than in relation to a prescribed accounting period, which normally is one of three months. It is to be noted that Subsection (4) of Section 73 of the UK VAT Act, 1994 (previously, the Finance Act 1972) states that the assessment may relate to one or more periods and the assessment can be combined and notified to him as one assessment. The only difference in the last sentence of Section 33 (2) of the VAT Act of Sri Lanka in comparison with the UK VAT Act, 1994 is that the words combination of assessment are missing.",

The prescribed accounting period for VAT liability under Section 31 (2) of the UK Finance Act, 1972 was a period of 3 months. The company challenged the notice stating that, for an assessment made under Section 31 (1) to be valid, it has to be restricted to a prescribed accounting period of three months and it ought to have been split up to three monthly periods and accordingly, the assessment in question was invalid since it related to a continuous period of 21 months.",

The said Amendment Act however, came into effect only on 31.03.2011 and by that time, the Appellant had already furnished monthly returns under the provisions of the VAT (Amendment) Act, No. 2 of 2003, which refers to the taxable period as one month as specified in Section 25B. Accordingly, the Appellant could not have furnished its returns for a period of 6 months in terms of Section 25B (1) (b) of the VAT (Amendment) Act, No. 09 of 2011. The returns had been furnished only in respect of the period covering from January 2011 to March 2011 and a global assessment has been made for a period covering 3 months for the reasons described under Questions of Law Nos. 1 and 2. For those reasons, I hold that there is no substance in the argument that the assessment had been made for a part of the taxable period of 6 months as requried by the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act, No. 09 of 2011.",

In the result, the assessor was justified in invoking Section 33 (2) of the VAT Act in making one assessment for the periods from 01.04.2010 to 31.12.2010 and one assessment from 01.01.2011 to 31.03.2011. Accordingly, the assessments made in respect of the said two periods fall within the meaning of Section 33 (2) of the VAT Act. For those reasons, I hold that the assessments dated 27.03.2014 are not time barred.",

In Lanka Asok Leyland PLC v.

The Court of Appeal held that although the appeal has to be submitted to the Commissioner-General, there is no requirement that the acknowledgement must be made by the Commissioner-General himself.

In this Court, the appellant criticises the judge's explanation, in the words which I have emphasised in the passage cited, for the reason why the borrower does not make a supply of services to the lender. It is said that the judge failed to appreciate that a borrower does create rights in favour of the lender the right to receive interest, rights over security and the right to receive repayment-for which the lender provides consideration capable of being valued in monetary terms, namely putting the principal of the loan at the borrower's disposal for the period of the loan\" (see paragraph 6 of the appellant's skeleton argument in this Court). In my view that criticism is misconceived. The judge was not addressing a case where the borrower provides security; nor was he addressing a case where the borrower issues loan or debenture stock. He was addressing the simple case where money is borrowed at interest. In such a case, as the judge pointed out, the payment of interest is the consideration for the use of the money lent. On a proper analysis the borrower is paying for a service (the grant of credit) which is provided by the lender. That is the analysis which found favour with the Advocate General in the BLP case, when he said, in the passage which I have cited:",

As noted, the core activity of finance companies is carrying on finance business, which means the business of acceptance of money by way of deposit, the payment of interest thereon, and the lending or investment of money or the lending of money on interest and the investment of money in any manner whatsoever (see the definition of finance business in the Finance Companies Act). Such financial activities also include trade in securities and investment of money in whatsoever, which includes bank deposits for the purpose of earning interest from their investment in banks.",
