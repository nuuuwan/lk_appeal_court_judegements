T

his application for judicial review seeks to impugn by certiorari two documents

namely P7 dated 16th January 2020 and P9 dated 26th February 2020. The

document marked P7 is titled Sri Lanka Tea Board Circular No. CIR/BR/1/2020" and

directed at all Licensed Produce Brokers of Tea. The gist of P7 is that with effect from

1st February 2020, no licensed Tea Broker or licensed Tea Brokers collectively shall

accept teas from registered factories, exceeding its approved maximum production

capacity of made tea. The proltibition is on the acceptance of tea from a registered tea

factory, which exceeds its approved maximum production capacity of made tea. It is

averred in the petition that the Respondents were well aware and had full knowledge

that the Petitioner was manufacturing over the purported maximum production

capacity. Therefore the argument was made on behalf of the Petitioner that the

Respondents are estopped from preventing the Petitioners from manufacturing

260,000 kg of made tea. In other words the Petitioners must be permitted to produce

5

260,000 kg of made tea over and above the approved maximum that was permitted

namely 170,000 kg-this was the pith and substance of the argument of the Petitioner.

By P9 dated 26th February 2020 which was issued one month after P7, the 4th

Respondent Tea Commissioner again instructed the licensed Produce Brokers of Tea

that subsequent to the recommendations of an ad hoc COlrunittee appointed for the

purpose of considering the appeals made by some manufacturers of tea, the Tea

Commissioner had granted approval to increase production capacity of those

factories but certain conditions were imposed namely:-

1. The manufacturer has to maintain Good leaf percentage of 60% as per the

Gazette No.1684/48 dated 10th December 2010.

2. The manufacturer has to maintain GMP score at 80% or above according to the

Circular No. TClCIR(204)-1-20l9 and in addition should obtained HACCP or

equivalent certification.

3. Payments for green leaf should be paid on the due date and no arrears payment

should be reported.

4. The Registered Tea Manufacturer should not contravene the provisions of Tea

Control Act No.51 of 1957 under any circumstances.

The instruction contained in P9 also tabulated the amended approved maximum

production capacities for made tea manufacturers, who had made appeals. The list at

item 97 gives the increased maximum production capacity of made tea prescribed for

the Petitioner at 170,000 kg.

It has to be noted that although both P7 and P9 were directed to licensed Produce

Tea Brokers, none of them are before this Court challenging P7 and P9 on the

recognized ground of judicial review.

Those Tea Brokers who stand as intermediaries between tea manufacturers and

buyers have been told not to accept tea from several manufacturers who produce over

and above their approved maximum production capacity of made tea. This shows that

5

the tea industry is quite regulated and P7 and P9 show the notices that the tea

brokers have been put under namely they are not to accept tea from those

manufacturers who exceed their permitted cap. In the case of the Petitioner the

permitted cap is 170,000 kg of tea. If one looks at the table appended to P9, one could

see several manufacturers who have been imposed with limitation on production

caps. None of those manufacturers of tea are before this Court challenging this

prohibition on tea brokers. It is only this tea manufacturer (the Petitioner Company)

which is before this Court challenging P7 and P9.

In respect of this Petitioner, the last increase on its maximum production capacity, as

could be seen from the list appended to P9, is 170,000 kg of manufactured tea as

opposed to the previous 140,000 kg and the Petitioner has been explicitly informed

that it should adhere to the approved maximum capacity and that any excess

production will fall foul of the relevant regulations-vide RUA and RUB. Even though

P7 and P9 instruct the tea brokers, the manufacturers of tea such as the Petitioner

have also been made aware of these limitations but these documents have not been

brought to the attention of this Court along with the petition giving rise to a

complaint by the Respondents that the Petitioner is guilty of suppression of material

facts.

As I listed it above, one of the impugned documents P9 imposes a requirement among

many that the manufacturer has to maintain good leaf percentage of 60% per cent. In

other words a tea manufacturer is told not only to adhere to his maximum capacity

bur also to maintain this green leaf requirement-vide Gazette No.l684/48 dated 17th

December 2010 (R12). In fact Regulation 3 of R12 specifically instructs all registered

manufacturers of tea and suppliers of green leaf as raw materials to registered tea

factories.

Regulation 3 specifically instructs the manufactures who operate a tea factory for the

production of made tea to ensure the procurement of a minimum of sixty per centum

(60%) of green leaf in conformity with the quality standard determined by the Sri

5

Lanka Tea Board for use i.n manufacture of tea. The same regulation states in 3(b) that

every such manufacturers such as the Petitioner must ensure that the green leaf so

procured for manufacture should not be damaged due to past harvest operations of

suppliers of such green leaf.

A corresponding duty to endeavor to supply a minimum of sixty per centum (60%) of

green leaf in conformity with the quality standard determined by the board is

imposed on every supplier of green leaf as well. These regulatory controls, as one

could see, have been imposed as far back as 17'h December 2010 on all manufactures of

tea and supplier of green leaf, with the laudable objective of maintaining the standard

of Ceylon Tea (see R-12) and when the Petitioner seeks to impugn P9 (direction given

to tea brokers) it passes strange that he also impugns this imperative condition of

minimum green leaf standard of 60%-a requirement that he has been aware of for

almost 10 years if I were to go by the gazette.

Having acquainted all tea manufacturers with the imperative requirement of 60% of

minimum green leaf standard in 2010, the 4,h Respondent incorporated it in his

instructions dated 26,h February 2020 (P9) but the Petitioner seeks a quashing of P9.

It is too late to quash P9, as the Petitioner chose not to challenge the gazette

notification which is dated 17'h December 2010. The Petitioner was already bound by

his conditions of registration which principally imposed a cap on his production and

the Petitioner was, like the other tea manufacturers, put on notice of this condition of

the cap. Therefore, when the directive is given in P9 to continue to maintain the

quality of made Sri Lankan Tea as well as the cap on production, it cannot give rise to

a complaint before this Court.

By way of their Petition dated 19,h May 2020, the Petitioner avers that since its

incorporation in or around 2003/2004 and re-registered in 2009, it has been in the

continuous manufacture of high quality tea since its inception. It is by acquisition of a

factory called New Hopewell Tea Factory in Balangoda that the Petitioner states that it

commenced its operation of manufacturing tea. The document marked Pl(e)

5

connotes a registration certificate dated 17th September 2004. It is the contention of

the Petitioner that the Tea Commissioner sets up a "monthly approved maximum

production capacity" in the registration certificates that are issued to manufacturers.

In paragraph S of the Petition the Petitioner states that many a manufacturer,

including the Petitioner, exceed the cap imposed by the Tea Commissioner but

qualifies it by stating that the excess in manufacture over the approved cap is with

the Respondent's knowledge and approval.

In opposition to this averment stated in paragraph S of the Petition, the paragraph

XVII of the statement of objections filed by the IS[ to 4th Respondents controvert this

assertion by averring that the Petitioner had not obtained prior approval for the

installation of any machinery to increase the approved capacity for manufacturing

made tea, in contravention of the conditions in the registration certificate. In regard

to this important question of the approved maximum capacity that the Petitioner's

tea factory could manufacture, it has been asserted in the objections that the 4th

Respondent Tea Commissioner has from time to time revised the monthly approved

maximum capacity of the Petitioner's tea factory subsequent to inspection of the

factory. Such revisions are said to be as follows:-

a) Increased from 57,200 kg on 17'h January 2000 to 67,000 kg on 17'h September

2004 (R2(c) and R2(d;

b) Increasedfrom 67,000 kg to 140,000 kg on 15th December 2015 (R2(a;

c) Retained at 140,000 kg on OSth March 2019 (R2(b;

d) Increased from 140,000 kg to 170,000 kg from nnd February 2020.

Thus the fact that the Tea Commissioner had increased the production limit of the

Petitioner's tea factory multiple times is demonstrated by the registration certificates

marked R2(a), R2(b), R2(c) and R2(d). These are documents that have been

appended to the Respondent's statement of objections. Further, it would appear that

the Respondents have expliCitly informed the Petitioner that as a tea manufacturer he

should adhere to the approved maximum capacity on tea production. This salient

5

factor is evidenced by the letters marked Rll( a) and Rll(b) that have been appended

to the Respondent's statement of objections.

Thus it becomes clear that any excess of production has always been with the written

approval granted to the Petitioner and it cannot be contended that the Respondents

have acquiesced in the violation or infringement of the maximum production

capacity. It has to be pinpointed at this stage that the documents marked Rll(a) and

Rll(b) by which the Respondents directed the Petitioner to adhere to the limits on

production on multiple occasions have not been disclosed to this court and the

learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General contended that this amounts to a

suppression of material facts.

In fact the document marked Rll(a) reveals that the required minimum green leaf

standard to manufacture made tea of good quality is 60%. The letter makes it clear

that the leaf quality of the Petitioner is below the required standard and the

document marked Rll(a) instructs the Petitioner to improve the leaf standards and

therefore his request for increase in capacity cannot be acceded to. As I said before, it

is the Sri lanka Tea Board (Quality Standard of Green leaf) Regulation, No.2 of 2010

that imposes a minimum cap of green leaf standard to manufacture made tea of good

quality at 60% and the Regulation and the leaf Quality Inspection Report pertaining

to the Petitioner's factory dated 09th October 2019 have been annexed to the

statement of objection as Rll and R13.

It is quite clear that it is the Sri lanka Tea Board (SlTB) which is vested with the

authority to regulate the tea industry and towards this end, the authority is

responsible for setting in motion measures to ensure the supply of good quality green

leaf to all existing factories with the view to promoting high quality manufacturing of

tea. In the course of the argument, this court heard arguments on the challenges

facing the tea industry, namely, the severe shortage of green leaf. It was brought to the

notice of this Court that green leaf supplies to factories (registered tea manufactures)

such as the Petitioner have been dwindling over the years and this has impacted on

5

the volume of exports of Ceylon Tea resulting in difficulties to maintain high prices

for Ceylon Tea which has always maintained its synonymous reputation.

We have taken cognizance of these arguments and the crux of the issue before us is

the lawfulness of the directions given in P7 and P9. What the Tea Brokers have been

told to do by way of P7 and P9 has been well known to the Petitioner. From the time

of its registration the Petitioner is aware of the one of the conditions of his

registration namely he cannot go beyond a particular quota of production if I may put

it simply. The Petitioner sought an enhancement. He was given this increase namely

170,000 kg of manufactured tea. He had been periodically given the enhancements.

None of those enhancements had been challenged before. So in accordance with the

latest increase, the Tea Brokers were to told not to accept manufactured tea from not

only from this Petitioner but also from others if they exceeded their quota. There is no

mismatch between the directions in P7 and P9 and the conditions of registrations as

well as the quota the Petitioner has to produce. If P7 and P9 had told the Tea Brokers

not to accept manufactured tea from a manufacturer contravening his permitted cap,

they are in conformity with the conditions of registration of a licensed Tea

Manufacturer and no illegality or Wednesbury unreasonableness arises in the case.

If P7 and P9 are sought to be quashed, the other tea manufacturers who are not before

this Court will seek similar privileges of contravening their own caps on production

and a Court cannot and should not act in vain as Lord Wilberforce said in the case of

Malloch v. Aberdeen Corporation (No.1) (1971) 1 WLR 1578.

In the circumstances we proceed to refuse this application.

Sobhitha Rajakaruna,J.

I agree.
