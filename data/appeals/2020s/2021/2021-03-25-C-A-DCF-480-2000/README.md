The Plaintiff - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Plaintiff") instituted an

action in the District Court on or around 17th October 1991, sought from Court inter alia as

follows:

a. For ejection of the original Defendant and her servants, agents and those who are

holding under her from the premises more fully described in the schedule to the plaint

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the subject property").

b. For a judgement amounting to a sum of Rs.1,800/- as damages and a sum of Rs.50/-

per month until the Defendant is ejected from the subject property and the Plaintiff's

possession is restored.

The Plaintiff claims that he became the lawful owner of the subject property in or around 30th

September 1963. The Original Defendant entered the subject property with leave and license of

the Plaintiff and no rent has been obtained from the Defendant by the Plaintiff. Thereafter, the

Plaintiff sent a quit notice to the Defendant on or around 5th August 1988, and the Defendant

failed to leave the subject property despite the warning of the Plaintiff. The Defendant has been

in possession of the subject property and has been causing damages to the Plaintiff from 1st

October 1998, amounting to a sum of Rs.50/- per month.

pg. 3

Since the lawful ownership of the Plaintiff was admitted, the Defendant started her case and the

original Defendant, Manandewage Sumanawathie (on behalf of the National Housing

Commission), one Gunadasa Perera (on behalf of the Kotikawatte Municipal Council) gave

evidence on behalf of the Defendant and produced as evidence documents marked from "VI" to

"V8". After the conclusion of the case of the Defendant, the original Defendant passed away and

accordingly Substituted Defendant-Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the

substituted Defendants") were submitted in the place of the original Defendant.

The Plaintiff states that the Defendant has failed in establishing the Contract of Tenancy in

respect of the subject property. The title of the subject property was not disputed by the

Defendant and in fact the Defendant had admitted the Plaintiff as the lawful owner of the subject

property. It is therefore submitted by the Plaintiff that the burden shifted on to the Defendant

to prove the contract of tenancy, but the Defendant failed to establish the same.

The Plaintiff also claims that the unavailability of the documents relied upon by the Defendant

does not bar the Plaintiff from reaping the fruits of the Judgement. The function of the Appeal

Court is to consider as to whether the trial Judge has applied correct standards and procedure in

inferring, and mere unavailability of documents at the appeal stage would not amount to setting

aside a judgement. Therefore, it is submitted by the Plaintiff that the position of the Defendant

on unavailability of documents cannot hinder the Plaintiff from reaping the fruits of the

judgement dated 24.04.2000 by the learned District Judge.

The Defendant, in response, states inter alia that the corpus is owned by the Plaintiff and that the Defendant had taken the corpus on rent in 1971 and that the Defendant is occupying the said

premises as the lawful tenant by paying rent and therefore the said corpus is subject to the

provisions of the Rent Act.

The Defendant states that on 12.04.1971 the Defendant legally rented and came into occupation

as a legal tenant of the said premises. Since then till end of 1984 the relevant rental was paid to the Plaintiff and was accepted by the Plaintiff although the Plaintiff did not issue any receipts for the payments. The Plaintiff owns more than four houses and in the same period the Defendant's daughter rented another house from Plaintiff which is owned by him. In 1982 the Plaintiff was

preparing to sell the premises in suit and the Defendant intending to purchase this property made

an application to the Commissioner for National Housing under the Provisions of Section 13 of

the Ceiling of Housing Property.

The Defendant states that according to the said application the Commissioner for National

Housing made an inquiry in 1984 and the Plaintiff stated that he has no intention of selling the said house anymore and further stated that the Defendant is not a Tenant but only a Licensee. Thereafter, the Plaintiff refused to accept the house rental from month of January 1985 and the Defendant deposited the relevant house rental to Kotikawatte - Mulleriyawa Town Council. In 1984 the Plaintiff gave up the idea of selling the corpus and after 6 - 7 years the Plaintiff has filed

pg. 4

this case to cancel the legal tenancy of the Defendant and to eject the Defendant and the substituted Defendants who are the children of the Defendant.

In the circumstances aforesaid, the Defendant states that it is imperative to decide and determine whether the premises in suit was occupied by the original Defendant (now deceased)

as a tenant as per the position of the Appellants or as a licensee as contended by the Respondents. If the original Defendant was a tenant then the provisions of the Rent Act would

apply, and as such the procedure laid down in Section 22 of the said Act must be complied with for the purpose of ejectment. The question of whether the original Defendant was a tenant or a licensee must be decided on a balance of probabilities.

The document marked as V1 and V2 which were marked and proven during trial is evidence of the fact that there was a move by the Plaintiff to sell the corpus in the early part of 1984 and further that the original Defendant requested to purchase it from the Housing Development Authority (Commissioner for National Housing) by way of the application V1. Thereafter, the

Housing Development Authority (Commissioner for National Housing) fixed this case for inquiry at which inquiry both the original Defendant and Plaintiff gave evidence. This evidence is marked

as V2.

The testimony on the contents of document marked V2 is given by M.D. Sumanawathie an Officer of the Housing Development Authority (Commissioner for National Housing) who confirms that

the position taken by both the Appellant and Respondent in this trial was taken by them at the stage of that inquiry i.e. in the year 1984.

The Defendant states that at this inquiry the Plaintiff who originally wanted to sell the premises

in question retracts from his original intention and says that he does not wish to proceed with

the sale as he wishes to bestow the said premises on his children. It is only thereafter that the original Defendant starts paying the rent to the authorized person instead of the landlord. This

is confirmed by document marked V4 which has been confirmed by G. Perera Mulleriyawa,

Kotikawatta Divisional Secretariat.

The Defendant states that the document marked V4 is a summary of the rent paid in respect of the premises in suit. After 4 years since the said inquiry took place at the National Housing Development Authority (Commissioner for National Housing) the original Plaintiff purportedly

issued a Notice to quit marked as P1 dated 05.08.1988. After over 3 years since the said notice the plaint in the instant case was filed i.e. 17.10.1991.

The Defendant states that it is also imperative to note that the Plaintiff took over 4 years to issue the said notice to quit even after becoming aware that the original Defendant does not consider herself to be a licensee. Further, ejectment proceedings were instituted over 3 years thereafter. the Latin phrase main Vigilantibus Et Non Dormientibus Jura Subveniunt which means that the law assists those that are vigilant with their rights, and not those that sleep thereupon, is one that has great relevance in this instance.

pg. 5

The Defendant states that in any event, the Plaintiff has consistently taken up the position that

the Plaintiff granted leave and license to the original Defendant and her children on a

sympathetic basis. If so would it not have been probable that the purported notice to quit ought

to have been issued in closer proximity to when the original Defendant offered to buy the premises from the Plaintiff i.e. after 1984 and not in 1987.

The Defendant states that it is clear that the Plaintiff has in fact taken well over 7 years to institute

proceedings against the original Defendant to eject her well after she stopped paying her rent.

Another material point the Defendants embark upon is the fact that ought to consider is that at

times material to this action, the Plaintiff had leased out of his other houses to the daughter of

the original Defendant. This was revealed by non-other the Plaintiff himself during cross

examination (vide page 140 of the Appeal brief).

Therefore, the Defendants submit that there is a high probability that the Plaintiff would have not only given a house on lease to the original Defendant's daughter but also to the original Defendant during the same period.

Subsequent to a thorough analysis of the arguments of the Plaintiff and the Defendant, it is

pertinent to note that even though the Defendant claimed that she paid rent in respect of the

subject property since 1971 when they came into possession of the subject property, she failed to produce receipts or any other document of such payment. Therefore, it is submitted by the

Plaintiff that the Defendant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence in order to prove the existence of a contract of tenancy between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.

In George Wille's book of "Londlord and tenant in South Africa" it is stated that;

"A lease is formed by the consent or agreement of the parties on three essential

points: (1) that the object of the contract is to let and hire (2) Ascertained property

(3) At a fixed rent. The parties to the contract must of course, be capable of

contracting, their consent must be freely given, and the purpose of the contract must

not be illegal. .. "

In order to form a lease agreement, the above said pre-requisites have to be fulfilled but none

of the requirements have been adhered to by the Defendant.

MARY BEATRICE AND OTHERS v. SENEVIRATNE SLR 1997 - Volume 1, Page No -197

The plaintiff-respondent instituted action to eject the original defendant from the house in

question. It was the position of the plaintiff that the house was leased out to the original

defendant's husband by a Deed of lease (P6) and on his widow and children were permitted to

reside in the house. The original defendant died after the institution of the action. The

substituted defendants-appellants denied the Deed of Lease, and claimed title to the premises

by prescription. The District Court held with the plaintiff. On appeal-

pg. 6

Held:

1. The leases (P5 and P6) were established and proved. The defendants are estopped from

asserting title in view of the fact that the substituted defendants' father had acquiesced in the

rights of the plaintiff as owner of the subject matter. The predecessor of the defendants was the

lessee of the thatched house only, if he had any claim or title to th e land and the trees there was

no necessity for them to enter into P5 and P6.

2.Even assuming that the defendant had become owner of the entire premises, it was not open

to him to refuse to surrender possession. He must first give LIP possession and then it would be

open to him to litigate about the ownership.

3.The defendants are not entitled to dispute the title of the plaintiff. The plaintiff need not

institute an action in rem.

In EDIRlslNGHE v. CHAR LIS slNGHO sLR 2000 - Volume 3, Page No - 380

The Commissioner after Inquiry, directed that the Respondent, who claimed to be the t enant cultivator be restored to possession on the basis that he had been evicted by the Appellant who became the owner of the field under Deed No. 2469. This Order was affirmed by the High Court. On Appeal.

Further, the following portion of the evidence shows the intention and/or objective of the

Plaintiff in granting the possession to the Defendant. ;

pg. 7

It could therefore be seen that the Plaintiff has given his consent for the Defendant to possess the subject property upon sympathy and the objective of this consent was merely Plaintiff's sympathy towards the Defendant and has never had an oral or written agreement to let and hire.

Moreover, it could also be noted that even though the Defendant claimed to have paid rent, there is no evidence adduced in order to prove the same as illustrated below

"9: 71 Su 81 ~ 1:ifi:b 1:ll(3 eCDI)D, z;l"'Z51 1Sl,6~,D wdg 1Sl6:51Z51 e@,Z51@

Further, the amount purported to have paid as rent to the Municipal Council lacks consistency

and in turn breaks Defendant's position of the contract of tenancy.

It is also imperative to note that upon the fact that he has been the lawful owner of the subject

property and had given the subject property unto the defendant with the leave and license. In

case of license, legal possession continues to vest with the owner and the licensee is permitted

to use the property for a particular purpose. The Defendant came into possession of the subject

property in 1971 and had been there with the leave and license of the Plaintiff, Plaintiff has never

pg. 8

accepted any money from the Defendant as rent, even the rent purported to have paid to

municipal council has not been obtained by the Plaintiff.

The Defendant was in possession of the subject property with the leave and license

of the Plaintiff and Plaintiff has a right to revoke the license granted to the

Defendant. Therefore, when a person is in possession with leave of the owner and

when a notice to quit is forwarded to him asking for peaceful and vacant possession

of that property, the licensee is bound to quit the said property.

In an Indian case of Associated Hotels of India Pvt Ltd Vs R.N. Kapoor (1960) lSCR 368 (SC 1959)

Subra Rao J. held as below;

" ......... If a document gives only a right to use the property in a particular way or under

certain terms while it remains in possession and control of the owner thereof, it will be a

license. The legal possession, therefore, continues to be with the owner of the property,

but the licensee is permitted to make use of the premises for a particular purpose'. But

for the permission, his occupation would be unlawful. It does not create in his favor any

estate or interest in the property".

Therefore, it could be seen that there has been a license granted to the defendant and

when she was asked to quit by the lawful owner, she was bound to quit and restore the

vacant and peaceful possession of the subject property to the Plaintiff.

The notice to quit marked as "oIl" therefore amounts to termination of the license

granted by the Plaintiff, and thereafter the Defendant is no longer a licensee and has no

right to possess the subject property.

In the said circumstances, it could be concluded that the Defendant has been in

possession of the subject property as a licensee and therefore the Plaintiff has the right

to revoke the license granted by the Plaintiff. The appeal is hereby dismissed.
