JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam J

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter after referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General under Sections 54(A) (b) and

54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended

by Act No. 13 of 1984 for Trafficking and Possession respectively of 8.64

grams of Heroin on 17th October 2011 in the High Court of Colombo.

After trial the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed life imprisonment on both counts

on 15th of June, 2015.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. During the argument he was connected via zoom from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. Inward journey of the production is not proved beyond

reasonable doubt by the prosecution.

2. Case for the prosecution fails the test of probability.

Back ground of the case.

On 17/10/2011 IP Thushara Sampath Pushpakumara attached to Police

Narcotic Bureau had received information from PS 26878 Obeysekera about

the trafficking of Heroin by a person called Dematagoda Shanka. He with 06

other police officers attached to Police Narcotic Bureau had left for the raid

after completing all necessary formalities. The team had left the bureau at

6.50am and reached Kotikawatta around 7.45am as per the information.

The team had waited near the Kotikawatta Crematorium and the informant

had arrived around 8.30am and had met Sgt.26878 Obeysekera and had re-

confirmed that the Appellant was planning to traffic drugs on that day. The

police party had waited there till 13:20 hours and the informant had called

Sgt 26878 Obeyekera and had asked them to meet him near the Cargills

Food City situated on Gothatuwa road and they had therefore waited at the

car park till the arrival of the informant. The informant had arrived and

informed them that the Appellant would be coming from his home for the

transaction and asked the witness and PS 26878 Obeysekera to wait on the

Galkotuwa Road. Accordingly, the witness and PS 26878 Obeysekera had

walked to Galkotuwa Road junction and waited. After some time, the

informant had showed a person who was wearing a denim trouser and a shirt

coming along the Galkotuwa Road and left the place. The witness and PS

26878 Obeysekera after identifying themselves stopped the Appellant and

did a body search. In his right trouser pocket, a parcel covered in a grocery

bag was found and upon further examination powder like substance was

detected in that parcel. Further a cell phone, a purse and Rs.200,000/= cash

in Rs.2000/= denomination were found in his possession. On a field

examination the substance found in the possession reacted for Diacetyl

Morphine alias Heroin. Hence the Appellant was arrested for possession of

Heroin around 13:50 hours. Thereafter he was taken to Cargills Food City

car park in a three-wheeler. From there he was taken to his house situated

off Galkotuwa Road for further investigation. As the house search did not

4 | P a g e

reveal any illegal substance, the police party concluded their investigation

and returned to the Bureau at 16:45 hours.

At the Police Narcotic Bureau, the Heroin was properly weighed and sealed

after obtaining the thumb impression of the Appellant. The parcel was

weighed approximately 107grams and was marked as production number

159/11. The money which had been recovered from the Appellant was also

sealed and marked as production number 160/11. The witness had handed

over the parcels to the reserve police officer IP/Rajakaruna. At the trial he

had identified the production and the Appellant properly. For this raid the

assistance of the Police Special Task Force was also sought by the officers of

the Police Narcotic Bureau.

PW09 PS Obeysekera who had received the information and participated in

the raid along with PW01 had properly corroborated the evidence of PW01

without any contradiction or omission.

IP/Rajakaruna to whom the productions were handed over by PW01 had

given evidence and confirmed that he handed over the same to the

Government Analyst on 28/10/2011 and identified the production and the

Government Analyst Receipt which had been marked as P5 in the trial. In

the receipt the Government Analyst had confirmed that the productions

pertaining to this case had been handed over by PW06 IP/Rajakaruna with

seals intact.

PW08 Assistant Government Analyst Mrs. Jayasekera had given evidence

and confirmed that the parcel marked as P1 had contained 8.64 grams of

pure Heroin. The Government Analyst Report was marked as Y at the trial.

Her qualifications and expertise in the field of narcotics have been admitted

under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 by

the defence.

After the closure of the prosecution case defence was called and the

Appellant had made a dock statement and totally denied the charge. He

5 | P a g e

further said that he was arrested at his residence and he had been wrongly

connected to this case as his father was known for being engaged in drug

transactions.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person. In the case of this

nature the prosecution not only need to prove the case beyond reasonable

doubt but also ensure, with cogent evidence that the inward journey of the

production has not been disturbed at the all-material point.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable

doubt. Although we take serious view in regard to offences

relation to drugs, we are of the view that the prosecutor

should not be given a second chance to fill the gaps of badly

handled prosecutions where the identity of the good

analysis for examination has to be proved beyond

reasonable doubt. A prosecutor should take pains to ensure

that the chain of events pertaining to the productions that

had been taken charge from the Appellant from the time it

was taken into custody to the time it reaches the

Government Analyst and comes back to the court should be

established.

In Perera V. Attorney General [1998] 1 Sri.L.R it was held:

the most important journey is the inward journey because

the final analyst report will depend on that.

In Witharana Doli Nona v.The Republic of Sri Lanka CA/19/99 His

Lordship Justice Abrew remarked thus;

It is a recognized principle that in drug related cases the

prosecution must prove the chain relating to the inward

6 | P a g e

journey. The purpose of this principle is to establish that the

productions have not been tampered with. Prosecution

must prove that the productions taken from the accused

Appellant was examined by the Government Analyst

Therefore, proving the chain of custody is a very important task for the

prosecution. If investigating officers do not do their duty properly, the chain

of custody can be successfully challenged at the trial. This is because the

prosecution always relies on evidence gathered by police officers in cases of

this nature.

In the first ground of appeal the Appellant takes up the position that the

Inward Journey of the production has not been proved beyond reasonable

doubt by the prosecution. Thereby the learned counsel for the Appellant

argues that the conviction is bad in law and unsafe.

According to chief investigation officer IP Pushpakumara, after coming to the

Police Narcotic Bureau the substance found in the possession of the

Appellant was weighed and sealed properly and handed over to PW09 IP

Rajakaruna. This evidence has been properly corroborated without any

contradiction by PW09. It is apparent that PW09 had not mentioned the

name of the officer from whom he has received the production No.159/11.

But in his evidence, he has very correctly mentioned that the same

production had been handed over to the Government Analyst. Failure to

mention the name of the officer from whom he received the production will

not occasion any impact on the prosecution case as in this case the same

person who received the production had handed it to the Government

Analyst with all seals intact.

Further the Counsel for the Appellant brought to the notice of the court that

in the proceedings at page 99, the last answer of PW09, is typed as that he

had handed over the production at 14:16 hours to a person called Ratnapala

at the Government Analyst Department. The Government Analyst in her

7 | P a g e

evidence confirmed at page 179 of the brief that the production pertaining to

this case had been received from IP Rajakaruna of Police Narcotic Bureau on

28/10/2011.In the receipt which had been marked as P05 the Government

Analyst has remarked that the parcel marked as P1 was properly sealed.

Considering this evidence, it appears that the stenographer who had taken

down the evidence of PW09 wrongly mentioned the name of Ratnapala as the

person who received the production at the Government Analyst Department.

This error was not corrected by the prosecution before passing the judgment.

This error has no effect on the prosecution case as the Government Analyst

confirmed that she had received the production from IP Rajakaruna of the

Police Narcotic Bureau.

Considering the evidence presented by the prosecution with regard to Inward

Journey, I conclude that with all material points considered there is no break

in the chain of production in its inward journey as advanced by the counsel

for the Appellant. Therefore, I conclude that the first ground of the Appellant

is devoid of any merit.

In the other ground of appeal, the counsel for the Appellant contends that

the case for the prosecution fails the test of probability.

In the case of Wickremasuriya v.Dedoleena and others 1996 [2] SLR 95

Jayasuriya J held that;

A judge, in applying the Test of Probability and

Improbability relies heavily on his knowledge of men and

matters and the patterns of conduct observed by human

beings both ingenious as well as those who are less

talented and fortunate

His Lordship further held that;

If the contradiction is not of that character, the Court

ought to accept the evidence of witnesses whose evidence

is otherwise cogent, having regard to the Test of

8 | P a g e

Probability and Improbability and having regard to the

demeanour and deportment manifested by witnesses.

Trivial contradictions which do not touch the core of a

partys case should not be given much significance,

especially when the probabilities factors echoes in favour

of the version narrated by an applicant

In Iswari Prasad v. Mohamed Isa 1963 AIR (SC) 1728 at 1734 His Lordship

held that;

In considering whether evidence given by a witness

should be accepted or not, the court has to examine

whether he is, in fact, an interested witness and to inquire

whether the story deposed to by him is probable and

whether it has been shaken in cross-examination. That is

-whether there is a ring of truth surrounding his

testimony.

Justice Mackenna Discretion, The Irish Jurist, Vol.IX (new series), 1 at 10

has said;

When I have done my best to separate the true from the

false by these more or less objective tests, I say which

story seems to me the more probable, the plaintiffs or the

defendants, and If I cannot say which, I decide the case,

as the law requires me to do in defendants favour.

Guided by the above cited judgments and writing now I consider the second

ground of appeal advanced by the Appellant in this case.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge has considered all evidence

adduced by both the prosecution and the defence. The Judge had the

advantage of observing the demeanour and deportment of the witnesses.

According to PW01 they had received the information at about 5.35am on

17/10/2011. After constituting a team, they had left the Police Narcotic

9 | P a g e

Bureau at around 6.50am and reached Kotikawatta at around 7.45am. The

informant had arrived there at 8.30am and re-confirmed the trafficking of

Heroin by the Appellant. At around 13:15 hours the informant had called

PW02 and asked them to meet him near Cargills Food City on Gothatuwa

Road. The police team came there in five minutes time and PW01 and PW02

had met the informant at 13:25 hours. The informant told them that the

Appellant was coming from his house for the business and asked them to be

at Galkotuwa Road junction. While waiting there, the informant had shown

a person coming towards Galkotuwa junction as the Appellant. After

establishing their identity, the Appellant was searched by PW01 and PW02

who found the substance in his possession. He was arrested at 13:50 hours

and brought up to their vehicle in a three-wheeler and taken to his house

which is situated off Galkotuwa Road for further investigations.

Learned counsel for the Appellant drawing our attention to pages

76,77,78,109,112,115,117,118 of the brief argues that above mentioned

evidence is not probable and cannot be believed. He further submitted that

the Appellant was not arrested at Galkotuwa Road junction but he was

arrested at his residence. Although the information was specific the raiding

team had obtained the address from the Appellant after his arrest. Hence the

counsel for the Appellant argues no such incident happened as claimed by

the prosecution.

In this case the investigating officers had received information that the

Appellant was leaving his house with Heroin. No specific time was

mentioned. But the police team had waited almost six hours to complete

their task. Considering their evidence there is no improbable evidence

considered during the trial. Their evidence pertaining to the raid was clear,

cogent and was devoid of any contradiction or ambiguity. Their evidence is

not challenged at all. Considering all the circumstances their action cannot

be faulted at any stage of the raid.

10 | P a g e

This ground of appeal also fails as the Learned High Court judge very

correctly acted on the overwhelming evidence adduced by the prosecution.

Considering all the evidence presented during the trial, we conclude that the

prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. We further

conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which to interfere with the

decision of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 19/06/2015.

Hence, we dismiss this appeal.

Appeal is dismissed.
