Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The Petitioners have submitted an appeal to the University Services Appeals Board

(USAB) in January 2014, seeking the payment of an allowance known as the

Academic Allowance that is paid to all Lecturers of Universities coming under the

purview of the 29th Respondent, the University Grants Commission (UGC). By an

order delivered on 8th November 2016, the USAB, having come to the conclusion that

the Petitioners have been denied their academic allowance unreasonably, had

nonetheless concluded that the USAB does not have the jurisdiction to direct the

UGC or the 1st Respondent, the University of Moratuwa to pay an allowance to an

employee of a University.

The Petitioners thereafter invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, seeking inter alia the

following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Board of Management of the

Institute of Technology of the University of Moratuwa refusing to pay the

academic allowance to the Petitioners;

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to pay the academic allowance

to the Petitioners.

Although the Petitioners had sought a Writ of Certiorari to quash the order of the

USAB, the Petitioners did not actively pursue the said relief, thus leaving this Court to

determine whether the Petitioners are entitled to the above relief independent of

the findings of the USAB.

The issue that arises for determination in this application is whether the Petitioners

are entitled to the payment of the said academic allowance that is paid to the

lecturers of all State Universities. As the Universities Act uses the word, teacher to

collectively refer to a Professor, Associate Professor, Senior Lecturer, Lecturer and

Assistant Lecturer etc, I shall, where appropriate in this judgment, use the word

teacher/s when referring to a lecturer/s.

5

The Petitioners, some of whom have Bachelors Degrees and all of whom have

Masters Degrees have joined the Faculty of Engineering of the 1st Respondent as

Engineering Teaching Assistants (ETAs) during the period 1977 1985. Over a period

of time, the Petitioners have received promotions as ETAs Grade I and Senior ETAs.

The Petitioners state that as ETAs, their duties were identical to that of lecturers and

that they conducted classes, lectures and tutorials for those students who were

reading for the Bachelor of Science in Engineering and the National Diploma in

Technology. It is admitted that ETAs are on a different salary scale to teachers. It is

also admitted that ETAs are not paid the academic allowance and that payment of

the academic allowance is limited to teachers.

The Petitioners state that in the year 2000, the Minister of Education, by an Order

made under Section 24A of the Universities Act marked P8 established the Institute

of Technology of the University of Moratuwa (ITUM)(the Institute). The following

provisions of P8 relate to the Staff of the Institute:

Paragraph 21(2) - On the establishment of the Institute, the Staff of the Institute

shall be provided on release by the University from among its own staff, or be

appointed by the Commission or the University, as the case may be.

Paragraph 21(3) Where an officer, teacher or other employee of the University has

been released for service to the Institute on a full time basis, the Institute shall pay

him the salary and the allowances of his substantive post in the University. In any

other case, the Institute may pay such officer, teacher or other employee, such

allowance as it may determine in consultation with the University and the approval of

the Commission.

The Petitioners state that applications were called for the post of Lecturer

(Probationary) / Senior Lecturer Grade I / Senior Lecturer Grade II at the Institute.

The Petitioners had responded by submitting their applications and had been

interviewed by the Institute. By a letter dated 18th October 2000, annexed to the

petition marked P10a, the Petitioners had been informed that the University

Council had decided to release the Petitioners from their present employment, and

that they will be attached to the Institute on a full time basis under the provisions of

paragraph 21(2). The said decision was to become effective from 1st November 2000

6

and the Petitioners were to become members of the Staff of the Institute from that

date.

The Petitioners had been informed by letter dated 1st November 2000, annexed to

the petition marked P11 that they have been appointed to the post of Lecturer

(Probationary) of the Institute with effect from 1st November 2000. In terms of P11,

the Petitioners had been placed on the salary scale of a Lecturer (Probationary) of Rs.

11,000 per month with an entitlement to ten increments at the rate of Rs. 375. Apart

from the salary, the Petitioners were to be paid an allowance of 30% of the basic

salary and a Monthly Compensatory Allowance (MCA) of Rs. 1000 per month.

P11 also specified that:

if you are presently in receipt of a take home pay which is higher than the take

home pay receivable in the new post, you would be entitled to receive a monthly

allowance on a personal to the holder basis to ensure that your take home pay

would not be reduced as a result of accepting this appointment.

The intention right from the beginning therefore has been that the Petitioners

cannot be paid less than what they were being paid as ETAs. The critical factor in

P11 is that the Petitioners were being placed on the salary scale of their new

designation of teacher, which was lower than the salary that the Petitioners were

drawing as ETAs but the Petitioners were due to be paid an allowance to ensure that

the take home pay of each Petitioner was the same as October 2000 i.e. the last

salary that the Petitioners drew prior to their appointment as teachers in terms of

P11.

By a further letter dated 1st November 2000, marked R1, the University Grants

Commission, under the heading, Determination of salary payable to Engineering

Teaching Assistants of the University of Moratuwa who are to be appointed to the

post of Teachers at the Institute of Technology, University of Moratuwa had

informed the 2nd Respondent, Vice Chancellor of the 1st Respondent as follows:

The Commission has approved the payment of the difference between the

present salary drawn by the Engineering Teaching Assistants and the salary

7

payable to those who are appointed to the post of Lecturer (Probationary) in the

form of an allowance to be paid on a personal to the holder basis. The new

appointees will be placed on the initial of the salary scale and also pay (sic) a

personal allowance as specified above. This allowance will not be counted for

the calculation of the academic allowance of 30%.

R1 therefore recognised that the Petitioners will be placed on the salary scale of a

teacher as well as recognised the entitlement of the Petitioners to the academic

allowance of 30%, calculated on the basic salary of a teacher.

The Petitioners had expressed their displeasure with the above determination of

their salary and by a letter dated 14th February 2001, annexed to the petition marked

P14a, the Petitioners had proposed inter alia as follows:

The payment of the difference between the salary drawn by ETA and the salary

payable to those who are appointed to the post of lecturer (Probationary) in the

form of an allowance will not be justifiable as it will result in lowering of present

salary step we were enjoying in the old scale.

This will cause immense losses to us at future revisions of salary scales.

In our case, since the salary step of previous post is higher than the last step of

the new scale (i.e. Probationary Lecturer), the only possible placement should be

to retain the salary step we have been enjoying as ETA, having made it personal

to us as Lecturer (probationary) and whatever the allowances that are paid to

Lecturer (probationary) to be paid to us without any discrimination.

What the Petitioners were seeking therefore was to be placed on the higher salary

scale that they were receiving as ETAs, which is higher than the salary scale they

were to be placed as teachers, as well as receive all allowances including the

academic allowance that were being paid to teachers. In other words, the Petitioners

were seeking the best of both salary scales. If the above request was acceded to, the

Petitioners, while being lecturers, would have drawn a gross salary higher than what

was being paid to a Senior Lecturer, thus creating an anomaly within the system.

8

Each of the Petitioners have thereafter been issued with a letter of appointment

dated 16th July 2001 marked P16 by the Vice Chancellor of the 1st Respondent,1

appointing them to the post of Lecturer (Probationary). The salient features of the

letter of appointment are re-produced below:

3. This post is permanent and since you are a confirmed Engineering

Teaching Assistant in the Division of Inter-disciplinary of the Institute of

Technology, University of Moratuwa, you would in terms of Section

72(1)(c) of the Act, and its subsequent amendments as applicable, receive

exemption from the requirement of undergoing a further period of

probation.

11. The post carries a consolidated salary scale of Rs. 11,000 10 x 375

14,750 (B04) per mensem. You will be placed on the initial salary step of

Rs. 11,000 per month with effect from 1st November 2000 and you are

entitled to receive the following allowances:

(i) An Academic allowance of 30% of the salary i.e. Rs. 3300

(ii) Monthly Compensatory Allowance of Rs. 1000

(iii) Monthly allowance of Rs. 5500 payable on a personal to the holder

basis until you secure qualifications required to be promoted to the

post of Senior Lecturer Grade II, to ensure that your present take

home pay including salary and Monthly Compensatory Allowance

would not be reduced as a result of accepting this appointment. This

allowance would appropriately be recalculated in an event a revision

of salaries of Academic Staff is retrospectively effected, to ensure

that your take home pay would remain unchanged.

Thus, the request made by the Petitioners by P14a was partially allowed, in that

although they were placed on a salary scale of a teacher, they were given an

entitlement to the academic allowance as well as a special allowance to ensure that

the take home pay will not be reduced. The Petitioners were thus assured of

receiving the same take home salary that they would have received had they 1 Vide page 93 of the documents annexed to the petition.

continued as ETAs in the 1st Respondent University as opposed to joining the

Institute as teachers.

The Petitioners claim that in terms of P16, they were paid the academic allowance

of 30% of the salary.

The Petitioners state that as they were holding permanent posts in the 1st

Respondent, it was contrary to the provisions of the Universities Act to appoint them

as Lecturer (Probationary). The Petitioners had also been aggrieved by the decision

to place them at the initial salary step of teacher and pay them an equalization

allowance to ensure that their take home pay as teachers at the Institute were not

less than what they would have received as ETAs at the University.

The Petitioners admit that the Institute appointed a Committee comprising of the

Acting Director of the Institute, Professor Malik Ranasinghe, Professor B.L.

Tennekoon and two others to consider the above request of the Petitioners. The

recommendation of the Committee had been considered by the Board of

Management of the Institute and thereafter the Council of the 1st Respondent. By

letter dated 17th January 2002, annexed to the petition marked P14b the Director of

the Institute had informed the UGC as follows:

The Council at its 253rd meeting held on 3rd December 2001 having taken into

consideration the details forwarded by the above memos along with the

recommendation of the Board of Management decided to forward the following

recommendations to the UGC having noted that this mechanism would ensure

that the group of personnel affected would receive the same take home pay and

basic salary which they were in receipt in the post of Engineering Teaching

Assistant prior to their appointments to the post of Lecturer (Probationary).

Recommendations

1. According to Section 5C of the Universities (Amendment) Act No. 1 of

1995, a person holding a permanent post, when appointed to a post of

teacher in the same department need not undergo a probationary period.

10

Therefore, staff falling into this category must be considered confirmed

and that they be designated as lecturer.

2. To place them on the salary scale and pay allowances applicable to his/her

post immediately prior to the post of teacher in the Institute, on personal

to the holder basis, if the gross salary applicable to the present post of

teacher is lower than that of the post immediately (held) prior to the post

of teacher in the Institute.

3. He/she must be converted to the salary applicable to the post (of teacher)

if and when the basic salary applicable to the post becomes equal or

higher to the basic salary of the personal to the holder salary. If the gross

salary drawn by the staff members is lower than the gross salary

applicable to the post (of teacher), at any stage prior to the conversion,

such difference to be paid as a special allowance.

The underlying rationale behind the above recommendation was to ensure that the

group of personnel affected would receive the same take home pay and basic salary

which they were in receipt in the post of Engineering Teaching Assistant prior to their

appointment to the post of Lecturer (Probationary).

The decision of the UGC on the above recommendation is set out in its letter dated

27th September 2002, marked R2 and reads as follows:

1. According to Section 5C of the Universities (Amendment) Act No. 1 of

1995, a person holding a permanent post, when appointed to a post of

teacher in the same department need not undergo a probationary period.

Therefore, staff falling into this category must be considered confirmed

and that they be designated as lecturer.

2. To place them on the salary scale and pay allowances applicable to post

held immediately prior to the post of teacher in the Institute, on personal

to the holder basis, if the gross salary applicable to the new post of teacher

is lower than that of the post held immediately prior to the post of teacher

in the Institute.

11

3. To convert their salary whenever the basic salary applicable to the post of

teacher becomes equal or higher to (the) personal to the holder salary, or

if the gross salary drawn by the staff member is lower than the gross

salary applicable to the post of teacher, at any stage prior to the

conversion, such difference to be paid as a special allowance.

The following salient features are evident from R2:

a) The salary mechanism contained in R2 was personal to the Petitioners.

b) R2 recognises, and it is in fact admitted by all parties that the basic salary of a

teacher was lower than the basic salary that the Petitioners were drawing as

ETAs.

c) Thus, in terms of R2, the Petitioners were afforded a special privilege of being

placed on the same salary scale and the same salary step that they would have

been had they remained as ETAs at the 1st Respondent vide paragraph 2

(referred to as the personal to the holder basis).

d) However, R2 provided for a conversion from the said salary to the salary step

of a teacher, on a future date.

e) The future date would be when the basic salary of a teacher became higher

than the personal to holder salary that was to be paid to the Petitioners (i.e. the

salary scale of an ETA).

f) What is critical to this application is that until the conversion took place, and

provided there was a difference between the take home pay of the two posts

(i.e. teachers and ETAs), such difference was to be paid in the form of an

allowance.

The underlying principle in R2 therefore was to ensure that the take home salary of

the Petitioners remained the same, despite them having agreed to join the Institute.

Based on the above decision of the UGC, the Institute had issued a supplementary

letter of appointment dated 13th January 2003, marked R3, which reflects the

decision in R2, informing the Petitioners as follows:

12

I am pleased to inform you that as per University Grants Commission decision

at its 615th meeting held on 9th August 2002, your designation will be changed

from Lecturer (Probationary) to Lecturer, with effect from 1st November 2000

and the post is confirmed.

Further, until further notice, you will be placed on salary step Rs. 22,925 of the

B-03(a) scale (19,125 8x475 22,925) the scale attached to the previous post

you held (ETA Grade I) before appointment as Lecturer in the Institute of

Technology University of Moratuwa with effect from 1st November 2000. You

would also be paid the following allowances applicable to the post of ETA Grade

I as follows.

MCA: Rs. 2250 (10% of the salary)

Interim allowance: Rs. 1200

The above salary scale and allowances will be made on personal to the holder

basis until the gross salary applicable to the post of teacher is lower than that of

the post held immediately prior to the post of teacher in the Institute of

Technology University of Moratuwa.

Your salary will be converted to the salary attached to the post of teacher when

the basic salary applicable to the post of teacher becomes equal or higher to

personal to the holder salary or if the gross salary drawn by you is lower than

the gross salary applicable to the post of teacher you hold at any stage prior to

the conversion, such difference will be paid as a special allowance.

All other conditions stipulated in the letter of appointment issued to you dated

16th July 2001 remains unchanged.

It is clear that the terms of remuneration in P16 were replaced by the above terms

of remuneration in R2. What is critical is that the Petitioners request for the above

formula and the payment of an academic allowance vide P14a- was partially

rejected in that the 1st Respondent and the UGC, while agreeing to placing the

Petitioners on the salary scale of an ETA, did not agree to the payment of an

academic allowance to the Petitioners.

13

If the Petitioners, while holding the official designation of teacher were to be paid

the salary scale that they were entitled to as ETAs, which admittedly was higher than

the basic salary of a teacher, and the academic allowance as well, that would have

led to an anomaly, with the Petitioners receiving a gross salary higher than what they

would be entitled to in their official designation of teacher. Hence, the rationale for

not paying the academic allowance to the Petitioners. This is a reflection of the

underlying principle that their take home salary cannot be less than what they would

have enjoyed as ETAs.

The fact of the matter was that the Petitioners were drawing a higher salary in their

previous post as ETAs as a result of being placed at the upper end of the salary scale

by virtue of having served periods varying between 17-25 years. However, when they

joined the Institute, they did so as teachers, and were placed at the lower end of the

salary scale of a teacher. The result was that the Petitioners were getting as teacher,

a salary which was lower than what they drawing as ETAs. Hence, the resolution

offered to the Petitioners by the above decision of the UGC and reflected in R3 was

that the Petitioners would be placed on the salary step that they were in, as ETAs.

The Petitioners were now being placed in a hybrid situation, which originated at their

request. That is, while their designation was teacher, they were going to be paid the

salary of an ETA (on a personal to holder basis), which was higher than what the

Petitioners would have been entitled to as teachers, subject to an adjustment by way

of an allowance, to ensure that they received the same take home salary had they

not joined the Institute.

The UGC decision was that the salary and allowances specified in R3 would be paid

as long as the gross salary payable to a teacher was less than the aggregate of that

specified in R3. However, the UGC did contemplate there being a day when the

basic salary of a teacher may be higher than what the Petitioners would receive as an

ETA in terms of R3. Once that day arrived i.e. the conversion date - in terms of

R3, the salary of the Petitioners were to be converted to that of a teacher.

In essence, by virtue of joining the Institute, the Petitioners could not get a take

home pay less than what they would otherwise have received. The 1st Respondent,

14

and the UGC, by R2 had given the Petitioners an assurance that if such a situation

occurs, the equilibrium will be restored in the manner provided therein.

The Respondents have submitted a document marked R4a setting out the

comparison of the gross salary of a teacher and the actual salary that was paid to the

1st Petitioner from 1st November 2000 to 1st July 2014. The above narration as at 1st

November 2000 can be demonstrated by the following table:

Description ETA/actual payment to the Petitioners

Teacher

Basic salary 20550 16250 MCA 2250 1500 10% allowance 2055 1625 30% academic allowance - 4875 Gross Pay 24855 24250

The 1st Petitioner has received for the month of November 2000, which is the date

on which she assumed duties at the Institute, a salary of Rs. 24855, which is Rs. 605

higher than what she would have received as a Teacher. According to R4a, this

position continued until November 2006, and was applicable in respect of all

Petitioners.

Had the Petitioners been paid the academic allowance of 30% calculated on their

basic salary, the Petitioners would have received an additional sum of Rs. 6165, and a

total take home salary of Rs. 31,020, which is much higher than what they were

entitled to as teachers and thereby creating an anomaly with the salary paid to other

teachers. It is therefore evident from the above table that the Petitioners were not

being paid the academic allowance of 30% for the reasons that I have already

adverted to.

Even though the Petitioners were not being paid the academic allowance, the

Petitioners continued to receive a salary, as represented to them by R3, which was

marginally higher than what they would have received had they opted to be placed

at the starting step of a teacher.

15

The grievance of the Petitioners that culminated in this application appears to have

been triggered by three events. The first is that the Petitioners appear to have

reached the highest point in their salary scale and their basic salary was therefore

stagnant. The second is that the salary of teachers had been increased. The result

was that the difference between the basic salary that was drawn by the Petitioners

and the basic salary of a teacher had narrowed. The third event is the increase of the

academic allowance of a lecturer/Senior lecturer in the following manner:

August 2011 - 58% - 64%

January 2013 - 75% - 80%

January 2014 - 80% - 85%

December 2014 - 100% - 120%

January 2016 - 116% - 136%

As would be seen from the above, an academic allowance of approximately 30% of a

low basic salary ensured that the Petitioners received about the same take home pay

of a teacher. However, the saturation of the Petitioners basic salary and the increase

of the basic salary of a teacher and the academic allowance created a situation

where the gross salary of a teacher was now higher than the gross salary of an ETA

that the Petitioners had opted to draw (i.e. the personal to the holder salary).

This can be demonstrated by the following tables for different periods:

As at 1st January 2007

Thus, when the gross salary of a teacher increased beyond the gross salary of the

Petitioners, the Respondents should have ensured that the Petitioners received the

same salary as what they would have received had they been paid at the salary of a

teacher. In other words, the Respondents should have given effect to paragraph 3 of

R2 by the payment of a special allowance to cover the difference.2 The Respondents

however does not appear to have made that adjustment.

2 Vide penultimate paragraph of R3.

17

It is in the above circumstances that the Petitioners complained to the USAB about

the non-payment of the academic allowance.

I have already set out the evolution of the Petitioners from ETA to a teacher while

maintaining their salary as an ETA on a personal to holder basis but subject to

ensuring that their take home pay was not less than what they would have earned

had they continued as ETAs. Having opted for the above scheme, which was

beneficial to the Petitioners at that time, the Petitioners cannot later claim an

entitlement to the academic allowance, when doing so is more beneficial to the

Petitioners. The learned Senior State Counsel has quite rightly pointed out that the

Petitioners would be paid their academic allowance when the conversion takes place

and the Petitioners start receiving a salary of a teacher. The fact of the matter is that

the conversion has not taken place and therefore I am of the view that the

Petitioners are not entitled to the payment of the academic allowance which is a

component of the salary paid only to a teacher.

The Respondents have submitted that the basic salary of a teacher is substantially

less than the personal to holder salary that the Petitioners are receiving. If the

academic allowance of 136% is calculated at the personal to holder salary, that

would be unjust and be a windfall to the Petitioners. The learned Senior State

Counsel submitted that if this happened, the gross remuneration that the Petitioners

would receive will exceed that of other teachers including Professors and that such a

situation would be unfair and inequitable and lead to an anomaly.

However, all is not lost for the Petitioners, for the reason that in terms of paragraph

3 of R2, until the conversion takes place, the Petitioners are entitled to be paid the

difference by way of a special allowance. It appears from the above table for January

2014 that the Petitioners have only been paid a sum of Rs. 71129 whereas had they

been placed on the salary scale of a teacher, the Petitioners would have received Rs.

103,110. In terms of R3, the Petitioners are entitled to be paid the difference by

way of a special allowance, if payment has not been made already.

The Petitioners have sought a Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to pay

them the academic allowance. I have already held that the Petitioners are not

entitled to the payment of an academic allowance. I am therefore not in a position to

grant the Writ of Mandamus that has been prayed for.

18

However, I am of the view that in terms of R2 and R3 the Petitioners are entitled

to receive a gross take home pay which is equivalent to what a teacher in the grade

that the Petitioners were eligible to be in, would receive. The Petitioners have a legal

entitlement in terms of R2 and R3 to receive such a sum of money in the form of a

special allowance until the conversion date, and I am of the view that the

Respondents have a corresponding legal duty to pay such sum of money. A Writ of

Mandamus would thus be available to the Petitioners, directing the Petitioners to

comply with R2 and R3 by the payment of a special allowance.3

As held by the Supreme Court in Ranjanee Pathirana vs Secretary, Ministry of

Environment and Natural Resources and Others,4, In the field of public law the writ

of mandamus is a powerful weapon the Courts use freely to prevent breach of duty

and injustice. While this Court cannot grant relief where none has been prayed for,5

this Court has the power to issue a Writ which has been prayed for, albeit in a

modified form.6

Accordingly, I issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st 28th Respondents to take

the salary that the Petitioners would have been entitled to as a teacher inclusive of

the academic allowance, and deduct the actual salary paid to the Petitioners, and

thereafter take steps to pay the said difference, if any, to the Petitioners by way of a

special allowance as provided for in R2 and R3. As this may involve a significant

sum of money for which the 1st Respondent may not have any financial allocation, I

direct that the said calculation be done within three months from today and that the

said payment be made within a period of one year from today.

I make no order with regard to costs.
