Both parties agreed to get the argument disposed by way of written submissions. Anyhow none of the parties have filed the written submissions. There are several connected matters that were taken up together with this matter. The court observers that the facts relating to each are different. The Petitioner states that he was an employee of the Prima Ceylon Ltd and that he retired from his service eight months ago. The Petitioner states that he has been granted a tenancy in respect of the premises at B-43 in Daanyagama Housing Scheme, China Bay, Trincomalee upon a Lease Agreement has been entered into between the Petitioner and the Food Commissioner. Nevertheless, only a copy of a renewal rent agreement (marked as P3) of the said agreement entered into between the Petitioner and the Food Commissioner has been tendered along with the Petition. Although the Petitioner has failed to produce the copy of the original Lease Agreement referred to in said P3, he states that he has fully complied with terms and conditions of the said agreement including the payment of the monthly rental. The Petitioner further states that there had been several attempts to recover the possession of the premises by the Respondent. Later on, the Petitioner has been served with a quit notice in term of the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No.03 of 1971, dated 18th February 2019 (P4) against the Petitioner demanding him to hand over the premises alleging that the Petitioner has acted in breach of the terms of the said Lease Agreement. In spite of such circumstances, the Petitioner has made this application moving for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit notice marked P4 stating that the purported quit notice is bad in law for the reasons mentioned below.",

The original Lease Agreement R1 entered in to between the Petitioner and the Respondent has been submitted by the Respondent with his Statement of Objections. The lease period of the impugned Lease Agreement has been renewed by the said agreement P3. However, the lease period specified in the said Lease Agreement (P3) itself has expired on 29.09.2016 and the Petitioner has retired from the service of Prima Ceylon Limited. Therefore, it is observed that in view of Clause (iv) of the said Lease Agreement P3, the Lease Agreement has come to an end. Apart from the above findings, in order to decide as to whether the disputed quit notice is bad in law base on the reasons alleged by the Petitioner, this Court will have to consider whether the Petitioner or the Respondent has acted in breach of the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement. Furthermore, the court will have to take into consideration the contractual relationship between parties. However, in the case of Podinona Urban Council Horana 1981 (1) SLR 141, it was held that in as much as the relationship between the parties was contractual the Petitioner was not entitled to the remedy by way of Certiorari. In the case of Ariyaratne vs. the National Insurance Corporation and Others (2003 2 Sri Lr 212) it was held as follows;",
