MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner in this application has invoked the supervisory

jurisdiction of this Court under Article 140 of the Constitution

seeking, inter alia, the following relief:

a) a writ of certiorari quashing the orders of the 5th Respondent

dated 26.07.2013 marked P5 and 12.03.2015 marked P8. b) a writ of mandamus directing the 1st to 5th Respondents to

have an inquiry a fresh and permit the Petitioner to file his statement and participate in the proceedings of the inquiry pertaining to the application bearing No. 41935 in the Debt Conciliation Board.

The 1st Respondent is the chairman and 2nd to 4th Respondents are

the members of the Debt Conciliation Board which is the 5th

Respondent in this application.

The Petitioner states that by virtue of the Deed bearing No. 4105

dated 24.07.2008 attested by Mahinda Tissa Athukorale, Notary

Public marked P1, the 6th Respondent has transferred his property

to the Petitioner for a sum of Rs. 50,000/- and thereafter, once again

the 6th Respondent collected a sum of Rs. 350,000/- and had given

a letter dated 28.12.2010 which is marked as P2 stating that he

would not claim anything whatsoever pertaining to the said

transaction.

Thereupon, the 6th Respondent made an application to the 5th

Respondent on 25.01.2011 stating that the said deed marked P1

was not a transfer, but the particular land had been pledged to the

Petitioner in order to secure a loan. In paragraph 8 of the petition,

the Petitioner states that having received the notice he was present

before the 5th Respondent Board on 13.02.2012, 08.05.2012 and

02.10.2012. Since the Petitioner was not present before the 5th

Respondent on 06.11.2012, in terms of section 29 (1) of the Debt

Conciliation Ordinance, No. 39 of 1941 (hereinafter referred to as

Page 4 of 10

the Ordinance), the 5th Respondent issued notice on the Petitioner,

accordingly, the Petitioner was present before the 5th Respondent on

07.01.2013 and 01.04.2013. Thereafter, the matter was fixed for

inquiry on 17.07.2013.

The Petitioner further states that he could not take part in the

proceedings of the inquiry on 17.07.2013 as a result of an accident

due to which his leg was fractured. In the circumstances, on

17.07.2013, the 5th Respondent had taken up the inquiry ex parte

and consequently under section 29 (4) of the Ordinance issued a

certificate dated 24.09.2013. The said order and the certificate are

marked as P5 and P6 respectively. Thereafter, the 5th Respondent in

its order dated 12.03.2015 marked P8, rejected the application made

by the Petitioner to review the aforesaid order marked P5.

Being aggrieved by the said orders marked P5 and P8, the Petitioner

invokes the writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking to quash the same

on the grounds set out in the petition.

The 6th Respondent in his statements of objection took up the

position that he did not intend to transfer the property to the

Petitioner by the deed marked P1. The said deed of transfer was

executed only as a security for a loan. There was a mutual trust that

the Petitioner would re-transfer it to the 6th Respondent upon the

settlement of the said loan. Since the Petitioner refused to re-

transfer the property as agreed upon, the 6th Respondent made an

application before the 5th Respondent Board.

Having scrutinized the petition of the Petitioner and the statements

of objection of the 6th Respondent it appears to this Court that the

overriding questions for determination in this petition are as follows:

1. Whether the aforesaid impugned orders marked P5 and P8,

made by the 1st to 5th Respondents were in terms of the

provisions of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance.

Page 5 of 10

2. Did the 1st to 5th Respondents err in facts and law, when they

held that the deed marked P1 was executed as a security for

a loan obtained by the 6th Respondent from the Petitioner?

The 6th Respondent made an application to the Debt Conciliation

Board on 25.01.2011 claiming that the said deed of transfer marked

P1 is not, in fact, a transfer but a security for a loan obtained from

the Petitioner. Thereafter, upon being served with summons by the

5th Respondent Board, the Petitioner by his letter dated 12.10.2011

informed the 5th Respondent Board that he has not entered into any

transaction with the 6th Respondent, and therefore, there is no

necessity of him being present before the Board for an inquiry (vide

page of 118 of the case record). Thereupon, under section 29 (1) of

the Ordinance, the Board issued notices on the Petitioner.

Accordingly, the Petitioner was present before the Board on

07.01.2013 and 01.04.2013. Thereafter, matter was fixed for inquiry

on 17.07.2013. Admittedly, the Petitioner did not take part in the

proceedings of the inquiry on 17.07.2013. Hence, acting under

section 29 of the Ordinance the 5th Respondent rightly had taken up

the inquiry ex parte and consequently on 24.09.2013 issued a

certificate in terms of section 29 (4) of the Ordinance. Hence, it

appears that the Board had given adequate opportunities to the

Petitioner to take part in the proceedings in accordance with the

provisions of the said Ordinance. As such, the contention of the

Petitioner stating that the order marked P5 is contrary to the

provisions of the said Ordinance is devoid of merits.

It is pertinent to be noted that the Petitioner, having received the

notice under section 25 (1) of the Ordinance, informed the 5th

Respondent Board that it is not necessary for him to be present

before the Board. Moreover, the Petitioner having received the notice

under section 29 (1) of the Ordinance opted not to file the statement

of debts or objections. Furthermore, the Petitioner was absent on the

Page 6 of 10

date of inquiry. In the circumstances, there is no option to the 5th

Respondent Board but to take up the matter ex parte against the

Petitioner. Having scrutinized the proceedings of the 5th Respondent

Board it is manifestly clear that, the Petitioner has not taken interest

to proceed with the inquiry with due diligence.

It is the contention of the Petitioner that he had not been served with

notice in terms of section 29 (2) of the Ordinance prior to the

granting of the certificate in favour of the 6th Respondent in terms of

section 29 (4) of the Ordinance. It is borne out from the case record

that the notice under section 29 of the Ordinance had been first

served on the Petitioner upon being absent on 24.07.2012. Once

again on 06.11.2012 notice under section 29 had been served on

him through the Divisional Secretary. After notices have been duly

served on the Petitioner in terms of section 29 as aforesaid, the

matter was fixed for inquiry. As such, it is the considered view of

this Court that the 5th Respondent has duly given notices to the

Petitioner in terms of the provisions of the Ordinance before issuing

certificate under section 29 (4).

The Petitioner, in terms of section 54 of the Ordinance, made an

application dated 20.12.2013 to review the aforesaid order marked

P5. After inquiry, the 5th Respondent by order dated 12.03.2015

marked P8, dismissed the application on the basis, inter alia, that

the said application was time barred. An application for revision

under section 54 (1) of the Ordinance to be filed within three months

from the date of the order, which reads thus,

The Board may, of its own motion or on application made by any person interested, within three months from the making of an order by the Board dismissing an application, or granting a certificate, or approving a settlement, or before the payment of the compounded debt has been completed, review any order passed by it and pass such other in reference thereto as it thinks fit.

Page 7 of 10

In the instant case, the order granting a certificate in favour of the

6th Respondent was made on 26.07.2013 and the application under

section 54 (1) of the Ordinance was made by the Petitioner on

20.12.2013. As such, it is abundantly clear that the order of the 5th

Respondent, dismissing the application made under section 54 (1)

of the Ordinance, on the footing that the application was out of time,

is not wrong.

In paragraph 12 of the petition, it is stated that the Petitioner could

not take part in the proceedings of the inquiry on 17.07.2013 as a

result of an accident due to which his leg was fractured. This fact

has to be proved with cogent evidence to the satisfaction of the 5th

Respondent Board. It is to be noted that, in order to substantiate the

foregoing reason, the Petitioner has submitted only a private medical

certificate issued by an Ayuvedic practitioner who was not testified

before the Board as well. In the circumstances, it appears to this

Court that the Petitioner totally failed to establish the fact that he

could not be present before the Board on 17.07.2013 due to the

purported accident by which his leg was fractured.

The 2nd question to be considered is, as to whether the deed marked

P1 was an outright transfer, or a security executed in a loan

transaction. The contention of the 6th Respondent was that he has

executed the deed marked P1 in favour of the Petitioner as a security

for the loan of Rs. 50,000/- obtained from the Petitioner. In short,

the contention of the 6th Respondent was that the Petitioner is

holding the property by deed marked P1 on a constructive trust.

The possession of the property in dispute is a most important factor

to be considered in deciding the question of constructive trust. The

fact that after the execution of the deed of transfer, the transferor

remained in possession of the land would be an attendant

circumstance. It would show that the transferor did not intend to

dispose of the beneficial interest, although he signed the deed of

Page 8 of 10

transfer. Vide Ehiya Lebbe v. Majeed [1947] 48 NLR 357, Thisa

Nona and Three Others v. Premadasa [1997] 1 Sri LR 169 and

Carthelis v. Ranasinghe [2002] 2 Sri LR 359.

The 6th Respondent has categorically given evidence before the

Board on 22.06.2011 that he is in possession of the land in dispute

even after the execution of P1 (vide page 21 of the case record). The

6th Respondents evidence has been substantiated with the

complaint made by him to the police on 21.11.2010 (vide page 125

of the case record). Furthermore, it is evident from the letter dated

23.01.2011 issued by the Divisional Secretary of Millaniya and the

Girama Niladari of Millaniya that the 6th Respondent is in possession

of the land in question (vide page 142 of the record). Accordingly, it

was well established before the Board that the Petitioner has not

obtained possession of the land in dispute from the 6th Respondent

after the execution of P1.

True it is that the valuation of the land in dispute is another

significant aspect to establish the claim of constructive trust. Vide

Jayanthi Chandrika Perera v. D. Don Chandrakumara (SC

Appeal No. 83/2014, SC Minutes of 24.03.2017I and W.M.

Chandralatha v. H.M. Punchi Banda and Another (SC Appeal No.

185/2015, SC Minutes of 04.12.2017). As per the deed marked P1, a

sum of Rs. 50,000/- was paid by the Petitioner to the 6th Respondent

for an extent of 52.13 perches. According to the evidence of the 6th

Respondent, the value of a perch was of Rs. 40,000/- (vide page 20

of the case record).

In paragraph 6 of the petition, the Petitioner states that the 6th

Respondent had accepted in a sum of Rs. 350,000/- in addition to

the consideration stipulated in P1 and had given a letter dated

28.12.2010 stating that he would not claim anything whatsoever

pertaining to the said transaction. The 6th Respondent, in his

statements of objection has denied this letter. In such a situation,

Page 9 of 10

there is a burden cast upon the Petitioner to prove the said letter

before the Board, where the Petitioner failed to do so. Besides, it is

to be noted that there is a doubt created before Court that, if, P1 is

an outright transfer, there is no necessity to pay an additional

amount of Rs. 350,000/- to the 6th Respondent after five months

from the date of execution of P1.

Having considered the proceedings adopted and the totality of the

evidence adduced before the Board, it appears to this Court that the

impugned orders are not contrary to section 21 of the said

Ordinance.

In these respects, it is apparent that the determination of the 5th

Respondent stating that the deed P1 was executed for a loan

transaction is justifiable.

Furthermore, it is settled law that a party seeking prerogative relief

should come to Court with clean hands. The expression is derived

from one of Equitys maxims - He who comes to Equity must come

with clean hands.

In the case of Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi [1973] 77 NLR

13, it was held that,

When an application for a prerogative writ or an injunction is made, it is the duty of the petitioner to place before the Court, before it issues notice in the first instance, a full and truthful disclosure of all the material facts; the petitioner must act with uberima fides.

Undisputedly, upon being served with summons by the 5th

Respondent Board, the Petitioner by his letter dated 12.10.2011

informed the Board that he has not entered into any transaction

with the 6th Respondent, and therefore, there is no necessity of him

being present before the Board for an inquiry. This is a material fact

as far as the allegations made by the Petitioner against the 5th

Page 10 of 10

Respondent Board are concerned, which was suppressed by the

Petitioner in his petition.

In paragraph 16 of the petition, the Petitioner states that the 5th

Respondent Board has no jurisdiction to entertain the application of

the 6th Respondent. It was further stated that the application and

the affidavit tendered by the 6th Respondent to the 5th Respondent

Board were defective. It is to be noted that the foregoing preliminary

legal objections were not raised before the Board by the Petitioner,

and therefore, the Petitioner is estopped from taking up such

objections in this Court.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no basis to interfere with the

impugned orders marked P5 and P8 of the 5th Respondent Board.

In the circumstances, I proceed to dismiss the application.

The parties should bear their own costs as to this application.

Application dismissed.
