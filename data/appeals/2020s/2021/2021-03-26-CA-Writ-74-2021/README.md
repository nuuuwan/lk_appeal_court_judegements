Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The Petitioner holds a Bachelor of Science Degree in Aircraft Maintenance

Engineering from the University of Glamorgan and a Post Graduate Diploma in

Business Management from the Cardiff Metropolitan University, England.

The Petitioner states that on 27th April 2019, several Officers of the Terrorism

Investigation Division (TID) arrived at his house and arrested the Petitioner and his

wife on suspicion that they had aided and abetted the several terrorist attacks that

took place on Easter Sunday - 21st April 2019.

The Petitioner states that he was thereafter detained at the TID on a detention order

marked P4 for a period of three months on the basis that he was connected with or

concerned in the spreading of Muslim ideologies, aiding and abetting and conspiring

to cause bomb explosions on 21st April 2019 and concealing such information from

security Forces.

The Petitioner states that he and his wife were produced together with fourteen

others in the Magistrates Court, Mount Lavinia on 31st July 2019 under B Report

No. B/917/19. Having done so, the Petitioner claims that the TID had sought

permission to have the Petitioner discharged from the said case, and to produce him

before the Hon. Magistrate of Colombo in relation to another investigation relating

to the said terror attacks. The Petitioner had thereafter been produced before the

Magistrates Court, Colombo in Case No. B 15761/08/19, where the Petitioner had

been remanded by the Hon. Magistrate.

Upon completion of the investigations, the TID had sought the advice of the Attorney

General. While the advise was pending, the Petitioner had filed Writ Application No.

43/2020 in this Court seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the detention order and a

Writ of Mandamus on the Attorney General to tender his advise to the TID. The

Petitioner states that while that application was pending, he learnt that the Attorney

General was in the process of taking steps to indict him.

It is admitted that the Attorney General filed an indictment against the Petitioner in

the High Court of Gampaha on 3rd September 2020, marked P10. Aggrieved by the

3

decision of the Attorney General to indict him, the Petitioner has filed this

application seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said decision.

The principal submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

Attorney General could not have reasonably formed an opinion to indict the

Petitioner, and that there is no factual basis to sustain the charge contained in the

indictment.

Section 393 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, as amended

provides that it shall be lawful for the Attorney General to present an indictment in

any of the situations provided therein. While the Attorney General has the discretion

to institute criminal proceedings, such discretion is generally referred to as the

prosecutorial discretion in the Common law jurisdictions, with the Attorney General

or the Director of Public Prosecution, as the case may be, being conferred with the

prosecutorial powers to institute criminal proceedings .

It would therefore be appropriate to consider at the outset whether the power of

the Attorney General to forward indictment against persons who are suspected to

have committed an offence is amendable to the Writ jurisdiction conferred on this

Court by Article 140 of the Constitution, and if so, the circumstances in which a Court

will interfere with that power by way of judicial review.

I shall begin by considering the judgment of the Supreme Court in Victor Ivan v

Sarath N. Silva, Attorney General & Another.1 This was a case where the decision of

the Attorney General to indict the petitioner, who was at that time the Editor of the

Ravaya newspaper, in respect of several defamatory articles he had published in the

said newspaper was challenged by the petitioner on the basis that the said decision

was in violation of his fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The

contention of the respondent that the Attorney Generals decision to grant sanction

to prosecute, or to file an indictment, or the refusal to do so are absolute, unfettered

and unreviewable was rejected by Mark Fernando J, who stated as follows:

the Attorney Generals power to file (or not to file) an indictment is a

discretionary power, which is neither absolute nor unfettered. It is similar to

1 [1998] 1 Sri L.R. 340.

4

other powers vested by law in public functionaries. They are held in trust for the

public, to be exercised for the purpose for which they have been conferred, and

not otherwise.

In Sarath de Abrew v Iddamalgoda and six Others,2 the petitioner argued that the

decision taken by the Attorney General to indict him under Section 365B of the Penal

Code and to direct the Police to institute proceedings before the Magistrates Court

was in violation of his fundamental rights.

Priyantha Jayawardena, J held as follows:

While I agree with the submissions made by the learned Presidents Counsel for

the Petitioner that every power must be exercised by the authority fairly,

reasonably and lawfully, the mere fact that the statement of witnesses of the

defence has not been recorded as claimed by the Petitioner cannot make the

decision of the Attorney General unsustainable. The Attorney Generals decision

to indict the Petitioner may be vitiated if a conclusion is arrived not on an

assessment of objective facts or evidence but on a subjective satisfaction. .... If

it is found that there was evidence before the Attorney General and such

evidence had been considered by several officers of the said Department and a

final decision was reached by the Attorney General based on the views of the

said officers, the Superior Court would not interfere and would hesitate to

substitute its own view in place of the Attorney General.

A review of the English cases in this area show that while judicial review is available in

respect of the prosecutorial discretion in order to prevent any abuse by the

prosecuting authorities, the English Courts are mindful of its impact on the criminal

justice system, and has therefore clearly indicated its extreme reluctance to intervene

by way of judicial review.3

2 S.C (FR) Application No. 424/2015 SC Minutes of 11th January 2016. 3 See Sharma v Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions & Others [2006] UKPC 57 where the Privy Council, having considered previous judicial pronouncements identified the reasons that demonstrated the extreme reluctance shown by Courts to disturb decisions to prosecute, by way of judicial review. See the judgment of this Court in Ajahn Gardiye Punchihewa v. The Officer-In-Charge, Financial Investigation Unit III and Others [CA (Writ) Application No. 311/19; CA Minutes of 18th June 2020]

A similar approach has been taken by the Supreme Court of our country in respect of

decisions of the Attorney General. In The King v Fernando4 Layard CJ stated that:

I do not think that it is desirable in every case to interfere with the discretion

vested in the Attorney-General. The only cases in which this Court should

interfere is when the Attorney-General has abused the discretion left to him, and

these cases are very rarely likely to arise.

The discretion of the Attorney General to decide to which Court he should commit

cases was considered in The King v Baba Singho5 where it was held as follows:

it is within the discretion of the Attorney-General to direct to what Court a

case shall be committed and what offence he shall be indicted for, and it

appears to me that it should only be in some extreme case that the Court of

Appeal should interfere with the discretion so given to him and direct a trial in a

different Court.

In Velu v Velu and Another6 Weeramantry J, having considered the powers of the

Attorney General to direct a Magistrate to commit an accused who had been

discharged after the preliminary inquiry, held that:

the Attorney-General is vested with a measure of discretion which is rendered

effective by his statutory power to secure that inquiries under Chapter 16 will

terminate in a manner determined in the exercise of that discretion. Into the

sphere where this discretion is exercised it is not the province of this Court to

enter save for the gravest cause.

The current position in Sri Lanka has been summarised by Wengappuli, J in Ajahn

Gardiye Punchihewa v. The Officer-In-Charge, Financial Investigation Unit III and

Others7 in the following manner:

In view of these pronouncements, it is clear that the prosecutorial discretion is

reviewed in English Courts as well as in Sri Lanka, in exercising its powers of 4 8 NLR 354. 5 21 NLR 142. 6 76 NLR 21. 7 Supra.

6

judicial review only when there is material to satisfy that the decision to

prosecute was taken in extreme situations akin to dishonesty or mala fides or

an exceptional circumstance warranting effective judicial intervention.

It is significant to note that the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is not alleging

dishonesty or mala fides on the part of the Attorney General in indicting the

Petitioner, but, as I have already stated, is only complaining that there is no factual

basis to sustain the charge against the Petitioner.

I shall now consider the submission of the learned Deputy Solicitor General as to how

the Attorney General formed an opinion to indict the Petitioner, and the factual basis

to sustain the charge. He submitted that the Petitioner has made a confession to an

Assistant Superintendent of Police on 19th September 2019 where the Petitioner has

inter alia stated as follows:8

The learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted further that the decision of the

Attorney General to indict the Petitioner is based inter alia on the above contents of

the said confession.

The charge in the indictment P10 reads as follows:

8 A copy of the said confession of the Petitioner has been tendered to this Court by the Attorney General with his motion dated 12th March 2021.

Section 2(1)(h) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 48 of

1979, as amended, (the PTA), reads as follows:

Any person who by words either spoken or intended to be read or by signs or

by visible representations or otherwise causes or intends to cause commission

of acts of violence or religious, racial or communal disharmony or feelings of

ill-will or hostility between different communities or racial or religious groups

shall be guilty of an offence under this Act.

In terms of Section 5(1)(a) of the PTA:

Any person who knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that any

person is making preparation or is attempting to commit an offence under this

Act, fails to report the same to a police officer shall be guilty of an offence and

shall, on conviction be liable to imprisonment of either description for a period

not exceeding seven years

The charge against the Petitioner is that he failed to disclose to the Police the fact

that Zaharan was organising groups of persons having connections to ISIS, an

international terrorist group, with a view of committing an offence coming within

Section 2(1)(h) of the PTA. The factual basis for the said charge is borne out from the

confession that the Petitioner is said to have made, the relevant parts of which I have

already referred to.

Section 16(1)(a) of the PTA states that any statement, whether it amounts to a

confession or not, may be proved as against such person if it is not irrelevant under

Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance. Section 17 of the PTA provides that Sections

8

25, 26 and 30 of the Evidence Ordinance do not apply to proceedings under the PTA.

Section 16 (2) places the burden of proving that any statement is irrelevant under

Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance on the person asserting it to be irrelevant.

As submitted by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, it is clear that the decision to

file the indictment P10 has been taken on the contents of the above confession.

While I therefore do not see any merit in the submission of the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner that the Attorney General could not have formed an opinion in the

absence of any factual basis, I must say that I am in agreement with the submission

of the learned Deputy Solicitor General that the decision of the Attorney General to

indict the Petitioner based on the contents of his confession is reasonable. It is

certainly not a decision that attracts the definition of unreasonableness set out by

Lord Greene in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v. Wednesbury

Corporation.9

I shall now consider a matter that has been raised by the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner in his written submissions. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner

submitted that having received the said confession,10 he had carried out a

comparison with the contents of the B Report dated 6th August 2019 filed in Case

No. 15761/8/19 by the Director, TID. Having done so, he submitted that the contents

of the said confession is a copy and paste of the contents of the said B Report, which

was dated more than a month prior to the said confession. The learned Counsel for

the Petitioner has thus submitted that the said confession is questionable and that it

is not safe to indict the Petitioner on such a confession.

Having examined the said confession and the B Report, I must note that while some

of the incidents referred to in the B Report have been referred to in the confession

as well, it does not appear to me that the confession is a cut and paste of the B

Report. Having said so, this issue raised by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is a

matter that must be raised before the Hon. High Court Judge when an application is

made to read in evidence the said confession. If its the position of the Petitioner that

he did not make the confession or that the confession is not voluntary, he can object

9 [1948] 1 KB 223 at 229 Unreasonableness has been defined as something so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority. 10 Ibid.

to the said confession being marked, which would then require the learned Trial

Judge to determine the voluntariness and relevance of the said confession at a voir

dire inquiry.

In the above circumstances, I do not see any legal basis to issue formal notice of this application on the Respondent. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
