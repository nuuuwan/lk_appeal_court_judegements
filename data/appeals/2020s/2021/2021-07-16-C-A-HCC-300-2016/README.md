JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam J

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General with six charges in the

High Court of Colombo. The first charge was Cheating Mahesh Jayantha

Dias to give Rs.1800000/= to the Appellant to secure foreign employment.

The second and third charges are for Misappropriation and Criminal

Breach of Trust of the same amount. The fourth charge was Cheating

Chandrika Sonali Mendis to give Rs.2000000/= to the Appellant to secure

foreign employment. The fifth and sixth charges are for Misappropriation

and Criminal Breach of Trust of the same amount.

3 | P a g e

After the trial the Learned High Court Judge has found the Appellant guilty

for first, second, fourth and fifth charges and ordered to pay a fine of

Rs.5000/= for each charge with a default sentence of three months simple

imprisonment. For each count 06 months RI suspended for 10 years was

imposed. Further the Appellant was ordered to pay Rs.2000000/= as

compensation to PW01 with a default sentence of 03 months simple

imprisonment and Rs. 1500000/= compensation to PW02 with a default

sentence of 03 months simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellant is on bail and has given consent to argue this matter in her

absence due to the Covid 19 pandemic. With the permission of this Court

the Appellant was present during the final day of the argument.

At the very out set the Learned Deputy Solicitor General informed this

court that he is not contesting the conviction and sentence imposed on

second and fifth charges by the trial court. Hence the counsel for the

Appellant restricted his argument on the second ground of Appeal.

In the second ground of Appeal the Appellant contends that on a proper

correct and impartial reading of the evidence in this case has the

prosecution fallen short of establishing the charges against the accused in

all their ingredients and in total.

Back ground of the case

In this case PW01 and PW2 are wife and husband. PW01 is a beautician by

profession and her husband PW02 was running an advertising firm during

the period relevant to this case. As the couple were not successful in their

respective businesses, both had decided to migrate to England for greener

pasture. At this time the Appellant being a relative of PW01 had promised

employment in England and PW01 had paid Rs.2000000/= to the

4 | P a g e

Appellant on 13/03/2009 in the presence of PW04 who is a Justice of

Peace (JP). The Appellant acknowledged the said sum by placing her

signature to an affidavit attested by the said JP which had been marked as

P1 in the trial. The Appellant had promised to secure a job in England in

two months time.

Likewise, PW02 had paid the Appellant Rs.1800000/= on 04/04/2009 in

the presence of the same JP. This occasion too the Appellant had placed

her signature to an affidavit and acknowledged the receipt of the said

money. The said affidavit was marked as P2 in the trial. After the payment

the couple had handed over their passports and waited for the travel

arrangement by the Appellant. After some time as the Appellant went

incommunicado, PW01 and PW02 had lodged their complaints to Colombo

Crime Division on 24/09/2009 as directed by their local police. As the

Appellant absconded for some time, the police could only arrest her on

15/07/2010. The prosecution called three more witnesses with PW01 and

PW02 and closed their case.

As there was a case to answer by the Appellant the Learned High Court

Judge had called for the defence. The Appellant opted to make a dock

statement and called two witnesses. In her defence she had completely

denied the charges levelled against her.

The Counsel for the Appellant strenuously argued that both PW01 and

PW02 had failed to provide cogent evidence with documents with regards to

raising of funds allegedly to have been given to the Appellant.

PW01 in her evidence stated that she had sold her jewelleries and obtained

money from her mother to raise the money. To complete Rs.2000000/= her

husband PW02 had given Rs. 500000/= to her. She further said that she

had number of jewelleries and sold everything to raise the money. Although

the defence had marked 03 promissory notes as V4, V5 and V6 with

PW01s National Identity Card No. 728180692V but she had denied placing

5 | P a g e

her signature on those documents. Answering to court PW01 has said that

the Appellant would have obtained her identity card number from her

passport. Further date of the documents of V4, V5 and V6 had been on

04/12/2006,08/01/2007 and 02/02/2007 respectively. But money had

been given to the Appellant by PW01 and PW02 on 13/03/2009 and

04/04/2009 respectively. Further PW01 had denied that she knew a

person called Dammika Samankanthi from whom the defence alleges that

PW01 had obtained money after singing the promissory notes which had

been marked as V4, V5 and V6. The defence witness Samankanthi in her

cross-examination admitted that she had not made any complaint against

PW01 till she gave evidence in the High Court. This lethargic attitude

clearly demonstrates her malafide intention of favouring the Appellant.

During the cross-examination of PW02 the defence had shown V4, V5 and

V6 to him. PW02 after examining the same informed the court that

signatures appearing on V4, V5 and V6 were not signed by his wife as it

differs in some characters. But answering to the court PW02 had admitted

signature appearing on V6 as his wifes signature. Even though this

evidence favours the defence case no plausible nexus has been elicited

between V4, V5 and V6 with the money paid to the Appellant by PW01 and

PW2. The Learned High Court Judge citing this reason has very correctly

disregarded the documents V4, V5 and V6 which had been marked subject

to proof by the defence.

Next the Counsel for the Appellant contended that Appellants signatures

had been forcibly obtained to P1 and P2 by PW02 who had allegedly

abducted the Appellant and her daughter from Anuradhapura to

Kadawatha and obtained her signature forcibly to blank papers and

converted the same as affidavits. Hence the Appellant drew this courts

attention about the page setting of P1 and P2 to substantiate her

argument. On perusal of the originals of P1 and P2 no visible discrepancies

6 | P a g e

appear on P1 and P2 and they are in conformity with Section 02 of the

Affidavits Act No. 23 of 1953.

Further in their evidence PW01 and PW02 stated that when they paid

money to the Appellant at their residence in the presence of PW04 the JP,

the Appellant had received the money and placed her signature on P1 and

P2 respectively.

Although the Appellant takes up the position that her signatures had been

forcibly obtained on P1 and P2 after she and her daughter had been

abducted and forcibly held under detention, but no complaint had been

lodged in any of the police stations in the island. The conduct of the

Appellant in this regard clearly demonstrates her after thought to escape

from this case.

The Counsel for the Appellant further argued that PW04 is not a reliable

witness as per the contradiction marked as V8. It is the contention of the

Appellant that she had never signed P1 and P2 at the residence of PW01

and PW02. According to PW04 the JP, on both occasions had obtained the

signature of the Appellant at the residence of PW01 and PW02. He further

added that on both occasions as instructed by complainants he had

obtained Appellants signature when the money had been paid to the

Appellant. On both occasions P1 and P2 had been prepared by him as per

the instructions given to him by PW01.

But PW04 in his statement to police had said that he obtained the

signature of the Appellant over a Rs.50/= stamp to an affidavit which had

been prepared by PW01. This contradiction had been marked as V8 by the

defence. Further two more contradiction on the same point had been

marked as V9 and V10.

Although the defence had marked V8, V9 and V10, the witness PW04 re-

affirmed that the purported affidavits had been prepared by him and signed

in his presence at the residence of PW01 and PW02.

7 | P a g e

The importance of an omission and a contradiction in criminal trials have

been discussed in several judicial decisions by the Appellate Courts of our

country. It is pertinent to discuss whether the above-mentioned

contradictions V8, V9 and V10 have any adverse effect on the evidence

given by PW04 in this case.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would

ordinarily affect the trustworthiness of the witness

statement, it is well established that the Court must exercise

its judgement on the nature of the inconsistency or

contradiction and whether they are material to the facts in

issue. Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the

matter and assail the basic version of the witness cannot be

given too much importance.

Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling

discrepancies and omissions. When contradictions are

marked, the Judge should direct his attention to whether

they are material or not and the witness should be given an

opportunity of explaining the matter.

Now I consider whether the aforementioned contradictions are material and

affect the trustworthiness and creditworthiness of the evidence of PW04.

8 | P a g e

The incident happened in the year 2009 and the PW04 had given evidence

before the High Court on 22/09/2014 after about 05 years of the incident.

Considering the contradictions and the passage of time passed after the

incident a reasonable court cannot expect hundred percent accurate

evidence from a witness. The Appellate Courts have repeatedly endorsed

this position in several decided cases.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

(Supra) the Court held that:

The court observed further, that human beings are not computers and

that it would be dangerous to disbelieve the witness and reject

evidence based on small contradictions or discrepancies.

Considering the above-mentioned judicial decision, the Learned High Court

Judge has very correctly concluded that the contradiction marked as V8,

V9 and V10 are not material contradictions which affect the root of the

case.

Next the Counsel for the Appellant argued that the husband of the

Appellant who is a relation of PW01 had been separated from the Appellant

from the year 2007 and therefore, coming to PW01s house with the

Appellants husband is a blatant lie uttered to court by PW01.To

substantiate her argument the defence had marked documents V1(The

motion filed along with the divorce plaint) and V2 (The plaint of the divorce

case no. DDV/00177/09).

PW01 had reiterated that when the Appellant came to discuss about the

foreign employment, she had come with her husband to her house. But

when she came to collect money, on both occasions, the Appellant had

come alone and collected the money. As stated earlier the Appellant had

collected the money on 13/03/2009 and 04/04/2009 from PW01 and

PW02 respectively.

9 | P a g e

It is possible that any married people can be separated for some time and

file divorce action thereafter. In this case upon perusal of V1 and V2 the

certified copies of the Colombo District Court, which had been admitted by

the prosecution at the trial, revealed that the divorce action was filed after

completing the corrections of pleadings on 22/07/2009. Hence the position

taken by PW01 that the Appellant came with her husband to her house

before she accepted money has not been contradicted by the defence. As

this argument has no merit the Learned High Court Judge had very

correctly rejected this position advanced by the Appellant during the High

Court trial.

In the case of Attorney General v. Viswulingam 47 NLR 286 Justice

Cannon stressed that:

the judge should direct his mind specially to the issue what

contradictions are material and what contradictions are not material

before he proceeds to discredit the testimony of a witness.

In Jagathsena v. Bandaranaike [1984] 2 Sri.L.R 39 Justice Collin Thome

in considering the issue of contradictions inter se of the testimony of two

witnesses, emphasized that:

the trial judge should probe the issue whether the discrepancy is due

to dishonesty or defective memory or whether the witnesss power of

observation was limited.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge has considered all evidence oral

and documentary placed before the court by both parties to come to her

conclusion. She had analysed all evidence very correctly to come to her

conclusion. Also, she has given plausible reasons as to the acceptance and

rejection of evidence in her judgment. She had observed the demeanour

and deportment of the witnesses and mentioned about their behaviour

whenever she thought it would be necessary in the proceedings.

10 | P a g e

Hence it is wrong to say that the Learned High Court Judge was

predetermined and failed to evaluate the prosecution witnesses in a correct

perspective.

Considering all the evidence presented during the trial, we conclude that

the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. We further

conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which to interfere with the

decision of Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 16/12/2016.

Hence, we dismiss this appeal.

Appeal is dismissed.
