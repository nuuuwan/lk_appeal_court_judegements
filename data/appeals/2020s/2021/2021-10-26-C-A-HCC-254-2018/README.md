In this case the learned High Court Judge of Kandy has convicted the

accused appellant after trial for committing rape on one Emily Saroja Jeyaraj on

or about 23.06.2008 and sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and Rs

5000/= fine with a default sentence of 6 months and compensation of Rs 50,000/-

with a default sentence of one year rigorous imprisonment.

Aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence the appellant has preferred

this appeal to this Court setting forth the following grounds of appeal.

1. The items of evidence are not sufficient to prove the prosecutions case

against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

2.The rejection of evidence of the accused is wrongful and the learned

Judge of the High Court has failed to correctly apply the principles

governing the Dock Statement.

3

3.The rejection of the contradictions and omissions regarding the

evidence of PW 1 is erroneous in law.

4.The rejection of Medical evidence is erroneous in law.

At the hearing of the appeal the Counsel for the appellant informed Court

that he has been instructed by the appellant to argue this matter in his absence

due to the covid pandemic. The appellant who was connected through Zoom

technology at the argument reiterated same.

The facts of the case albeit briefly are as follows;

The victim PW 1, a Tamil lady of 67 years who had suffered a stroke a few

years ago and was recovering from partial paralysis had been alone in her home

in Augustawatta Kandy as her husband had gone to Colombo that morning. The

accused appellant known to the victim and identified as the baas who attended

on the water tank and repaired the front and back doors of their house had come

around 11.15 am on the 23rd of June 2006 and inquired about her husband and

was informed that he had gone to Colombo and expected back home that night.

PW 1 has testified that she had her lunch after the appellant who spoke

with her through the open window left and when she was eating a piece of papaw

she had seen the accused coming towards her with a knife threatening her. When

he grabbed her dress she has fallen near the dining table, thereafter, he had carried

her to the bedroom and forcefully raped her. At the beginning of the assault on

her she had cried out for help as evidenced in pages 75, 80,83 and 92 of the brief.

In page 108 she has specifically stated as follows;

Thus, her evidence is that the appellant threatened her with a knife and she

feared for her life. She has given clear, cogent and convincing evidence how the

incident had occurred. At one point she has testified that if she had a knife in hand

she would have killed him. (page 90)

She has informed her husband by telephone of the alleged rape soon after

the incident and he had told her that he will ask a lady from a close by boutique

to come and stay with her until he returned. He has come in a three wheeler from

Colombo with their daughter and on the same evening lodged a complaint to the

Kandy Police and PW 1 had been admitted to the Kandy Hospital.

It was contended by the Counsel for the appellant that PW 1s evidence

was not corroborated by the lady who was asked to come and be with her.

In Sunil and another vs The Attorney General 1986 (1) SLR 230 it was

held that if the evidence of a woman victim of a sex offence is convincing, such

evidence could be acted upon in the absence of corroboration.

In Sumanasena vs Attorney General {1999) 3 SLR 137 it was held that

evidence must not be counted but weighed and the evidence of a single

witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a court of law.

In the instant case soon after the incident PW 1 had informed her husband

of the rape and he has given evidence corroborating the evidence of PW 1. The

evidence of both husband and wife is cogent and no doubt has arisen about the

veracity or truthfulness of that evidence. Thus, the ground of appeal that the items

of evidence are not sufficient to prove the prosecution case beyond reasonable

doubt cannot stand.

5

The evidence of PW 1 is corroborated by medical evidence. PW 3, is the

doctor who examined the victim. The Medico Legal Report is marked as P2. In

the short history given by the victim in P2 it refers to her being raped by the baas

and his name Hemantha is given. The microbiology report for vaginal semen

where Spermatoza was observed is marked as P4. But no DNA test has been done.

The doctor has made some observations about her medical and her physical

condition, of her being partly paralysed a few years ago and how that had

impacted on the victim with regard to the incident.

It was elicited from the prosecution witnesses that the appellant lives about

100 to 150 yards away from the house of the victim and well known to all the

family members and usually referred to as the baas.

At the trial, it was contended that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses

was that there were many baases in the area and there was no proper

identification. The argument for the appellant was, when the victim had stated

she was unaware of the name of the baas his name Hemantha cited in the police

statement is erroneous.

The victim PW 1 had admitted not knowing the name of the appellant who

she referred to as the baas. However, she has specifically stated the work he had

done in the house and thus the identification has been beyond a doubt. Therefore,

there was no issue about the identification of the person and the only issue was

his name. A plausible explanation has been given by PW 1 and her husband

PW 2, that they got to know the name of the baas as Hemantha from their

daughter, who came back from Colombo with the father, after hearing what

happened to her mother. It has been elicited that the daughter also knew the

6

appellant quite well and there is unchallenged evidence that the daughter had

given gifts to the wife and children of the appellant for Christmas.

The contradictions marked as V1 to V3, V1 in page 115 of the brief relates

to the identification of the appellant by name. The incident has happened during

day time by a person well known to the victim who had been talking with her few

minutes before the incident. Her being unaware of his name when she could

identify the person without any doubt is not a material contradiction in this case.

As stated earlier, on perusal of the evidence of the victim it is quite apparent that

it was to the appellant baas the prosecution witnesses were referring to without

any ambiguity.

V2 is with regard to the victim denying she asked for water from the

appellant and V3 is her stating in evidence that the appellant did not give her a

bottle of water when in the statement to the police it is recorded that he gave her

a bottle of water. These highlighted contradictions do not affect the credibility of

the witness and are not material contradictions that go to the root of the case.

The defence has failed to assail the credibility of PW 1 in cross

examination. The learned trial judge has correctly considered that these

contradictions do not affect the credit worthiness of PW 1. Therefore, the ground

of appeal that the learned judge had erred not considering the contradictions and

the omission cannot stand.

Another ground of appeal is the learned trial judge rejecting and not

applying the principles governing the evaluation of the Dock Statement.

In the Dock Statement the appellant admits shouting in front of the house

of the victim that he was unable to earn a living that day because of PW 2 who is

7

alleged to have asked the appellant to assist him to take some items to the Railway

Station that day but when the appellant came, PW 2 had already left. This is the

defence he has put forward. Therefore, it is the position of the appellant that a

false complaint had been lodged accusing him of raping PW 1, because he was

shouting in front of the victims house.

In page 192 of the brief it refers to an alleged argument between the

appellant and the victim over the appellant finding fault with PW 2 wasting his

day and his losing his source of income as he is a daily wage earner.

It is up to the prosecution to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

However, in the instant case the probability factor of the dock statement of the

appellant has to be given some serious consideration.

It is in evidence that the victims family left Kandy because of the shameful

incident. The victim is a 67 year old lady with a young working daughter and a

son who was abroad and the husband living with her. Would a woman who had

suffered a stroke make a false complaint claiming she was raped by a man who

lives in close proximity to her house over the fact he shouted that he could not

find work that day due to PW 2 not keeping his word to give employment that

day? Would an elderly couple be of a mind set to accuse a comparatively young

person who had been employed by them on a few occasions and who live close

by of such an offence in our society if it were not true, knowing and realizing the

trauma, the humiliation and the embarrassment they will have to go through in

society. What was the victim going to gain by making such a false complaint

other than shame? I am of the view that it is not at all probable in the given

context.

8

The learned trial judge has very carefully analysed and considered the

Dock Statement in page 446 of the brief (page 17 of the judgment) and has quite

correctly concluded that the dock statement did not raise a reasonable doubt on

the prosecution case.

For the reasons adumbrated in the foregoing paragraphs of this judgment,

I find no merit in any one of the grounds of appeal. Therefore, there is no valid

reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of Kandy.

Accordingly, the conviction and the sentence are affirmed and the appeal is

dismissed.
