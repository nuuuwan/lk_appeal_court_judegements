JUDGEMENT

The 1st Petitioner is a legal entity that has the power to be sued or to sue. The 2nd and 3rd

Petitioners are the chairman and the secretary of the 1st Petitioner.

Page 4 of 6

The 1st Petitioner is the Gampaha District Co-Operative Rural bank engaged in receiving

deposits and lending money to its member societies. It also supplies computer equipment,

furniture and other utility equipment to the member societies.

The Petitioner had called for bids for branded computer equipment on or around 07.02.2021.

On receiving the quotations, the tender board of the 1st Petitioner had awarded the tender to the

10th Respondent. The 8th Respondent had requested computers. After purchasing the same from

the 10th Respondent, the Petitioner had sold those computers to the 8th Respondent. When

perusing the documents P6 (a-s), it appears that the Petitioner had sold the computers to the 8th

Respondent. In the written submissions, Petitioner had pointed out that he was only a go-

between to facilitate the sale of computers, and he had no direct connection in respect of the

sale. The document P6 (a-s) proves otherwise.

The 8th Respondent had complained to the 1st Petitioner regarding malfunction/defects of the

equipment sold to them by P7. The 8th Respondent had pointed out that as the petitioners'

decision to award the tender, the 1st Petitioner must intervene. Especially when parsing P6 (a-

s), it is the Petitioner who is liable. Document P8 speaks of the hardships the 8th Respondent

had to face due to the inefficiency of the 10th Respondent.

It was only after facing difficulties in functioning that the 8th Respondent had complained to

the 1st Respondent.

On receiving the complaint from the 8th Respondent, the 1st Respondent had summoned the 1st

Petitioner. The Petitioner argues that the 1st 7th Respondents had not headed that the 10th

Respondent was responsible and not the Petitioner at the inquiry. According to the 1st 7th

Respondents, the 10th Responded was summoned and was present at the inquiry held on

21.08.2013. The 10th Respondent had taken the ground that his responsibility was limited to

fixing the computers. The Petitioner alleges that the 8th Respondent had not taken the proper

care of the computers. Therefore, the malfunction was due to the 8th Respondents failure. The

rooms where the computers are kept is not air condition. Thus, the dust had accumulated and

caused the malfunction.

The Petitioner is trying to blame someone. Either the 8th Respondent or the 10th Respondent.

The Petitioner contends that the 1st Respondent can hold an inquiry under Section 13 of The

Page 5 of 6

Consumer Affairs Authority Act No 9 of 2003, only regarding goods and services within the

scope described in Section 12 of the Act. Therefore, power is not confined to inquire about

warranty given by implication or otherwise by manufacturer or trader.

Section 12 is in two parts,

(1) the Authority may, for the purpose of protecting the consumer and ensuring the quality of

goods sold or services provided, by notification published in the Gazette, from time to time,

determine such standards and specifications relating to the production, manufacture, supply

storage, transportations and sale of any goods, and the supply of any services.

(2) The Authority may, by notification published in the Gazette, adopt such standards and

specifications prescribed by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution established by the Sri Lanka

Standards Institution Act No 6 of 1984 relating to the production, manufacture, supply storage,

transportation and sale of any goods, and to the supply of any services, as standards and

specifications, to be determined under sub-Section (1).

Whether the 1st Respondent has the power cannot be discussed by considering Section 12 only.

One must look into the whole Act. Section 13 had given the power to the Authority to hold an

inquiry, and Section 13 (b) speaks explicitly of manufacture or sale of any goods which does

not conform to warranty or guarantee given by implication or otherwise.

In this instance, the Petitioner had implied to sell computers in good condition, which he had

failed. Therefore the 1st Respondent has the power to hold an inquiry. The other argument taken

by the Petitioner is that the 8th Respondent had not come within the Three months mentioned

in the Act. The question was discussed in Lankem Ceylon P.L.C. Ltd Vs Consumer Affairs

Authority and six others in case (C.A. No. 245/2011)

"I also need to comment on the time limit referred to in Section13(2) of the Act. The three

months referred therein is more or less is in the case in hand, the pesticide described as Biflex

should act as a resistant to termites. As such as trade/manufacture has thought it fit to provide

a warranty for five years. All this must have been contemplated after testing the chemical and

giving some time for possible reactions. Otherwise, the warranty period may be a shorter

period, i.e., one year. As such, the deciding factor would be the guarantee period which could

Page 6 of 6

vary from product to product. As such, a complaint within the guarantee period would suffice,

and this court cannot rule in favour of the petitioner company on this aspect."

Therefore, depending on the nature of goods/services, it may take more than three months to

identify some form of defect in the goods purchased or the services obtained. As such, a

complaint within the guaranteed period would suffice.

As the 8th Defendant had moved before the guaranteed period, the Petitioner's argument fails.

When perusing the entire case, it is evident that Petitioner had opted to buy from the 10th

Respondent and supply to the 8th Respondent. Therefore, the responsibility of suppling after

sale facilities or arranging for it and holding the responsibility of goods lies in the Petitioner.

As per to the doctrine of Fraus omnia corrumpit. The Petitioner had not come with clean hands.

Anyone who does not come with clean hands cannot seek mercy in court.

For the reasons set out in this judgment, I see no reason to grant the prayers prayed by the

Petitioner. I refuse the petition.
