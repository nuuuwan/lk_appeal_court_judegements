MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed by the petitioner to obtain bail under

section 10(1) a, of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crimes and

Witnesses Act nu 4 of 2015.

The petitioner has written to the Unit of the Assistance to and Protection of

Victims and witnesses in 2016 stating that he has been threatened and warned

by an armed group to withdraw his complaints with regard to the

misappropriation of funds at the Trinity College Kandy. The said complaint with

regard to his personal security, had been investigated and the investigative

officers had found out the complaint to be malicious and false. The Attorney

General had been forwarded with the IB extracts and upon perusing the same

the petitioner had been indicted under the above mentioned act for falsely

providing information to mislead the authorities.

Once the indictment was forwarded to the High Court of Colombo the

petitioner had absconded court and trial had been fixed to be taken up in his

absence and the petitioner had been warranted. Upon the warrant being issued

the police had been able to take the petitioner in to custody and the learned

High Court Judge had remanded the petitioner. The trial had been fixed to be

taken up in August.

The counsel for the petitioner urged before this court that the petitioner did

not falsely mislead the authorities but , the investigative officers have not

investigated the matter properly hence the truth had not been revealed, and

he urged that the petitioner had been in remand since 2020 to enlarge the

petitioner on bail.

The petitioner had filed this application under section 10(1) a of the relevant

act and according to which an accused charged under section 8 or 9 of this act

can be enlarged on bail only upon exceptional circumstances. The

exceptionality, the petitioner has urged in this matter is that the petitioner was

the complainant in many sensitive matters therefore he was threatened by

unknown parties and when he sought protection under the above mentioned

act the police without carrying out the investigations properly the Attorney

General had indicted him without proper material.

It is well settled law that the acceptability of the facts in a case cannot be gone

in to when considering bail unless there is a very glaring atrocity that has been

committed and a person has been falsely implicated.

But in the instant matter the police had fully investigated the matter and the

Attorney General had been furnished with the material and thus the petitioner

had been indicted but the petitioner had been absconding from the courts and

he has been arrested upon being warranted by the relevant High Court. The

High Court Judge had used his discretion and has remanded him and has fixed

the matter for trial without any delay.

Therefore upon considering the previous conduct of the petitioner the learned

High Court Judge remanding the petitioner to ensure that he faces trial is

reasonable and justifiable.

Therefore upon considering the submissions of the petitioner and the

respondent, it is the considered view of this Court that the grounds urged by

the petitioner as exceptional are not exceptional.

Therefore this Court is of the opinion that the petitioner has not supported his

application in terms of the provisions of the act under which the petitioner has

been indicted. Therefore the instant application is hereby dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
