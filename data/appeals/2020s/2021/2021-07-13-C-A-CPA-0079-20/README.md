Iddawala- J.

The petitioner has invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court

conferred under Article 138 of the Constitution seeking to set aside

an order of the learned High Court Judge of Panadura dated

02.07.2020 in Bail Application HCBA 95/2019.

The petitioner is the wife of the suspect of the Case No. B2221/18 in

the Magistrates Court Moratuwa and she was the petitioner of above

bail application. The suspect of the case has been arrested at his

home at the above address on 07.11.2018 allegedly for possession of

heroin by the Walana Anti-Corruption Unit and handed over to

CA (PHC) APN 79/2020 13/07/2021

Page | 3

Angulana Police. He was produced before the Magistrate on

14.11.2018 and had been held in remand custody. According to the

B Report by the Police the suspect had 5200mg of heroin

(diacetylmorphine) in his exclusive possession and 69930 mg in his

almirah. According to the Report of the Government Analyst filed

(marked as X 2) in the appeal brief the pure quantity of heroin

(diacetylmorphine) is 3.249g and 6.735g respectively.

A bail application was filed on behalf of the suspect in the High Court

of Panadura in terms of Section 83 (1) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act, no 13 of 1984 and

it was refused by the Order of the Learned High Court dated

02.07.2020.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the petitioner preferred a revision

application to this Court pleading that the Order be set aside and the

suspect be enlarged on bail.

The 1st and 2nd respondents have objected to this application on the

grounds, inter alia, that there are no exceptional circumstances to

invoke the revisionary jurisdiction in terms of the Section 83 (1) of

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by

Act No 13 of 1984 and there is an unreasonable and unexplainable

prolonged delay in filing the revision application since the date of the

impugned Order of the High Court.

It has been well established in many reported cases that the Orders

refusing to grant bail are considered as final Orders for which appeal

is available. This contention has been discussed at length in the

cases Anuruddha Ratwatte and Others vs. The Attorney General

2003 2 SLR 39 and in Cader vs. Officer - In - Charge Narcotics Bureau

2006 3 SLR 74.

However, in this instant case, no appeal against the Order of the High

Court was filed by the suspect. Instead of filling an appeal, this

present revision application was filed on 24.07.2020, that is precisely

after three weeks from the date the High Court pronounced its Order.

On the other hand, the petitioner does not disclose any reasons as to

why the suspect did not exercise the appellate jurisdiction of this

court.

However, in terms of Section 364 of the Criminal Procedure Code Act,

No. 15 of 1979, this Court has power to call for and examine the

record of any case which has been already tried or pending in the

High Court or Magistrates Court. Section 364 states:

The Court of Appeal may call for and examine the record of

any case whether already tried or pending in the High Court or

Magistrates court, for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the

legality or propriety of any sentence or order passed therein or

as to the regularity of the proceedings of such court.

The revisionary power of this Court is discretionary and when a party

files a revision application, he must satisfy the court that there are

exceptional circumstances which shock the conscious of Court. In

such exceptional circumstances, the revisionary power of the Court

can be exercised for the following purposes as discussed extensively

in Attorney General vs. Ranasinghe and others 1993 2 SLR p 81 @ p

85 :

1) To satisfy this court as to the legality of any sentence or order

passed by the High Court or Magistrates Court.

2) To satisfy this court as to the propriety of any sentence or order

passed by such court.

CA (PHC) APN 79/2020 13/07/2021

Page | 5

3) To satisfy this court as to the regularity of the proceedings of

such court.

1st and 2nd respondents raised a preliminary objection in their

statement of objections that there is an unreasonable and

unexplainable prolonged delay of 5 months in filing the revision

application since the date of the impugned order of the High Court.

This delay factor has been decided in the case of Gnanapandithen

V. Balanayagam (1998) 1 SLR 391 where G.P.S. de Silva CJ decided

that; The question whether delay is fatal to an application in revision

depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.

In this instant case the impugned order of the learned High Court

Judge was delivered on 02.07.2020 and this revision application was

filed on 24.07.2020. Accordingly, the Court cannot observe any

substance in the preliminary objection raised by the 1st and 2nd

respondents in their statement of objections dated 21.01.2021.

In the present application, the petitioner has submitted as

exceptional circumstances, the following: -

i. The order of the learned High Court Judge is contrary

to law.

ii. There is no likelihood of charges being framed against

him in near future.

iii. The suspect has no previous convictions but has one

pending case.

iv. The suspect has been in remand for this case from 7th

November 2018.

v. The present situation of COVID-19 pandemic has

created a risk situation for the suspect to be kept in

the remand prison.

CA (PHC) APN 79/2020 13/07/2021

The suspect being in remand for a long period of time

has made the suspects children helpless financially.

Consideration of bail with regard to persons suspected or accused of

offenses involving the manufacturing, trafficking, importing or

exporting or possession of heroin, cocaine, morphine or opium is set

out in section 83 (1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance as follows:

"No person suspected or accused of an offence under Section 54A

or Section 54B of this Ordinance shall be released on bail, except

by the High Court, in exceptional circumstances"

A close examination of this section makes it very clear that the

provisions of the Bail Act, No. 30 of 1997 has no application under

this law of Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

This contention has drawn the attention of the Court in several

reported cases. In Shiyam v Officer-in-Charge, Police Narcotics

Bureau & another (2006) 2 Sri L.R. 156, the Supreme Court held:

that the provisions in the Bail Act, No. 30 of 1997 would have

no application in relation to the suspects or accused who have been

alleged to have committed an offence under Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

Therefore, this Court has no doubt that only the provisions of the

section 83 (1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance

is applicable in granting bail for offences which fall under sections

54A and 54B of this Ordinance. Hence, the grounds for consideration

of granting bail under the Bail Act may not necessarily be

CA (PHC) APN 79/2020 13/07/2021

Page | 7

grounds/exceptional circumstances considered for granting bail

under the Section 83 (1) of Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance. Therefore, it should be carefully considered whether the

above reasons constitute to be exceptional circumstances.

Exceptional circumstances is very subjective, and cannot be given a

firm description. It depends and varies on the circumstances of each

case and an exceptional circumstance in one case might not

constitute an exceptional circumstance in another case.

In the case of Ramu Thamodarampillai Vs. The Attorney General

2004 3 SLR 180 observed thus:

". the decision must in each case depend on its own facts

and circumstances. But, in order that like cases will be decided

alike, there should be uniformity of decisions, it is necessary that

guidance should be laid down for the exercise of that discretion

(emphasis added)

Petitioner has averred that the financial hardships his family are

being faced as an exceptional circumstance. However, a person

having children or being a sole bread winner, in other words, leading

a family life, are a part of a normal life style of a normal person which

is banal in nature and not uncommon to be considered as

exceptional. The hardships that imprisonment might impose on a

suspects family is not an exceptional circumstance by itself.

The petitioner has also averred not having previous conviction as an

exceptional ground. This has been considered in the case of Cader

Vs Officer - In - Charge Narcotics Bureau (supra) where Basnayake J

observed that:

CA (PHC) APN 79/2020 13/07/2021

Page | 8

When a person is found guilty of possessing heroin, anything

more than 2 grams, the mandatory punishment is either death

sentence or life imprisonment

Therefore, I am of the view that not having previous convictions

and not having any cases pending cannot be considered as

grounds when considering bail

Further petitioner has submitted that the COVID-19 has created a

risk situation to the petitioner. While it is understood without a doubt

that COVID-19 has imposed a significant effect specifically on the

populations that live in close proximity like in prisons, this risk factor

is common to every person held in custody and not exceptional to the

petitioner. Therefore, while the effect of COVID-19 should be

considered as a unique factor, that alone would not constitute to be

an exceptional circumstance to enlarge the petitioner on bail in this

instance case.

When carefully examining the previous Orders, in general, when

there is no prima facie case against the accused /suspect or if there

is an inordinate delay in the process which cannot be explained or

justified, they had been considered as exceptional circumstances

depending on the nature of the case.

There is a series of reported cases which had identified the

"exceptional circumstances" in relation to granting bail under Section

83(1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

In C.A. (PHC) APN No 16/12- CA minutes dated 14.06. 2012 the

allegation levelled against the suspect was that she was in possession

of 3.59 grams of heroin. The suspect was in remand over a period of

one year after the issuing of the Government Analyst Report without

CA (PHC) APN 79/2020 13/07/2021

Page | 9

being indicted. This fact and other reasons like the suspect not

having pending cases or previous convictions and she being a

widow were considered in this case. On these circumstances suspect

was enlarged on bail by the above order of His Lordship

Sisira de Abrew J.

Besides, in CA Application No 44/2002 CA minutes dated

06.03.2003 the petitioner was enlarged on bail considering his

remand period of one year and ten months even after serving of

indictment on him.

In this instant application the petitioner was arrested on 07.11.2018

and remanded on 14.11.2018. Accordingly, he has been held in

remand custody for more than two years. The Government Analyst

Report in relation to the case was issued on 30.05.2019 but no

indictment has been served on the petitioner even after a lapse of 2

years since the issuance of the report. Even at the inquiry there was

no indication from the respondents as to when the indictment will be

served and no explanation or justification was given for the

prolonged delay. While it is understood that delays occur due to the

volume of investigations, institutions of cases, workload of trial

courts and the congestion in remand prisons etc. an inordinate delay

is different from a plausible delay that is foreseeable due to different

reasons.

The punishments for offenses committed under section 54A and 54B

of the above Ordinance are either death sentence or life

imprisonment. Thus, it should be assured that the proceedings with

regard to such serious offences are carried out without any

unreasonable delay or at least a proper justification is indicated for

any such delay in order to ensure the effective administration of

justice which guarantees the safeguarding of rights of all parties.

Therefore, considering the above reasons, in the interest of justice,

this court inclines to enlarge the suspect on bail subject to the

following conditions: -

1. A cash bail of Rs. 200,000/-. 2. Surety bail of Rs. 500,000/- each with two sureties acceptable

to the learned Magistrate. 3. The suspect is directed to report to the Officer in Charge of

the Police Station in Angulana on every Sunday between 8:30 am to 12:30 pm.

4. Passport or any travel document belonging to the petitioner

should be surrendered to the Magistrate Court Moratuwa.

5. Violation of any condition amounts to the cancellation of the

bail granted.

Registrar of this Court is directed to send copies of this bail order to

the learned High Court Judge, Panadura, to the learned Magistrate,

Moratuwa and to the relevant authorities.
