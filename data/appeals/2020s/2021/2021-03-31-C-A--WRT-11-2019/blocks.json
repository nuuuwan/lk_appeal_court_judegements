This is the traditional view of judicial review. English Courts have gone into the distinction between merits of a decision and procedural defects that preceded the making of a decision. In the writ application bearing No. 918/85, S.N. Silva, PICA (as His Lordship then was) never went into the title of the Plaintiffs vis~a~vis that of the People's Bank. There was only the decision making process before the vesting order that was challenged before the then President of the Court of Appeal. The challenge was based on an absence of the right to a hearing and the learned President of the Court of Appeal (as His Lordship then was) concluded that as the ground for judicial review was not established, he would dismiss the application for a writ of certiorari. But the later action filed by the Plaintiffs in the District Court of Colombo that has led to this appeal was a rei vindicatio action. Metaphorically the apples were not the same. Judicial review and an action rei vindicatio are not comparable. Therefore, the learned Additional District Judge of Colombo was quite incorrect when she held that res judicata applied in this case.",

Therefore, the relief for a writ of mandamus prayed for by the Petitioner by which the Petition moves this court to issue an order directing the 1st to 4th Respondents requiring them to hold a proper inquiry and issue the grant to the Petitioner, cannot allowed. However, this judgment shall not prevent the 1st to 4th Respondents from holding a proper inquiry into the matter and making an appropriate order with regard to the rightful entitlement to the grant in issue. In view of the above circumstances I direct the issue of a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari to quash the order to issue the grant in favour of the 5th Respondent.",
