R. Gurusinghe, J.

The accused-appellant (appellant) was indited along with the first

accused for having committed the offence of murder of a person by the

name of Abeymanike, attempted to murder Warnakulasuriya Piyal, and

hurt Warnakulasuriya Sudharma, offences punishable under sections

296, 300, and 315 of the Penal Code respectively.

The prosecution has called PW2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 18, and produced

items P1 to P10. The appellant made the dock statement and closed the

defense case.

The prosecution version of the case is that the appellant came to the

deceased Abeymanike's house together with the first accused in the

night. The first accused slashed the deceased and PW2 with a sword,

while the appellant attacked PW2 and PW3 with a club.

PW3, Sudharma, testified that on the 17th of December 2007, around

8.30 and 9.00 in the night, PW3, her brother Piyal, PW2, and her mother

3

(the deceased) were at home. The deceased was about to sleep. The first

accused Sunil came and called out to the deceased. They identified the

voice as Sunil's, and the deceased opened the door. The first accused

entered the house armed with a sword. There was a bottle lamp burning

inside the house. The first accused assaulted the deceased with the

sword. The deceased fell on the ground. Then the appellant came with

the club and dealt a blow on PW2 upon which he fell unconscious. PW3

ran away.

As per the evidence of PW2 the first accused called out to his mother, the

deceased. Then the deceased opened the door and was assaulted by the

first accused with the sword. When PW2 approached the deceased to

help her, the appellant dealt a blow on PW2. PW2 cannot recollect

anything that took place thereafter.

The first accused and the appellant had not come to the deceaseds

house together. There was a time gap between their arrivals. PW3

admitted that the first accused had completed his assault by the time the

appellant arrived at the scene.

On page 82 of the brief, PW3 has answered as follows:

There is no evidence to show that the appellant had dealt any blows on

the deceased. In all probability, the fatal injuries to the deceased was

caused by the first accused with the sword.

The liability of the appellant for the murder would depend on whether

the appellant was acting with the first accused in furtherance of a

common murderous intention. There is no evidence of a pre-arranged

plan.

PW8, Premaratna, has testified that the first accused had told him that

he had assaulted Abeymanike (the deceased) and Ranmahattaya (PW2).

However, the first accused had not mentioned to PW8 regarding the

presence or involvement of the appellant in the incident.

This piece of evidence shows that the first accused and the appellant

were not acting together and that they did not have a pre-arranged plan

between them. Accordingly, it also creates a doubt as to whether the

appellant had a common intention with the first accused.

In the case of King vs.Assappu 15 NLR 324, the Court of Criminal Appeal

stated the points that should be taken into consideration in regard to

common intention as follows;

"We are of the opinion that in all cases where the question of common

intention arises the Judge should tell the Jury that, in order to bring the

rule in section 32 into operation, it is the duty of the prosecution to

satisfy them beyond all reasonable doubt that a criminal act has been

done or committed; that such act was done or committed by several

persons; that such persons at the time the criminal act was done or

committed were acting in the furtherance of the common intention of all;

and that such intention is an ingredient of the offence charged, or of

some minor offence. The Judge should also tell the Jury that in applying

the rule of common intention there are certain vital and fundamental

5

principles which they must keep prominently in mind - namely (a) the

case of each prisoner must be considered separately; (b) that the Jury

must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was actuated by a

common intention with the doer of the criminal act at the time the

alleged offence was committed; (c) they must be told that the benefit of

any reasonable doubt on this matter must be given to the prisoner

concerned - 47 N. L. R. at p. 375; (d) the Jury must be warned to be

careful not to confuse "Some or similar intention entertained

independently of each other" with "Common intention"; (e) that the

inference of common intention should never be reached unless it is a

necessary inference deducible from the circumstances of the case -A. I. R.

1945 P. C. 118; (f) the Jury should be told that in order to justify the in-

ference that a particular prisoner was actuated by a common intention

with the doer of the act, there must be evidence, direct or circumstantial,

either of pre-arrangement, or a pre-arranged plan, or a declaration

showing common intention, or some other significant fact at the time of

the commission of the offence, to enable them to say that a co-accused

had a common intention with the doer of the act, and not merely a same

or similar intention entertained independently of each other - 47 N. L. R.

at p. 375, 48 N. L. R. 295; (g) the Jury should also be directed that if

there is no evidence of any common intention actuating the co-accused

or any particular co-accused, or if there is any reasonable doubt on that

point, then the charge cannot lie against anyone other than the actual

doer of the criminal act. - 44 N. L. R. 370, 46 N. L. R. 135, 473, 475; (h) in

such a case such co-accused would be liable only for such criminal acts

which they themselves committed; (i) the Jury should also be directed

that the mere fact that the co-accused were present when the doer did

the criminal act does not per se constitute common intention, unless

there is other evidence which justifies them in so holding - 45 N. L. R.

6

510; and (j) the Judge should endeavour to assist the Jury by examining

the case against each of the co-accused in the light of these principles."

In Wilson Silva vs. the Queen 76 NLR 414, Weeramantri J stated the

following:

"It was necessary to warn the Jury that even if there was a simultaneous

attack in pursuance of similar intentions this would not satisfy the test

of common intention unless there was a sharing of the intention. The

Jury had, however, been placed on their guard not against such

simultaneous and similar attacks but against separate attacks which

they may no doubt have thought were attacks separate in point of time.

Separate attacks would perhaps have been distinguished by them from

an attack in pursuance of common intention even without this direction

but the crucial distinction they should have had in mind was that even if

this was a simultaneous attack (rather than a series of separate attacks)

such attack should have been in consequence of a sharing of intentions

rather than in consequence of similar intentions individually entertained

by the assailants. The importance of this distinction being clearly

brought home to the Jury has, as is in the case of the other matters I

have mentioned, been repeatedly stressed by this Court."

In King vs. Ranasinghe 47 NLR 373, it was held that common intention

within the meaning of section 32 of the Penal Code is different from the

same or similar intention. The inference of common intention should not

be reached unless it is a necessary inference, deducible from the

circumstances of the case.

In this case, there is no evidence of a pre-arranged plan or any other

evidence of common intention to kill the deceased, which could be

attributable to the appellant.

7

The Learned Senior Additional Solicitor General for the respondent

argues that as the appellant has done nothing to prevent the first

accused from inflicting the injuries and the appellant dealing a blow on

PW2, facilitated the first accused to kill the deceased. Therefore, this

shows that the appellant had the common intention to kill the deceased.

At the same time, the Learned Additional Solicitor General concedes the

fact that the appellant had not inflicted any injury to the deceased.

Further, PW3 has also admitted that the first accused had completed the

assault on the deceased when the appellant arrived.

This creates a ground of possibility for other inferences to be drawn from

the above facts, such as the inference that the appellant did not

participate in a pre-arranged plan with the first accused to murder the

deceased. Also, when looking at the admission of PW3, along with the

aforementioned evidence of PW8, it shows that there was a time gap

between the assault on PW2 and PW3 and the murder of the deceased.

This creates further doubt as to whether a pre-arranged plan existed

between the first accused and the appellant or whether the first accused

was acting by himself. Consequently, a common intention cannot be

attributed on the appellant.

In the circumstances, the evidence is insufficient to prove that the

appellant shared a common intention to kill the deceased. Therefore, the

appellant is acquitted of count one, and the sentence of death is set

aside.

However, there is no complaint or argument regarding the conviction of

count two and count three. Both PW2 and PW3 stated that the appellant

dealt a blow on them. PW2 fell on the ground unconscious having

received the blow from the appellant. PW2 had eight injuries. One of the

injuries was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

There were five grievous injuries. PW3 was also hurt by the appellant

8

with a club. The medical evidence also corroborates the nature of the

injuries. Therefore there is sufficient evidence to support the conviction

for counts two and three.

Thus, the conviction and sentence of counts two and three are affirmed.

It is further ordered that the sentence be effective from the date of

conviction, namely 09/08/2012.

The appeal against the conviction on count one is allowed. The appeal

against the conviction of counts two and three is dismissed.

Appeal partly allowed.
