The essential ingredient is that a member of the public who is affected by such a decision has to submit to the jurisdiction of the authority whose action is subject to review. In other words, there is an unequal relationship between the authority wielding power and the individual who has to submit to the jurisdiction of that authority. The principles of administrative law that have evolved such as the doctrine of ultra vires, error on the face of the record, rules of natural justice, requirement of procedural fairness and the reasonableness of decisions, coupled with the remedies by way of prerogative writs, lie to correct any illegality or injustice that may emanate from this unequal relationship. It is in this context that the view has been firmly held that relationships that are based on contract, without any statutory underpinning and actions of companies and private individuals and bodies, are not subject to judicial review by way of the writs of certiorari and prohibition.",
