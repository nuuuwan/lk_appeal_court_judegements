Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The issue that arises for the determination of this Court is whether the decision of the

Respondents to withhold the payment of the retirement benefit that was promised to

the Petitioners under the Command Benevolent Fund of the Sri Lanka Air Force (the

SLAF) is unreasonable and if so, whether the Petitioners are entitled to a Writ of

Mandamus directing the Respondents to pay the Petitioners the said retirement benefit.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The 311 Petitioners are non-commissioned Officers of the SLAF. Of them, 306 are

Airmen while the balance 5 are Air Women. During their career at the SLAF, the

Petitioners have held the ranks of Master Warrant Officer, Warrant Officer, Flight

Sergeants, Sergeants, Corporals and Leading Air Craftsmen and have served in various

Units of the SLAF, in all parts of the Island. The Petitioners state that they have worked

with dedication, commitment, diligence and loyalty right throughout their career at the

SLAF.

The Petitioners state that by Air Force Order 850 marked P2, the SLAF established The

Command Benevolent Fund (the Fund) for the purpose of providing welfare benefits to

all ranks of the Regular Force of the SLAF. Paragraph 2 of P2 has recognized the fact

that the families of Regular Force Service Personnel who die suddenly or early in life,

find it difficult under their changed circumstances to adjust their financial affairs and

that in such a situation, the Fund shall provide immediate financial assistance to such

families. In order to provide these benefits, the Fund depends essentially on the

membership fee that would be paid by its members, who are all serving Officers of the

SLAF, both Commissioned as well as Non- Commissioned.

While paragraph 5 of P2 sets out the benefits that the Fund aims to provide, paragraph

10 thereof recognises that servicemen find it difficult upon retirement to adjust

themselves to the income standards that they were used to as serving Officers and

provides for the members to contribute a sum Rs. 100 per month and to receive the said

sum as a retirement benefit, upon their retirement from the SLAF. It is admitted that the

5

monthly membership fee has been revised over the years and that by 2014, members

were paying a sum of Rs. 1000 per month towards the retirement benefit.

The Petitioners state that by letter dated 3rd September 2014 marked P4, the 9th

Respondent, Air Vice Marshall C.P. Welikala, the Director of Administration of the SLAF

had informed all members that the Fund has introduced a new retirement benefit

scheme that would be applicable to all Officers of the Regular Force as well as the

Voluntary Force of the SLAF. According to the Petitioners, the Retirement Benefit Fund

that was referred to earlier was limited to those in the Regular Force. Those in the

Volunteer Force of the SLAF had a separate Fund (the VAF). Thus, P4 was the first time

that Officers in the Volunteer Force of the SLAF were permitted benefits under the

Fund.

In terms of the scheme set out in P4, all Officers were scheduled to receive the

following payments upon their retirement:

Category Number of completed Years at retirement

Benefit

Commissioned Officers 20 years 1,500,000

Commissioned Lady Officers 15 years 1,000,000

Non-commissioned Officers 22 years 1,000,000

Non-commissioned Lady Officers 15 years 750,000

Officers retiring on medical grounds 12 years 500,000

The monthly contribution that each member of the Fund was required to make in order

to receive the above benefit is set out below:

Category Present contribution

Proposed Contribution

Regular Force Commissioned Officers 1000 2250

Volunteer Force Commissioned Officers 500 1750

Regular Force Non-commissioned Officers 1000 1750

Volunteer Force Non- commissioned Officers 50 1250

6

The final paragraph of P4 stipulated that any Officer who was not agreeable to the

enhanced deduction should convey their objection on or before 16th September 2014.

P4 also specified that until the Fund has sufficient funds to meet the above payments,

those who retire at any given point in the first 36 months i.e. on or before 3rd

September 2017, would only receive the following sums of money:

Category Number of completed Years at

retirement

Benefit

Commissioned Officers 20 years 1,000,000

Commissioned Lady Officers 15 years 750,000

Non-commissioned Officers 22 years 750,000

Non-commissioned Lady Officers 15 years 500,000

Officers retiring on medical grounds 12 years 500,000

Thus, even an Officer who had contributed the enhanced sum of money for one month

and retired thereafter was eligible to receive and did in fact receive the said sum of

money.

The Petitioners state that they bona fide believed in the Scheme introduced by P4 and

the representations made therein and did not object to an enhanced deduction from

their salary. It is admitted that a sum of Rs. 1750 was deducted from the salaries of the

Petitioners from October 2014 until their retirement. P4 did not set out that the

success of the scheme will be examined periodically or that the retirement benefit that

was promised would be adjusted under any circumstances or more particularly due to

the Fund not having sufficient funds to meet the above obligation.

It is admitted that of the 311 Petitioners, the 1st 225th Petitioners retired from service

after the completion of the 36 month period specified in P4 while the 226th 311th

Petitioners retired in 2017 but prior to the completion of the 36 month period. The

7

Petitioners claim that they are entitled to the payment of the sums of money set out in

P4 upon their retirement.

The Petitioners state that by his letter dated 6th December 2017 marked P7, the 9th

Respondent, writing in his capacity as Director (Administration) and on behalf of the 1st

Respondent, the Commander of the SLAF had informed the Petitioners of the following:

Thus, P7 recognized the entitlement of the Petitioners to the retirement benefit

promised by P4 and held out further that the said benefit would be paid to the

Petitioners in due course.

By letter dated 4th January 2018 marked P8, the 15th Respondent had informed the 1st

Petitioner that a sum of Rs. 276,912, has been remitted to the bank account of the 1st

Petitioner as the entitlement of the 1st Petitioner under P4. It is admitted that similar

letters have been sent to all Petitioners, except the 107th Petitioner who was paid

subsequently. The payments that were made to all Petitioners are set out in the table

marked P9. Thus, all Petitioners have received less than Rs. 300,000 although P4 held

out that they would be entitled to a sum of Rs. 1m if they retired after 36 months or Rs.

750,000 if they retired in less than 36 months from September 2014.

By a further letter dated 26th January 2018 marked P12, the 9th Respondent, once again

writing on behalf of the 1st Respondent, had informed the 1st Petitioner as follows:

Aggrieved by the above decision to withhold the payment that had been promised, the

Petitioners filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision contained in P12;

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to pay the Petitioners the sums of

money as held out to them by P4.

Before I consider the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners,

I would like to consider an objection that was raised by the learned Senior State Counsel

for the Respondents in the written submissions tendered on behalf of the Respondents

that the scheme contained in P4 does not have any statutory underpinning and that

this Court does not have the jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter.

The scope of judicial review has seen many developments since the often quoted words

of Lord Atkin, J in Rex v. Electricity Commissioners ex parte London Electricity Joint

Committee Co1 where it was held that the controls of judicial review may be used

wherever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting

the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially, act in excess of their legal

authority.

The subsequent disuse and exclusion of the duty to act judicially2 was followed by the

expansion of the scope of judicial review to the actions of non-statutory bodies in the

celebrated case of R v. Panel on Take-Overs and Mergers, Ex parte Datafin plc. and

another3 where Sir John Donaldson MR adopted the following formula which drastically

expanded the scope of judicial review:

Possibly the only essential elements are what can be described as a public

element, which can take many different forms, and the exclusion from the

jurisdiction of bodies whose sole source of power is a consensual submission to its

jurisdiction.4

The defining feature in the above formula is the reference to a public element which

has been analysed in Judicial Remedies in Public Law,5 as follows:

"Two approaches to the definition of "public" can be discerned in the Datafin

case. First, there is the extent to which the body operates under the authority of

the government or was established by the government or, presumably, by some

other recognized public authority. Secondly, there is the extent to which a

particular function is performed against a background of statutory powers even

though there is no specific statutory or prerogative authority for the power which

it is sought to review. Both these approaches involve some link between the

1 [1924] 1 KB 171. 2 OReilly v Mackman [1983] 2 AC 237 at 279. 3[1987] QB 815. 4Ibid.at page 838. 5 Clive Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law (5th Edition, 2017), Sweet & Maxwell, at page 49. This is cited with authority in the case of Lanka Securities (Private) Limited v. Colombo Stock Exchange and Others [CA (Writ) Application No. 326/2019; CA Minutes of 29th May 2020 per Janak De Silva, J].

10

government, or the legislature, and the body in question...The current approach

of the courts is to consider whether the body is woven into the fabric of public

regulation or governmental control of an activity or is integrated into a system

of statutory regulation or, but for its existence, a governmental body would

have assumed control over the activity regulated by the body under challenge."

It is interesting to note that Sir John Donaldson MR was influenced by the decision in the

case of Regina v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, Ex parte Lain6, where Lord

Parker C.J. stated that the exact limits of the ancient remedy of certiorari had never

been and ought not to be specifically defined, and went on to hold as follows:

They have varied from time to time being extended to meet changing conditions.

At one time the writ only went to an inferior court. Later its ambit was extended

to statutory tribunals determining a lis inter partes. Later again it extended to

cases where there was no lis in the strict sense of the word but where immediate

or subsequent rights of a citizen were affected. The only constant limits

throughout were that it was performing a public duty. Private or domestic

tribunals have always been outside the scope of certiorari since their authority is

derived solely from contract, that is, from the agreement of the parties

concerned... We have as it seems to me reached the position when the ambit of

certiorari can be said to cover every case in which a body of persons of a public

as opposed to a purely private or domestic character has to determine matters

affecting subjects provided always that it has a duty to act judicially. Looked at in

this way the board in my judgment comes fairly and squarely within the

jurisdiction of this court. It is, as Mr. Bridge said, a servant of the Crown charged

by the Crown, by executive instruction, with the duty of distributing the bounty of

the Crown. It is clearly, therefore, performing public duties.[Emphasis added]

The words of Lord Parker CJ remain true to date, with the exception of the duty to act

judicially.

This position is aptly summarised in De Smiths Judicial Review7, as follows:

As in other contexts, in working out whether a decision is susceptible to judicial

review the court considers two main factors. It will have regard to the source of

the power under which the impugned decision is made. If this is purely

contractual, judicial review is unlikely to be appropriate; some close statutory (or

prerogative) underpinning of the contract will normally be needed. Alternatively,

the court may consider whether the function being carried out by the defendant is

a public function.

The judicial developments discussed above are reflected in Harjani and another v

Indian Overseas Bank and others8, and several other decisions of this Court and the

Supreme Court.

In this background, let me now consider whether the scheme contained in P4 and the

subsequent decision contained in P12 have the requisite statutory flavour which

invites the exercise of jurisdiction of this Court.

It is admitted that all Petitioners have served the SLAF and have retired from service. It

is also admitted that the Fund has been established by an Air Force Order. The

Respondents have admitted further that the Fund was established under powers vested

in the Commander of the Air Force under Section 156 of (the) Air Force Act No. 41 of

1959, as amended.9 Section 156 reads as follows:

All property belonging to the Air Force or to any part of the Air Force, other than

the property of individual members of the Air Force, and the exclusive right to sue

for and recover moneys and other property due to the Air Force or to any part of

the Air Force, shall vest in the Commander of the Air Force for the time being, with

7 Harry Woolf, Jeffery Jowell, Catherine Donnelly, Ivan Hare, De Smiths Judicial Review [8th Edition, 2018] Sweet and Maxwell, page 148-149. See Kumuduni Madugalle v. National Housing Development Authority and others [CA(Writ) Application No. 540/2019; CA Minutes of 16th June 2020 per Samayawardhena, J]. 8[2005] 1 Sri LR 167. 9 Vide paragraph 7(ii) of the Statement of Objections.

12

power for him to sue, to make contracts and conveyances, and to do all other

lawful things relating to such property; ......

I cannot see any other relevance to the above admission by the Respondents except an

admission that the moneys lying to the credit of the Fund is the property of the SLAF

and can be dealt with by the Commander in terms of the powers vested in him in terms

of the Air Force Act.

In their Statement of Objections, the Respondents have stated as follows:10

a) In terms of Air Force Order 850, the Commander of the Air Force is the

administrator of the Fund;

b) As the administrator of the Fund, the Commander has the authority to make

decisions pertaining to the Fund;11

c) The Commander has at various times, in the administration of the Fund, issued

Orders as empowered by Section 159 of the Air Force Act;

d) The Commander of the Air Force has the power to alter the Rules of the Fund as

and when necessary;

e) The Commander of the Air Force, being the administrator of the Fund has the

authority to make decisions pertaining to the Fund;

f) Such decisions have been taken in the regular procedure by the Board of

Management of the SLAF.

The essence of the above statements of the Respondents is that the power of the

Commander to take decisions relating to the Fund emanate from the powers that are

vested in the Commander in terms of the SLAF Act. A different position was later sought

to be taken where it was argued that the Fund is akin to a welfare society comprising of

10 Vide paragraphs 7(ii)-(iv) and 8 of the Statement of Objections. 11 Vide paragraph 7 of P2.

13

members whose relationship to the Fund is contractual and that whatever decisions

that are taken are contractual in nature and devoid of any statutory underpinning.

The Fund has been established by an Air Force Order and in terms of the powers vested

in the Commander under the Act. Unlike a welfare society, the Fund does not have a

constitution of its own, or even if it does, none has been produced. The Respondents

have not placed any material before this Court to establish that the Fund has a group of

office bearers who, even though they are serving officers of the SLAF, perform their

functions independent of their official titles and functions. On the contrary, the position

of the Respondents has been that the Fund is being administered by the Commander,

and that decisions have been taken by the Board of Management of the SLAF.

The Respondents have also not placed any material before this Court to establish that

the moneys lying to the credit of the Fund is kept in a special bank account without it

being mixed with State funds. While one would imagine that the monies belonging to

the Fund are held by the Commander in trust for the members, the Respondents have

admitted that the moneys lying to the credit of the Fund is the property of the SLAF and

can be dealt with by the Commander in terms of the powers vested in him in terms of

the Air Force Act vide Section 156 of the Act. In light of these representations made by

the Respondents themselves, this Court cannot deny the existence of a statutory nexus

to the impugned decisions.

Furthermore, even the documents that have been sent by the Respondents to the

Petitioners i.e. P4, P7, P8 and P12 - have been written in the official capacities of

the relevant officer, with P7 and P12 having been sent on behalf of the Commander

of the SLAF. It is also clear from R2 and the annexures thereto that the decision (a) to

commence the scheme, and (b) to re-visit the scheme in 2017, have been taken by the

SLAF and not by a set of office bearers of a welfare society.

When I take into consideration the totality of the above material, it is clear that the

Fund has been established by the Commander of the SLAF in terms of the Air Force Act,

and that the decisions that are being impugned in this application have been taken on

14

behalf of the Commander, by the Board of Management of the SLAF. Therefore, I am of

the view that the Fund has the public element or the statutory underpinning that is

required for this Court to exercise the Writ jurisdiction conferred on this Court and hear

and determine this matter.

This takes me to the principal argument presented to this Court by the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners that the decision conveyed to the Petitioners was

arbitrary, unreasonable and irrational.

In Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service,12 Lord Diplock having

introduced irrationality as one of the three grounds upon which administrative action

is subject to judicial review, stated that:

"By 'irrationality' I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as 'Wednesbury

unreasonableness. It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of

logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his

mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it. "

Lord Diplocks definition of irrationality is intrinsically linked to the test adopted by Lord

Greene in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v. Wednesbury Corporation13

where unreasonableness was explained as something so absurd that no sensible person

could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority. The famous example of

the red-haired teacher who was dismissed due to the colour of her hair, illustrates the

high threshold for unreasonableness that was expected to justify judicial intervention

on this ground.

Recent developments in English law however illustrate that Courts are keen to reduce

the rigour of wednesbury unreasonableness14 in order to better fulfill their function of

12 [1985] 1 AC 374 (the GCHQ Case). 13 [1948] 1 K.B. 223 at pages 229 - 230. 14 See R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Daly [2001] 3 All ER 433; Regina (Association of British Civilian Internees: Far East Region) v. Secretary of State for Defence [2003] QB 1397 at page 1413; Kennedy v Charity Commission (Secretary of State for Justice and others intervening) [2015]1 AC 455.

15

probing the quality of decisions and ensuring that assertions made by public authorities

are properly substantiated, justified, and strike a fair balance between parties.

The case of Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside Metropolitan

Borough Council,15 decided prior to the GCHQ case provides in the following passage,

what can be considered a more balanced test: 16

In public law, unreasonable as descriptive of the way in which a public

authority has purported to exercise a discretion vested in it by statute has become

a term of legal art. To fall within this expression it must be conduct which no

sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities would have

decided to adopt.

It is clear that by P4, the SLAF had represented to the Petitioners that they would be

paid a sum of Rs. 1 million (or Rs. 750,000 if the period was less than 36 months and

depending on whether the recipient was an Airman or Air Woman) when they retire

upon completing 22 years of service. It was argued that P4 created in the minds of the

Petitioners a legitimate expectation that they would receive the said sum of money on

their retirement. I must admit that on the face of it, what was promised by P4 does not

appear to be a realistic scheme, where after three years of contributing Rs. 1750 per

month, an officer would receive what would appear to be an unrealistic sum of Rs. 1

million. What is worse is that even an Officer who retired after contributing for just a

month received Rs. 750,000. Hardly the circumstances that should prevail for a Court to

recognize a legitimate expectation, even though 1821 Officers were paid the sums of

money promised vide R1 - leaving Ripley in disbelief.

However, what is important to note is that the SLAF did not venture out into the

unknown and hence, what was being introduced was not an unrealistic scheme. The

Scheme which was initially proposed was in line with the schemes operated by Sri Lanka

Army and Sri Lanka Navy. Furthermore, prior to venturing into this new initiative, the

15[1977] AC 1014. 16See Colonel U.R. Abeyratne v. Lt. Gen. N.U.M.M.W. Senanayake and Others, CA (Writ) Application No. 239/2017; CA Minutes of 7th February 2020; Also see KIA Motors (Lanka) Limited v. Consumer Affairs Authority, CA (Writ) Application No. 72/2013; CA Minutes of 26th May 2020; U.A.A.J Ukwatte and another v. Minister of Education and others, CA (Writ) Application No. 403/2019; CA Minutes of 12th June 2020.

16

SLAF has conducted what the SLAF itself calls a comprehensive study vide Exhibit A to

the analysis carried out in June 2017 relating to the future sustainability of the Fund,

marked R2.

The scheme contemplated that all Officers serving in the SLAF will join the scheme and

contribute towards the Fund. However, it is not all those who joined the scheme that

would receive the ultimate benefit of Rs. 1m for the reason that some officers may leave

the service prior to the completion of the mandatory period that they need to serve in

order to receive the benefit. Such officers would only receive their contribution with

interest at 5% per annum. While the membership fee that was to be charged was to

bring in Rs. 704m per annum, the number of retirees in the first three years was an

average of 675, with over 90% of the retirees being non commissioned Officers. Thus,

the moneys that were to be generated through the membership fee were sufficient to

pay those retiring in the first three years, at the marked down rate.

The Report R2 has identified that the study in 2014 proposed a monthly contribution

from Volunteers which was Rs. 500 less than Officers of the Regular Force whilst

offering the same retirement benefits to the Officers of the Volunteer Force under the

Scheme. The reason for doing so is that the study had assumed that the Volunteer Force

Fund (the VAF) would merge with the Fund from the beginning of the scheme, bringing

in the capital of the VAF to the Fund. The merger, which should have brought in

approximately Rs. 382m, however had not taken place.

The study in 2014 had also estimated an annual income of Rs. 704m. However, what

was received was Rs. 80m less due to the distribution of a portion of the savings from

the Fund to the VAF, at the rate of Rs. 500 per officer of the Volunteer Force every

month. The primary cause in the drop of revenue was the failure to have the Regular

Force and the Volunteer Force make the same monthly contribution and the failure to

merge with the VAF. The drop in the total income had therefore been Rs. 165m.17

17 Vide Exhibit B of R2.

17

R2 had therefore proposed the following two options so that the scheme would

continue to be feasible:

(a) Increase the monthly contribution of Regular as well as Volunteer Force personnel

by Rs. 500, which would bring in an additional Rs. 215m per year;

(b) Merge the Fund with the VAF and have all members contribute the same monthly

amount, irrespective of whether they belong to the Regular Force or the Volunteer

Force, thus bringing in an additional sum of Rs. 144m.

Although R2 has recognised that the existing scheme would suffer losses beyond 2022,

R2 has further recognised that with either of the above options being implemented,

the scheme could continue till 2029 with a slight deficit. Annexed to R2are the figures

for each of the above options which shows clearly that with either of the above options,

the scheme is feasible until 2029.18 Thus, R2 contained remedial measures that would

ensure the scheme could continue until 2029 and beyond.

The recommendations in R2 had been considered by the 9th Respondent, who has

recommended that the following be implemented:19

a) To increase the monthly contribution of each member by Rs. 500;

b) To merge the VAF with the Fund;

c) To equal the contributions made by Regular and Volunteer Force officers;

d) To increase the loan interest rate from 4.2% to 5% in order to equalize it with the

cost of capital;

e) Increase the monthly membership fee of Rs. 5 to Rs. 20.

18 Vide Exhibit E of R2. 19 Vide Annexes A and B of R2.

18

The above proposals of the 9th Respondent have been recommended by the 2nd

Respondent, who was the Chief of Staff at that time and later became the Commander

of the SLAF, subject to one further amendment i.e. to increase the monthly

membership fee from Rs. 5 to Rs. 25.20

The Respondents have not explained why the above proposals were not implemented.

Had it been done, the Fund would have had sufficient monies to honour its obligations.

Instead, the Respondents claim that a decision was taken by the Board of Management

of the SLAF that the Petitioners cannot be paid the sums of money that was promised by

P4 and arbitrarily reduced the sum to Rs. 276,912. It is clear that the Respondents have

represented to the Petitioners that they would be paid Rs. 1m on retirement, provided

they have completed contributions for 36 months. If the said representation was to be

retracted by the Respondents, that must be on reasonable grounds. In this instance, the

Respondents own documents reveal that they had two options open to them, which

would have ensured that the scheme could proceed upto 2029. Therefore, the decision

in P12 is a decision taken without due appreciation of the relevant facts and

circumstances.

In any event, the adjustment to P4 contained in P12 is admittedly after the

Petitioners retired from service and has been on 26th January 2018 with retrospective

effect from June 2017. It is clear that the powers vested in the Commander of the Air

Force under Section 156 of (the) Air Force Act do not specifically confer on the

Commander of the Air Force, the power to make decisions which affect rights

retrospectively.

Together with their written submissions, the Respondents have tendered several

documents which reveal the following:

a) The contributions of the Volunteer Force Airmen / Airwomen have been increased

in February 2018 by Rs.500 to Rs. 1750;

20 Vide document dated 18th July 217 annexed to R2.

19

b) The contributions of the Airmen / Airwomen have been increased in September

2019 from Rs. 1750 to sums ranging from Rs. 2750 to Rs. 3250, depending on the

number of years in service;

c) The payments due to the Petitioners who have completed 36 months prior to

retirement have been increased upto Rs. 700,000 while those with less than 36

months are to be paid Rs. 600,000;

d) Airmen retiring after September 2019 are entitled to a sum of Rs. 700,000.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that the decision in P12 in so far as it

relates to the Petitioners is arbitrary and unreasonable and is liable to be quashed by a

Writ of Certiorari. I accordingly issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the letter dated P12.

I also issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents or those holding Office in the

Command Benevolent Fund to pay the Petitioners the Retirement Benefit in terms of

P4. I make no order with regard to costs.
