simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the

5

At the trial, the prosecution led the evidence of the complainant

Ashoka Chandana, (sometimes referred to as Ashoka Ranjith) T.B

Dissanayaka, Saman Manoj, P.C.24221 Herath, and IP Chandrapala

Abeywickrama (whose name is not included in the indictment).

It is pertinent to document the following facts to understand the

delay for the pronouncement of the judgment, when after the

conclusion of the trial the first date of judgment was fixed for

9.01.2015 and finally judgment had been delivered three years later

on 28.03.2018.

The evidence of the prosecution witnesses, the dock statement of

the accused and the evidence of the two witnesses called on behalf of

the defense have been concluded and the correction of proceedings on

behalf of the accused concluded on 05.09.2014 (it has been informed

that there are no corrections on behalf of the prosecution) and the

judgment has been fixed for 09.01.2015.However, the judgment was

not delivered on that day by the learned High Court Judge before

whom the trial was concluded.

On 31.03.2015 an application has been made by both parties to

adopt the evidence and deliver judgment by the successor High Court

Judge and accordingly, judgement has been fixed for 03.07. 2015.On

this day it had been informed by the Honorable judge that the

proceedings dated 08.03.2015 of PW 2 was not filed of record.The

legal officer of the Bribery Commission has been informed to submit a

photo copy of the evidence of PW 2 on 28.10.2015. Thereafter, as per

the proceedings dated 22.01.2016 another application has been made

6

before another High Court Judge to adopt the evidence and pronounce

the judgment and accordingly, again the judgment has been fixed for

30.03.2016.

However, on 19.05.2016 once again an application had been

made before the High Court Judge who delivered the impugned

judgment to adopt the evidence and deliver the judgment. After the

adoption of evidence, judgment has been fixed for 15.06.2016 on

which date court has made order under section 439 of the Criminal

Procedure Code to recall PW 01 Asoka Chandana whose evidence was

subsequently recorded on 30.11.2016 and the judgement was finally

delivered on 28.03.2018 convicting the accused-appellant on all

charges.

Briefly the facts of this case are as follows; according to Ashoka

Chandana the complainant, he had made an application for a permit

to transport some timber on behalf of one Manoj Kumara who is a

supplier of timber to a place in Moratuwa. The permit had to be issued

by the Divisional Secretary of Mahawa who is the appellant. Ashoka

Chandana has stated that the Divisional Secretary at his office

solicited a bribe of 20,000/- to issue the permit. Initially a sum of Rs.

10,000/- was given and accepted and then the Bribery Commission

was informed by telephone and the following day when the balance Rs

10,000/- was paid in the presence of the Bribery Officers, the

Divisional Secretary was arrested.

The appellant denied that he solicited and accepted any such

gratification and states that it is a fabricated charge. The motive being

7

the appellant admonishing and reprimanding the complainant about

not supplying timber or returning the money taken from the

Accountant Kumara who works in the AGAs office. The accountant

has complained about Asoka Chandana (who comes regularly to the

AGAs office to obtain permits) to the Divisional Secretary who is his

superior.

It is interesting to note that the complainant in his examination

in chief could not remember any specific date about the alleged

transaction or the date of the raid. However, in cross examination the

following dates were fixed. The date the appellant solicited Rs.

20,000/- to be on the 13.05.2007. Rs 10,000/- given on 14.05.2007

and the raid was on 16.05.2007 when the balance Rs 10,000/- was

given.

It was submitted by the learned Presidents Counsel that the

Divisional Secretary was on leave on the 13th, the day he is alleged to

have solicited the money, and that the prosecution has failed to

establish its case beyond reasonable doubt.

It appears that the 13th of May is a Sunday. Therefore, when the

complainant in cross examination, has been specific about the days in

relation to the alleged transaction, it is the duty of the prosecution to

establish the case beyond reasonable doubt.There is no obligation on

the appellant to fill in the blanks of the prosecution case.

The learned counsel for the accused at the trial stage has stated

that on the 13th the accused was on leave and according to the

8

calendar it is a Sunday. As such, as far as the charge of soliciting a

gratification is concerned there is no evidence coming forth from the

complainant in proof of this charge, let alone any corroboration from

any witness.

On a perusal of the evidence, it was apparent that as a whole,

there were many contradictions and discrepancies in the evidence of

the prosecution witnesses, which will be addressed subsequently in

this judgment.

PW 01 had in evidence in chief portrayed as if it was he who paid

the initial Rs 10,000/- to the Divisional Secretary. (appellant) However

after his evidence was postponed for another day for cross

examination, the prosecuting counsel sought permission from Court to

examine PW 01 further and some leading questions were asked,

where the name of one Dissanayake as the person who gave the

appellant the initial Rs. 10,000/- was elicited. It is very clear that up

to the point the leading questions were asked as to who gave the

appellant money, there was no evidence of Dissanayake paying any

money. The previous evidence was presented as if it was PW 01 who

paid the money to the appellant.

What is more surprising is Dissanayake (PW 2) in his evidence

never testifying that any money was given to the Appellant by him.

The prosecution case is dependent on the issue that money was

solicited then paid to the appellant. But Dissanayake merely stated

that the Divisional Secretary asked for a payment Rs 10,000/- to issue

a permit, which message he conveyed to Ashoka Chandana PW 01.

9

When considering the evidence of Ashoka Chandana at one time

stating that he paid Rs 10,000/- through Dissanayake, and if in fact

Dissanayake gave that money to the Divisional Secretary, why

Dissanayake did not testify to that fact is unclear. It is not probable

for a person like Dissanayake who is said to be a farmer, to forget a

fact like paying money to the highest government officer in the region.

This position leads to another discrepancy in the evidence of

Asoka Chandana. He was heard to say that after the initial payment of

Rs 10,000/-, the appellant gave his telephone number and wanted

him (PW 1) to contact the appellant with the balance Rs 10,000/.

(page 62 of the brief in evidence in chief)

: 20000/- , ? : .

Then the question arises, if it was Dissanayake who gave Rs

10,000/- to the appellant, PW 1 could not have been given the

telephone number by the appellant on that occasion.

What is most significant is that although PW 1 gave evidence for

the second time before the learned judge who pronounced the

impugned judgment, he has not testified either about him giving Rs

10,000/-to the appellant or sending that money though Dissanayake

or the Appellant accepting such money.

PW 1 has on 15.5.2009 and 30.11.2016 given evidence.

Therefore, some discrepancies in his evidence can be expected with

10

the passage of time. However, it is safe to assume that payment of

money in an unlawful manner to a person of the caliber of a Divisional

Secretary, which is not an every day occurrence, has to be etched in

PW 1s memory. His failure to testify to that fact creates a doubt about

his testimonial trustworthiness.

Further, PW 1 has categorically stated that he travelled to the

place of raid in the vehicle of the Bribery Officers, whereas in his

earlier evidence and the evidence of officer Herath (PW 4) was that

they went in a three wheeler, with which evidence the whole scenario

of the raid changes. This is clearly contradictory evidence.The

contradictory evidence of PW 1 cannot be considered as due to faulty

memory.

These vital infirmities in the evidence of PW 1, the learned trial

judge has failed to consider.

In K. Padmathilake Alias Sergeant Elpitiya VS. The Director

General of Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and

Corruption [2010] BLR 67 it was held;

(a) Credibility of prosecution witnesses should be subject to judicial

evaluation in totality and not isolated scrutiny by the judge.

(b) When witnesses makes inconsistent statements in their evidence

either at one stage or at two stages, the testimony of such

witnesses is unreliable and in the absence of special

circumstances, no conviction can be based on the testimony of

such witnesses. On the other hand one cannot be unmindful of the

11

proposition that Court cannot mechanically reject the evidence of

any witness.

(c) It is the paramount duty of the Court to consider entire evidence of

a witness brought on record in the examination-in-chief, cross-

examination and re-examination.

(d) It is a cardinal principle that unreliable and unacceptable evidence

cannot be rendered credible, simply because there is some

corroborative material.

The evidence of PW 1, when considered in its totality,contains

discrepancies and material contradictions which has created a doubt

about the credibility of his evidence.

Furthermore, there is another confusing fact elicited from the

proceedings at the trial. Both, PW 1 and PW 4 Officer Herath refer to

an Inspector Gunawardena as the main officer involved in the raid. He

was the person who had given instructions and the marked money

to PW 1 and the officer who arrested the appellant.

Although the name SI Gunawardena of the Bribery Commission

is named as a witness, it is IP Chandrapala Abeywickrama who had

given evidence at the trial. From pages 156 and 179 of the brief, IP

Abeywickrama has given evidence of how the raid was conducted and

regarding the arrest of the appellant. The questions posed by Counsel

as well as in the answers of the witnesses including the evidence of

PW 4 refer to an officer named Gunawardena.

12

The prosecution has failed to explain this very relevant issue.

The Counsel for the appellant in his written submissions in the High

Court in page 351 of the brief has submitted that inadvertently the

name of the officer is stated as Gunawardena and the correct name is

Abeywickrama. But it is unclear on what basis the counsel for the

accused-appellant has stated that fact when the prosecution who

called the officer has not given any such clarification. Further, even at

the hearing of the appeal that aspect was not adverted to by any party.

Therefore, the current position before this court seems to be

that there is a gaping and unexplained mystery about the prosecution

witness who has conducted the raid and arrested the appellant.

It is also apparent that the learned trial judge has failed to

consider the credit worthiness of the evidence of PW 1 and officer

Herath PW 4, with regard to the acceptance of money at Dahaiyagama

junction in his evaluation and analysis as there are material

contradictions in their evidence.

There is also no analysis or evaluation of the evidence of PW 2

Dissanayake by the learned trial judge in the judgment. The Counsel

for the respondent conceding that fact was heard to say that the

judgment states that there were six prosecution witnesses. Merely

because the number of the prosecution witnesses are referred to in a

judgment that does not mean that the evidence of one of the most

important witnesses was considered by the learned judge when there

is no reference to that fact.

13

It is well established that findings of primary facts by a trial

judge who hears and observes the witnesses are not to be lightly

disturbed on appeal. (Alwis vs Piyasoma Fernando 1993 1 SLR 122,

Wickramasooriya vs Dedoleena 1996 2 SLR 95, Fradd vs Brown 20

NLR 282)

It is noted that in the instant case the learned judge who

delivered the judgment had the benefit of witnessing only PW 1.

It is trite law that a court of appeal should "attach the greatest

weight to the opinion of the judge who saw the witnesses and heard

their evidence," and, consequently, should not disturb a judgment of

fact unless it is unsound. The principle embodied has been stated

succinctly in the following cases.

King v. Gunaratne14 Ceylon Law Recorder 174 Macdonell, C.J.

stated:

"This is an appeal mainly on the facts from a Court

which saw and heard the witnesses, to a Court

which has not seen or heard them, and in dealing

with this judgment I have to apply the three tests, as

they seem to be, which a Court of Appeal must apply

to an appeal coming to it on questions of fact:

(1) Was the verdict of the Judge unreasonably against the weight of evidence, (2) Was there a misdirection either on the law or on the evidence,

14

(3) Has the Court of trial drawn the wrong inferences from matters in evidence." In Martin Fernando v. The Inspector of Police, Minuwangoda, 45 NLR 210 Wijeyewardene, J. held that:

"An Appellate Court is not absolved from the duty of

testing the evidence extrinsically as well as

intrinsically" although "the decision of a Magistrate on

questions of fact based on the demeanour and

credibility of witnesses carries great weight." Where

"a close examination of the evidence raises a strong

doubt as to the guilt of the accused, he should be given

the benefit of the doubt.

On a perusal of the judgment of the learned trial judge it appears

that the dock statement and the evidence of the two defence witnesses

have not been given due consideration according to law. The evidence

of the witnesses has been rejected on the basis that they are partisan

witnesses, without giving any acceptable reason how that conclusion

was reached.

In Jayathunga V A.G and another 2002 1 SLR 197 at 202 Hector

Yapa J, stated as follows.

.. The other submission that was made by

Learned Presidents Counsel was the failure of the

Learned High Court Judge to consider the defence

evidence, specially the evidence given by the Accused

Appellant, before he decided to sustain the conviction of

the Accused Appellant. Counsel contended that there

was complete failure by the High Court Judge to

15

consider the evidence given by the defence. In support of

this submission, Learned counsel cited the cases The

King V Tholis Silva (30 NLR 267), where it has been held

that it is the duty of a Court to scrutinize the defence put

forward in a case and if it is rejected, to give reasons

therefore. Counsel also referred to the case of

Chandrasena and others V. Munaweewa (1998(3) SLR

94), where the need for a judge to analyse and evaluate

the evidence of both the Prosecution and the defence

with reasons has been highlighted and commented

upon.

On consideration of the totality of the evidence adduced at the

trial and the above mentioned facts and the judicial authorities cited,

it is my considered view that it is unsafe to allow the conviction to

stand.

Accordingly, the conviction and the sentence are set aside. The

appeal is allowed. The appellant is acquitted of all the charges.

The registrar is directed to send a copy of the judgment together

with the original case record to the High Court of Colombo.
