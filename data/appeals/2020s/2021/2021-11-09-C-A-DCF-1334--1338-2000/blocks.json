    "text": "It was argued by the 5B & 27 defendant-appellants that Joronis who was entitled to 1/6 share had married in community of property and after executing deed 510, his balance 1/12 had devolved on his 2 children Meinona and Gamage Arnolis Perera, each of whom becoming entitled to 1/24 shares. The devolution of Meinonas 1/24 on deeds 514, 515, 516 and 517 was to Gamage Arnolis Perera who was the father of the 5th defendant and the brother of Meinona. All those deeds deal with a 1/24 share. Similarly, the 1/24 share, which the other child of Joronis who was Gamage Arnolis Perera had inherited devolved on his wife Isabella Perera on deeds 519 and 520. These deeds too correctly deal with 1/24 share. The learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the said documents.",
