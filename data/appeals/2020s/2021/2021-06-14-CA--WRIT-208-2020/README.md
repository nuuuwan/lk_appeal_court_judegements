Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

This matter was taken up for argument together with CA (Writ) Application No.

211/2020 and CA (Writ) Application No. 355/2020. By way of a motion filed on 7th

June 2021, the Attorneys-at-Law for the Petitioners and the 2nd Respondent have

informed that they are in agreement for this Court to deliver judgment in CA (Writ)

Application No. 211/2020 and for the said judgment to bind the parties in this

application.

By a judgment delivered today in CA (Writ) Application No. 211/2020, I have issued a

Writ of Certiorari quashing the Order made by the Hon. Magistrate of Colombo on

29th June 2020 in Case No. 30656/04/20 to issue summons on the Petitioner in that

application. I have also held that the said judgment shall not prevent the 2nd

Respondent from making a further application to the Hon. Magistrate to act in terms

of Section 139 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, as amended.

I accordingly issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Order made by the Hon.

Magistrate of Maligakanda in Case No. 9527/20 on 12th March 2020 to issue

summons on the Petitioners in this application. I also hold that this judgment shall

not prevent the 2nd Respondent from making a further application to the Hon.

Magistrate in terms of Section 139 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Such an

application, if made, shall be considered by the Hon. Magistrate in terms of the law.

I make no order with regard to costs.

President of the Court of Appeal
