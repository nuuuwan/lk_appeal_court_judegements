    "text": "The doctrine of estoppel is one founded on considerations of justice and good sense. If an issue has been distinctly raised and decided in an action, in which both parties are represented, it is unjust and unreasonable to permit the same issue to be re-litigated afresh between the same parties or persons claiming under them. The submission that a petitioner cannot continue to agitate the same matter over and over again brings me to the final objection raised by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, namely that this action is an abuse of the process of Court. I agree with the said submission and take the view that this Court, in the exercise of its Writ jurisdiction, will not exercise its discretion in favour of these Petitioners who are seeking to re-agitate an issue ad nauseum. Thus, on this ground alone, I am of the view that this is not a fit matter where the discretion of this Court must be exercised in favour of the Petitioners. In the above circumstances, I see no legal basis to issue formal notice of this application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed.",
