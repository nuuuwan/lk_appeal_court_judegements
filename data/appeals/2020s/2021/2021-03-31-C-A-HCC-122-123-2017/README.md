3 | P a g e

rape committed an offence punishable under section 364(2) of

the Penal Code as amended by the Act No. 22 of 1995.

After the trial the Appellants were convicted as charged for the 1st count

and each of them were sentenced to five years RI and a fine of Rs.5000/-.

In default 03 months RI imposed.

For the 2nd count the 1st Appellant was sentenced to 12 years RI with a fine

of Rs.5000/-. In default three months simple imprisonment imposed. In

addition, Rs.75000/- was imposed as compensation payable to the victim

with a default sentence of one year RI. The Learned High Court Judge

ordered the sentences imposed for count one and count two to run

concurrently.

For the 3rd count the 2nd Appellant was sentenced to 12 years RI with a fine

of Rs.5000/-. In default three months simple imprisonment imposed. In

addition, Rs.75000/- was imposed as compensation payable to the victim

with a default sentence of one year RI. The Learned High Court Judge

ordered the sentences imposed for count one and count three to run

concurrently.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsels for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent to argue this matter in their absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic.

4 | P a g e

The Counsels for the Appellants agreed to argue jointly on the following

grounds of appeal:

a. The learned trial judge erred in law and facts by convicting

the Appellants for charge of rape on the uncorroborated

testimony.

b. The learned trial judge has failed to consider that the

testimony of the doctor who is an independent witness

contradicts the evidence of the prosecutrix.

c. The findings of the learned trial judge in the impugned

judgment are untenable and contrary to the well settled

principles of law.

d. The learned trial judge has failed to consider the medical

evidence in the correct perspective.

In this case the prosecutrix is a married woman with grown up children. At

the time of the incident, she was living with her husband in a wattle and

daub house that was built in their chena cultivation in the Neelabemma

area. Her son was living separately at Yaya 18. On the date of the incident

at about 10.00pm the Appellants had gone to prosecutrixs house and

called her husband. She had identified the Appellants with the help of a

kerosene oil bottle lamp and a torch. When she had inquired as to why they

came to her house, the 1st Appellant had told her that they need a coir rope

to tie up some firewood. When she had replied in the negative, the

Appellants had then entered her house, occupied the veranda and

consumed liquor for about two hours. As the husband of the prosecutrix

did not join them both had left the house thereafter.

In a short while the 2nd Appellant had come back and asked for a cup from

the prosecutrixs husband. When the prosecutrix had given a cup the 2nd

Appellant had held her hand and both struggled in front of the house. At

5 | P a g e

that time 1st Appellant had come there and kicked the prosecutrix several

times. Thereafter one of the Appellants had removed his sarong and placed

it around the prosecutrixs head. In the meantime, the prosecutrixs

husband had been tied up by the Appellants. Thereafter, the prosecutrix

had been dragged across a water way and placed on top of a rock in the

Wilpattu jungle. At that time the Appellants were armed with a bottle and a

knife. Thereafter the 1st Appellant had stabbed her with the knife and 2nd

Appellant had dealt a blow on her head with the bottle.

Thereafter, both the Appellants had raped the prosecutrix for about two

hours on the rock. When the Appellants fell asleep, she escaped from their

custody and walked in to the Wilpattu jungle and managed to come up to

the Neelabemma bunt and prayed for help. She was taken to

Anuradhapura Hospital and warded there for about five days. The doctor

had only examined her body. She had given a statement to Nochchiyagama

Police while receiving treatment in the hospital.

In the 1st ground of appeal advanced by the Appellants contented that the

learned trial judge erred in law and facts by convicting the Appellants for

charge of rape on the uncorroborated testimony of the prosecutrix.

Justice Dheeraratne in Sunil and others v. Attorney General [1986] 1

Sri.L. R 230 held that:

Corroboration is only required or afforded if the witness

requiring corroboration is otherwise credible. If the

evidence of witness requiring corroboration is not credible

his testimony should be rejected and the accused

acquitted. Seeking corroboration of a witnesss evidence

should not be used as a process of inducing belief in such

evidence where such evidence is not credible.

6 | P a g e

It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated

testimony of a woman victim of a sex offence but if her

evidence is convincing such evidence could be acted on

even the absence of corroboration.

In Premasiri v. Attorney General [2006] 3 Sri.L.R held that:

The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there

can be a conviction in a case of rape but the necessity of

corroboration as a matter of prudence except where the

circumstances make it unsafe to dispense with it, must be

present to the mind of the judge.

In the evidence of the prosecutrix she had said that she was raped by the

Appellants for about two hours taking turns. When the Appellants had

fallen asleep, she had escaped from their custody and manged to arrive

near a hermitage and lost consciousness. Thereafter she had regained

consciousness at the Anuradhapura hospital.

In the cross examination the defence had marked a vital contradiction (V6)

with regard to the dress of the prosecutrix. At the non-summary inquiry,

the prosecutrix had said that she was naked when she reached the

Neelabemma bunt. But in the High Court trial she had said that her dress

was intact and gave it to the police on the following day. The prosecution

had marked her underskirt as P01. In her re-examination it was revealed

that the police had recovered P01 on 18/01/2005 nearly after about a year.

7 | P a g e

The prosecutrixs position was that she was unconscious when she reached

near the bunt and unable to say how she had come to the hospital. The

police officer who first met the prosecutrix near the bunt had categorically

said that he had spoken to her at that time and after inquiry he had got

down her husband and handed her over to him to be sent to the hospital.

Further the officer had said when he first saw the prosecutrix she was

wearing a red coloured blouse without buttons and a black coloured

underskirt.

As PW04, the husband of the prosecutrix had passed away before the High

Court trial, his evidence given in the non-summary inquiry was marked as

P4 under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance. In his evidence he had

said that when he saw his wife no clothes were found on her body except a

blue coloured clothe that had been put over her body. His evidence is fully

corroborated by PW03 the son of the prosecutrix.

PW03 in his evidence said that he could speak to his mother only after two

days of the incident. In his evidence nowhere he mentioned that his mother

had told him about rape committed by the Appellants on her. According to

him the prosecutrix had only told him that the Appellants had abducted

her, kept on a rock in the Wilpattu jungle and she escaped from their

custody when the Appellants had fallen asleep. In his evidence, marked as

P04, the husband of the prosecutrix too had not mentioned about the rape

incident.

The appeal grounds 2nd and 4th are considered together as they are

connected to medical evidence. In those grounds the Appellants contented

that the learned trial judge has failed to consider that the testimony of the

doctor who is an independent witness contradicts the evidence of the

prosecutrix and has failed to consider the medical evidence in the correct

perspective.

8 | P a g e

The doctor in his evidence said that he had only examined the body of the

prosecutrix as in the history to the doctor she had only mentioned about

the physical assault by the Appellants and has failed to mention about

sexual assault. He had further said that she was produced before him after

treatment for her injuries. Further the prosecutrix has not mentioned to

her family members including her husband about the alleged sexual

assault that has been committed by the Appellants. Considering nature of

this case and the evidence presented, failure to adduce medical evidence

pertaining to rape charges is a serious lapse on the part of the prosecution.

The final ground advanced by the Appellants is that the findings of the

learned trial judge in the impugned judgment are untenable and contrary

to the well settled principles of law.

Although the learned trial judge in his judgment at page 252 admitted that

considering corroborating evidence in a rape is a matter of prudence and

caution, he has failed to analyse the evidence in a correct perspective as

argued by the Appellants. Although the learned High Court Judge had

stated that the prosecutrixs evidence has been well corroborated by the

other evidence, when analysing the evidence presented by the prosecution

the conclusion reached by the trial judge is not tenable.

In this case all appeal grounds which are raised by the Appellants have

merits. The prosecutrix had failed to mention to her husband, her son and

the doctor that she was raped by the Appellants on the date of the incident.

Therefore, her evidence is not convincing to act without corroboration.

When analysing entirety of the evidence presented, we are of the view that

the prosecution had proved the 1st charge against the Appellants beyond

reasonable doubt. Hence, we affirm the conviction and sentence imposed

on them with regard to the 1st count. We further order the sentence

imposed on 1st count be operative from the date of conviction namely

13/07/2017.

9 | P a g e

As the prosecution has failed to prove the 2nd charge against the 1st

Appellant and the 3rd charge against 2nd Appellant beyond reasonable

doubt, we set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed on 2nd and 3rd

charges and acquit the 1st Appellant from 2nd count and acquit the 2nd

Appellant from 3rd count.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High Court of

Anuradhapura along with the original case record.

The appeal is partly allowed.
