Defendant-Respondents

This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha dated

21.05.1999.

The plaintiff instituted the above styled action in the District Court of Gampaha seeking inter alia

a declaration oftitle to the allotment of land marked Lot 3 of Ambagahawatta containing in extent

A.0-R.1-P.7.3 morefully described in the schedule to the plaint dated 05.07.1985 [page 55 ofthe

appeal brief].

The plaintiff averred in his plaint that-

1. He became entitled to the land in dispute by virtue of deed No. 2205 dated 24.02.1984

attested by M. K. Wijedasa, Notary Public (ell);

2. He and his predecessors have been in undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the

land in dispute for more than 10 years and have acquired the prescriptive title;

3. Since 11.05.1985, the defendants are unlawfully and wrongfully interrupting his peaceful

possession causing damages amounting to Rs. 50/- per month.

The 1't - 6th defendants filed their answer on 20.02.1986 [page 57 of the appeal brief] and took

up the position that-

1. The plaintiff or his immediate predecessor (i.e. Ramanayake Pathirennehelage Daniel

Singho) was never in possession of the land in dispute nor do they have any title,

prescriptive or otherwise, to it;

Page 2 of 7

2. The 1st -6th defendants and their predecessors have been in undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession of the land in dispute for more than 10 years and have acquired

the prescriptive title;

3. The plaintiff is unlawfully and wrongfully interrupting their peaceful possession and have

caused damages amounting to Rs. 5,000/-.

The 1st - 6th defendants sought a dismissal of the action of the plaintiff.

The 7th defendant filed his answer separately on 20.11.1986 [page 59 of the appeal brief] and

averred that-

1. The land in dispute is a divided portion of the subject matter of District Court of Gampaha

case bearing No. 3931/P which was left unallotted;

2. The co-owners of the said unallotted land portion transferred it to him by several deeds;

3. The 7th defendant and his predecessors have been in undisturbed and uninterrupted

possession of the land in dispute for more than 10 years and have acquired the

prescriptive title;

4. The plaintiff, the 1st - 6th defendants or their predecessors were never in possession of

the land in dispute nor do they have any title, prescriptive or otherwise, to it.

The 7th defendant prayed a declaration of title to the land in dispute in his favor.

At the beginning of the trial, 8 issues [pages 63 and 64 of the appeal brief] were raised. After a

lengthy trial, the learned Additional District Judge delivered his judgment on 21.05.1999 [page

148 of the appeal brief].

In his judgment, the learned Additional District Judge raised a new issue (numbered as issue No.

9) regarding the prescriptive title of the defendants in terms of section 149 of the Civil Procedure

Code which reads -

"52Si:5l2:Sl611)25f e"w iil~eo:l e~6 tIl2:Sl611)25f e00 eC;~b e"w 6t1l Zldb Stll8 B~~ 1)(",1)25f ~e"

e"w B~~ 0 1)(",1)25f e"e;WJ tIl2:Sl@l Ciil> lfl2Si ~?"

The learned Additional District Judge answered the said issue in affirmative. The action was

decided in favor of the defendants and the plaint of the plaintiff was dismissed. Being aggrieved,

the plaintiff appealed.

In his petition of appeal, the plaintiff contested inter alia that the learned Additional District

Judge, in raising a new issue whilst delivering the judgment, has miSinterpreted the provisions of

section 149 of the Civil Procedure Code and has misdirected himself on the law relating to the

burden of proof in a rei vindicatio action.

Page 3 of7

It is an established principle of law that ownership of the property claimed in a rei vindicatia

action is a fundamental condition to its maintainability [De Silva v. Goonetileke (32 N.L.R 217),

Pathirono v. Joyasundoro (58 N.L.R 169), O. A. Wonigarotne v. Juwanis Appuhamy et 01 (65 N.L.R

167), Mansi! v. oevaya (1985) 2 Sri.L.R 46, Lathee! v. Mansaar (2010) 2 Sri.L.R 333] and the burden

is on the plaintiff to establish the title pleaded and relied on by him [ohormadasa v. Jayasena

(1997) 3 Sri.L.R 327].

In establishing his title to the land in dispute, the plaintiff relies on '0(1' by which one Ramanayake

Pathirennehelage Daniel Singho has gifted his prescriptive title to the plaintiff only one year prior

to the institution ofthe instant action. Hence, it's imperative to see whether the said Ramanayake

Pathirennehelage Daniel Singho had prescriptive title to the land in dispute in order to convey

such title to the plaintiff as the law precludes a transferor from conveying a better title than the

one he possesses according to the maxim nemo dat quod non habet.

Accordingly, the plaintiff must establish the requisites stipulated in section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance. This means that, as set out in section 3, he has to prove, on a balance of probabilities,

that his predecessor had undisturbed and uninterrupted possession for a minimum of ten years

and that such possession has been adverse to or independent of the co-owners ofthe land.

The plaintiff has called Ramanayake Pathirennehelage Daniel Singho to give evidence on his

behalf. A careful perusal of his evidence shows that even though he claimed to possess the land

in dispute for a period of twenty years, he never was in actual possession of the same. He himself

has accepted Kurunegala to be his permanent place of residence. Also, the final decree marked

'0(2' by which the said Ramanayake Pathirennehelage Daniel Singho claimed to have obtained a

declaration of title to the land in dispute shows that the declaration was issued in respect of Lots

2 and 7 of Ambagahawatta and not in respect of Lot 3.

Further, the final decree marked '51' clearly indicates that Lot 3 (i.e. the land in dispute) was a

divided portion of the subject matter of District Court of Gampaha case bearing No. 3931/P which

was left unaliotted. There is no cogent evidence to show when and how the said Ramanayake

Pathirennehelage Daniel Singho started possessing the land in dispute against the co-owners of

the same.

The plaintiff has attempted to show that his predecessor (i.e. Ramanayake Pathirennehelage

Daniel Singho) acquired prescriptive title to the land in dispute through his agent/representative

namely the 1st defendant. However, according to '52', what the predecessor of the plaintiff

possessed through his agent/representative is Lots 2 and 7 of Ambagahawatta and not Lot 3.

Page 4 of 7

In view of the above, I hold that the learned Additional District Judge has correctly evaluated the

evidence led and concluded that the plaintiff has failed to fulfill the burden of proof on him in

establishing the prescriptive title of his predecessor.

The next question to be decided is whether that the learned Additional District Judge, in raising

a new issue whilst delivering the judgment, has misdirected himself as to the provisions of section

149 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Section 149 of the Civil Procedure Code reads -

"The court may, at any time before passing a decree, amend the issues ar frame additional

issues on such terms as it thinks fit."

A plain reading of section 149 of the Civil Procedure Code suggests that it is open to the court to

frames additional issues at any time before passing a decree.

In the case of Hameed v. Cassim [(1996) 2 SrLL.R 30 at 33], Dr. R. B. Ranaraja, J. observed-

"Bertram, C. J. in Silva v Obeysekara cammenting an the discretian of a judge ta allaw

issues after the commencement of the trial abserved, "No doubt it is a matter within the

discretion of the Judge whether he will allaw fresh issues to be formulated after the case

has commenced, but he should da so when such a course appears to be in the interests of

justice, and it is certainly nat a valid objectian to such a course being taken that they da

not arise on the pleadings."

The pravisions of sectian 149 cansidered along with the observatian of Bertram, C. 1.

certainly do nat preclude a District Judge from framing a new issue after the parties have

clased their respective cases and before the judgment is read out in open court. It is not

necessary that the new issue should arise on the pleadings. A new issue could be framed

on the evidence led by the parties orally or in the form of documents. The only restriction

is that the Judge in framing a new issue should act in the interests of justice, which is

primarily to ensure the correct decision is given in the case. It also means that the Judge

must ensure that when it is considered necessary to hear parties to arrive at the right

decision on the new issue, that they be permitted to lead fresh evidence or if it is purely a

question of law, that they be afforded an opportunity to make submissions thereon."

In the instant action, the 1st - 6th defendants pleaded prescriptive title to the land in dispute in

their answer. Also, it must be noted that the witnesses who gave evidence on behalf of the 1st _

6th defendants were cross-examined with regard to the title claimed by the 1st - 6th defendants

and the manner of their possession. As the new issue raised by the learned Additiona l District

Judge is based on the pleadings and the plaintiff had ample opportunity to cross-examine the

Page 5 of7

witnesses during trial with that regard, I am of the view that the plaintiff was not prejudiced or

taken by surprised by the newly framed issue.

Accordingly, I hold that the issue No.9 falls within the ambit of section 149 of the Civil Procedure

Code and the position of the plaintiff that the learned Additional District Judge has misdirected

himself as to the provisions contained therein has no merit.

Having said that, it is of vital importance to see whether the learned Additional District Judge was

correct in answering the said issue No.9 in affirmative.

The 1st - 6th defendants claim prescriptive title to the land in dispute. During trial, the lA, 3rd, 4th

and 5th defendants, all being family members, gave evidence stating that they have been in

possession of the land in dispute for over twenty years. Even though they have collaborated the

evidence led by each other, the only independent witness they called to give evidence on their

behalf, has failed to collaborate the evidence led on behalf of the 1st - 6th defendants.

In Juliana Hamine v. Don Thomas (59 N.L.R 546 at 548), L. W. De Silva, A. J. observed-

"The paper title being in the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, the burden of proving a title by

prescription was on the Plaintiff. That burden he hos fOiled to dischorge. Apart from the

use of the word possess, the witnesses called by the Plaintiff did not describe the manner

of possession. Such evidence is of no value where the Court has to find a title by

prescription. On this aspect, it is sufficient to recall the observations of Bertram, C. J. in the

Full Bench Case of Alwis v. Perera [1 (1919) 21 NLR at 326}:

"I wish very much that District Judges - I speak not particulorly, but generally -

when a witness says 'I possessed' or 'We possessed' or 'We took the produce',

would not confine themselves merely to recording the words, but would insist on

those words being explained and exemplified. I wish District Judges would abandon

the present practice of simply recording these words when stated by the witnesses,

and would see that such facts as the witnesses have in their minds are stated in full

and appear in the record. "

The land in dispute being an unallotted yet divided portion of a co-owned land, the 1st - 6th

defendants have failed to lead any cogent evidence to show when and how they and/or their

predecessors started possessing the same. I am also of the opinion that a settlement entered in

favour of the 1st - 6th defendant in an action instituted in terms of section 66 ofthe Primary Courts

Procedure Act is not adequate to satisfy the requisites stipulated in section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance.

Page 6 of 7

Since the 1" - 6th defendants have failed to sufficiently explain their manner of possession of the

land in dispute, they have failed to discharge the burden of proof in establishing the prescriptive

title claimed by them. I hold that the learned Additional District Judge has erred in answering the

issues NO. 7 and 9 in affirmative. I answer the said two issues as follows-

7. !'hsi;5llSl0lD2l"i ~l&G0'G C~ 0'G@'I5l 0'd ~e;w2l"i ~Cl @l tQ1:il;5l1'l~0'@l 2l"i tQ1:il;5lColC) ~1'llSlO0' C!J'I5l

For all the foregoing reasons, I allow this appeal partly and vary the judgment of the learned

Additional District Judge of Gampaha dated 21.05.1999 to the extent set out above. The learned

Additional District Judge of Gampaha is directed to enter decree accordingly.

Parties shall bear their costs.
