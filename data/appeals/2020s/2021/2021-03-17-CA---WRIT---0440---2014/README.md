Written Submissions on: 29.10.2019 (by the Petitioner). 17.09.2019 (by the 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 5th Respondents). 15.10.2019 & 24.01.2020 (by the 4th Respondent). Argued on: 27.01.2021. Decided on: 17.03.2021. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

1. The Petitioner in this application has invoked the supervisory

jurisdiction of this Court under Article 140 of the Constitution seeking

the discretionary remedies of writs of certiorari and mandamus.

2. The Petitioner is a minor and therefore makes this application,

appearing by his next friend, his father Senadheerage Sujeewa

Rajaratne.

3. After filing their respective statements of objection, the Respondents

have moved that this court should in the first instance decide on the

preliminary objections as to the maintainability of this application for

judicial review and written submissions have been tendered expatiating

on the preliminary objections.

4. For purposes of fully comprehending the scope of the preliminary

objections raised on behalf of the Respondents, the factual matrix

surrounding the basis of this application repays attention.

Factual matrix

5. In response to a circular No. 23/2013 dated 23.05.2013 (marked as

P1) published by the 5th Respondent-Secretary, Ministry of Education,

the Petitioner had submitted to the 1st Respondent- Principal of Royal

College, Colombo 07, an application dated 07.06.2013 (marked as P2)

seeking admission to Grade 1 of Royal College for the year 2014.

Page 4 of 25

The application had been presented under the 'children of residents in

close proximity to the school category. [According to the

'Guidelines/Instructions and Regulations regarding admission of children

to Grade 1 which is a component of the afore-stated 'Notification' entitled

'Instructions related to admission of children to Grade One in the

Government Schools for the Year 2014' issued by the 5th Respondent,

50% of children of the maximum number of students who may be

selected for Grade 1, should be selected from the Children of residents in

close proximity to the school category - vide Clause 6.0 (a) 1 of P1.]

6. In the said application presented to the 1st Respondent - Principal of

Royal College, Colombo 07, the Petitioner had taken up the position

that, he together with his family, including her wife and the children

are resident at No. 9/1A/1/1, Gomez Path, Havelock Town, Colombo

05, the same being approximately 650 meters distance from Royal

College, Colombo 07.

7. In response to the aforesaid application for admission to Royal College,

the Petitioner had been called for an interview which was subsequently

held on 17.08.2013. At the interview, in support of their application,

the Petitioner and the applicant (i.e., Petitioners Father) had tendered

for examination several documents P4 to P7 to the Interview Panel

(chaired by the 1st Respondent) which were required by the 1st

Respondent.

8. According to the Petitioner, following the interview held on 17.08.2013,

at which the afore-stated documents had been examined, the

application for admission to Royal College, Colombo, presented by the

Petitioner had received the following marks:

Page 5 of 25

Criteria Maximum marks

Marks awarded to the Petitioner Clause 6.1.I-Residence

35

35 Clause 6.1.II-Documents in proof of place of residence

10

04 Clause 6.1.III-Additional documents in proof of place of residence

05

01

Clause 6.1.IV-Proximity to the school from the place of residence

50

20

Total 100 60

9. Based on the marks received for each category, the application of the

Petitioner had received a total of 60 marks out of a maximum of 100,

which is below the purported cut off point 64 marks and was therefore

placed on the waiting list.

10. The Petitioner states that under Clause 6.1. IV in the above table, the

Petitioner has been awarded 20 marks, having deducted 30 marks (i.e.,

05 marks for each school) for the following six schools which

purportedly exist with primary sections that the Petitioner could be

admitted to between Royal College, Colombo 07, and the Petitioners

place of residence:

1. Thurstan College, Colombo 07 2. Isipathana Vidyalaya, Colombo 05 3. Vidyathilaka Vidyalaya, Colombo 05 4. St. Marys Sinhala Vidyalaya, Colombo 05 5. Lumbini Vidyalaya, Colombo 05 6. Dudley Senanayake Vidyalaya, Colombo 05

11. However, the Petitioner states that as demonstrated by letter dated

15.08.2013 (marked as P9), the Principal of Dudley Senanayake

Vidyalaya, Colombo 05 has stated that the said school would not be

admitting children to Grade 1 for the year 2014 since the said school is

undergoing development under the National Programme for developing

Page 6 of 25

a Thousand Secondary Schools. The Petitioner, by appending document

P11, further submits that the Ministry of Education on 13.05.2013

issued a letter, inter alia, directing that schools which are to undergo

development in terms of the National Programme for developing a

Thousand Secondary Schools should not take steps in respect of Grade

1 admissions for the year 2014.

12. It is in these circumstances, the Petitioner submits that deducting 05

marks for Dudley Senanayake Vidyalaya, Colombo 05 is illegal,

arbitrary, mala fide and ultra vires the provisions of the circular P1 as

the said school cannot be considered as a Government School with

primary section between the school applied to and the place of

residence.

13. Against the decision of the 1st Respondent to award the Petitioner only

60 marks having deducted 05 marks for Dudley Senanayake Vidyalaya,

Colombo 05 as aforesaid, the Petitioner submitted an appeal dated

20.10.2013 to the Appeals and Protest Board consisting of the 2nd to 4th

Respondents together with two others through the 1st Respondent.

14. Consequently, by letter dated 07.11.2013 (marked as P12-b), the

Petitioners father was called to be present before the said Appeals and

Protest Board on 30.11.2013. According to the Petitioner, at the

hearing, the Petitioners contention with regard to Dudley Senanayake

Vidyalaya, Colombo 05 was accepted by the members of the Appeals

Board and therefore the Petitioner was assured that the said error

would be rectified.

15. However, when the final list of selectees for Grade 1 admission at Royal

College, Colombo 07 was displayed on the school Notice Board, the

Petitioner was once again placed on the waiting list, at No. 16 having

purportedly scored only 60 marks. The Petitioner further states that the

cut-off point on the final list too remained at 64 marks.

Page 7 of 25

Appeal to the 5th Respondent, Secretary of Ministry of Education in terms of 11.10 of P1

16. The Petitioner submits that, being dissatisfied with the Interview Panel

and the Appeals and Protest Board to award the Petitioner only 60

marks notwithstanding the matters placed before the Appeals Board, on

29.12.2013 he made an appeal to the 5th Respondent, the Secretary,

Ministry of Education in terms of clause 11.10 of P1.

17. The Petitioner further states that in response to the aforesaid appeal to

the 5th Respondent, the Petitioner is aware that a committee was

appointed to inquire into the same and based on its findings the 5th

Respondent by his letter dated 20.02.2014 (marked as P18) directed

the 1st Respondent to admit the Petitioner into Grade 1 of Royal College,

Colombo 07.

18. However, the Petitioner states that, despite numerous visits to meet the

1st Respondent subsequent to receiving P18, the 1st Respondent has

refused or failed to comply with the direction made by the 5th

Respondent as reflected in P18 and in the circumstances the Petitioner

has not been admitted to Grade 1 of Royal College, Colombo to date. It

is further revealed from the Petition that, due to the said refusal or

failure of the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner dispatched two letters dated

13.03.2014 and 21.04.2014 to the 5th Respondent, bringing to his

notice such refusal or failure of the 1st Respondent to admit the

Petitioner to Grade 1 as directed by the 5th Respondent. These letters

have been marked as P19-a and P19-b by the Petitioner.

19. The Petitioner further submits that, on or around 27.12.2013 he made

a complaint to the Human Rights Commission against, inter alia, the

aforesaid decision of the 1st to 4th Respondents to place the Petitioner

on the waiting list by awarding the Petitioner only 60 marks. Pursuant

to the document marked P20, it is clear that, upon the complaint made

by the Petitioner, the Human Rights Commission held an inquiry on

Page 8 of 25

several dates and at the end on 31.07.2014 made its recommendation,

inter alia, to admit the Petitioner to Grade 1 of Royal College, Colombo

07.

20. However, the Petitioner further states that on 08.08.2014 when the

Petitioner and his father met the 1st Respondent in anticipation of relief

pursuant to P20, the 1st Respondent had informed the Petitioner and

his father that the Petitioner would not be admitted to Grade 1 of Royal

College. Therefore, the Petitioner further submits that similar to the

aforesaid direction of the 5th Respondent to admit the Petitioner to

Grade 1 which was not complied with by the 1st Respondent, the said

recommendation of the Human Rights Commission too has been

completely ignored and disregarded by the 1st Respondent and the

Petitioner to date has not been admitted to Grade 1 of Royal College,

Colombo 07.

21. In the above circumstance, the Petitioner argues that the refusal of the

1st Respondent to admit the child to Grade 1 of Royal College for the

year 2014, the refusal to comply with the direction given by the 5th

Respondent and the refusal to implement the recommendations of the

Human Right Commission are unreasonable, irrational, malicious,

illegal, against the principles of natural justice and ultra vires of the

provisions of Ministry of Education circularP1 and the provisions of

the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 21 of 1996.

22. In view of the foregoing, the Petitioner sought, inter alia, the following

relief:

b. A writ in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the

Interview Panel consisting of the 1st Respondent together with four others to award the Petitioner only 60 marks by deducting 05 marks for the purported reason that Dudley Senanayake Vidyalaya, Colombo 05 qualifies as a school with a primary section that the Petitioner could be admitted to.

Page 9 of 25

c. A writ in the nature of Certiorari to quash the decision of the

Appeals and Protest Board consisting of the 2nd to 4th Respondents together with two others to award the Petitioner only 60 marks as evinced by P13 by deducting 05 marks for the purported reason that Dudley Senanyaka Vidyalaya, Colombo 05 qualifies as a school with a primary section that Petitioner could be admitted to. d. A writ in the nature of Mandamus to order the 1st Respondent to

comply with the direction made by the 5th Respondent as reflected in P18. e. A writ in the nature of Mandamus to order the 1st Respondent to

comply with the direction made by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka as reflected in P20.

23. However, during the course of the argument, the Counsel for the

Petitioner informed Court that he would confine his relief to prayer (d)

of the Petition. Accordingly, this Court is invited to see the legality in

granting relief (d) i.e., writ of mandamus.

Preliminary Objections

24. Before I proceed to set down the decisions on the preliminary

objections, let me crystalize them in a nutshell. The objections some of

which are often described as discretionary bars are as follows:

1. Suppression and misrepresentation of material facts or Absence

of Uberirimae fides.

2. Non-citing of necessary parties who are entitled to be heard, as

any order adverse would affect their rights.

3. The matter urged in the application had been adjudicated by the

Supreme Court in a similar case.

Page 10 of 25

Suppression of material facts or Absence of Uberrima fides:

25. The Respondents, in support of this preliminary objection, stated that

the Petitioner had not been qualified based on the documents relied on

by the Petitioner to satisfy residency criteria. More specifically, the

learned Additional Solicitor General for the 1st-3rd and the 5th

Respondents raised this objection on the basis that, being Deed of

Lease No. 635 dated 14.05.2011 (P6-c), was a false or a forged

document on the basis that the Notary Public who executed the said

instrument has referred to the same as a Last Will in his monthly list

submitted to the Land Registry, which had been made only to legitimize

a claim for admission to school on the basis of residency criteria spelt

out in P1.

26. Accordingly, it was argued by the learned Additional Solicitor General

that, as stated in the CircularP1 itself, the documents submitted for

admission should remain intact until the selection process is over and

even thereafter as it is permissible under the law to disqualify a student

if documents are found to be false or forged. It was further argued by

the learned Additional Solicitor General that the integrity of the

documents should be maintained even when the matter is taken to

judicial forum because the court is bound to look at the integrity and

acceptability of the documents when a court of law is called upon to

decide on the admission or otherwise of a student. Thus, it was the

contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General that, the

Petitioner has failed to satisfy this Court on the all-important issue of

the integrity of the Deed of Lease, P6-c and thereby acted in breach of

the principle of uberrima fides, which is a sine qua non for the success

of the application.

27. However, when replying to the above contention, the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the Deed of Lease-P6c is duly

registered by the land registry and the registration has not been

cancelled or altered in terms of section 39 of the Registration of

Page 11 of 25

Documents Ordinance, No. 23 of 1927 (as amended) and therefore the

registration of the same is valid and stands to date. He further argued

that, according to section 33 of the Notaries Ordinance, No. 01 of 1907

(as amended), in any event, non-compliance of the Rules of the Notaries

Ordinance by the Notary Public cannot invalidate the Deed of Lease.

Therefore, he submitted that the above contention against the validity

of Deed of Lease P6-c is untenable and made without merit.

28. According to the scheme contained in P1, the scheme recognizes two

categories of documents that may be produced in proof of residency.

They have been identified as main documents and additional

documents. Clause 6.1.I of the scheme stipulates the types of main

documents that may be submitted in proof of residency and the

assignment of marks for the submission of such documents. These

main documents include (i) Title Deeds, (ii) Deeds of Gift, (iii)

Certificates of ownership, (iv) Government awards, (v) Documents (lease

agreements and payment receipts) relating to houses purchased on

housing loans/hire purchase schemes, (vi) continuously registered

lease bonds, and (vii) other documents confirming residency etc. It

would be seen that the several categories of documents stipulated

above, postulates non-insistence on actual ownership. Residency

arising out of other forms of actual possession is also recognized. It is to

be noted that the Petitioners father (applicant) had submitted the above

Deed of Lease P6-c, as a main document in proof of place of residence

and accordingly, the Interview Panel consisting the 1st Respondent,

being satisfied with P6-c, had awarded 04 marks out of a maximum 10.

29. Thus, this Court of the view that, the learned Additional Solicitor

Generals arguments on the validity of the document P6-c (which was

already accepted by the Interview Panel), cannot be allowed first time in

this forum.

Page 12 of 25

30. In the circumstances, I see no merit in the contention of the

Respondents that the Petitioner lacks uberrima fides and thus this

court overrules the preliminary objection raised on this discretionary

bar.

Non-citing of necessary parties:

31. The other preliminary objection that both Counsel for the Respondents

have raised is that the Petitioner has failed to cite other students or

their next of kin as Respondents who would be affected by the decision

of this court to change the selection of students as urged by the

Petitioner or to quash the decision of the Interview Panel and the

Appeals and Protest Board [vide prayer (b) and (c) to the Petition dated

19.12.2014].

32. Further, referring to the document marked 1R4(B), Counsel for the 4th

Respondent submitted that, if marks are not deducted as canvassed by

the Petitioner, then there are seven more students, in addition to the

Petitioner would then be entitled to marks more than 65 which is above

the cut-off mark of 64, and if the Petitioners argument is upheld, then

all the eight students would get more marks than the present cut-off

mark.

33. Furthermore, the Counsel for the 4th Respondent submitted that

notwithstanding the other remaining students, the other 4 members of

the Interview Board and 2 members of the Appeals Board have not been

made as Respondents by the Petitioner.

34. As I mentioned before, since the Petitioner has confined his relief to

only prayer (d) of the Petition i.e., Mandamus to order the 1st

Respondent to comply with the direction made by the 5th Respondent, I

am of the view that, suiting other remaining members of the Appeal and

Protest Board is not necessary to adjudicate the instant application.

Page 13 of 25

35. It has to be remembered that the power to issue writs vested by Article

140 of the Constitution in this Court is a supervisory power and not an

appellate jurisdiction (vide The Board of Trustees of the Tamil University

Movement vs. F.N. de Silva1) and in exercising the writ jurisdiction, this

Court will not consider whether the decision is right or wrong in the

context of the greater benefit of the society or otherwise, but whether the

decision is lawful or unlawful in the eyes of the law. (Vide Public Interest

Law Foundation vs. Central Environment Authority2).

36. As observed by Marsoof, J. in J. S. Dominic vs. Minister of Lands &

Others3 writs in the nature of certiorari and mandamus, which are

granted by our courts according to law as provided in Articles 140 and

154P (4) (b) of our Constitution, had their origins in English common

law and were known as prerogative writs as they were the means by

which the Crown, acting through its courts, ensured that inferior courts

or public authorities acted within their proper jurisdiction. The

hallmark of such writs was that they were granted in the name of the

Crown, as the title of every case indicated, but as the law developed,

initially individual litigants were permitted to initiate proceedings in the

name of the Sovereign, and in jurisdictions such as Sri Lanka, even

without expressly referring to the Crown.

37. As H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth observe in Administrative Law, page

591 (9th Edn.), The Crown lent its legal lent its legal prerogatives to its

subjects in order that they might collaborate to ensure good and lawful

government. The fact that our Constitution expressly refers to these

writs by their ancient names shows that our Constitution makers

intended to preserve the beneficial characteristics of these ancient

remedies, which possess the inherent character and virility to be able to

change to suit changing circumstances and needs. It is therefore

unthinkable that a court of law will subvert the objectives of these

1 [1981] 1 SLR 350 2 [2001] 3 SLR 330 & CA/WRIT/173/2015, C.A. Minutes dated 03.07.2018. 3 S. C. Appeal No. 83/08, S.C. Minutes dated 07.12.2010.

Page 14 of 25

beneficial remedies by non-suiting a party through a process of tying it

down in unshakable knots, as the Court of Appeal has sought to do in the

instant case4.

38. Therefore, I am of the view that the Petitioner has made the party to

grant or issue a writ of mandamus to comply with the direction made

by the 5th Respondent and the parties directly affected by the outcome

of this case as Respondents to this application. Thus, this court

overrules the preliminary objection raised on the issue of failure to cite

necessary parties.

Matter being already adjudicated by the Supreme Court:

39. The other preliminary objection that the learned Additional Solicitor

General has raised is that the matter urged in the instant application

has been adjudicated by the Supreme Court in a similarly

circumstances case.

40. The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that it was not the

Petitioner alone who was not eligible for admission but another 43

applicants including a few who had secured more marks than the

Petitioner as borne-out. This is evident by document marked 1R-4(B).

He further submitted that, although an applicant called A. M. Sandil

Senila Ariyathilaka listed at No. 21 of 1 R-4(B) had challenged the

reduction of marks under the same circumstances before the Supreme

Court in Case No. SC. FR. No. 188/2014 (marked as 1R5(B)), the

Supreme Court did not interfere with the issue.

41. In contrast, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner in his

written submission strenuously argued that the Supreme Court order,

1R5(B) that is being relied on pertains to a Fundamental Rights

application filed by another aggrieved student and it is not that the

Supreme Court has not interfered with the issue but that the issue

4 Supra 3, pg. 15-16

Page 15 of 25

never arose, and the proceedings were terminated. In evident, he

highlighted the following passage of the order in case No. SC. FR. No.

188/2014 dated 11.12.2014:

we have indicated to counsel that he should present his

application through Ministry of Education for admission to Grade II

Royal College in 2015.

Learned Additional Solicitor General is directed to inform the

Secretary, Ministry of Education that this application should be

viewed favourably having regard to the special circumstances of

the case. [see pg. 2 & 3]

42. Further, a careful perusal of the above judgment of the Supreme Court

is suggested that, the Petitioner of the instant application had not been

included as a party by the said applicant A.M. Sandil Senila

Ariyathilaka (on behalf of the aggrieved child L.L. Amila Janali

Liyanaarachchi).

43. In Lanka Maritime Services Ltd. vs. Sri Lanka Ports Authority and six

Others5. It was held that,

per Saleem Marsoof, J.,

"I am of the opinion that there is no Rule of Court or principle of law

which precludes the filing of a fresh application with respect to the

same subject matter as an existing application but the Court may

in the context of a writ application take into consideration the fact

of the existence of the earlier application in exercising its discretion

in regard to whether any new material placed before Court in the

later application should be rejected or any additional relief prayed

for in the latter case should be refused".

5 [2004] 3 SLR 332

Page 16 of 25

It is trite law that the doctrine of res judicata precludes fresh

proceedings only where there is a previous judicial decision on the

same cause between the same parties. [vide pg. 336-337]

When there is no proper judicial pronouncement (including

withdrawal without reservation of the right to initiate proceedings)

in a case involving the same parties and the same cause, a Court

will not dismiss any fresh action or application in limine and will

entertain the subsequent action or application.

44. In the circumstances, I hold that where there is no prior judicial

pronouncement in a case involving the same parties and the same

cause, a Court will not dismiss any fresh action or application in limine

and will entertain the subsequent action or application.

45. In Sri Lanka, fundamental right jurisdiction exists apart from and

independent of writ jurisdiction where the latter is exercised

independently by the Court of Appeal subject to appeal to the Supreme

Court, and the former exclusively by the Supreme Court. Fundamental

right jurisdiction is invoked in relation to violation of fundamental

rights expressly stated in the Constitution whereas the writ jurisdiction

is, broadly speaking, invoked to control the power of the bodies, which

discharge duties of public nature. The acts complained of in a writ

application do not necessarily give rise to complain of violation of

fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

46. In Pathirana vs. Victor Perera (DIG Personal Training Police)6 at 284-285,

Sriskandarajah J. stated:

In applications for writs the courts have relaxed the rules of

standing even wider than the rules of standing in fundamental

rights applications in order to ensure good administration.

6 [2006] 2 SLR 281

Page 17 of 25

In Wijesiri vs. Siriwardene7, Wimalaratne J. on behalf of the Supreme

Court at page 175 stated:

In this connection it would be relevant to refer to the views of an

eminent jurist on the question of locus standi. Soon after the

decision of the Privy Council in Durayappah vs. Fernando (1967) 3

WLR 289, in an Article entitled Unlawful Administrative Action in

(1967) 83 L.O.R. 499, H. W. R. Wade expressed the view that one

of the merits of Certiorari is that it is not subject to narrow rules

about Locus standi, but is available even to strangers, as the

Courts have often held, because of the element of public interest. In

other words it is a genuine remedy of public law, and all the more

valuable for that reason (at p. 504). As regards the applications for

Mandamus they should, in his view, in principle be no more

exacting than it is in the case of the other prerogative remedies,

because public authorities should be compellable to perform their

duties, as a matter of public interest at the instance of any person

genuinely concerned; and in suitable case, subject always to

discretion, the Court should be able to award the remedy on the

application of a public spirited citizen who has no other interest

than a due regard for the observance of the law-Wade-

Administrative Law (4th Ed) 608. The result of a restrictive doctrine

of standing, therefore, would be to encourage the government to

break the law; yet this is exactly what the prerogative writs should

be able to prevent (p. 609). To restrict Mandamus to cases of

personal legal right would in effect make it a private law remedy (p

610). These observations, with which I am in respectful agreement,

appear to make the second requirement, insisted upon by Tambiah

J. i.e.: some personal interest in the matter complained of,

unnecessary. But the first requirement ought, in my view, to be

satisfied and it is satisfied if the applicant can show a genuine

interest in the matter complained of, and that he comes before

7 [1982] 1 SLR 171

Page 18 of 25

Court as a public-spirited citizen concerned to see that the law is

obeyed in the interest of all, and not merely as a busy body

perhaps with a view to gain cheap publicity. As to whether an

applicant satisfies this second requirement will depend on the

facts of each case.

In Perera vs. Central Freight Bureau of Sri Lanka8 at pg. 89-90, Marsoof

J. stated:

As Lord Denning noted in R vs. Inland Revenue Commissioners ex

p. National Federation of Self Employed and Small Business Ltd.,

(1982) AC 617 English Courts have orchestrated the generous view

that if there is good ground for supposing that a government

department or public authority is transgressing the law, or is about

to transgress it, in a way which offends or injures thousands of

her Majesty's subjects, then anyone of those offended or injured

can draw it to the attention of the court of law and seek to have the

law enforced. In the course of his judgment in the same case, Lord

Diplock observed as followsIt would, in my view, be a grave

lacuna in our system of public law if a pressure group, like the

federation, or even a single public spirited taxpayer, were

prevented by out dated technical rules of locus standi from

bringing the matter to the attention of court to vindicate the rule of

law and get the unlawful conduct stopped."

The rationale for the expanding canvas of locus standi in the

context of certiorari and prohibition was explained by H.W.R.

Wade-Administrative Law (8th Edition) pages 362 to 363 in the

following words-

The prerogative remedies, being of a public character as

emphasized earlier, have always had more liberal rules about

standing than the remedies of private law. Prerogative remedies

8 [2006] 1 SLR 83

Page 19 of 25

are granted at the suit of the Crown, as the titles of the cases

show; and the Crown always has standing to take action against

public authorities, including its own ministers, who act or threaten

to act unlawfully. As Devlin J said: Orders of certiorari and

prohibition are concerned principally with public order, it being the

duty of the High Court to see that inferior courts confine themselves

to their own limited sphere. In the same sense Brett J. had said in

an earlier case that the question in granting prohibition is not

whether the individual suitor has or has not suffered damage, but

is, whether the royal prerogative has been encroached upon by

reason of the prescribed order of administration of justice having

been disobeyed. Consequently the court is prepared to act at the

instance of a mere stranger, though it retains discretion to refuse to

do so if it considers that no good would be done to the public.

Wade further goes on to observe at page 683 that-the House of

Lords is clearly now determined to prevent technicalities from

impeding judicial review so as to protect illegalities and

derelictions committed by public authorities.

Sri Lankan Courts too have been quick to recognize standing of

any citizen to seek relief against public authorities that stray

outside their legitimate bounds.

47. Who can file a writ application? The short answer is - any person (as

defined in section 2(s) of the Interpretation Ordinance) who has

sufficient interest as opposed to the outdated requirement of personal

interest because of the element of public interest.

48. While, answering an important question whether a Trade Union can file

a writ application, Professor Wade (Administrative Law, 9th Edn, at page

686) says that:

Lord Denning added: The court would not listen, of course, to a

mere busybody who was interfering in things which did not

Page 20 of 25

concern him. But it will listen to any one whose interests are

affected by what has been done. The same tendency is

illustrated by the courts willingness to grant certiorari to a trade

union acting on behalf of one of its members [as] in Minister of

Social Security v. Amalgamated Engineering Union [1967] AC 725.

This practice is now common.

If a total stranger can successfully file an application for writ in the

spirit of public interest, why cannot the Petitioner an aggrieved

person, who represents his child affected by the action or inaction of

the Respondents, which is sought to be quashed by certiorari or

ordered to be complied by mandamus, file this writ application?

Therefore, I overrule the preliminary objection regarding standing of the

Petitioner to file this application.

49. Now, what the Petitioner is seeking to do by way of this application is to

obtain a mandate order to the 1st Respondent to comply with the

direction made by the 5th Respondent as reflected in P18.

50. It was submitted by the Petitioner that against the decision of the

Interview Panel and the Appeals and Protest Board to award the

Petitioner only 60 marks notwithstanding the matters placed before the

Appeals Board as mentioned above, the Petitioner tendered a formal

appeal dated 29.12.2013 in terms of clause 11.10 of P1 to the 5th

Respondent - Secretary, Ministry of Education.

51. It was the position of the Petitioner that in terms of Clause 11.10 of P1,

the Secretary to the Ministry of Education has the power of overall

supervision of all matters pertaining to Grade 1 school admissions as

well as the power to resolve any disputes that may arise.

The said clause 11.10 reads thus:

Page 21 of 25

11.10.

.

(Vide page 14 of P1).

52. Therefore, the Petitioner further submitted that the said appeal

preferred to the 5th Respondent is an appeal provided by law and having

considered the appeal made by the Petitioner, the 5th Respondent by

letter dated 20.02.2014-P18 directed the 1st Respondent to admit the

Petitioner to Royal College, Colombo.

53. The contents of the document P18 is reproduced below in its entirety:

, 5. 54. In this matrix, the Petitioner further argued that the said decision of the

5th Respondent has not been challenged by any party and has not been

set aside by any court of competent jurisdiction and is therefore valid

to-date. Thus, the Petitioner contended that the 1st Respondent is

legally obliged to give effect to the said decision of the 5th Respondent

and admit the Petitioner to Royal College, Colombo [vide paragraph 24

of the Petition and page 10 of the written submission tendered by the

Petitioner].

55. Furthermore, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner, invited

this Court to peruse the Supreme Court decision in SC. FR. No.

414/20179, where the Supreme Court upholding a direction made by

the Secretary, Ministry of Education in admitting a child to Grade 6 in

Vishaka Vidyalaya, Colombo in the year of 201910.

9 S.C. Minutes dated 24.01.2019. 10 In this case, Petitioner made an application to Vishaka Vidyalaya, Colombo to admit his child to Grade 1. However, the Principal of Vishaka Vidyalaya (the 1st Respondent) refused the admission of the said child to the Vishaka Vidyalaya. Thereafter, on an appeal made by the Petitioner to the Secretary to the Ministry of Education (the 2nd Respondent) in terms of circular marked P1, the said Secretary made an order that the petitioners child should be admitted to Grade 1 in Vishaka Vidyalaya in the year 2014. However, the 1st Respondent did not comply the direction made by the 2nd Respondent. It was in those circumstances, the Petitioner had complained to SC that his fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) have been infringed by the 1st Respondent when she refused to admit the Petitioners child to Vishaka Vidyalaya, Colombo.

56. It is important to note that, the learned Additional Solicitor General for

Respondent who, inter alia, appearing for the 5th Respondent, in his

statement of objection states that the power of the 5th Respondent

under Clause 11.10 is meant to be exercised in relation to the entire

group of students who are similarly circumstance-more particularly in

relation to applicants who had presented cogent evidence in regard to

residency [vide para. 20(ii) of the statement of objections dated

20.05.2015].

57. It is my view that, as observed by Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva (then he

was) in Haputhantirige and Others vs. Attorney General11 a circular

containing the admission scheme is to be deemed the 'law' governing

admission of children to State schools, as it is a 'binding process of

regulation pertaining to the admission of children to government schools'.

58. It is pertinent to see the following words of Sarath N. Silva C.J., in

Haputhantiriges Case:

It is plain to see that the Circular does not have any of the general

characteristics that pertain to policy. It has a classification of 7

categories, a scheme of weighted marking and a related

identification of documents that could be received in evidence.

From a functional perspective it is the binding process of regulation

laid down by the executive as regards the matter of admission to

Government Schools. On the reasoning stated above it would

constitute the law" within the purview of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution in reference to which the alleged infringement of the

right to equality has to be judged. [Vide pg. 115]

59. Furthermore, Wade, whilst discussing the legal form and characteristics

of Circulars, states that although Circulars have no inherent legal

effect, they may be used as a vehicle for conveying instructions to which

11 [2007] 1 SLR 101

Page 24 of 25

some statute gives legal forceThey may also contain legal advice of

which the courts will take notice.12

60. Therefore, it is imperative that admission of children to Grade 1 of

government schools be necessarily decided upon strictly in terms of this

circular (the applicable 'law') and not determined according to any other

ground, whatsoever. Further, in view of the position taken up by the

learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner, this Court is required to

examine the lawfulness of this 'law' and the accuracy of the application

of the provisions of this 'law' to the merits of the application presented

by the Petitioners to gain admission to Grade 1 of Royal College,

Colombo.

61. I am inclined to the view of the Petitioner that, according to the Clause

10.11 of P1, the Secretary to the Ministry of Education has the power of

supervision of all matters pertaining to Grade 1 school admissions as

well as the power to resolve any disputes that may arise13. Certainly,

also this power includes make necessary directions to his subordinates.

62. It is well recognised rule that when a lawful direction is made, there is a

(mandatory) duty on the subordinate i.e., public officer to comply with

it. No writ or order in the nature of a mandamus would issue when

there is no failure to perform a mandatory duty. Even in cases of

alleged breaches of mandatory duties, the salutary general rule, which

is subject to certain exceptions, applied by our courts, as it is in

England, when a writ of mandamus is asked for, could be stated as I

find it set out in Halsburys Laws of England (3rd Edn.), Vol.13. pg. 106:

As a general rule the order will not be granted unless the party complained of has known what it was he was required to do, so that he had the means of considering whether or not he should comply, and it must be shown by evidence that there was a distinct demand of that which the party seeking the mandamus desires to enforce, and that demand was met by a refusal

12 H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth, Administrative Law, page at 735-736 13 Vide SC. FR. No. 414/2017, S.C. Minutes dated 24.01.2019.

63. In the circumstances, I have no hesitation to conclude that the 1st

Respondents decision not to comply with the direction made by the 5th

Respondent to admit the Petitioner into Grade 1 of Royal College,

Colombo 07 is, to say the least, irrational and unreasonable according

to the standard of unreasonableness would amount to an abuse of

administrative authority set out in Associated Provincial Picture Houses

Ltd. vs. Wednesbury Corporation14. Therefore, the Petitioner is entitled

to the relief-mandamus, as prayed for in the prayer (d) to the Petition.

64. As the instant application was preferred to enter the child,

Senadheerage Hesandu Dilsara to Grade 1 in 2014, he should now be

admitted to Grade 8 in 2021 at Royal College, Colombo 07.

65. Accordingly, this Court issue a writ of mandamus under prayer (d) of

the Petition, against the 1st Respondent to comply with the direction

made by the 5th Respondent, to admit the Petitioner, Senadheerage

Hesandu Dilsara to Grade 8 in 2021, of Royal College, Colombo 07.

66. Considering the circumstances, I make no order for costs.

Application of the Petitioner is partly allowed.
