K. K. A. V. SWARNADHIPATHI, J.

Counsel: Dr. Sunil Coorey with Amila Kiripitige for the Substituted

Defendant-Appellant. H. Withanarachchi with Sahantha Karunadhara for the

Plaintiff-Respondnets. Written Submissions on: 24.08.2020 (by the Defendant-Appellant)

Decided on: 26.03.2021

MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

This is an appeal from the judgment of the learned District Judge of

Kegalle dated 20.02.1997.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff)

instituted action against the Defendant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to

as the Defendant) seeking, inter-alia, for a declaration of title to the

premises morefully described in the schedule to the amended plaint and

the ejectment of the Defendant therefrom1. The Defendant in his answer,

moved for a dismissal of the Plaintiffs action on the footing that he is the

owner of the subject matter as set out in his answer. After trial, the

learned District Judge delivered the impugned judgment in favour of the

Plaintiff as prayed for in the prayers to the plaint. Being aggrieved by the

judgment the instant appeal has been preferred by the Defendant.

When this matter was taken up for argument on 03.02.2021, both

Counsel consented to dispose the matter by way of written submissions.

The grounds of appeal advanced by the Defendant to challenge the

impugned judgment are set out below:

1 Vide page 55-57 of the Appeal breif

Pg. 4 of 9

1. The title of the Plaintiff to the subject matter was not established.

2. The contention of the Plaintiff that the Defendant is in possession of

the subject matter as a licensee was not established.

I shall now deal with the question of title of the Plaintiff to the subject

matter.

There are abundant authorities that a person claiming a declaration of

title must have title himself. According to the existing authorities, the

Plaintiff must show title to the corpus in dispute and that, if he cannot,

the action will not lie.

In Wanigaratne vs. Juvanis Appuhamy 2, it was held that, in a re

vindicatio action the plaintiff must prove and establish his title. He cannot

ask for a declaration of title in his favour merely on the strength that the

defendants title is poor or not established.

In the case of Dharmadasa vs. Jayasena3 it was observed that in a rei

vindicatio action the burden is on the plaintiff to establish the title pleaded

and relied on by him. The defendant need not prove anything.

In Peiris vs. Savunhamy 4 it was held that, where in an action for

declaration of title to land, the defendant is in possession of the land in

dispute, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that he has dominium.

In accordance with the evidence adduced by the Plaintiff, one Siyalis

Appuhamy was the original owner of the corpus. The said Siyalis

Appuhamy, by Deed bearing No. 2057 dated 16.05.1935 marked P3

conveyed his rights to the 4th Plaintiff, Dingiri Banda (1/5), Kiri Banda

(1/5), Bandara Thilake (1/5), Punchi Banda (1/5) and Podi Ralahamy

(1/5). Upon the demise of the said Kiri Banda, his rights devolved on the

aforesaid 4th Plaintiff, Dingiri Banda, Kiri Banda, Bandara Thilake, Punchi

Banda and Podi Ralahamy. On the demise of Bandara Thilake his rights

2 65 NLR 167 3 [1997] 3 SLR 327 4 54 NLR 207

Pg. 5 of 9

devolved on the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th Plaintiffs. On the demise of the said the

Punchi Banda, his rights devolved on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs. The

said Podi Ralahamy transferred his undivided rights to the 5th Plaintiff by

deed bearing No. 1530 dated 24.02.1976 attested by Siyambalapitiya,

Notary Public marked P4. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs became the owner of

the subject matter [Vide Trial proceedings dated 23.09.1992, pg 78-81 of

the Appeal brief].

It is pertinent to note that the title of the Plaintiffs has been well

established with cogent oral and documentary evidence. Hence, the 1st

ground of appeal put forward by the Defendant is devoid of merits.

In a re vindicatio action, once the title is established by the plaintiff, the

burden of proof shifts to the defendant to establish that he has a right to

possession or occupation of the property.

In Siyanemis vs. Jayasinghe Udenis de Silva5, the plaintiff proved that

he had legal title to the property in dispute, but the land was in the

possession of the defendant, who asserted a legal right to possess. The

Privy Council held that the burden of proof in regard to the right of

possession was on the defendant.

In Don Namaratne vs. Don David 6 , S. N. Silva, CJ, (agreeing with

Bandaranayake, J. and Yapa, J.) held that,

The learned Presidents counsel for the Defendant submits that the

plaint is defective since the date on which wrongful possession on the

part of the Defendant commenced is not set out. We cannot agree with

this submission. The owner is entitled to possession of his

property at all times. The rights of others are subject to the

right of ownership. Once the title of the Plaintiff is admitted or

proved, the burden shifts to the Defendant to prove his right to

possess the property. If the Defendant fails to prove the right

Pg. 6 of 9

[Tenancy, licensee superior title] judgment to be entered in favour of

the Plaintiff. In the re-vindicatio action, if the title of the Plaintiff is

admitted by the Defendant, the Defendant should begin the case.

In Sirinivasam Prasanth vs. Nadaraja Devaraja7, recently the Supreme

Court has reiterated the above position as follows:

per Mahinda Samayawardena, J.

In a vindicatory action, the initial burden is on the Plaintiff to prove

title to the property. If he fails to prove title, the Plaintiffs action shall

fail no matter how weak the case of the Defendant is. However, once

the paper title to the property is accepted by the Defendant or proved

by the Plaintiff, the burden shifts to the Defendant to prove on what

right he is in possession of the property.

Let me add this for clarity. The right to possession and the right to

recover possession are essential attributes of ownership of immovable

property. The owner is entitled to these as of right. The law does not

require that the owner must possess his property. That is his choice.

He can either possess it or leave it as it is. In simple terms, merely

because the owner does not possess the property, he does not lose

ownership of the property.8

Having framed the issues No. 16 and 17, the Defendant took up the

position that one Palihenage Mudiyanse had obtained a prescriptive title

to the subject matter, and thereupon by Deed bearing No. 15 dated

24.11.1975 attested by D.H. Seniviratne, Notary Public marked V1, the

said Palihenage Mudiyanse conveyed his rights to the Defendant.

Therefore, there is a burden cast upon the Defendant to establish the

purported prescriptive title of his predecessor in title, namely Palihenage

Mudiyanse, with strong and cogent evidence as required in Section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance. It is pertinent to note that the Defendant

7 SC Appeal No. 163/2019, SC Minutes of 22.03.2021. 8 See pg. 6-7

Pg. 7 of 9

failed to adduce acceptable oral or documentary evidence to prove the said

prescriptive title. Thus, the learned trial Judge has rightly declined to

accept the bare oral statement of the Defendant in proof of the said

purported prescriptive title to the subject matter.

In C. Abeykoon vs. P.N.A. Peries and Others9, Prasanna Jayawardena,

PC, J. (agreeing with Malalgoda, PC, J. and Dehideniya, J.) observed that,

It is a well-established principle of law that, so long as a person

possesses a property as the licensee or agent of the owner, that

person cannot acquire prescriptive title to that property. Instead, the

running of prescription can commence only upon the licensee or agent

committing some overt act which demonstrates that he has cast

aside his subordinate character and is now possessing the property

adverse to or independent of the owner of the property and without

acknowledging any right of the owner of the property. The overt act is

required to give (or deemed to give) notice to the owner that his

erstwhile licensee or agent is no longer holding the property in the

capacity of a licensee or agent and is, from that time onwards,

claiming to possess property adverse to or independent of the owner.

The overt act makes the owner aware (or is deemed to make him

aware) that he runs the risk of losing title to the property if the

licensee or agent complete ten years of such adverse or independent

possession and acquires prescriptive title to the property.10

In Jayaneris vs. Somawathi11, Weeramantry, J. observed that, clear

and cogent evidence and a high order of proof is required to establish

adverse possession where an agent or a licensee claims prescriptive title

against the owner who placed him in possession of the property.

Pg. 8 of 9

In the case of Sirajudeen vs. Abbas12, the Supreme Court held that,

Where the evidence of possession lacked consistency, the fact of

occupation alone or the payment of Municipal rates by itself is

insufficient to establish prescriptive possession.

Where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to

immovable property, the burden of proof rests squarely and fairly on

him to establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of

prescriptive rights.

A facile story of walking into abandoned premises after the Japanese

air raid constitutes material far too slender to found a claim based on

prescriptive title.

As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general

statements of witnesses that the Plaintiff possessed the land in

dispute for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive period are

not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession necessary

to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses

should speak to specific facts and the question of possession has to

be decided thereupon by Court.

One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as

provided for in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance is proof of

possession by a title adverse to or independent of that of the claimant

or Plaintiff. The occupation of the premises must be of such character

as is incompatible with the title of the owner.

Having scrutinized the evidence adduced by the Defendant, it is well

established that the Defendant in this case totally failed to prove the

purported prescriptive title of his predecessor in title. Therefore, the

Defendant cannot claim title by deed marked V1.

12 [1994] 2 SLR 365

Pg. 9 of 9

Moreover, though the Defendant took up the position that his predecessor

in title, namely Palihenage Mudiyanse obtained title by way of

prescription, in terms of his purported title deed marked V1, the latter

obtained title by way of paternal inheritance. Hence, it appears to this

Court that the title pleaded by the Defendant is defective.

As the Defendant failed to establish any acceptable legal grounds to

possess the subject matter in suit, he is liable to be ejected from the same

and the Plaintiffs are entitled for a judgment as prayed for in the prayers

to the plaint as enunciated by the Supreme Court in Namaratnes case13.

In the circumstances, the 2nd ground of appeal advanced by the Defendant

is also devoid of merits.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no basis to interfere with the judgment of

the learned District Judge of Kegalle dated 20.02.1997.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/- and

the impugned judgment is affirmed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to dispatch a copy of this Judgment

along with the original case record to the District Court of Kegalle.

Appeal dismissed.
