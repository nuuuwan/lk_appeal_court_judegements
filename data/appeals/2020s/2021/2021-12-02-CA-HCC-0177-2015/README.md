R. Gurusinghe, J.

The accused-appellant (the appellant) was indicted together with thirteen others

in the High Court of Kandy with others unknown to the prosecution on the 5th

of December 2001 for;

a) being members of an unlawful assembly having a common object of using

criminal force against those employed at the polling station of the

Superintendent's office, in Galaha Estate, an offence punishable under

section 140 of the Penal Code;

b) during the course of the same transaction, inserting unauthorized ballot

papers into a ballot box and thus committing an offence punishable under

section 66 of the Parliamentary Elections Act No. 1 of 1980 read with

section 146 of the Penal Code and;

c) causing mischief while being members of the said unlawful assembly, an

offence punishable under section 410 read with section 146 of the Penal

Code.

There were two other counts of which the appellant was discharged.

At the closure of the prosecution case, the Trial Judge acting in terms of section

200 of the Criminal Procedure Code, acquitted all other accused persons, other

than the appellant, on the basis that identification of the others was in doubt.

The appellant made a dock statement and called two witnesses. Then the

appellant was convicted for counts one, two, and three and discharged of counts

four and five, and sentenced to six months for the first charge and one year each

for the second and third charges.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment and sentence, the appellant preferred this

appeal.

4

The grounds of appeal are as follows:

1) The conviction on count two of the indictment is illegal as the charge

is contrary to law.

2) The Learned Trial Judge has made use of the evidence rejected in

acquitting the second to the fourteenth accused in order to convict

the first accused-appellant.

3) There has been no adequate analysis of the evidence of the

prosecution and the infirmities. The evidence of the defense

witnesses has not been considered before acting upon them, causing

prejudice to the appellant.

4) The Learned Trial Judge has not considered the ingredients

necessary to establish the offence of unlawful assembly and the

basis of imposition of liability on membership of the unlawful

assembly.

5) The Learned Trial Judge has proceeded in the misconception that

the accused owed an explanation in the light of the evidence led by

the prosecution and that the dock statement of the appellant

strengthens the case for the prosecution.

Counsel for the appellant argued that membership of an unlawful assembly

could only be made on the basis of imposing vicarious liability in respect of an

offence punishable under the Penal Code. Further, it was argued that in section

38 of the Penal Code, the term 'offence' denotes a thing punishable under the

Penal Code. The appellant was convicted for an offence under section 66 of the

Parliamentary Elections Act No. 01 of 1981(Parliamentary Elections Act), read

with section 146 of the Penal Code. Counsel further submitted that section 146

of the Penal Code does not refer to sub-sections 2 and 3 of section 38.

5

Sub-section 3 of section 38 of the Penal Code expressly refers to section 138,

which is the definitive section with regard to an unlawful assembly.

Section 38 of the Penal Code provides that;

'38. (1) Except in the Chapter and sections mentioned in subsections (2) and (3),

the word 'offence' denotes a thing made punishable by this Code.

(2) In Chapter IV, and in the following sections, namely, sections 67, 100, 101,

101A, 102, 103, 105, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 113A 113B, 184, 191,

192, 200, 208, 210, 211, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 338,

339, 377, 378, and 431, the word " offence " denotes a thing punishable in Sri

Lanka under this Code, or under any law other than this Code.

(3) And in sections 138, 174, 175, 198, 199, 209, 213, and 427, the word

"offence" has the same meaning as in subsection (2) when the thing punishable

under any law other than this Code is punishable under such law with

imprisonment for a term of six months or upwards, whether with or without fine.'

The provision in section 38 is plain and unambiguous. The general rule of

interpretation is that when the meaning of a provision is plain and literal, its

ordinary and grammatical meaning must be given to it.

In M/s. Hiralal Ratanlal vs. STO, AIR 1973 SC 1034, the Supreme Court of India

observed that;

"In construing a statutory provision, the first and foremost rule of construction

is the literary construction. All that the Court has to see at the very outset is

what does the provision say. If the provision is unambiguous and if from the

provision the legislative intent is clear, the Court need not call into aid the other

rules of construction of statutes. The other rules of construction are called into

aid only when the legislative intent is not clear."

6

The following well-known passage from the speech of Lord Atkinson in Vuchet &

Sons Ltd. v. London Society of Compositors [I913] A.C. 107 is formally consistent

with a restricted form of the golden rule.

Lord Atkinson stated that;

"If the language of a statute be plain, admitting of only one meaning, the

Legislature must be taken to have meant and intended what it has plainly

expressed, and whatever it has in clear terms enacted must be enforced though

it should lead to absurd or mischievous results. If the language of this sub-

section be not controlled by some of the other provisions of the statute, it must,

since its language is plain and unambiguous, be enforced, and your Lordships'

House sitting judicially is not concerned with the question whether the policy it

embodies is wise or unwise, or whether it leads to consequences just or unjust,

beneficial or mischievous."

Maxwell, on the Interpretation of Statutes twelfth edition page 36, states;

'A construction which would leave without effect any part of the language of a

statute will normally be rejected.'

In Khan vs. Ariyadasa 65 NLR 29, it was held that;

"Section 146 of the Penal Code creates an offence, but the punishment must

depend on the offence which the offender is made guilty by that section.

Therefore, then appropriate punishment sections must be read with it."

The word 'offence' used in sub-section 3 of section 38 is committed if the thing

is punishable only under the law, other than the Penal Code, with imprisonment

of a term of six months or upward with or without a fine. Although sub-section

3 of section 38 does not explicitly refer to section 146 of the Penal Code, by

referring to the definitive section 138, it encompasses all sections up to section

155. Sections 138 and 427 are not penal sections. As the provisions in section

7

38 of the Penal Code are plain and unambiguous, the literal meaning of the

provision should be given effect.

Accordingly, the offences described in section 66 of the Parliamentary Elections

Act are within the meaning of 'offence' envisaged in subsection 3 of section 38 of

the Penal Code. Thus, if the argument of the appellant is accepted, then a

substantial part of section 38 would become redundant. That is against the

aforementioned rules of interpretation.

Therefore, the prescribed sentence in section 66 of the Parliamentary Elections

Act, that is, imprisonment of either description up to two years on a conviction

of offences, falls under the ambit of sub-section 3 of section 38 of the Penal Code

and the argument of the counsel for the appellant cannot be sustained.

As such, the first ground of appeal is rejected.

The next argument is that the Learned Trial Judge made use of the evidence

rejected in acquitting the second to fourteenth accused to convict the first

accused-appellant. It was the contention for the appellant that PW3 had

identified most of the acquitted accused as persons who actively participated in

the incident upon which unlawful assembly charges were based. It was further

argued that this witness identified the ninth accused as the person who took the

sealed ballot box out of the station and dashed it on the ground.

Citing the case of Queen vs. Wellasamy 63 NLR 265, counsel for the appellant

argued that the evidence rejected in respect of one accused could not be relied

upon to convict another.

Several witnesses established the identity of the appellant. As argued for the

appellant, even if the evidence of PW3 is considered unreliable, there still exists

sufficient evidence to support the conviction.

8

PW5 was the station polling officer. He had identified the appellant and described

the illegal acts done by the appellant. PW5 is a public officer and had no

resentment towards the appellant. There is no reason to disbelieve the evidence

of PW5. Some omissions that are not significant were marked, but there were no

contradictions at all.

In the judgment of Wickremasuriya vs. Dedoleena and Others 1996 2 Sri LR 95.,

Jayasuriya J. cited the Indian authority, State of Uttar Pradesh v. Anthony 1985

AIR 48 (SC), which states that;

"The important principle and rule of caution was laid down that a witness should

not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies and omissions."

Considering the above, the evidence of PW5 cannot be rejected. If the evidence

of PW5 is not rejected, there is no option but to convict the appellant to the

offences the Learned High Court Judge found him guilty of. The evidence made

to discharge the second to the fourteenth accused was not used to convict the

appellant. The evidence disbelieved in respect of one offence was not made used

to convict the appellant. Therefore, the second ground of appeal cannot be

sustained.

In the course of her judgment, the Learned Trial Judge considered the effect of

a contradiction and omission regarding the testimonial trustworthiness of each

witness. The judgment expresses that the Learned Trial Judge has applied the

relevant test of demeanour consistency and probability in analyzing the evidence

of the witnesses.

In the case of Munasinghe vs. Vidanage 69 NLR 97, the Privy Council observed

as follows;

"In reviewing such findings of fact, the proper approach of an appellate tribunal

is as stated in the speeches of the House of Lords in Watt or Thomas v. Thomas

[1947] A.C. 484 (H.L.). Viscount Simon said at pp. 485-6.

9

"Apart from the class of case in which the powers of the Court of Appeal are

limited to deciding a question of law (for example, on a case stated or on an

appeal under the County Courts Acts), an appellate court has, of course,

jurisdiction to review the record of the evidence in order to determine whether

the conclusion originally reached upon that evidence should stand; but this

jurisdiction has to be exercised with caution. If there is no evidence to support a

particular conclusion (and this is really a question of law) the appellate Court

will not hesitate so to decide. But if the evidence as a whole can reasonably be

regarded as justifying the conclusion arrived at the trial, and especially if that

conclusion has been arrived at on conflicting testimony by a tribunal which saw

and heard the witnesses, the appellate Court will bear in mind that it has not

enjoyed this opportunity and that the view of the trial judge as to where

credibility lies is entitled to great weight. This is not to say that the judge of the

first instance can be treated as infallible in determining which side is telling the

truth or is refraining from exaggeration. Like other tribunals, he may go wrong

on a question of fact, but it is a cogent circumstance that a judge of first instance,

when estimating the value of verbal testimony, has the advantage (which is

denied to courts of appeal) of having the witnesses before him and observing the

manner in which their evidence is given.""

In the case of Bhagwati and Ors. vs. The State of Uttar Pradesh on 8 April, 1976

AIR 1976 SC 1449, the Supreme Court of India stated as follows regarding

decisions reached by the Trial Judge on facts;

"6. It is well-settled by the decisions of this Court including Mathai Mathews v.

State of Maharashtra that the power of an appellate court to review evidence in

appeals against acquittals is as extensive as its power in appeals against

convictions, and that before an appellate court can set aside an order of acquittal

it must carefully consider the reasons given by the trial Court in support of its

decision and give its own reasons for rejecting them. Thus, if the finding reached

10

by the trial Judge cannot be said to be unreasonable, the appellate Court should

not disturb it even if it were possible to reach a different conclusion on the basis

of the material on the record. This has been held to be so because the trial Judge

has the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses and the initial

presumption of innocence in favour of the accused is not weakened by his

acquittal. The appellate Court therefore should be slow in disturbing the finding

of fact of the trial Court, and if two views are reasonably possible of the evidence

on the record, it is not expected to interfere simply because it feels that it would

have taken a different view if the case had been tried by it. Mr. Anthony has

made a reference in this connection to the decision in Labh Singh v. State of

Punjab also. The question therefore is whether it could be said that the finding

reached by trial Judge was unreasonable, or whether the view taken by him was

a reasonably possible view of the evidence on the record."

In the case of Attorney General vs. Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa, [2011] 2 Sri

LR 292, the Supreme Court stated that;

"There is simply no jurisdiction in an appellate court to upset trial findings of

fact that have evidentiary support. A court of appeal improperly substitutes its

view of the facts of a case when it seeks for whatever reason to replace those

made by the trial judge. It is also to be noted that state is not obliged to disprove

every speculative scenario consistent with the innocence of an accused R v. Paul

[1977]1 SCR 181."

When considering the evidence of this case, we find that there is sufficient

evidence to support the conviction. Therefore, the argument that the evidence

was not adequately analysed and weighed cannot be accepted.

The Learned Trial Judge has had at the commencement of her judgment given

her attention to the applicable laws and the ingredients of each offence alleged

to have been committed by the appellant (page 56 of the judgment).

11

The appellant's involvement in committing the offences was considered on pages

32 and 33 of the judgment. There is clear evidence that the appellant entered

the polling station and, through intimidation of the officials, obtained the ballot

papers forcibly and ordered the other members of that unlawful assembly to stuff

the ballot boxes with the unauthorized ballot papers. He was there until the

others completed that task.

Although the rest of the accused persons, except for the appellant, were

acquitted, their acquittal was due to doubt as to their identification.

Nevertheless, the evidence shows that there were sufficient number of people to

form an unlawful assembly. The appellant was an active participant and the

leader of that unlawful assembly. The evidence also shows that there were more

than five people using criminal force to carry out illegal activities under the

direction of the appellant. Under these circumstances, the fourth ground of

appeal raised by the appellant cannot be accepted. The fourth ground of appeal

is rejected.

The Learned Trial Judge has evaluated the dock statement made by the appellant

and the evidence called by the defense. The appellant's position is that he came

to the Galaha polling station alone and spoke to the officer at the polling station,

and left the place peacefully. The appellant states that there was no incident as

alleged by the prosecution.

The Trial Judge observed that this is a mere total denial. The Trial Judge stated

that the appellant had no burden to prove his innocence. However, in the light

of overwhelming evidence against the appellant, the appellant chose only to

admit his presence and deny every other incident that had taken place.

When considering the totality of the evidence, the Trial Judge has rejected the

defense evidence. There is sufficient evidence to support the conviction of the

appellant. We see no reason to interfere with the findings of the Trial Judge in

this regard.

12

For the reasons stated above, the conviction of the appellant is affirmed, and the

appeal is dismissed.

However, the incident in this case had happened twenty years ago. The appellant

had to bear the torment of this case for the last twenty years. The appellant has

no previous convictions and is in an advanced age. Taking these reasons into

consideration, the sentence of two and a half years is reduced to two years and

suspended for five years with effect from the date of this judgement, that is 02nd

of December, 2021.

High Court Judge of Kandy is directed to implement this judgment as provided

in section 303 of the Criminal Procedure Code.Registrar is directed to send a

copy of this Judgemnt to the High Court Kandy along with the main case record

forthwith.
