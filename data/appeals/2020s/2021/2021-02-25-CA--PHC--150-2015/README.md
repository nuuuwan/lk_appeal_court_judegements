JUDGMENT

The Petitioner- Appellant was employed as a store manager at the 2nd Respondent-

Respondent, Kundasale Multipurpose Co-Operative Society Limited. Apparently, there was a

dispute between the Petitioner-Appellant and the 2nd Respondent-Respondent Society over an

alleged shortage of goods worth of Rs. 973,762.45 during the period of 1.03.1984 - 21.12.2010.

The said dispute was referred to the 1st Respondent-Respondent Commissioner by the 2nd

Respondent society to recover sum of Rs. 973,762.45 from the Petitioner-Appellant.

Page 4 of 13

The 1st Respondent-Respondent Commissioner has referred the said dispute to an

arbitration before the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Arbitrator in terms of Section 58 (2) (b) of the

Co-operative Societies Law No. 05 of 1972.

Thereafter, the 3rd Respondent-Arbitrator had inquired into the matter and held that the

Petitioner-Appellant should pay a sum of Rs. 765,512.42 to the 2nd Respondent Society.

Being aggrieved by the said award of the Arbitrator, the Petitioner-Appellant has

preferred an Appeal to the 1st Respondent-Commissioner in terms of Section 58 (2) of the Co-

operative Convention of No. 04 of 1993 of the Central Province.

It appears that the 1st Respondent-Respondent Commissioner had rejected the said

Appeal in terms of Rule 49 (xii) (b) of the Co-operative Rules 1973, published in the Extra

Ordinary Gazette No 93/5 dated 10.01.1974 made under Section 61 of the Co-operative Societies

Law No. 05 of 1972, for failing to submit the Appeal deposit as prescribed by Rule 49 (xii) (a) of

the Co-operative Rules 1973.

Subsequently, the Petitioner-Appellant has invoked the Jurisdiction of the High Court of

the Central Province holden in Kandy seeking to quash the 1st Respondent Commissioners said

decision by way of a Writ Application bearing No 25/2013 seeking a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the decision of the 1st Respondent Commissioner and also a Writ of Mandamus to compel

the 1st Respondent Commissioner to consider the Appeal.

However, on the basis for failing to submit the Appeal deposit as prescribed by Rule 49

(xii) (a) of the Co-operative society rules of 1993. The Provincial High Court of the Central

Province dismissed the Petitioners said application.

Page 5 of 13

It was the position taken up by the Petitioner-Appellant before us that the only ground for

the dismissal of the Writ application of the Petitioner-Appellant by the Provincial High Court is

that it is bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court in S.C Appeal bearing No. 58/80 in re

Somaratne Vs. Premachandra and the Court of Appeal decision in C.A Application bearing No.

889/2000 in Jayasuriya Vs. Seemasahitha Mitipola Sakasuruwamkarana and Naya ganudenu

Pilibanda samupakara samithiya.

Nevertheless, the Petitioner-Appellant urged Court that the Provincial High Court has not

drawn any attention to the Supreme Court Judgment in S.C Appeal bearing No. 57/1988 in

Sebastian Fernando vs. Multi-purpose Co-operative Society Ltd. and others reported in 1990

(1) S.L.R 342.

It was submitted on behalf of the Petitioner-Appellant that when deciding Sebastian

Fernandos Case, the Supreme Court also considered the S.C Appeal 58/80 S.C.M 28.07.1981

Somaratne Vs. Premachandras Case.

It was stated in Sebastian Fernandos case that there is a serious question that arises as

to the ultra vires of Rule 49 (xii) (a) that the requirement of an Appeal deposit is not authorised

by Section 58 (3), 61 (1), 61 (2) (y). Their Lordships further stated that the said question is to be

determined by the Court of Appeal itself.

Therefore, it was submitted that without considering the said vital position, it is unjust to

dismiss the Petition of the Appellant by the Provincial High Court just only depending on the

Judgments of Somaratne Vs. Premachandra and the Court of Appeal Judgment of Jayasuriya

Vs. Seemasahitha Mitipola Sakasuruwamkarana and Naya ganudenu Pilibanda samupakara

samithiya (supra) as Ratio Decedendi.

Page 6 of 13

The Petitioner-Appellant urged Court that in view of the Sebastian Fernandos Case, the

Court of Appeal has the duty to consider the serious question arising as to the vires of Rule 49

(xii) (a) that the requirement of an appeal deposit is not authorised by Section 58 (3), 61 (1), 61

(2) (y). Invariably, this decision is also relevant to the Provincial High Court. Nevertheless, the

Provincial High Court had not considered the said position and just depended on the difference

of Ratio Decidendi and Obiter Dicta.

Furthermore, it was submitted by the Petitioner-Appellant that it is extremely unjust to

impose a 10% of the award as a pre-requisite for the exercise of the right of Appeal and forfeit

the said 10% and credit to the consolidated fund if the Registrar satisfied that the Appellant had

no reasonable grounds to Appeal. Thus, this is a complete deprivation of the right of Appeal for

an aggrieved party prejudiced by an arbitrary decision of the Registrar.

As such, it was contended that Rule 49 (xii) (b) of the Co-operative societies Law is ultra

vires and sought relief prayed in the Petition of Appeal.

It is worthy to note that the Petitioner-Appellant has preferred this Appeal against the

award of the 3rd Respondent-Arbitrator, who inquired into the dispute that arose between the

Petitioner-Appellant and the 2nd Respondent- Society with regard to the shortage of goods worth

of Rs. 973,762.45. After the inquiry, the 3rd Respondent- Arbitrator has made an award for Rs.

765,512.42 to be recovered from the Petitioner-Appellant.

However, the 1st Respondent Commissioner rejected the said Appeal of the Petitioner -

Appellant under Rule 49 (xii) (b) of the Co-operative Societies Rules 1973, published in the

Extraordinary Government Gazette No. 93/5 dated 10.01.1974 made under Section 61 of the Co-

operative Societies Law No. 05 of 1972.

Page 7 of 13

Rule 49 (xii) (a) and (b) reads as follows;

(a) Every appeal to the Registrar from an award of an Arbitrator or a panel of Arbitrators

shall be made within 30 days from the date of the award by a written statement setting out the

grounds of appeal. Every such appeal shall be forwarded to the Registrar with an appeal deposit

of Rs. 50 or 10% of the sum awarded where the appeal is made by the party against whom the

award has been made and by Rs. 50 or 10% of the sum claimed in the dispute where the appeal is

made by the party claiming any sum of money, whichever sum is the higher sum in either case.

(b) An appeal not made in conformity with the above shall be rejected by the Registrar.

It is noteworthy that in terms of the said Rule, a person preferring an Appeal against an

award of an Arbitrator is mandated to deposit an amount of Rs. 50 or 10% of the Arbitrators

award, which is higher.

Apparently, the Petitioner-Appellant has failed to deposit the required amount as

stipulated by the said rule when he was preferring the Appeal to the 1st Respondent-

Commissioner.

In this respect, it was submitted on behalf of the 2nd Respondent-Society that in the case

of Sebastian Fernando Vs. Multi-purpose Co-operative Society Ltd. and others, the Supreme

Court only made certain observations as to the legality of the Rule 49 (xii) thus their

observations merely constitute an Obiter and do not have any binding authority on lower

Courts.

However, it was argued on behalf of the Petitioner-Appellant that in Sebastian

Fernandos case, the Supreme Court very clearly stated that there is a serious question that

Page 8 of 13

arises as to the vires of Rule 49 (xii) (a) that the requirement of an Appeal, deposit is not

authorised by Section 58 (3), 61 (1), 61 (2) (y). Furthermore, it was stated that the question is to

be determined by the Court of Appeal itself.

As such, the Petitioner-Appellant submitted that without considering the said position, it

is unjust to dismiss the Petition of the Petitioner-Appellant by the Provincial High Court just

only depending on the Judgments of S.C Appeal 50/1980 Somaratne Vs. Premachandra and

the Judgment by the Court of Appeal C.A. Application No. 889/2000 Jayasuriya Vs.

Seemasahitha Mitipola Sakasuruwamkarana and Naya ganudenu Pilibanda samupakara

samithiya as Ratio Decedendi.

This aspect of Law has been properly analysed and emphasized in the case of CA PHC

12/2014 W.D.M Lokbanda Dissanayake Vs. G. Weerasekere and three others, by His

Lordship Janak De Silva as follows;

In Sebastians Fernandos case (Supra) Fernando J stated (at page 349):

Thus, a serious question arises as to the vires of Rules 49 (xii) (a) that the requirement of

an appeal deposit is not authorised by sections 58 (3), 61 (1) or 61 (2) (y). However, as that

question was not placed before the Court of Appeal for consideration, and as the

Respondents were not heard in that Court (nor in this Court, though duly noticed) it is only

proper that it should be determined by that Court, after such amendment of the Petition as

that Court may permit in its discretion and after hearing the Respondents.

Kulatunga J. echoed similar sentiments and held (at page 360):

Page 9 of 13

For the above reasons I am of the view that a serious question arises as to the vires of

Rules 49 (xii) (a). This question as not raised in the Appellants application to the Court of

Appeal but only in this Court; Leave was allowed on that ground and the question was

argued without the Respondents being heard. As such it is only proper that a determination

on that ground should be made by the Court of Appeal after such amendment of the Petition

as that Court may permit in its discretion.

Clearly the Supreme Court left the vires of Rule 49 (xii) (a) to be considered by the Court

of Appeal. It was observed by His Lordship Justice Janak De Silva that when the matter was sent

back to the Court of Appeal, the State had given an undertaking to Court that the Registrar of

Co-operative Development notwithstanding the insufficiency of fees will entertain the Petition of

Appeal dated 21.03.1983. In view of this undertaking the Petitioner withdrew his application and

hence the Court of Appeal did not make a finding on the vires of Rules 49 (xii) (a) as directed by

the Supreme Court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant relied strongly on the Supreme Court decision in

Sebastian Fernando V. Katana Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd. and others [(1990) 1

S.L.R. 342] and submitted that the Supreme Court had analysed the legality of Rule 49 (xii) (a)

exhaustively and held that the said rule is ultra vires. It is true that the Supreme Court did make

a detailed analysis of Rule 49 (xii) (a). However, the Supreme Court did not declare it to be

ultra vires.

Rule 49 (xii) (a) was made under the Co-operative Societies Law No. 05 of 1972 by the

relevant Minister of the Central Government. He was exercising a power given under a Law in

the whole country and not only within the Central Province. Hence it could not have been the

Page 10 of 13

subject matter of a direct attack as to its vires in the Provincial High Court of the Central

Province by way of Judicial review. There is a general rule in the construction of statutes that

what a court or person is prohibited from doing directly, it may not do indirectly or in a

circuitous manner [Lex Non Cogit Ad Imposibilia]. Therefore, His Lordship emphasized that the

vires of Rule 49 (xii) (a) is not open for collateral attack in proceedings before the Provincial

High Court. This finding is sufficient to reject the argument made by the Learned Counsel for the

Appellant on the vires of Rule 49 (xii) (a).

In this respect, it is worthy to note the decision of the Supreme Court in Somaratne Vs.

Premachandra, Commissioner of Co-operative Societies and others (supra) where Ismail J.

(with Wanasundera J. and Ratwatte J. agreeing) held, I quote;

I am therefore of the view that Rule 49 (xii) (a) is the rule that has been framed under

Section 61 (2) by the Minister and does not circumscribe the right of appeal granted under

Section 58 (3) of the Law as the rule making powers of the Minister entitles the Minister

in terms of the Law to prescribe forms, fees to be paid and procedure to be observed.

In view of Sebastian Fernandos case (supra) Fernando J. and Kulatunga J. had

considered the ruling in Somaratnes case (supra) as to the vires of Rule 49 (xii) (a) as Obiter.

In this instance, it is worthy to note the distinction between the Ratio Decidendi and

the Obiter Dicta of a Judgment.

The Blacks Law Dictionary 10th Edition defines, Obiter dictum as a Judicial comment

made while delivering a judicial opinion, but one that is unnecessary to the decision in the case

and therefore not precedential (although it may be not considered persuasive).

Page 11 of 13

Strictly speaking an Obiter dictum is a remark made or opinion expressed by a Judge,

in his decision upon a cause, by the way that is, incidentally or collaterally, and not directly

upon the question before the Court; or it is any statement of Law enunciated by the Judge or

Court merely by way of illustration, argument, analogy or suggestion In the common speech

of Lawyers, all such extrajudicial expressions of legal opinion are referred to as dicta or

Obiter dicta these two terms being used interchangeably.

According to the Blacks Law Dictionary 10th Edition, Ratio Decendi is defined as

follows; The phrase the Ratio Decidendi of a case is slightly ambiguous. It may mean either

(1) the rule that the Judge who decided the case intended to lay down and apply to the facts, or

(2) the rule that a latter Court conceded him to have had the power to lay down.

His Lordship Justice Janak De Silva cited Rupert Cross in precedents in the English Law

(3rd ed-1977) in the W.D.M Lokbandas Case and has observed that distinction can be drawn

between a different kind of dicta;

a. Dicta which are irrelevant to the case in which they occur [which he identifies as

obiter dicta.]

b. Dicta which relate to some collateral issue in the case although not forming part of

the ratio decidendi [which identifies as Judicial dicta. Page 85.

Apparently, this classification suggests that Judicial dicta have a higher level of authority

than mere obiter dicta.

Page 12 of 13

As such, His Lordship that dicta in Somaratnes case (supra) amounts to Judicial dicta

and further held that the Judicial dicta in Somaratnes case (supra) and held that to be intra vires

and not ultra vires.

It is pertinent to note that in S.C Appeal 58/80 [Somaratnes case (supra)], delivered on

28.07.1981, where Justice Ismail emphasized that;

I am of the view that Rule 49 (xii) (a) is not ultra vires the rule making powers conferred

on the Minister, particularly since under Section 58 (3) provides the period within which an

appeal may be filed can be prescribed by the rules.

In terms of the said Rule 49 (xii) (a) and (b), a person appealing against an award of an

Arbitrator is mandated to deposit an amount of Rs. 50 or 10% of the Arbitrators award,

whichever is higher. In Fernandos Case, it was emphasized by Kulatunge J. agreeing with

Fernando J. that, this rule may discourage and even prevent appeals made bona fide and upon

good grounds solely because an Appellant does not have the means of making the required

appeal deposit. However, the Appellant when submitting the Appeal to the 1st Respondent has

failed to deposit the required amount as stipulated by the said rule.

Therefore, the 1st Respondent by letter marked P7, rejected the Appellants appeal on the

basis that the Appellant has failed to deposit 10% of the value of the award of the Arbitrator

under Rule 49 (xii) (b) of the Co-operative rules, made under Section 72 (2) of the Co-operative

Statutes of the Central Provincial Council No. 10 of 1990, as amended by statute No. 04 of 1993,

which is not ultra vires.

Page 13 of 13

Hence, in the circumstances, it is my considered view that the application of the

Petitioner-Appellant for a Writ of Certiorari and Mandamus is without merit.

In view of the foregoing reasons, we see no reason for us to interfere with the Order of

the Learned High Court Judge of the Central Province holden in Kandy dated 11.09.2015.

Thus, the Appeal is dismissed with costs.
