Iddawala J.-

The petitioner-petitioner ter referred as the petitioner) had

invoked revisionary jurisdiction f this Court conferred under Article

138 of the Constitution seeking t set aside an Order of the High Court

of Colombo in 4027/2007 pertai ing to the confiscation of the property

claimed by him.

Attorney General filed an indict ent in the High Court of Colombo on

18.09.2007 against the 1st accus d respondent respondent (hereinafter

referred as the 1st accused resp ndent) and 13 others under Offences

Against Public Property Act, No 12 of 1982. There were 34 counts

against the 1 st accused responde t and he pleaded guilty for all counts.

On 08.05.2014 he was sentence for 3 years for each count, and the

sentences to run concurrent!. In addition, a fine of Rupees

11,988,024,454.00 which is equ val en t to the three times value of the

amount referred to in the indict ent was imposed on the 1st accused

respondent. He was given time ill 06.06.2014 to pay that fine. The

learned High Court Judge ordere that if the fine was not paid the Court

would consider forfeiting the pr perties belonging to the 1 st accused

respondent to the State and the alue so imposed would be recovered

in terms of Section 6 of the Offe ces Against Public Property Act. On

06.06.2014, the 1st accused resp ndent informed the Court that he is

not in a position to pay the fine 0 imposed. Then the Court made an

Order to forfeit the properties in the name of 1 st accused respondent

and the properties purchased by im in the names of his relatives. The

Attorney General submitted a list of assets belonging to the 1 st accused

respondent and purchased by h m or purchased in the names of his

relatives. In this list, the land d the building at No.130, Stanley

Thilakaratne Mawatha, Nugego a claimed by the petitioner was

included as the 4 th item. This is arked as PIC.

CA (PHC) APN 154/2017 Page 4 of 9 10/03/2021

The petitioner claimed that he p rchased this property on 0 l.12.2005

by Deed No. 3125 attested by D mika D. Yapa, Notary Public for a

valuable consideration of Rupees 13 million. The petitioner stated that

he became aware of the forfeitur of his land which he purchased bona

fide and for valuable considerati n, pursuant to an Order made in the

High Court of Colombo Case o. 4027/2007 after seeing a notice

published in the newspapers. T e petitioner stated that the said Order

had been made without any inti ation to him, or the petitioner being

given an opportunity to show ca se why the said property should not

be forfeited. Thereafter he filed an application in the High Court on

06.08.2014 and brought to the n tice of the learned High Court Judge

that the said Order pertaining to the confiscation of the property is per

incuriam and pleaded that th said Order be set aside and an

opportunity to be given to him 0 prove his claim. The learned High

Court Judge dismissed the petif ner's application by his Order dated

25.08.2017. Aggrieved by the said Order the petitioner filed this

application by way of a revision i this Court.

In the written submissions fil d by the Counsel on behalf of the

Attorney General acceded the re ief (f) prayed by the petitioner in his

present application, i.e. - for the High Court Judge to hold an inquiry

as to whether the property be onging to the petitioner should be

forfeited.

Petitioner claimed that he p rchased this subject property on

01 .12.2005 from one Nigamuni D yawathie Mendis Abysekera (mother-

in-law of the 1st accused-respon ent), whereas the indictment of the

original case was served on 18.0 .2007.

Section 6 of the Offences again t Public Property Act, No. 12 of 1982

states:

"Where any fine imposed n any person under sections

2,3,4,5, or lOis in default the court may order all such

property of the defaulter, ovable or immovable, as it

considers equivalent in valu to the amount of such fine to

be forfeited to the Republi and any sum realized on the

sale of such property whic is in excess of the amount of

such fine shall be refunded 0 such person.

It is clear in this Section that it oes not prescribe for an inquiry or for

any special proceedings to be t en by the trial judge before ordering

the confiscation of the property.

In the case of Rasiah vs. Thamb ra'

J held that:

"it is one of the fundame tals of the administration of

justice that a person shoul not be deprived either of his

liberty or his property with ut an opportunity being given

to him to show cause again t such an order being made".

In the Maxwell's Interpretatio of Statutes 11th Ed P. 358, the

presumption of fair procedure in onnection with the exercise of judicial

powers is underlined:

"In giving judicial powers t affect pre judicially the right

of persons or property a st tute is understood as silently

implying when it does not e pressly provide the condition

or qualification that the ower is to be exercised in

accordance with the fund mental rules of the judicial

procedure such for instanc as that which requires that

CA (PHC) APN 154/2017 10/03/2021

before its exercise the pe on sought to be pre judicially

affected shall have an opp rtunity of defending himself'.

Section 40 of the Forest Ordina ce as amended by Forests (Amendment)

Act, No. 13 of 1982 has introdu ed a similar provision on forfeiture. In

Manawadu vs. Attorney Gene al (1987) 2 S.L.R 30, Sharvananda CJ

held that:

"The word 'forfeited' must be given the meaning 'liable to

be forfeited' so as to avoid he injustice that would flow on

the construction that forfel re of the vehicle is automatic

on the conviction of the ac sed. The amended section 40

does not exclude by neces ary implication the rule of audi

alteram partem. The own r of the lorry not a party to the

case is entitled to be hear on the question of forfeiture of

the lorry. If he satisfie the court that the accused

committed the offence without his knowledge or

participation his lorry will ot be liable to forfeiture".

The House of Lords in re Hami on 1981 AC 1038 has stressed that:

"One of the principles of n tural justice is that a person is

entitled to adequate notic and opportunity to be heard

before any judicial order s pronounced against him, so

that he or someone acti g on behalf may make such

representations if any, as e seems fit. This is the rule of

audi alteram partem hich applies to all judicial

proceedings unless its ap lication to a particular class of

proceedings has been excl ded by Parliament expressly or

by necessary implication".

Though the Section 6 of the Of nces Against Public Property Act does

not contain a procedure to b taken by the Court before ordering

confiscation of the property, th principles of natural justice should be

adhered while discharging judi ial functions at all stages, unless it is

clearly precluded by Parliament expressly or by necessary implication.

In Wiseman V. Borneman (19 9) 3 All ER 275 @ P 279, the House of

Lords emphasized the inhere

process of administration of jus ice:

rules of natural justice in the

"It is reasonably clear fro the authorities that where a

statutory tribunal had b en set up to decide the final

question affecting party's ghts and duties, if the statute

is silent on the question, the court will imply into the

statutory provisions a rule hat the principles of the natural

justice should be applied. his implication will be made on

the basis that the Parliam t is not to be presumed to take

away parties' rights witho t giving them an opportunity of

being heard in their in erests. In other words, the

Parliament is not to be pre umed to act unfairly".

In light of the above contention it is in my opinion that the principles

of natural justice should be ad ered to and an opportunity be given for

the petitioner to be heard on h s claim. In confiscating a property for

an offence under the Offences Against Public Property Act, No.12 of

1982, the law makers may no have intended that the rights of an

innocent third party or a bon fide purchaser be deprived of. It is

presumed that parliament doe not intend its legislations to produce

highly inequitable results. Any realistic application submitted by an

innocent third party or a perso claimed to be a bona fide purchaser of

the property so surrendered u der Section 6 of the Offences Against

CA (PHC) APN 154/2017 10/03/2021

Page 8 of9

Public Property Act, No. 12 of 982, has to be considered in the same

Court where the original order r confiscation was made.

Therefore, I direct the High Co rt Judge of Colombo to hold a limited

inquiry only on the claim of the etitioner as to why the property claimed

by him should not be forfeited.

I make no order as to costs.
