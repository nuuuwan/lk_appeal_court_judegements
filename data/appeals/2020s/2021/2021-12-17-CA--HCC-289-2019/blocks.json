The appellant had been consuming alcohol in the sitting room. After having a bath, she had come to her room wearing a towel, to change. Then the appellant had come and held her by the hand and covered her mouth. Within the scuffle, her head struck on the wall or the cupboard where she fell unconscious. When she regained consciousness she has felt dizzy and also pain in the genital area. When she came out of the house after dressing herself, she has seen the appellant sleeping on the floor near the cot where the sister was. The appellant had on and off harassed the PW1 threatening not to tell the mother about the incident. Due to the fear of the appellant she had not told the incident to the mother. However, after she went for work she had told her friend about the incident and gone to see a doctor with the friends mother. She has got to know from the lady doctor that she is no more a virgin. Thereafter, as her friend could not keep her at their place she had gone and boarded herself at a boarding place. She had told about the incident to her mother.

It is well understood that she may not have rushed to make a complaint due to the social stigma that may be attributed to her as a result.

As mentioned before in paragraph 12 of this judgment, the prosecution however, has failed to establish that it was the appellants penis that was used in penetration. The charge of Rape failed due to that reason. However, insertion of any other part of the human body or an instrument to the vagina will constitute the offence of Grave Sexual Abuse as defined in Section 365B of the Penal Code. Hence, when the charges were framed there had been a clear doubt as to which offence was committed, Rape or Grave Sexual Abuse, as the PW1 was unconscious when the penetration happened. Thus in terms of Section 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act the prosecution was entitled to indict him either for Rape and alternatively Grave Sexual Abuse or for one of the offences. As it was doubtful as to which of those offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, the succeeding Section 177 provides for convicting for the offence which the appellant is shown to have committed although he was not charged with it. It is also pertinent to note that Rape and Grave Sexual Abuse come under the same class of sexual offences and also defined in the same chapter of offences affecting the human body, Chapter XVI of the Penal Code. As there was a doubt as to which of the offences was",

The Court will have to consider whether he would have been taken by surprise or whether he did not have the opportunity to defend himself for Grave Sexual Abuse. The accused was right throughout represented by Counsel at the trial. As I have mentioned before, the moment the penis, genitals or any other part of the human body or instrument touches the vagina without consent of the victim, the offence of Grave Sexual Abuse is completed. Hence, one cannot argue that the elements that constitute Grave Sexual Abuse would have taken the appellant by surprise and the appellant should have expected the same. Also, as mentioned before, Section 177 of the Code of Criminal procedure Act provides for conviction of such offence although not charged with it. 21. In the above premise, we find the appellant guilty of the offence of Grave",

It was submitted by the Counsel that the appellant was a first offender and was fifty seven years old, married with a school-going child. It was also mentioned that he was a disabled person but the sole breadwinner of the family by selling betel. The Court will also take into consideration that the Legislature has considered Grave Sexual Abuse a very serious offence. The prescribed punishment of a minimum of five years which may extend to twenty years reflects the intention of the Legislature. The Court will also take into consideration the fact that the appellant has taken advantage of the vulnerability of his step-daughter who was living in the same house with him. Taking those factors into consideration, the following sentence is imposed on the appellant Ten years rigorous imprisonment, in addition a fine of Rupees five Thousand to be paid, in default of payment of such fine three months",
