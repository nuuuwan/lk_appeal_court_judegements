Decided on: 19th February 2021

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

When this application was taken up for argument on 14th July 2020, the learned

Counsel appearing for all parties moved that this Court pronounce its judgment on

the written submissions that had already been tendered on behalf of the parties.

Thereafter, on 30th September 2020, the parties were directed to tender their

3

written response to certain matters that I wished to clarify, arising from the

pleadings. This has been duly complied with by all parties.1

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash

the decision of the Board of Review appointed under the Ceiling on Housing Property

Law No. 1 of 1973, as amended marked X15 (the CHP Law). By this decision

delivered on 29th August 2017:

(a) The Board of Review had rejected the application of the Petitioner to be

substituted in place of the tenant of premises No. 212/19, Puttalam Road,

Kurunegala in the proceedings that were pending before the Board of Review;

(b) The Board of Review had arrived at the decision that what has been vested in

the Commissioner of National Housing is only the house situated at the

aforementioned premises and not the appurtenant land.

Therefore, there are two issues that I am called upon to consider in this application.

The first is whether a tenant who has made an application under Section 13 of the

CHP Law to purchase the house he or she is living in, could be substituted in the

event of his or her death, and if so, whether the Petitioner can be substituted on

behalf of the tenant. The second issue is, what exactly is vested with the

Commissioner of National Housing when the Minister makes a vesting order in terms

of Section 17 of the Act.

The Act of Parliament that must be considered in determining the above issues is the

CHP Law and in particular the provisions of Sections 13, 16 and 17 thereof. However,

prior to doing so, and in order to place in proper perspective the applicability of the

said Sections, I would at the outset discuss the structure of the CHP Law.

The CHP Law was enacted inter alia, to regulate the ownership of houses, as stated in

the long title to the Law, and came into operation on 13th January 1973. Section 2

specifies the maximum number of houses which may be owned by an individual who

1 Vide motion dated 12th October 2020 filed by the Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioner, motion dated 13th October 2020 filed by the Attorney-at-Law for the 10th Respondent and the motion dated 11th January 2021 filed by the Attorney-at-Law for the 1st Respondent.

4

is a member of a family as well as an individual who is not a member of a family.

Section 2 further sets out the manner in which the maximum number of houses that

could be owned by a body of persons could be determined. This maximum number

of houses is referred to as the permitted number of houses that a person may own

after the introduction of the CHP Law.

Section 8(1) requires each of the persons referred to above, to submit a declaration

setting out the number of houses owned by such persons and the houses that such

persons propose to retain. Section 8(1) further requires such persons to

simultaneously intimate in writing to the tenant, if any, of each house the ownership

of which such individual or body does not propose to retain, that the ownership of

such house is not proposed to be retained.

The purpose of giving such notice is to enable the tenant of such house to act in

terms of Section 9 of the CHP Law, which reads as follows: The tenant of a surplus

house or any person who may succeed under section 36 of the Rent Act to the

tenancy of such house may, within four months from the date of commencement of

this Law, apply to the Commissioner2 for the purchase of such house.

Section 10 sets out the steps that a person may take in respect of the houses which

are in excess of the permitted number of houses. In terms of Section 10, any person

who owns any house in excess of the permitted number of houses, may, within the

time periods specified therein, dispose of such house with notice to the 1st

Respondent, the Commissioner of National Housing, unless the tenant of such house

or any person who may succeed to the tenancy of such house under section 36 of

the Rent Act, has made an application with simultaneous notice to the owner for the

purchase of such house.

Section 11(1) provides that, Any house owned by any person in excess of the

permitted number of houses which has not been disposed of within the period within

which such person may dispose of such house in accordance with the provisions of

section 10 shall on the termination of such period vest in the Commissioner. In terms

of Section 12(3), when the Commissioner of National Housing proposes to sell any

2 The reference to Commissioner is to the Commissioner of National Housing, the 1st Respondent in this application.

5

such house vested in him, he shall in the first instance offer to sell such house to the

tenant, if any, of such house.

The above provisions of the CHP Law contain the mechanism to extract the excess

number of houses that a person may own at the time the CHP Law came into force

and to sell such house to the tenant occupying such house, thereby achieving the

object of the CHP Law, namely the regulation of the ownership of houses.

Section 9 as well as Section 10 of the CHP Law refers to Section 36 of the Rent Act,

which contain provisions regarding the continuation of the tenancy upon the death

of the tenant. Section 36(2) of the Rent Act provides inter alia that any person who in

the case of residential premises which has been let prior to the date of

commencement of the Rent Act is the surviving spouse or child of the deceased

tenant and who was a member of the household of the deceased tenant during the

period of three months preceding the death of the tenant, shall be deemed for the

purposes of the Rent Act to be the tenant of the premises. Thus, the legislature, by

specifically referring to Section 36 of the Rent Act in Sections 9 and 10 of the CHP

Law have extended the right of a tenant to make an application to purchase a house

in terms of the CHP Law, to the heir of such tenant, in the event of the death of the

tenant, provided that the application to purchase the house is made by the heir of

the tenant during the period specified in Section 9 and provided further that such

heir was a member of the household of the deceased tenant during the period of

three months preceding the death of the tenant.

It is perhaps important to mention that the above provisions contained in Sections 8,

9, 10 and 11 of the CHP Law deals with houses which are in excess of the permitted

number of houses.

As pointed out by Sarath Silva, J (as he then was) in Kathiresan vs Sirimevan Bibile,

Chairman, Board of Review and Others,3 the CHP Law contained two principal

methods of regulating the ownership of houses. The first was the imposition of a

ceiling on the number of houses that may be owned by individuals or other bodies,

which is provided for in Section 2 and is given effect to by the procedure that I have

discussed above. The second is by giving a right to any tenant to make an application 3 [1992] 1 Sri LR 275 at 279.

6

to the Commissioner for the purchase of a house rented to him. The statutory

provisions for the latter are found in Sections 9 and 13 of the CHP Law.

Section 13 of the CHP Law specifies that, Any tenant may make application to the

Commissioner for the purchase of the house let to him where no action or

proceedings may under the Rent Act be instituted for the ejectment of the tenant of

such house on the ground that such house is reasonably required for occupation as a

residence for the landlord of such house or for any member of his family.4

The fact that an application cannot be made in terms of Section 13, if such house is

reasonably required for occupation as a residence of a landlord or a member of his

family makes it clear that Section 13 does not, on the face of it, relate to the houses

which are in excess of the permitted number of houses. Section 13 is therefore an

alternative to the provisions discussed earlier, by which a tenant has been given the

right to purchase the house he is living in. I must however say, in order to avoid any

ambiguity, that there can be instances where a landlord does not inform the tenant

of his decision as required by Section 8(1), which may then prevent the tenant from

making an application under Section 9. In such a situation, it appears to me that the

tenant may still make an application under Section 13.

The effect of Section 13 has been considered by this Court in Kathiresan v. Sirimevan

Bibile, Chairman, Board of Review, Ceiling on Housing Property Law and Others5,

where this Court, having considered the provisions of the CHP Law, stated as follows:

Section 13 was introduced as a measure of regulating ownership. It remained

in operation until the amendment effected by Act No. 4 of 1985 which provided

that no application could be made for the purchase of a house after 1.1.1987.

The ceiling also ceased to be in operation from that day. The policy of the law up

to that point was that a tenant who was in occupation of a house let to him at

the time the present landlord became owner and who continues as tenant under

the present landlord, is entitled to apply for the purchase of that house. This

4 Section 22(1)(b) of the Rent Act stipulates that proceedings for the ejectment of the tenant of any premises where the rent does not exceed Rs. 100 per month shall not be instituted unless where such premises are in the opinion of the Court, reasonably required for occupation as a residence for the landlord, or any member of the family of the landlord. 5 Supra; at page 283.

7

policy also involves the vesting of such house without the consent of the

landlord.6

There is a significant difference between the two methods set out in Sections 9 and

13 i.e. Section 13 does not contain a reference to Section 36 of the Rent Act. Thus,

a surviving spouse or child of a tenant who was a member of the household of the

tenant was not considered a tenant for the purposes of making an application under

Section 13. The position therefore is that in terms of Section 13, the right to make an

application to purchase a house is limited to the tenant. In the event of the death of

the tenant, the right to make an application does not extend to his spouse or child.

I shall now endeavour to set out as briefly as possible, the facts of this application. I

say briefly as possible for the reason that the facts of this application span over a

period of 45 years, several appeals to the Board of Review appointed under the CHP

Law and two applications to this Court. I must however admit, rather sadly, that this

is not unusual in contested matters under the CHP Law.

It is not in dispute that premises No. 212/19, Puttalam Road, Kurunegala was owned

by S. Kanagasabai, and subsequently by V. Sinnadurai. The tenant of the house

situated on the said premises at the time the CHP Law came into force was B.F.

Nivithigala. It is admitted that B.F. Nivithigala made an application under Section 13

on 10th May 1973 to the 1st Respondent, to purchase the said premises. Sinnadurai

had passed away in August 1977.

The procedure that should be followed by the 1st Respondent, on receipt of an

application under Section 13 is set out in Section 17 of the CHP Law, which reads as

follows:

Where an application has been made under this Law for the purchase of a

house, and the Commissioner is satisfied-

(a) that such house is situated in an area which in his opinion will not be

6 The right given by section 13 to a tenant is not in absolute terms. It is available only "where no action or proceedings may under the Rent Act No. 7 of 1972 be instituted for the ejectment of the tenant of such house on the ground that such house is reasonably required for occupation as a residence for the landlord of such house or for any member of his family.

8

required for slum clearance, development or redevelopment or for any other

public purpose;

(b) that it is feasible to alienate such house as a separate entity; and

(c) that the applicant is in a position to make the purchase,

the Minister may, on being so notified by the Commissioner, by Order

(hereinafter referred to as a Vesting Order) vest such house in the

Commissioner with effect from such date as may be specified therein.

The Minister, acting in terms of Section 17(1) of the CHP Law had made an Order on

29th September 1984 vesting the said premises in the 1st Respondent. This Order has

been published in Gazette No. 325 dated 23rd November 1984, marked X2.

The effect of a vesting order has been set out in Section 15(2) of the Law, which

reads as follows:

Where any house is vested in the Commissioner under this Law, the

Commissioner shall have absolute title to such house and free from all

encumbrances, and such vesting shall be final and conclusive for all purposes

against all persons whomsoever, whatever right or interest they have or claim

to have to, or in, such house .....

By letter dated 16th February 1985 marked X5, the 1st Respondent had informed

B.F.Nivithigala of the aforementioned vesting order and requested him to deposit a

sum of Rs. 12,000 being of the purchase price, and a sum of Rs. 280 per month

until the transfer deed is executed in his favour. Nivithigala has paid the said sum of

Rs. 12,000 on 20th February 1985, as borne out by the receipt marked X5a.

The said vesting order had been challenged in CA (Writ) Application No. 355/85 by

Gnanawathie Rajanayagam, who by then had purchased the said premises,7 on the

basis that the decision of the 1st Respondent contained in the letter dated 23rd

February 1984 and the vesting order of the Minister are bad in law since the tenant,

7 Upon her death, Gnanawathie Rajanayagam had been substituted by Jeevananthan Rajanayagam.

9

Nivithigala had not amended his application to reflect the change in ownership. This

Court, having rejected the said argument presented on behalf of the owner

dismissed the said application by its judgment delivered on 1st August 1995 as the

petitioner had filed the said application after a period of six months had lapsed since

the publication of the vesting order.8

While the above application was pending before this Court, the 10th Respondent,

M.S.M.Samsudeen had purchased the said premises from Gnanawathie Rajanayagam

on 25th January 1989, by Deed of Transfer No. 2797, marked X3. It must be noted

that by the time X3 was executed:

(a) The said premises including the house situated on the said premises had been

vested with the 1st Respondent vide X2 dated 23rd November 1984;

(b) Absolute title to the said premises was with the 1st Respondent vide the

provisions of Section 15(2).

With the delivery of the judgment of this Court in CA (Writ) Application No. 355/85,

and in the absence of any appeal to the Supreme Court in August 1995, there was a

closure to the challenge of the Vesting Order X2.

Once the premises are vested in the 1st Respondent, he is required to follow the

provisions of Section 16(1), which reads as follows:

Where any house which is not a flat or a tenement is vested in the

Commissioner under this Law, there shall also be vested in the Commissioner

such extent of land as is in the opinion of the Commissioner is reasonably

appurtenant to the house.

Thus, while in terms of Section 17(1) the house is vested in the 1st Respondent in

terms of an Order made by the Minister, the extent of land that is appurtenant to the

house is also vested in the 1st Respondent, but by operation of law as provided for in

Section 16. The cumulative effect of Sections 16(1) and 17(1) is that the house and

the extent of land appurtenant thereto, are vested in the 1st Respondent. 8 Vide judgment of this Court dated 1st August 1995, marked X4.

10

The Petitioner states that Plan No. 1385 dated 4th July 1997 marked X6 was

prepared for the purpose of ascertaining the extent of land that was appurtenant to

the house. X6 shows that the house has taken much of the land, a fact which is

contested by the 10th Respondent. By letter dated 5th December 1997 marked X7,

the 1st Respondent had informed Nivithigala and Rajanayagam that the entire extent

of land is appurtenant to the said house. It is admitted that neither Rajanayagam nor

the 10th Respondent to whose address X7 has been delivered, filed an appeal

against X79 with the Board of Review as provided for by Section 39 of the CHP

Law,10 within the stipulated time period.

The next step that needs to be taken by the 1st Respondent is set out in Section 20 of

the CHP Law, which reads as follows:

Where any house is vested in the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall, by

notice published in the Gazette and in such other manner as may be determined

by him, direct every person who was interested in such house immediately

before the date on which such house was so vested to make, within a period of

one month reckoned from the date specified in the notice, a written claim to

the whole or any part of the price payable under this Law in respect of such

house, and to specify in the claim-

(a) his name and address,

(b) the nature of his interest in such house,

(c) the particulars of his claim, and

(d) how much of such price is claimed by him.

9 Vide the written clarification provided to this Court by the motion filed on behalf of the 10th Respondent on 13th October 2020. 10 Section 39(1) of the CHP Law reads as follows: Any person aggrieved by any decision or determination made by the Commissioner under this Law may, within one month of the date on which such determination is communicated to such person, appeal against such decision or determination to the Board, stating the grounds of such appeal.

11

The notice under Section 20 had accordingly been published in Gazette No. 1034

dated 26th June 1998, marked X8. In my view, the vesting order X2, together with

X7 and the absence of any challenge to X7 as provided for by the CHP Law, should

have brought to an end, all challenges with regard to the vesting of the house and

the land appurtenant thereto, leaving only the issue of payment of the price payable

for the house to be determined by the 1st Respondent pursuant to the response

received to X8.

The finality that was expected by X7 was not to be. The 10th Respondent, who had

purchased the said premises in 1989, and who did not challenge X7 within the

stipulated time period set out in Section 39, lodged an appeal dated 18th July 1998

with the Board of Review regarding the decision in X8.11

The complaint of the 10th Respondent is as follows:

The relief sought by the 10th Respondent was therefore very clear. All that the 10th

Respondent wanted was any extra land which was not appurtenant to the house, to

be released to him. However, by then, the 1st Respondent had already determined

that the entire land is appurtenant to the house, which decision, as I have noted

earlier, had not been challenged before the Board of Review as provided for by

Section 39 of the CHP Law within the stipulated time period. Whether the Board of

Review can now consider the aforementioned relief sought by the 10th Respondent is

however a matter the Board of Review would have to decide.

The issue that eventually culminated in this application arose in May 2000. While the

above appeal of the 10th Respondent was under consideration by the Board of

Review, Nivithigala passed away on 25th May 2000. It is not in dispute that Nivithigala

had left the Last Will marked X19, which reads as follows:

I do hereby devise and bequeath all that allotment of land and house bearing

assessment No. 212/19 Puttalam Road, Kurunegala depicted in Plan No. 1385

CH/15/15914/163 dated 04.07.1997 made by T.S. Siriwardena Licensed

Surveyor relating to the vesting Order No. CH/15/15914/163 with the National

Housing Commissioner in the following manner.

1. An undivided 1/3rd share in extent should devolve in equal shares to my

two grandsons Ashane Navinka Andarawewa and Shanil Chamathka

Andarawewa both of 212/19 Puttalam Road, Kurunegala subject to the life

interest of Mrs. H. M. Nivitigala.

2. An undivided 2/3rd share should devolve on my two sisters Miss Deepika

Kalyani Nivitigala and Mrs. Gerty Jayaneththi of 212/19 Puttalam Road,

Kurunegala in equal shares.

13

The 10th Respondent had objected to the application to substitute Nivithigala on the

basis of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Leelawathie vs Ratnayake.12 I shall

discuss later in this judgment the applicability of the said decision to this application,

but let me state at this point that the Supreme Court had held in that case that a

tenant who makes an application under Section 13 cannot be substituted.

The objection for substitution had been taken up for the first time before the Board

of Review in Appeal No. 2649. By its decision delivered on 10th November 2000

marked X10, the Board of Review having correctly analysed the applicability of the

judgment in Leelawathie vs Ratnayake13 had allowed the substitution of a fit and

proper person in place of Nivithigala in order to proceed with the aforementioned

appeal of the 10th Respondent regarding the appurtenant land.14 I must note at this

stage that the Board of Review has observed in X10 that, the appellant has waived

his rights to contest the vesting of the house in the Commissioner. He agitates only

for the appurtenant land in respect of the vested house (vide paragraph 10 of

Applicants petition dated 14th October 1999). X10 was not challenged by the 10th

Respondent, and thus, Nivithigala stood to be substituted by a fit and proper

person.

It is not in dispute that in his last will, Nivithigala had appointed the Petitioner, who

was his brother-in-law as the executor. The Petitioner had therefore sought to be

substituted in place of Nivithigala, to which application the 10th Respondent had

objected, once again, on the basis of the judgment in Leelawathie vs Ratnayake.15

The Board of Review, having referred to the provisions of Section 36 of the Rent Act,

had by its decision dated 11th December 2003 marked X11 rejected the application

of the Petitioner on the basis that he is not a fit person to be substituted in place of

Nivithigala.

The cumulative effect of X10 and X11 is that the Board of Review did not think

that the judgement in Leelawathie vs Ratnayake was an impediment to the

substitution of Nivithigala, but took the view that the Petitioner was not a fit and

proper person to be substituted in place of Nivithigala.

12 [1998] 3 Sri LR 349. 13 Vide page 2 of X10. 14 Vide the appeal lodged by the 10th Respondent at page 632. 15 Ibid.

14

Aggrieved by the latter decision of the Board of Review, the Petitioner filed CA (Writ)

Application No. 536/2004 seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash X11. In the course

of the oral submissions, the Petitioner and the 10th Respondent had agreed that the

question of substitution could be decided by the 1st Respondent, and for the 1st

Respondent to make a determination on the person who should be substituted in

place of the deceased tenant, in order to resist the application which was pending

before the Board of Review.

This Court, by its judgment delivered on 20th June 2007 marked X12 had therefore

made the following direction:

This Court directs the Commissioner of National Housing to determine a

suitable person or persons who could be substituted in place of the deceased

tenant for the purpose of appeal No. 2649 which is presently pending before the

Ceiling on Housing Property Board of Review, and to communicate to the said

Board of Review for the Board of Review to conclude the said appeal.

The effect of the above judgment is that the substitution of Nivithigala has been

allowed in principle, with only the suitability of the person sought to be substituted

left to be decided by the 1st Respondent.

The 1st Respondent had accordingly made the following decision dated 13th

December 2012 marked X13, allowing the substitution of the Petitioner in place of

Nivithigala:

The 10th Respondent had thereafter filed with the Board of Review, an appeal dated

3rd January 2013 marked X14 against the above decision of the 1st Respondent.16

The Board of Review having afforded the Petitioner and the 10th Respondent a

hearing, had, by its order dated 29th August 2017 marked X15, held as follows:

(a) The Board determines that the appeal of the petitioner is allowed without

cost and the order dated 13th December 2012 made by the Commissioner

of National Housing is hereby set aside;

(b) As the right of the tenant ceases with his death the Board determines that

there cannot be any substitution in place of the deceased tenant;

(c) .........

Dissatisfied with the above decision of the Board of Review, the Petitioner has

invoked the jurisdiction of this Court seeking the aforementioned Writ of Certiorari.

The above narration of the facts brings me back to the first issue for determination,

namely whether a tenant who has made an application under Section 13 of the CHP

Law could be substituted in the event of his death.

As discussed earlier, Section 13 (as well as Section 13A) of the CHP Law applies in

respect of the permitted number of houses owned by an individual. Neither Section

makes any reference to Section 36 of the Rent Act. I shall now consider whether the

judgment of the Supreme Court in Leelawathie vs Ratnayake17 would be relevant to

a determination of the issue in this application.

16 No. 2743 had been allocated to this appeal. 17 Supra.

16

In Leelawathies case, the tenant had made an application under Section 13 of the

CHP Law to purchase the house let to her. The Commissioner decided to recommend

to the Minister the vesting of the house in the Commissioner for the purpose of sale

to the tenant. On an appeal by the owner of the house under Section 39 of the CHP

Law, the Board of Review set aside the decision of the Commissioner. The tenant

then moved the Court of Appeal by way of a Writ of Certiorari to quash the order of

the Board of Review. The tenant died pending the hearing of the application before

the Court of Appeal and her daughter was substituted. The Court of Appeal affirmed

the order of the Board of Review but an appeal was preferred to the Supreme Court.

Chief Justice G.P.S.De Silva identified the issue to be decided, in the following

manner:

The short point that arises for consideration before us is whether the

application made by the tenant in terms of section 13 of the CHP Law can be

proceeded with by the substituted petitioner-respondent after the death of the

tenant. In other words, has the substituted petitioner-respondent the locus

standi to maintain the application made by her mother (now deceased) who

was the tenant of the premises?

The Supreme Court, having considered the provisions of Sections 9 and 13 of the CHP

Law held as follows:

Moreover, there is a significant difference in the language of section 9 and

section 13, insofar as the person entitled to make the application is concerned.

While the entitlement to make an application for the purchase of the house is

confined to any tenant in terms of section 13, the provisions of section 9 speak

of the tenant .... or any person who may succeed under section 36 of the Rent

Act to the tenancy. .... The words underlined above are not found in section 13.

It seems to me that the difference in the language tends to show that the right

conferred by section 13 is personal to the tenant who makes the application. In

this connection, it is also relevant to note (as stated earlier) that Section 13

applies to houses which are within the permitted number allowed to be owned

by the landlord.

17

The Supreme Court thereafter referred to the provisions of Section 17 which

conferred upon the 2nd Respondent a discretion with regard to an application of the

tenant made under Section 13 of the CHP Law as opposed to an application under

Section 9 which gives the tenant a right to purchase the house such tenant is living,

and held as follows:

Once an application is made in terms of section 13 to purchase a house, the

Commissioner of National Housing has to be satisfied in regard to the specific

matters set out in sections 17 (1) (a), (b) and (c). Analysing the provisions of

section 13 read with section 17, Thamotheram, J. in Caderamanpulle vs

Keuneman18 expressed himself in the following terms: Under section 13 an

application has to be made under the law for the purchase of a house. This does

not mean that every application purporting to be validly made under section 13

has to be acted on and a notification made to the Minister under section 17

even if (a), (b) and (c) of the latter section19 are satisfied. It was rightly conceded

by Mr. H. L. de Silva that there was an area of discretion left to the

Commissioner for him to consider the equities in the case and decide whether

the application should be entertained. Before going into the question raised at

(a), (b) and (c) of section 17, he must decide whether he is going to accept an

application under section 13 and notify the Minister that an application has

been made under this law.

It would also be relevant to refer to the case of Perera v. Lokuge and others20,

wherein Kulatunga, J 21 held that (1) the Minister's power to make the vesting

order is discretionary, (2) the Commissioner is under a duty to consider equities

in addition to the matters set out in Section 17 to enable the Minister to make a

fair decision. It is thus abundantly clear that the CHP Law requires the

Commissioner of National Housing to address his mind to the equities in the

case and to act fairly. This again is a pointer to the true nature of the

application made under Section 13, namely, that the right conferred is personal

to the tenant making the application. The position of the present substituted-

18 SC Appeal No. 15/79; SC Minutes of 19th September, 1980. 19 Section 17. 20 1996 (2) Sri LR 282. 21 When dealing with an application under Section 13.

18

petitioner-respondent may well be different from the position of the original

applicant.

Admittedly, the present substituted petitioner-respondent is not the person who

made the application under section 13 to purchase the premises in suit. For the

reasons stated above, I hold that the substituted petitioner-respondent is not

entitled to proceed with the application made under section 13 by the original

applicant, namely, the deceased tenant (Aslin Ratnayake) and the Commissioner

of National Housing himself has now no right to entertain the application. The

right conferred by section 13 is personal to the tenant who makes the

application and comes to an end upon her death - Actio personalis moritur cum

persona.

As held by the Supreme Court, an application under Section 9 is different to an

application under Section 13 or 13A of the CHP Law. While Section 9 gives a tenant a

right to purchase the house and hence the reference to an heir, no such right exists

with a tenant making an application under Section 13 and 13A, with the discretion

whether to allow the application being conferred with the Commissioner. This

further explains the absence of a reference to an heir in Sections 13 and 13A.

Furthermore, in exercising that discretion, the Commissioner is required to consider

the equities of the case.

What is meant by equities has been explained by in Kathiresan v. Sirimevan Bibile,

Chairman, Board of Review, Ceiling on Housing Property Law and Others22 in the

following manner:

This requirement on the part of the Commissioner to consider whether the

vesting of the house is fair and reasonable in relation to the respective

interests of the parties, is nothing more than the normal requirement in

Administrative Law that where a discretion is vested in an authority, it

should be exercised reasonably.

22 Supra.

19

The position that has arisen in this application however is different. Unlike in

Leelawathie, the 1st Respondent, having considered the equities of the application of

Nivithigala has recommended that the house be vested and the Minister has

accordingly made a vesting order in terms of Section 17(1). That Order was

challenged before this Court in CA (Writ) Application No. 355/85 and dismissed. In

any event, the 10th Respondent has admitted that he is not challenging the Order

made under Section 17. Thus, by the time of his death, Nivithigala had acquired

proprietary rights in respect of the said property. The fact that the decision in

Leelawathie would have been different had there been an Order under Section 17 is

clearly evident by the following statement by Chief Justice G.P.S. De Silva:

Furthermore, there is the significant fact that in the present case the tenant

who made the application in terms of section 13 died before an Order was

made by the Minister under section 17 (1) vesting the house in the

Commissioner of National Housing. There was not even a notification by the

Commissioner to the Minister under section 17 (1). Thus the deceased tenant

had no proprietary rights in respect of the house which could pass to her heirs

on her death.23

I am therefore not inclined to follow the decision in Leelawathie vs Manel

Ratnayake.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner drew my attention to the judgment of the

Supreme Court in Cassim vs Weerawardene, Commissioner for National Housing

and Another,24 and has urged that the facts of this application warrants this Court

following the said judgment. The facts in Cassims case are as follows. The property

in question was purchased by Mohideen Cassim in 1968, during which time Shah

Mihilar and his wife were in occupation as tenants. While in occupation, Mihilar

made a request under Section 13 of the CHP Law on 20th October 1975, to purchase

the property and after inquiry and recommendation to the Minister, the said

property was vested in the Commissioner for sale to the tenant. This decision was

affirmed by the Board of Review. Mihilar died on 27th April 2000 and his legal heir

was his widow. On 8th May 2000, the Valuation Board notified the parties of the

23 Supra, at page 354. 24 [2002] 1 Sri LR 316.

20

value of the property. The widow of Mihilar received the said notification and

informed the Commissioner that she was willing to make the payment on behalf of

her husband. The Commissioner informed the widow that in view of the Supreme

Court decision in Leelawathie v. Ratnayake she was not entitled to purchase the

house and that steps will be taken to divest the house.

The widow moved the Court of Appeal by way of a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

decision of the Commissioner to divest the house. The Court of Appeal allowed the

application and directed the Commissioner to accept the money and transfer the

house to the widow. On appeal, the Supreme Court observed that in Leelawathie,

the tenant who made the application died before an order was made vesting the

house in the Commissioner and that there was not even a notification by the Minister

under Section 17(1) and that, that is the reason why the Supreme Court in

Leelawathie held that the deceased tenant had no proprietary rights in respect of

the house which could pass to the heir on her death. Having noted the facts in

Leelawathie, the Supreme Court in Cassim observed that at the time of the death of

the tenant, the house had been vested in the Commissioner and the only

outstanding step required of him to effect a formal transfer of the premises was the

payment of the purchase price. I must straightaway add that in the current

application, Nivithigala had even paid of the purchase price, and that the position

of Nivithigala is even better than the tenant in Cassim.

It is because of this factual position that the Supreme Court in Cassim held as

follows:

Even though the right of the tenant to make an application to purchase the

house was a personal right, once that right was exercised and a vesting order

made, the character of that right changed. It was a vested right which on the

death of the applicant devolved on his heirs.25

The above paragraph makes it clear as to why the Supreme Court refused to set

aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Cassims case and the basis on which it

sought to distinguish that case from the judgment in Leelawathie. I agree with the

25 Supra; at page 320.

21

learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the facts of this application fall entirely within

the judgment of the Supreme Court in Cassim.

In Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service,26 Lord Diplock

identified 'illegality', 'irrationality' and 'procedural impropriety' as being the grounds

upon which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. He then

went onto describe illegality in the following manner.

By 'illegality' as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision maker

must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making power and

must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable

question to be decided in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, by

whom the judicial power of the state is exercisable.

The complaint of the Petitioner is that the Board of Review acted illegally when it

arrived at its determination that the right of the tenant ceased with his death and

that there cannot be any substitution in place of the deceased tenant. I have

examined the Order of the Board of Review, X15, and observe that the Board of

Review has blindly followed the judgment in Leelawathie v Ratnayake. There has not

been a consideration of:

a) the facts of this application vis--vis the facts in Leelawathie;

b) the reasons that led the Supreme Court to arrive at its decision in Leelawathie;

c) the legal principles laid down in Leelawathie.

The Board of Review has not even considered the judgment of the Supreme Court in

Cassim v Weerawardena, which, for the reasons that I have already discussed,

reflect the correct legal position that is applicable to this application.

In the aforementioned circumstances, I hold that where a vesting order has been

made in terms of Section 17(1), a tenant who has made an application under Section

13 to purchase a house could be substituted in the event of his or her death.

26 [1985] AC 374,

22

I must state that the substitution is not being made for the purpose of determining

the person to whom the house should be transferred by the 1st Respondent. Nor is

the Petitioner asking that the property be transferred to him. He is only seeking to be

substituted in his capacity as Executor to fulfill the task entrusted to him by

Nivithigala in his last will and thereby secure the rights of the beneficiaries

nominated by Nivithigala in his last will. The Petitioner, and in his absence any other

person who will carry out the wishes of Nivithigala is in my view a fit and proper

person to be substituted in place of Nivithigala.

Furthermore, once the substitution is effected, the application of the 10th

Respondent made by X8 in response to the Order made in terms of Section 20

calling for claims for the price payable can be decided by the Board of Review. Once

a determination is made on X8, the 1st Respondent can transfer the house to the

heirs of Nivithigala as per his last will. The issue relating to the proving of the last will

would arise only at that stage and hence, the fact that the testamentary action has

been withdrawn does not arise for consideration at this stage.

I must also state that the Board of Review, having correctly distinguished the facts of

this application from that in Leelawathie, allowed the substitution of Nivithigala by

its Order X10. This Order has not been challenged by the 10th Respondent. The

current issue arose when the Petitioner was sought to be substituted, with an

objection being taken that the Petitioner is not a fit and proper person to be

substituted. Upon the said objection being upheld by the Board of Review, the

Petitioner invoked the Writ jurisdiction of this Court. The Order made by this Court

vide X12, was to direct the 1st Respondent to determine a suitable person or persons

who could be substituted in place of the deceased tenant, and to communicate such

decision to the Board of Review. It is therefore clear that the Order made by X10

permitting substitution has not been interfered with by this Court. In those

circumstances, it was not open to the Board of Review to have revisited the issue of

substitution of Nivithigala. By doing so, the Board of Review has acted beyond its

jurisdiction.

23

Taking into consideration all of the above circumstances, I am of the view that the

Board of Review acted illegally when it arrived at its determination that the

Petitioner cannot be substituted in place of Nivithigala. The Order of the Board of

Review is therefore liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

This brings me to the second issue to be decided in this application, i.e. the decision

of the Board of Review that what has been vested in the 1st Respondent is only the

house situated on the aforesaid premises and not the appurtenant land. I have

already referred to the applicable legal provisions in this regard, which can be

summarised as follows.

1) Where a tenant wishes to purchase the house he is living in, even though such

house is not in excess of the permitted number of houses, the first step is for

the tenant to make an application to the 1st Respondent, as provided by Section

13.

2) The second step is for the 1st Respondent to make his recommendation to the

Minister, having taken into consideration the equities of the said application.

3) The third step is for the Minister to make a vesting order in respect of the

house in terms of Section 17.

4) In this application, the Minister, acting on the recommendation of the 1st

Respondent has proceeded to make the vesting order in terms of Section 17(1)-

vide X2.

5) The fourth step is for the 1st Respondent to make a determination as to the

area of land that is appurtenant to the said house.

6) As provided by Section 16, where any house is vested in the 1st Respondent

under the CHP Law, there shall also be vested in the 1st Respondent, such

extent of land as is in the opinion of the 1st Respondent, is reasonably

appurtenant to the house.

24

7) The determination of the appurtenant land has been done by way of Plan X6

and has been duly conveyed to the parties by letter dated 5th December 1997,

X7.

8) The fifth and final step is for the 1st Respondent to invite claims for payment, as

provided for in Section 20.

9) This too has been complied with by the 1st Respondent vide X8.

Thus, to my mind, the vesting of the house is in terms of the vesting order, while the

vesting of the appurtenant land is by operation of law pursuant to a determination

by the 1st Respondent. I am therefore of the view that the cumulative effect of the

provisions of Sections 16(1) and 17(1) is that the house and the extent of land

appurtenant thereto are vested with the 1st Respondent.

I have examined the Order of the Board of Review X15, where it has held as follows:

Taking into consideration the arguments raised by both parties and the

documents submitted to Court, we feel that by gazette notification bearing

number 325 dated 23rd November 1984, only the house bearing premises no.

212/19 has been vested with the Commissioner of National Housing. Perusal of

the said gazette marked A carefully reveals that in the said gazette in two

conspicuous places, it described as a house. It does not mention about any

land. It refers only to a house.

Therefore, the Board is of the view that the appurtenant land, which is in extent

1 rood and 4 perches, was not included in the said gazette, and if the

appurtenant land was not included in the said vesting, the purchase of the said

property by the Petitioner-Appellant is a clear and valid transaction.

If that position is legal, then the second gazette notification which declares that

1 rood and 4 perches has been vested with the Commissioner, is illegal, and has

caused immense conflicts because that particular portion of land is already

purchased by a bona fide purchaser.

The above statement is incorrect, for two reasons.

25

The first is that the Board of Review has completely lost sight of:

(a) the provisions of Section 16(1) of the CHP Law, which provides for the vesting

of the land that is appurtenant to the house by operation of law; and

(b) the fact that the cumulative effect of the provisions of Sections 16(1) and 17(1)

is to vest in the 1st Respondent both the house and the extent of land

appurtenant thereto.

The second is that by the time the transfer of the said premises was effected in

favour of the 10th Respondent, the vesting order had already been made, with the

result that absolute title to such house was with the 1st Respondent and not with its

owner. The Board of Review therefore clearly erred when it held that the entire area

of land has not vested with the 1st Respondent, and therefore, its decision is liable to

be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

I accordingly issue a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Board of Review

marked X15. The decision of the 1st Respondent marked X14 shall therefore stand.

The Board of Review is directed to commence the hearing of Appeal No. 2649 within

8 weeks hereof, and to deliver its decision within 20 weeks hereof.

I make no order with regard to costs.

President of the Court of Appeal
