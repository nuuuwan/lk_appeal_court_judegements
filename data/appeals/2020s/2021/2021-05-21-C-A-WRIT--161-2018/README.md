Before: Arjuna Obeyesekere, J / President of the Court of Appeal Counsel: Dr. Sunil Cooray with Nilanga Perera for the Petitioner

Ms. Indumini Randeny, State Counsel for the 9th Respondent

Ms. Nishadi Wickremasinghe for the 12th Respondent Argued on: 5th October 2020 Written Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 1st April 2021 Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the 9th Respondent on 26th January 2021 Tendered on behalf of the 12th Respondent on 29th March 2021 Decided on: 21st May 2021 Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The Petitioner states that the land Galpoththawelakele which is 4 acres in extent,

situated in the District of Galle was owned by her father upon whose death half

share devolved on her mother while the other half devolved on herself and her four

siblings. Her mother had thereafter transferred her half to the Petitioner, and the

Petitioner and her husband had subsequently purchased the undivided shares held

by her siblings.

The Petitioner states that she and her husband had come into possession of the said

land in 1976. Having built a house on the said land, she says her family enjoyed the

harvest of the cinnamon plantation and several coconut trees situated on the said

land. The Petitioner states that in or about 1992, the Petitioner, her husband and

their children had moved to Nugegoda for the purpose of their childrens education.

However, the Petitioner states that she continued to be in possession of the said

land and enjoyed the harvest of the land by employing a caretaker by the name of

Goshinnawadu Sarath who resided in the area. The Petitioner states that they

frequently visited the said land to ensure that the land and their house remained

unoccupied.

4

In or about 1997, the Petitioner, having subdivided the said land into several

allotments as depicted in Plan No. 2697 dated 20th December 1997, had sold all the

said subdivided allotments except Lot No. 1 depicted in the said Plan. Lot No. 1 was

in extent of 2 Roods and 21.1 Perches and included their house, the cinnamon

plantation and several coconut trees. The Petitioner states that while she and her

husband continued to be in possession of Lot No. 1, she used to obtain various loans

from local money lenders in the area by offering the said land as security for such

loans by executing Deeds of Transfer or Conditional Deeds of Transfer in favour of

the lenders.1

The Petitioner states that on or about 8th March 2010, she obtained a loan of Rs. 1

million from the 10th Respondent which she agreed to repay with interest at 6% per

month. The Petitioner admits that she executed Deed of Transfer No. 12255 by

which she transferred the said Lot No. 1 to the 10th Respondent as security for the

said loan. The Petitioner states further that although she had taken a loan of Rs. 1

million, by mutual agreement, a sum of Rs. 300,000/- was inserted on the said Deed

as the consideration. It is important to note that the Petitioner did not hand over

possession of the land to the 10th Respondent.

The 10th Respondent had passed away in 2011. The 11th and 12th Respondents who

are the parents of the 10th Respondent had collected the interest on the said loan

from the Petitioner. The Petitioner states that she maintained a book, marked X1,

where she made a note of the interest paid to the 11th and 12th Respondents. The

Petitioner has produced marked X2a X2r the deposit slips by which she

deposited the interest in the bank account of the 11th Respondent. The Petitioner

state that from 2014, due to financial difficulties, she only paid part of the interest

that was due. The Petitioner states further that as at 6th July 2014, she had paid a

total sum of Rs. 2,800,000/- as interest for the said loan of Rs. 1 million.

The Petitioner states that as the 11th and 12th Respondents were threatening to sell

the said property, she filed Application No. 43318, marked X4 in the Debt

Conciliation Board (the Board) on or about 31st July 2014, which is over four years

after the execution of Deed No. 12255, seeking relief under the Debt Conciliation

Ordinance.

1 Vide Deeds of Transfer marked A9 A22 before the Board.

The 11th and 12th Respondents had appeared before the Board upon notices being

served. It had later transpired that the 11th and 12th Respondents had transferred a

portion of Lot No. 1 to the 13th Respondent a few days before the Petitioner filed the

application before the Debt Conciliation Board. The remaining portion of the land

had been transferred to the 14th and 15th Respondents thereafter, which prompted

the Petitioner to name the 13th 15th Respondents as parties before the Board.

Although the 11th and 12th Respondents were represented by their Attorney-at-Law

before the Board at the outset, the 11th -15th Respondents were neither present nor

represented thereafter, prompting the Board to fix the matter for an ex parte

hearing.

Section 19A(1A) of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance No. 39 of 1941, as amended by

Act No. 29 of 1999 reads as follows:

The Board shall not entertain any application by a debtor or creditor in respect

of a debt purporting to be secured by any such transfer of immovable property

as is a mortgage within the meaning of this Ordinance, unless that application is

made within three years of the date of the notarially executed instrument,

effecting such transfer:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall be read or construed as preventing

the Board from entertaining, after the period referred to in that subsection , an

application by a debtor who is in possession of the property transferred;

Admittedly, the Petitioner has filed the application before the Board after three

years from the date of execution of the Deed of Transfer. As the application was not

made within three years from the date of execution of the transfer deed, the

Petitioner was required to prove that she was in possession of the said property,

according to the proviso to Section 19A(1A) of the Ordinance, prior to her application

being entertained by the Board.

The Petitioner states that at the ex-parte hearing that commenced before the Board

on 17th January 2017, she gave evidence in proof of possession of the said land along

with documents marked A1 A22 in support of her oral testimony. She states that

she also led the evidence of Goshinnawadu Sarath, who looked after the property

6

after she moved to Nugegoda, the Grama Sevaka in the area, and M.G. Karunapala,

the present caretaker of the property. The Petitioner states that in the absence of

the 11th 15th Respondents, the evidence remained uncontradicted and

unchallenged.

By its Order delivered on 17th January 2018 marked X8, the Board rejected the

application of the Petitioner on the basis that the Petitioner had failed to prove that

she was in possession of the said land, as required by the proviso to Section 19A(1A)

of the Ordinance.

Aggrieved by the Order X8 the Petitioner filed this application, seeking inter alia the

following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the Order X8;

b) An order directing the Chairman and the members of the Debt Conciliation

Board to entertain the Petitioners application under Section 19A(1A) of the

Ordinance;

c) An order directing the Chairman and the members of the Debt Conciliation

Board to proceed with the Petitioners application under the provisions of the

Ordinance.

Prior to considering the legality of X8, it would be useful to briefly consider two

matters. The first is the circumstances that led to the introduction of the Debt

Conciliation Ordinance. The second is the manner in which Section 19A has evolved

over the years.

The Debt Conciliation Ordinance was introduced in 1941 as a piece of welfare

legislation by the Colonial Legislature to address a pertinent social issue involving

civil debts that particularly affected rural and economically disadvantaged

communities. Those who required financial assistance were compelled to mortgage

immovable property in order to obtain loans, and keep paying interest at exorbitant

rates until such time as they were able to redeem their properties. These

instruments were usually executed as outright transfers, due to the disparity in

bargaining power between the creditors and debtors, and because debtors are often

7

desperate to obtain financial assistance and did not have the benefit of access to

legal advice to execute a mortgage which protects their rights. This practice led to

the eventual loss of property which further widened the gap in society and drove the

poor to the depths of poverty.2

The Debt Conciliation Ordinance was therefore introduced to provide some relief to

the debtor in order to prevent capricious, oppressive, and unconscionable conduct

on the part of the creditor. The Department of Debt Conciliation was established to

provide relief and legal protection for debtors to redeem on concessional

installments and low interest rates, immovable properties such as agricultural land or

residential premises hypothecated to obtain a loan on a mortgage or a deed of

conditional transfer.3 The culture of informally mortgaging immovable property for

the purpose of obtaining loans exists to date, particularly due to the inability to

obtain loans from the formal banking and financial sector. This provides the Debt

Conciliation Ordinance and the mechanism set out therein continuing relevance.

The Ordinance in its original form did not provide for applications in respect of

conditional transfers. The Debt Conciliation (Amendment) Act No. 25 of 1959

introduced Section 19A which provided for Applications in respect of debts

purporting to be secured by conditional transfers of immovable property. The

learned State Counsel for the 9th Respondent, the Secretary of the Board has

annexed to her written submissions, the Parliamentary Hansard of 16th September

1958 relating thereto. The intention behind the recognition of conditional transfers is

set out in the following paragraph:

The Supreme Court decisions hitherto point to the conclusion that the law does

not warrant the construction that a conditional transfer is the equivalent of a

mortgage. So that, today the Debt Conciliation Board is empowered to deal only

with mortgages and it has no right to entertain applications for relief in the case

of conditional transfers. It is therefore to provide this much needed relief in the

case of conditional transfers that this Amendment is brought to the existing

Ordinance.

2 See Debt Conciliation Board v R.D. Hector Jayasiri [CA/APN/MISC 01/2011; CA Minutes of 9th October 2012; Deepali Wijesundera, J.] 3Parliamentary Debates of 4th August 1999; speech made by the Minister of Justice when introducing the amendment to the Ordinance.

8

The other Amendment which is sought to be made is this. As Hon. Members are

aware, at present applications for relief can be made in respect of

unencumbered agricultural properties only. The amendment that we propose to

introduce today in this Bill is to see that any property of any description

whatsoever comes within the scope of the authority of the Debt Conciliation

Ordinance. It is therefore with regard to these two objectives firstly, to widen

the scope of the work of the Debt Conciliation Board and authorize them to deal

with conditional transfers in the same way as they deal with mortgages, and

secondly in order to enable a larger section of the people to obtain relief in

respect of all properties and not merely certain agricultural properties that

this amending Bill is introduced.

It therefore shows that by introducing conditional transfers to the Ordinance, the

legislature was seeking to fill a gap which existed in the debt conciliation scheme and

the general purpose of the Act.

Section 19A introduced by the Amendment Act No. 25 of 1959 only permitted the

Board to entertain applications in respect of debts secured by conditional transfer of

immovable property provided such applications were filed at least thirty days before

the expiry of the period within which such property may be redeemed by the debtor.

By the Debt Conciliation (Amendment) Act No. 20 of 1983, Section 19A(1) was

amended, which enabled a party to make an application any time before the expiry

of the period within which that property may be redeemed.4 The Debt Conciliation

(Amendment) Act No. 29 of 1999 retained Section 19A(1) and introduced Section

19A(1A), which is the provision which relates to the present application.

As the learned State Counsel has submitted, the Ordinance as it now stands provides

for two regimes governing the admissibility of applications from debtors. The first is

where the transaction is a conditional transfer, where the time period within which

an application could be made extends up to any date before the expiry of the period

4 Section 19A(1) introduced in 1983 reads as follows: The Board shall not entertain any application by a debtor or creditor in respect of a debt purporting to be secured by any such conditional transfer of immovable property as is a mortgage within the meaning of this Ordinance unless that application is made before the expiry of the period within which that property may be redeemed by the debtor by virtue of any legally enforceable agreement between him and his creditor.

9

within which that property may be redeemed by the debtor by virtue of any legally

enforceable agreement between him and his creditor. The second relates to a

transfer simpliciter, where a debtor or a creditor is able to make an application

within three years from the date of such instrument. In terms of the proviso to

Section 19A(1A), the time restriction does not apply to a debtor who is in possession

of the property transferred.

I have already noted that the Petitioner has come before the Board after the lapse of

three years from the date of execution of the Deed of Transfer in question. The

Board, in their Order X8 has therefore correctly identified that in order for the

Petitioner to seek relief from the Board, she needs to first satisfy the Board that she

is in possession of the land as per the proviso to Section 19A(1A). It is only if the

Petitioner is able to cross this threshold issue that the Board would proceed with her

application in terms of Section 21A.

I must at this stage refer to Section 21A of the Ordinance, which was in existence at

the time Section 19A(1A) was introduced in 1999. Section 21A provides that in

determining whether or not a transfer or conditional transfer is in reality a mortgage,

the Board is required to take into consideration all the circumstances of the case and

in particular four matters set out therein. One of the matters that must be taken into

account is the continuance of the transferors possession of the property transferred.

In other words, has the debtor in addition to signing a Deed of Transfer handed over

possession of the land to the creditor, with the result that handing over of

possession is a possible reflection of the true nature of the transaction.

To my mind, the possession referred to in Section 19A(1A) of the Ordinance is a

reflection of the possession provided for in Section 21A. Therefore, a person who

effects a transfer and at the same time hands over possession to the creditor must

make an application within three years, whereas a debtor who does not hand over

possession to the creditor and therefore continues to be in possession, can make an

application even though a period of three years has lapsed since the execution of the

notarially executed instrument. The rationale for drawing a distinction between

handing over and not handing over possession is clear. The fact that in this

application, the Petitioner did not hand over possession at the time of the execution

of the Deed of Transfer, and has not since then handed over possession of the land

10

to the 10th Respondent or to any of the other Respondents, is sufficient evidence for

the Board to have concluded that possession of the property was with the Petitioner.

Prior to considering the position of the Petitioner with regard to possession, it might

be useful to consider what constitutes possession. The learned Counsel for the 12th

Respondent has cited the case of Iqbal v. Majedudeen and Others5 where this Court,

considered the meaning of possession in the context of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, and held as follows:

The test for determining whether a person is in possession of any corporeal

thing, such as a house, is to ascertain whether he is in general control of it.

Salmond observes that a person could be said to be in possession of, say, a

house, even though that person is miles away and able to exercise very little

control, if any.

The law recognizes two kinds of possession:

(i) when a person has direct physical control over a thing at a given time, he

is said to have actual possession of it;

(ii) a person has constructive possession when he, though not in actual

possession, has both the power and the intention at a given time to

exercise dominion or control over a thing either directly or through another

person.

In this case in hand, perhaps, it cannot be said that the 1st respondent has actual

physical possession because she was not in physical occupation of the house in

question; but she clearly had, at least, constructive possession because she, by

keeping the premises locked, clearly exercised not only dominium or control

over the property in question but also excluded others from the possession there

of. By keeping the premises locked, she, i.e. the 1st respondent, had not only

continued to retain her rights in respect of the property in question but also was

exercising a claim to the exclusive control there of, and her affidavit evidence is

that she had not terminated her intention to revert to the physical occupation of

the relevant premises.

11

The primary submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the Board

failed to consider the totality of the evidence presented to it, and that the decision of

the Board is irrational and unreasonable. In considering this argument, I am mindful

that this Court is exercising its Writ jurisdiction as opposed to its Appellate

jurisdiction, and that this Court is not concerned with the rights and wrongs of the

decision sought to be impugned but only whether the said decision is legal or not. As

Lord Brightman stated in the House of Lords in Chief Constable of North Wales

Police v Evans:6

Judicial review is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision

making process. Unless that restriction on the power of the court is observed,

the court will in my view, under the guise of preventing the abuse of power, be

itself guilty of usurping power..... Judicial review, as the words imply, is not an

appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was

made..

The consequence of not taking into consideration all the circumstances as required

by the Ordinance, or in other words, disregarding relevant considerations, has been

captured in the following two paragraphs of De Smiths Judicial Review:7

When exercising a discretionary power a decision-maker may take into account

a range of lawful considerations. Some of these are specified in the statute as

matters to which regard may be had. Others are specified as matters to which

egard may not be had. There are other considerations which are not specified

but which the decision-maker may or may not lawfully take into account. If the

exercise of discretionary power has been influenced by considerations that

cannot lawfully be taken into account, or by the disregard of relevant

considerations required to be taken into account (expressly or impliedly), a court

will normally hold that the power has not been validly exercised....

If the ground of challenge is that relevant considerations have not been taken

into account, the court will normally try to assess the actual or potential

6 [1982] 1 WLR 1155 at 1174. 7 Harry Woolf, Jeffery Jowell, Catherine Donnelly, Ivan Hare, De Smiths Judicial Review [8th Edition, 2018] Sweet Maxwell, page 305.

12

importance of the factor that was overlooked, even though this may entail a

degree of speculation. The question is whether the validity of the decision is

contingent on strict observance of antecedent requirements. In determining

what factors may or must be taken into account by the authority, the courts are

again faced with problems of statutory interpretation. 8

While I am mindful that it is not my duty to analyse the facts as would be done when

exercising appellate jurisdiction, I am also mindful that, as stated by Lord Bingham,

that they (judges) are auditors of legality; no more, but no less.9

If a decision has been influenced by considerations which either expressly or

implicitly cannot lawfully be taken into account, a Court may hold that such

discretionary power has not been exercised validly. In doing so, Courts can consider

to what degree the decision maker has been influenced by such considerations and

in order to determine the degree of influence, Courts may be guided by the reasons

provided by the decision maker. The reasons provided for a decision would allow

Courts to effectively scrutinize the decision and detect what factors have influenced

the decision maker.

In De Smiths Judicial Review10 it has been stated that:

Irrationality may also sometimes be inferred from the absence of reasons.11

When reasons are required, either by statute or by the growing common law

requirements, or where they are provided, even though not strictly required,

those reasons must be both adequate and intelligible. They must therefore

both rationally relate to the evidence in the case12, and be comprehensible in

themselves13.

The Petitioner had produced the proceedings before the Board marked X5(d) (g). I

have examined the evidence of the Petitioner where she has clearly stated as

follows:

8 Ibid. p 306-307. 9 Tom Bingham, The Rule of Law [2011], Penguin Books, at page 61. 10 Ibid; page 605. 11 See Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture Fisheries and Food [1968] AC 997 at 1032. 12 See Re Poyser and Mills Arbitration [1964] 2 QB 467 at 478. 13 See R v. Hammersmith and Fulham LBC Ex parte Earls Court Ltd, The Times,

13

a) She did not hand over possession of the property to the 10th Respondent;

b) She continues to be in possession of the land;

c) There is a cinnamon plantation and coconut trees on the land;

d) She has employed Karunapala to look after the property;

e) The income thereof is taken by her;

f) She visits the said land every two months or so while her husband visits the

land monthly; and

g) She was present when the valuer visited the property.

To my mind, all these are factors which on their own, and without any further

corroboration, establish that the Petitioner is in possession of the land.

As noted earlier, the 11th -15th Respondents were not present when the evidence-in-

chief of the Petitioner was recorded on 17th January 2017. The Board has therefore

directed that notices be issued on the 11th 15th Respondent informing that the

Debtor has given evidence relating to possession and that if the 11th 15th

Respondents are in possession of the land, that they could be present on the next

date to cross examine the Petitioner. When the inquiry commenced on 10th March

2017, the Board had noted that none of the persons noticed had appeared even

though notices had been dispatched. Thus, the evidence of the Petitioner, which

alone was sufficient to establish that she is in possession of the land, has gone

uncontradicted. This should have been sufficient for the Board to have arrived at a

finding on possession.

The evidence of Goshinnawadu Sarath, M.G. Karunapala and the Grama Sevaka had

been led thereafter.

In X8, the Board has accepted the position that there are coconut trees and a

cinnamon plantation on the said land, that the Petitioner visits the property once in

two months and her husband visits the property once a month, and that the said

14

land is being looked after by Karunapala. The question as to why the Petitioner and

her husband would visit the land unless they were in possession thereof does not

appear to have crossed the mind of the Board.

The Board has thereafter arrived at the following findings:

(a) The Petitioner has not led any evidence about the yield from the said land;14

(b) Although the Petitioner has stated that she obtains an income from the

property, she has failed to show how she obtains an income;15

(c) Even though the Petitioner has stated that Karunapala is the caretaker of the

said property, she has not stated how the income from the said land is obtained

from Karunapala and whether she obtains coconut from the property when she

visits the said property;16

(d) The Petitioner does not mention about Sarath, their caretaker prior to 2006 in

her evidence;

(e) Sarath describes the land as a land which is 100 perches in extent;

(f) The Grama Niladari who gave evidence assumed duties only a few months

before the Petitioner made this application to the Board. She has given

evidence of what she has heard and not from what she knows.

The Board had thereafter concluded as follows:

It is apparent from the above that the Board, instead of considering the evidence of

the Petitioner on the core issue of possession, was looking for contradictions

between the evidence of the various witnesses, which was irrelevant to the core

issue that the Board was called upon to decide. In any event, a perusal of the

evidence contained in the proceedings X5(g)-(f) reveal several inconsistencies

between the evidence that was led before the Board and with the conclusions

reached by the Board.

The Board has held that the Petitioner has not led any evidence about the yield that

she obtains from the said land, and although she has stated that she obtains an

income from the property she has failed to show how she obtains an income. In her

evidence on 17th January 2017 the Petitioner has stated as follows:17

16

The fact that the produce is taken by the Petitioner has therefore clearly been

established by the evidence of Sarath, but appears to have been inadequate for the

Board.

The Board has concluded that even though the Petitioner has stated that Karunapala

is the caretaker of the said property, she has not stated how the income from the

said land is obtained from Karunapala and whether she obtains coconut from the

property when she visits the said property.

The above extracts from the evidence of the Petitioner and the other witnesses quite

clearly illustrates that the Petitioner was earning an income from the cinnamon

plantation and the 10 coconut trees in her property. The explanation of the Board as

to why the evidence led in respect of the income earned from the cinnamon

plantation and the 10 coconut trees is inadmissible or inadequate does not stand to

reason and is not supported by the evidence. Therefore, in the absence of any

evidence of the Respondents to contradict the evidence, I am of the view that the

19 Vide pages 7 and 8 of the proceedings of 17th January 2017 marked X5(d). 20 Vide page 5 of the proceedings dated 12th June 2017 marked X5(f).

Board has erred in concluding that the Petitioner has not established that she earns

an income and the yield from the property.

Thus, there was clear evidence before the Board to establish that the Petitioner was

in possession of the land. The Board has however gone onto consider matters which

are irrelevant to the core issue. In my view, the most important factor was that the

Petitioner did not hand over possession of the land to the 10th Respondent at the

time the Deed was executed. The fact that the Board was mindful of this issue is

evident by the decision taken by the Board, at the end of the evidence of the

Petitioner on 17th January 2017, to issue a special notice to the 11th 15th

Respondents to be present before the Board to provide evidence with regard to

possession. Having done that, the Board completely failed to take into consideration

this issue in determining possession.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that the Order of the Board marked X8

is not supported by the evidence that was led before the Board, and is therefore

unreasonable and irrational. The said Order is therefore liable to be quashed by a

Writ of Certiorari.

There is one other matter that I wish to advert to. The learned Counsel for the 12th

Respondent submitted that the Petitioner has failed to exhaust the remedy provided

in Section 54 of the Ordinance, which reads as follows:

"The Board may, of its own motion or on application made by any person

interested, within three months from the making of an order by the Board

dismissing an application, or granting a certificate, or approving a settlement,

or before the payment of the compounded debt has been completed, review any

order passed by it and pass such other in reference thereto as it thinks fit.

The applicability of Section 54 was considered by this Court in Mulla Vidanalage

Indika Pushpamala vs Deshapriya Jayarathna and Others,21 where having referred to

several decisions of the Supreme Court and this Court relating to the need to exhaust

alternative remedies prior to invoking the Writ jurisdiction of this Court, it was held

as follows:

21 CA (Writ) Application No. 345/2018; CA Minutes of 12th October 2020.

I do agree that the Petitioner could have invited the Board to review their

decision in terms of Section 54. However, I am not inclined to refrain from

granting relief solely due to the failure on the part of the Petitioner to resort to

Section 54, for three reasons. The first is, for the reasons already discussed, the

decision of the Board is illegal. The second is, what is provided for by Section 54

is not a right of appeal, which means that there will not be a re-consideration of

all the facts during the review stage, unlike in an appeal. The third reason

follows the second. I have my doubts whether Section 54 is an effective

alternative remedy. In my view, the effectiveness of the remedy provided by

Section 54 is dependent on the grievance of the Petitioner. Where the power of

review is limited to the Order already made, I have my doubts whether the

Board can re-visit the circumstances that were not considered in the Order, or in

other words, act like how an appellate body would do, and re-consider all the

circumstances, thereby addressing the grievance of the Petitioner.

Taking into consideration all of the above circumstances, and the fact that the

Writ of Certiorari is a discretionary remedy, I am not obliged to automatically

dismiss this application owing to the failure on the part of the Petitioner to act

in terms of Section 54. I am of the view that the interests of justice demand that

I should exercise the discretion vested in this Court in favour of the Petitioner.

I am of the view that the failure to invoke the provisions of Section 54 of the

Ordinance does not disentitle the Petitioner from invoking the jurisdiction conferred

on this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution.

I accordingly issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Order marked X8. The Board

shall accordingly entertain the application of the Petitioner and proceed to hear the

said application in terms of the provisions of the Ordinance. I make no order with

regard to costs.
