Doctrine is one of the policy, grounded on theory that security and certainty require that accepted and established legal principle, under which rights may accrue, be recognized and followed, though later found to be not legally sound, but whether previous holding of court shall be adhered to, modified, or overruled is within court's discretion under circumstances of case before it. When point of law has been settled by decision, it forms a precedent which is not afterwards to be departed from, and, while it should ordinarily be strictly adhered to, there are occasions when departure is rendered necessary to vindicate plain, obvious principles of law and remedy continued injustice. The doctrine is not ordinarily departed from where the decision is of long-standing and rights have been acquired under it, unless considerations of public policy demand it. The doctrine is limited to actual determinations in respect to litigated and necessarily decided questions and is not applicable to dicta or obiter dicta.",

    "text": "Absolute provisions must be obeyed absolutely whereas directory provisions may be fulfilled substantially (Vide- Woodward vs Sarson (1875) (L.R.10 cp 733 at 746). No universal rule can be laid down for determining whether a provision is mandatory or directory. It is the duty of Courts of Justice to try to get at the intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the Statute to be construed per Lord Campbell in Liverpool Borough Bank vs Turner (1860) (2 De CF. & J 502 at 508) Vita Food Products vs. Unus Shipping Co. (1939 A.C. 377 at 393). Each Statute must be considered separately and in determining whether a particular provision of it is mandatory or directory one must have regard to the general scheme to the other sections of the Statute. The Queen vs. Justices of the County of London County Council (1893) 2 Q.B. 476 at 479). It is also stated that considerations of convenience and justice must be considered. Pope vs. Clarke (1953) (2 A.E.R. 704 at 705). Then again, it is said that to discover the intention of the Legislature it is necessary to consider-(1) The Law as it stood before the Statute was passed. (2) The mischief if any, under the old law which the Statute sought to remedy and (3) the remedy itself. (Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, Edition 12 page 160). These are all guidelines for determining whether Parliament intended that the failure to observe any provision of a Statute would render an act in question null and void. They are by no means easy of application and opinions are bound to differ. Indeed, some cases there may be where the dividing line between mandatory and directory is very thin. But the decision has to be made. I will therefore examine the Statute bearing in mind these guidelines.",

The real question in all these cases is this: A thing has been ordered by the legislature to be done. What is the consequence if it is not done? In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all voids. On the other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the legislature could have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters which must be strictly obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow must come to an end.",

A decision often takes its colour from the question involved in the case in which it is rendered.

The only thing binding as an authority upon a subsequent Judge is the principle upon which the case was decided.

The task of finding the principle is fraught with difficulty as without an investigation into the facts, it cannot be assumed whether a similar direction must or ought to be made as a measure of social justice. Precedents sub silentio and without argument are of no moment.

The only thing, says the same distinguished judge in another case, in a judges decision binding as an authority upon a subsequent judge is the principle upon which the case was decided. The only judicial principles which are authoritative are those which are thus relevant in their subject matter and limited in their scope. All others, at the best are distinguished from them, under the name of dicta or obiter dicta, things said by the way.

Board cannot be faulted for getting the appeal fixed for hearing as stated above since it is the duty and function of the Secretary of the Board to fix a date and time for hearing and to notify the parties. If it was the intention of the legislature that hearing should be concluded within 2 years from the date of filing the petition or that the time period of 2 years begins to run from the date of filing the petition, there could not have been a difficulty to make express provision, in that regard. I do agree with the view of the State Counsel. Hearing no doubt commences from the date of oral hearing.

He referred to the Sinhala version of Item 31 of the Inland Revenue Act and submitted that it refers to both profits and income of an undertaking and it makes reference to an individual and thus, the concessionary rate in Item 31 applies to both the business profits and income of such an undertaking who is either an individual or company. On this basis, Dr. Shivaji Felix contended that the concessionary tax rate referred to in Item 31 applies to an individual who is engaged in renting warehouses, and thus, the income received by the Appellant from renting warehouses qualifies for the preferential rate of tax, independent of whether rents received by such individual constitute business income or rental income.",

The Court took the view that the income derived by the company from shops and stalls is income received from the property and such income shall be treated as income from the house property and not income from a business (paragraph 3). The Court based its decision in the context of the main objective of the company and took the view that letting out of the property was not the object of the company at all. The Court was of the opinion that the character of that income which was from the house property had not altered because it was received by the company formed with the object of developing and setting up properties.

According to the schedule of premises listed out for the purpose of the Interpretation Committee at page 37 of the brief, the same premises (415/4/1/1 and 415/4) are being used for storage and office by Excel Trading.

The profits earned in such a case are referable, not to the exercise of the rights of property or of occupation since the customers come on to the land for the purpose of obtaining refreshment or procuring the benefit of the services. If on the other hand, the owner of land having (let me suppose) a remarkable view or some historic monument merely allows the public to come on to the land in return for an admission fee, I cannot myself see why it should be said that his profits are not covered by the Schedule A assessment since all that he is doing is to exploit his right of property by grating licences to come upon the land. The fact that he keeps the paths in order or the monument in repair in order to make a visit more attractive to the public again appears to me to make no difference, any more than does the action of the landlord of a house in keeping it in repair.",
