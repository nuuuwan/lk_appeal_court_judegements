    "text": "[22] The main complaint of Mr. Mahawanniarachchi was that the information regarding the dispute should have been filed in the Primary Court with the least possible delay after the dispute occurred on 08.01.2010 but the information in question was filed on 20.04.2010 and accordingly, the learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to make any determination due to inordinate delay in filing the information under section 66 (1)(a) of the Act. Now the question is this: What is the exact point in time the Police Officer is required to file the information under section 66 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act? Is it at every point in time when any dispute affecting land arises or only where any dispute affecting land is escalated to a point where a breach of the peace is threatened or likely between the parties.",

The Affidavits filed by the Appellants contractor Sirajuudeen (2V13) and his cousins, Nasheeth Abdul Cader (2V23 (a) and Muslih Abdul Cader (2V10) corroborate this position. The conduct of the Appellant in sending a prompt complaint from Sudan by fax on 26.02.2010 itself shows his intention to exercise control and retain power over the disputed premises and the house standing thereon.
