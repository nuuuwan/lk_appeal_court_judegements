Argued On 22.06.2021

Decided On 13.07.2021

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the order dated

28.5.20 of the learned High Court Judge of Puttlam.

The petitioner had been indicted under the Offences against the Public

Property Act nu 12 of 1982 for criminal misappropriation of funds belonging to

the Peoples Bank while serving as a senior executive of the bank. Upon

Page 3 of 5

Conclusion of the trial the petitioner had been found guilty and was sentenced

to 10 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine and a default sentence.

Upon being convicted the petitioner filed an appeal and a bail application

pending the appeal.

According to the provisions of the Offences against the Public Property act if an

accused is convicted under the said act he or she can obtain bail only on

exceptional circumstances.

The petitioner has filed the instant application for bail on the grounds that he is

suffering from TRIPPLE VESSEL DESEAS which needs CORONARY BYPASS

urgently.

In order to substantiate the position of the petitioner he has filed a medical

report obtained from the Nawaloka Hospital but the learned High Court Judge

has rejected the same.

The submissions made before this court by the counsel of the petitioner is that

the learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself by rejecting the medical

reports of the petitioner and the learned High Court judge has further

misdirected himself by not considering the permanent disability of the

petitioner caused by a motor traffic accident, therefore that is a ground which

needs to be considered as exceptional to enlarge the petitioner on bail pending

the appeal.

The position of the respondents is that there is no illegality or misdirection on

the part of the learned High Court Judge and the grounds submitted by the

petitioner are not exceptional.

Upon considering the submissions of both parties the petitioner has undergone

a bypass surgery at the Cooperative Hospital in Galle and has been treated for

post-operative care in the Karapitiya Hospital but due to the pandemic

situation in the country he has been transferred to the prison hospital in Galle.

The legal basis this court must consider has been set out in the Code of

Criminal Procedure Code act nu 15 of 1979 and the bail act and more so

according to several decided cases in our legal history bail pending appeal is

considered upon exceptional circumstances, but in the instant case the

petitioner has been indicted and convicted under Offences against the Public

Property act under which bail upon conviction can be considered only on

exceptional conditions, it is so said in section 8(2) of the act. Thus it is

abundantly clear in the act itself how bail should be granted.

In the Supreme Court judgment by her Ladyship Thilakawardena J it has been

very clearly said that exceptional circumstances only exist when the facts and

circumstances of the case are such that they constrain or compel Court to the

granting of bail

As very clearly put in the above case it is very obvious that exceptional

circumstances has to be considered in each case according to the facts of each

case, hence in the instant case the attention of this court is drawn to the report

from the Consultant Cardio Surgeon at the hospital in which the petitioners

Bypass surgery had been done, had stated that until the lapse of 90 days the

petitioner should be in sterile conditions and care, and the surgery had been

done on 23rd April , hence stipulated period is not yet over.

Therefore this court is of the opinion that the above recommendation of the

Consultant Surgeon compels this Court to enlarge the suspect on bail.

Therefore the order dated 28.5.20 is hereby revised and set aside and the

instant application for revision is allowed and the petitioner is enlarged on

following conditions of bail,

1) A cash bail of Rs 100000/, 2) Two sureties to the value of Rs 500000/ each 3) The petitioner to report to the relevant police station on every last

Sunday of each month.

The registrar of this Court is hereby directed to convey the instant order to the

relevant High Court.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
