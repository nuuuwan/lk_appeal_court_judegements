no sentence was imposed. For the convicted accused, the following sentences

were imposed. On count No 1, 6 months rigorous imprisonment, on the second

count which is for causing the murder of Mohamed Ramiz the death sentence was

Being aggrieved with the conviction and the sentence, the 1st to 4th and 6th

and the 7th accused have preferred their appeal to this Court. By judgment dated

16.06.2017, the judgment of the High Court was affirmed.

Aggrieved by the decision of this Court, an appeal has been preferred to

the Supreme Court where leave was granted on the Questions of Law submitted

for consideration. By order dated 4.3.2020 the Supreme Court has set aside the

judgment of this Court dated 16.6.2017 and referred the matter back to this Court

to hear and determine the appeals of the convicted accused expeditiously.

On 8.4.2021 and 5.5.2021 the appeals were argued before this Court.

Presidents Counsel Mr. Nalin Laduwahetty appeared for 2nd to the 4th and the 7th

Appellants and Presidents Counsel Mr. Shanaka Ranasinghe appeared for the 1st

and the 6th accused appellants.

Written submissions have been submitted on behalf of all the appellants. It

is noted that there is no written submissions submitted by the Respondent on the

main appeal, however, written submissions by the respondent filed of record

pertains to a preliminary objection taken by the appellants that they were not

given a jury option, which preliminary objection has been overruled by order

5

dated 29.09.2015 by Justice H. N. J Perera (as he then was) with Justice

K.K.Wickremasinghe.

The grounds of appeal of all the appellants can be summarized as follows;

That the learned trial judge failed to assess properly that the evidence of

the prosecution witnesses specially, witnesses PW 1 and PW 2 lack credibility,

given the fact their evidence is contradictory and inconsistent; the failure to

consider that the short history given to the doctor by PW 2 totally contradicts the

evidence given at the trial; failure to consider that the dock identification is bad

in law as there is no proper identification in this case; that the learned trial judge

has erred in law by convicting the appellants under the charge of Unlawful

Assembly.

The facts of the case, albeit briefly is as follows;

According to the evidence of PW 1, on 16.11.2013, around 3 am, during

the Ramadan period, she had heard some cries from outside when she was waiting

for her step brother PW 2 who she has sent to bring some fruits from a nearby

boutique.

She had run out of the house and tripped on some object she identified as

the injured Rizmi, now deceased. Her query as to who assaulted him was

unanswered and his mouth had been filled with blood and he had made only a

gurgling sound. After shouting for help, she had run to his house which was close

by and informed the inmates in the house. It was her evidence that she saw about

5 people near the mosque which was about 200 meters from where Rizmi was

fallen, but had not recognized any of them.

6

People had gathered to the place where Rizmi was fallen when she returned

after informing about Rizmi . She has seen PW 2 walking towards the gathered

crowd bleeding from his head. She had inquired from him what happened but he

has not answered. Thereafter, she has taken him by a three wheeler first to the

Police Station then to the hospital. On the way to the Police Station, near the

petrol shed PW 2 had answered her question as to who assaulted him stating it

was Hariz, Rizmi, Razeek, Rizwan, and Liyakath .Thereafter, he had fainted.

These names she has stated in her police statement.( Page 106 of the brief). It is

noted that although she had said that her brother said 4 names, in her answer five

names have been mentioned.

: ?

: ,, , , .

It is to be stated that throughout the proceedings, the names of the accused

have been written in different ways by the stenographers and as practical as

possible the names will be referred to in Sinhala with reference to the pages in

the brief for easy reference.

Further, although the witnesses have given evidence in Sinhala, it is to be

noted that they are not fluent in Sinhala language and therefore, the evidence

should be carefully assessed and understood giving consideration to the limitation

of the knowledge of the language. In pages 126 and 137 of the brief, PW 2 has

stated about his not being fluent in the Sinhala language.

PW 1 has not seen the actual attack but, when cross examined,she had

stated that the names of the 4 assailants as stated by her brother on their way to

the Police Station she had informed the Police. (page 122 of the brief)

7

: ?

: , , , . . .

PW 1 has further stated that she was unaware of any existing animosity

among the deceased, injured and the accused, but they live in close proximity to

each other. However, she has mentioned that there had been a recent incident

where one of her nieces had been struck by the motorcycle ridden by the nephew

of the person called Liyakath ,who is the 1st accused, and they had stopped

communicating with each other. However, after the matter was resolved by the

police, they were on talking terms once again.

In cross examination she had denied knowledge of any incident the

previous night or about any disputes between people from Mahagoda and

Maradana. (Page 118 of the brief). However, it appears that these suggestions by

the defence counsel appeared to be without any logical basis or solid evidence.

PW 1 has identified the accused appellants mentioned by PW 2 at the trial.

This identification can be accepted as she has testified that all the accused were

known to her as they were living close to her residence. However, her

identification is limited to what was conveyed by PW 2 and not as the persons

who attacked the deceased or PW 2.

The only eye witness PW 2 has testified that when he was returning from

the boutique he saw about seven people assaulting Ramiz. When he had

questioned why they were attacking him, the 1st accused is alleged to have

answered that as the deceased attacked him he was going to kill him and not to

interfere or else he too would be killed.

8

Further, when PW 2 asked them not to assault so severely, the 1st accused

appellant has attacked him with a Manne knife saying he (PW 2) was warned

not to interfere. PW 2 has clearly testified that the 1st accused Liyakan and 3rd

accused Hariz were carrying knives and the others were possessed with clubs at

that time.

In Page 128 of brief;

: ?

: , , , ,

. . . . . , , . . : ? : . . , , , . , .

PW 2 has testified about the place of incident as under the mango tree near

the mosque and there was sufficient light to identify from the lamp post that was

there. This evidence about the lamp post at the scene of the incident was

corroborated by a police witness.

In page 107 of the brief, PW 2 has identified Liyakath as the 1st accused,

Ramaz as the second accused, Hariz. as the 3rd accused, Rizwan as the 4th accused

who live in close proximity to each other. Names of the other accused had been

disclosed later as per the evidence in pages 162 and 163 of the brief where in

cross examination PW 2 has stated that after he left the hospital, in a statement to

9

the Police, he has given the names of Liyakath, Hariz, Ramaz, Rizwan, Naizer,

Manzoor as the assailants who were involved in the fight as follows.

In page 162 and 163 of the brief;

: .?

: .

. , , , , ,

.

The suggestion by the defence Counsel that the names of 5 to 7 accused

were not given in the statement to the hospital police was denied by PW 2, and

that fact has been highlighted as an omission.

According to his evidence PW 2 has given a statement to the Police on

18.11. 2003. In page 162, PW 2 had testified to a subsequent statement made by

him to the police. Therefore, the defence cannot be now allowed to say that they

were unaware of a second statement by PW 2. In page 163 PW 2 has given the

names of seven people who were involved in the incident which has not been

challenged in cross examination.

PW 2 has clearly testified that when he saw Rizmi being attacked by several

persons who he identified in page 128 as , , , ,

that he intervened and he was threatened by Liyakath

not to interfere. Liyakath and Hariz had been carrying knives with them. This

evidence he has further expanded in page 163 to include , , ,

, , .

10

In Wannaku Arachchilage Gunapala vs Attorney General 2007 SLR,

Volume 1, page 273, it was held Absence of cross examination of a prosecution

witness of certain facts leads to the inference of admission of that fact.

In Sarwan Singh vs State of Punjab 220 AIC SC (111)3652 at 3655, 3656

it was stated It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has

declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross examination

it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.

The learned trial judge has clearly stated in his judgment, that the evidence

of PW 2 has not been challenged by the defence. In the light of the above

authorities, when the evidence of PW 2 is not challenged in cross examination, it

has to be concluded that such evidence is not disputed and thus accepted.

It has been established by medical evidence that PW 2 suffered injury to

his forehead area and that there was a compound depressed fracture of the left

frontal bone and that the CT Scan showed , Skull fracture, Brain Contusion, and

Pneumocephalus. It is fair and just to consider this injury when his evidence is

considered . PW 1 saw him walking, bleeding from head and initially he could

not answer her question as to who injured him, but later, after mentioning the 4

names of some appellants he had fainted. It is also important to consider his

evidence that although he has recovered from his head injury, sometimes he has

loss of memory and he could not continue with his visits to the medical clinic

because of financial difficulties. Nonetheless, he had revealed the names of the

other assailants to the police. These facts have to be considered in the background

of his head injuries.

11

Another important issue taken up by the appellants is where both

Presidents Counsel emphasising on the fact that in the short history given to

Dr Jayasena a person called YAKAR had been mentioned as the person who

assaulted PW 2, and that as such a person has not transpired in evidence, the

evidence pertaining to the identification is contradictory. Further, that the

evidence did not elicit a use of a sword in the incident as PW 2 has only testified

about a Manne knife.

The medical officers evidence relating to Yakar is hearsay evidence. The

following Indian Supreme Court authorities have explained what is expected of a

medical personnel who examines a patient or an accused person in a criminal case

very succinctly.

In Pattipati Venkaiah v State of Andra Pradesh AIR 1985 SC 1715

(Supreme Court of India)

At Para 16: A doctor is not at all concerned as to who committed

the offence or whether the person brought to him is a criminal or

an ordinary person, his primary effort is to save the life of the

person brought to him and inform the police in medico legal

cases.

Bhargavan v State of Kerala AIR 2004 SC 1058 (Supreme Court of India)

At para 20: So far as non-disclosure of names to the doctor, same is

really of no consequence. As rightly noted by the Courts below, his

primary duty is to treat the patient and not to find out by whom the

injury was caused.

12

In Dolawatte vs Attorney General 1986 (1) SLR 371 it was held that the

rules pertaining to hearsay evidence would apply if the person who gives the

history of the patient ( if it is not the patient) is not called as a witness. It went on

to state, .....Medical Report of the doctor was admissible under section 414(1)

of the Criminal Procedure Code. The doctor being obliged in the course of his

professional duty to make the entry under the relevant cage specifying case

history the provisions of section 32(2) of the Evidence Ordinance are applicable

to the admission of such an entry.

In the instant case, the doctor who made the entry was called as a witness,

and had admitted in page 200 of the brief that the patient informed him that he

was assaulted by Yakar. That evidence has not been elaborated.

It is trite law that Court cannot presume certain issues. However, the doctor

being a Sinhalese, who was speaking to a person whose mother tongue is

different, should have been questioned more closely by the Counsel. PW2 is

alleged to have been assaulted by Liyakath. In the doctors notes the person is

Yakar which has some similarity, and for a person not familiar with the names

of that community, the name may have sounded as it was written by him.

(emphasis added)

Be that as it may, PW 2 has specifically testified how and where he was

assaulted by Liyakath in page 128,129 of the brief as follows;

: ? : . . , , , . , .

13

: , , . : ? : . .

Considering all of the above it is my view that the learned trial judge has

very correctly concluded that it has been established beyond reasonable doubt

that it was the accused appellants who are responsible for the injuries caused to

PW 2.

One of the main grounds of appeal is that the learned trial judge failed to

consider the contradictory evidence given by PW 1 and PW 2. The learned

Counsel for the appellants submitted that the contradictory and inconsistent

evidence of PW 1 and PW 2 which go to the root of the case has not been

considered by the trial judge and as PW 2 contradicted himself on vital and

decisive points, his evidence is unreliable and unworthy of any credence.

One such contradiction is that in the evidence of PW 1 she has stated that

the names of the people who assaulted PW 2 was told to her in the three wheeler.

Whereas, PW 2 in his evidence has testified that after getting injured he walked

to her house, knocked on her door and after mentioning the names of the people

who assaulted him he fainted. In another instance he had testified that he told PW

1 about his injuries when she came out of the house in to the compound.

14

Another discrepancy that was highlighted by the Counsel for the appellants

was PW 1 stating she saw PW 2 walking towards where Rizmi was fallen and

from there she took him to the police station . However, contradicting it, PW 2

in his evidence had stated that after being assaulted, he slowly walked to his

sisters house where eventually he fainted.

The vital issue to be considered is how the incident occurred and the

persons involved in it, more than the place where she met the witness and at

what point it was conveyed to PW 1. As stated above , it has been elicited that

PW 2 was bleeding from the head after being assaulted with a cutting weapon

and rational thinking or a photographic memory of the sequence of events cannot

be anticipated or expected in such circumstances. Thus, at which place or at what

point the names of the assailants was mentioned is not a material point in this

case.

In Bhoginbhai vs State of Gujarat (1983) AIR SC 753 the Indian Supreme

Court held thus By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a

photographic memory and to recall the details of an incident .It is not if as a video

tape is replayed on the mental screen. Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected

to recall accurately the sequence of events which take place in rapid succession

or in a short time plan. A witness is liable to get or mixed-up when interrogated

later on.

In H.K.K. Habakkala vs Attorney General 2010 BLR at page 102 it was

held if contradiction is to be material it should be sufficient to create a

reasonable doubt in the evidence of the witness concerned.

15

Another omission that was highlighted (in page 164 ) is that PW 2 has

failed to mention the names of 5,6, and 7 accused in the police statement. In page

162 in cross examination PW 2 has stated that after being released from the

hospital he has given a statement to the police regarding the incident and

mentioned the names of Liyakanth, Hariz, Ramiz , Rizwan, Naiser and Mansoor.

The contradictory positions referred to by the learned Presidents Counsel

do not affect the root of the case and no doubt has arisen regarding the credit

worthiness of the prosecution witnesses by these contradictions and discrepancies

which cannot be considered as material contradictions in the given circumstances.

Thus, the learned trial judges conclusion that the contradictions were not

material and that the omission did not affect the root of the case or create a

reasonable doubt in the case can be upheld in our considered view.

Another ground of appeal contended by the Learned Presidents Counsel

for the appellants is that the Dock Identification is bad in law.

It was submitted by Presidents Counsel Mr.Laduwahetty that although

PW 2 testified about 7 people assaulting the deceased , the evidence does not

elicit that position. It is apparent that the names of the accused have been

mentioned on two separate occasions. Initially only 4 names have been mentioned

by PW 2 to his sister while travelling in the three wheeler.

From the police evidence it has been established that those 4 persons have

been taken in to custody on 17.11.2003 when they surrendered themselves to the

Police. (page 210), The 5th and the 6th accused have been taken into custody on

16

31.1.2004 (page 210) and the 7th accused has been taken into custody on

19.03.2004. (page 226)

At one point PW 2 has testified mentioning six names and what he stated

was about seven people were assaulting the deceased when he intervened. One

cannot expect him to be counting the number of people who were around the

person being assaulted, in the given circumstances. Nonetheless, these 7 accused

have been identified in the evidence of PW 2 particularly in pages 132, 133 and

163.

This is a criminal action. It is a trite fact that consequent to investigations

of any incident, persons involved are identified and arrested. Likewise in the

instant case it appears that the accused appellants have been taken in to custody

at various stages. Thereafter, it is the burden of the prosecution to prove its case

beyond reasonable doubt.

PW 2 has testified about the presence of the accused at the scene of the

crime armed with clubs and two manna knives. It has been established by medical

evidence that the deceased had cut injuries as well as injuries from blunt trauma.

It has been established that PW 2 has cut injuries. Therefore, the learned trial

judges conclusion that on evidence, the accused had been instrumental in causing

bodily injuries to the deceased is well founded and the trial judge has sufficiently

analysed and evaluated the evidence of the complicity of each accused appellant.

On perusal of evidence it is apparent that on behalf of the accused, several

contradictory suggestions have been put to the prosecution witnesses, specially

when the time frame mentioned is considered. In page 138 it had been suggested

that PW 2 was involved in an incident the previous night with Rizwi and Iqbal

attacking Liyakath in his house. Another suggestion was that PW 2 and Rizwi

17

had tried to cause injury with a knife to the mother and sister of Liyakath .that

morning and they were chased away by Liyakath and subsequently, some people

from the area had injured Rizwi and PW 2 .(Page 146 of the brief)

Another suggestion was that Rizwi had tried to assault a person called

Thushara. It has also been suggested that PW 2 and Rizwi were always having

disputes with the 1st to 4th accused appellants. These have been merely

suggestions without any corroborating evidence. It is apparent that these

contradictory positions had been suggested by the defence Counsel to PW 2

without any logical or solid basis. This shows that various defences have been put

forward on behalf of the appellants and that the defence was not consistent.

In page 166 the following contradictory position had been suggested by

the defence counsel.

: 3

1

, ?

: .

: ?

: .

On perusal of the evidence it is abundantly clear that neither with the

contradictory stances that was suggested to the accused nor with the evidence,

the creditworthiness of the witnesses was impaired.

18

The dock statements of the appellants have been considered by the trial

judge and the conclusion that the Dock Statements have not cast any doubt in the

evidence of the prosecution evidence can be upheld.

It has been clearly established by evidence that the accused were well

known to the witnesses PW 1 and PW 2 as they were from the same area. In such

circumstances there was no need to hold an identification parade and no prejudice

has been caused to the appellants, by not holding an Identification Parade.

It was also contended on behalf of the appellants that as the charge was to

be under unlawful assembly, in order to fulfill that requirement the names of 7

people have been submitted and that the learned trial judge should have

considered whether the legal requirement to maintain a charge under unlawful

assembly could be maintained.

PW 2 has testified naming the seven accused who were at the place of

incident. Hariz and Liyakath were armed with manne knives and the others with

clubs. This material evidence was not challenged when it was opportune and

possible to challenge. Neither the plea of alibi of 2, 4, 6 and 7 appellants nor the

defence of any of the appellants have created a doubt in PW 2s evidence. The

medical evidence corroborates the evidence of PW2 in as much as it was

established that there were blunt trauma injuries on the deceased that could be

caused by being assaulted with clubs.

The common object of unlawful assembly alleged in count one and two

are, causing the death of Rizmi and the attempted murder of PW 2 respectively.

It is up to the prosecution to prove that these offences were committed in

furtherance of the common object.

19

In Ajith Samarakoon s The State 2994 2 SLR page 208 at page 230

Ninian Jayasuriya J held, that evidence not challenged or impugned in cross

examination can be considered as admitted and is provable against the accused.

On a consideration of the evidence of PW 2, it can be accepted that the

prosecution has proved that each accused was a member of the unlawful

assembly, at the time the offences were committed. The common object of the

unlawful assembly was the infliction of serious bodily injury on the deceased

and PW2. It is in evidence that Liyakath had stated that he is going to kill Rizmi

and if PW 2 interferes he too would be killed. The other appellants have been

present at the place of incident.

In King vs Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254, Soertz J stated once they were

found to be members of an unlawful assembly, the extent of their participation is

immaterial when we are considering their liability in law. In regard to their

liability they also serve who only stand and wait.

Therefore, the argument of the Counsel for the appellants does not arise for

consideration as the learned trial judge has sufficiently evaluated and analysed

the evidence to come to his conclusion on that legal issue.

The trial judge had the benefit of observing the language, expression, the

manner of giving evidence in the examination in chief and cross examination of

the witnesses. The demeanour and the deportment of the evidence of these

witnesses would have assisted him in his conclusions.

In Sigera Vs Attorney General 2011 1 SLR 201, it was held that an Appeal

Court will not interfere with the findings of facts of a trial judge who has the

20

privilege and the advantage of hearing and observing the demeanour and

department of witnesses as and when they gave evidence in court.

In the dock statements of the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 7th appellants they have

referred to a plea of alibi which has not seriously impugned the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses.

It is apparent that the learned judge has drawn proper inferences from the

evidence that has been elicited and proved.

For the reasons given above in the judgment, it is my considered opinion

that there is no merit in any of the grounds of appeal urged by the defence and

there is no justification in interfering with the verdict, findings or the sentence

imposed by the learned trial judge.

Accordingly, the conviction and sentence is affirmed of all the appellants.

The appeal is dismissed.
