For the Petitioner.

For the 6th Respondent

Argument: By Written Submissions

Date of Judgment: 17.11.2021

JUDGMENT

The petitioner, by his application, seeks a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari to quash

the order dated 3rd July 2018, which dismissed the petitioner's application to the Debt

Conciliation Board. Another writ of certiorari to quash the order dated 20th September 2018 for

rejecting the petitioner's application to review the order made on 3rd July 2018.

A writ of mandamus to direct the 1st 6th Respondents to review the order made on 03.07.2018

or in the alternative to issuing a writ of mandamus directing 1st 6th Respondents to conduct a

retrial based on amended application by the petitioner. Both parties presented their argument

based on the facts argued before this court.

The petitioner had filed his application before the Debt Conciliation Board against the 7th

Respondent. His application was that the two deeds executed are for loans from the 7th

Respondent and her relatives. At the time of executing the deeds, the Petitioner had no intention

of alienating the property to the 7th Respondent.

However, dishonouring the agreement, the 7th Respondent started to consider the transaction

as an outright sale of the land. The matter was taken up at the Debt Conciliation Board, where

both parties presented their case. At the inquiry, Attorneys-at-Law had represented both parties

and evidence had been let and cross-examined the witnesses. After a full inquiry, the three

members of the board had pronounced their order with reasons. To which the Petitioner had

sought to file an application to reconsider.

After considering, the Debt Conciliation Board members had decided that since they have

already considered and reasoned out, there is no reason to reconsider. Even though the

petitioner argues for setting aside these orders, he failed to reason out any valid reason why

that should be done. Unless the petitioner can satisfy this court as to any fault of the members

of the Debt Conciliation Board or any reasons to believe that an injustice had happened to the

Petitioner, this court should not disturb a decision taken after a lengthy inquiry where both

parties had been represented by Attorneys-at-Law.

The Petitioner set out that he had tried to amend his petition, which the Board rejected. Once

the Petitioner abandons his application to amend and face the inquiry, he has no legal status to

seek a retrial on the abandoned amended application. When rejecting the so-called application

to amend, the petitioner should have asked for the writ he is asking for now.

As the Petitioner had been sleeping and not been vigilant on his case, this court is not in a

position to make any order regarding the petitioner's application. On these grounds, I reject the

petition of the Petitioner.
