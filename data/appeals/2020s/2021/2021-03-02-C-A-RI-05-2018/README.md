c.P. Kirtisinghe - J

01 and 02 petitioners-petitioners-petitioners (hereinafter

referred to as petitioners) are seeking to revise/ set aside the judgement and

interlocutory decree entered in this case, to set aside the order dated 27.01.2018,

for a direction to add the petitioners as defendants and to allow them to tender

their statements of claim, for a direction to the lea rned District Judge to issue a

fresh commission to the surveyor or the Surveyor General to ascertain the

boundaries of the corpus, to dismiss the partition action and to restore the status

quo.

3

The plaintiff-respondent-respondent-respondent (herein after

referred to as the plaintiff) had instituted this partition action to partition the corpus in this case namely "Lot 04 of Lot 08 of Maanagoda Kurunduwatta" which is morefully described in the schedule to the plaint. It is common ground that it is a

sub division of a larger land which was partitioned in an earlier partition action

bearing no. 30701P in DC Kalutara. In the final plan marked X3 it is shown as Lot 04.

In the earlier partition action this lot had been allotted to the predecessors of the

plaintiff and the defendant and the adjoining Lot no. 03 had been allotted to the opt petitioner.

The corpus in this case is depicted as lots no. 01,02,03 in the preliminary plan no. 2133 prepared by surveyor Jayasuriya. The judgement in this

case was pronounced on 13.09.2006 and the interlocutory decree was entered

accordingly. Thereafter the surveyor had surveyed the land to prepare the final scheme of partition. The petitioners state that the plaintiff attempted to show the

boundaries of the corpus within Lot 03 claimed by the petitioners. There after the

petitioners had made an application to the District Court under section 839 of th e

civil procedure code seeking relief and the court after holding an inquiry had dismissed this application on 27.01.2017.

The learned counsel for the defendant respondent submitted that

there is a long delay on the part of the petitioners which is not explained. He submitted that the preliminary plan had been prepared in 1993 and the judgement

had been entered on 13.09.2006. The learned District Judge had refused the application of the petitioners on 27.01.2017. But the petitioners had made this application to this court on 20.03.2018. The Petitioners have explained the delay.

The petitioners say that the surveyor did not erect or identified any boundaries at

the preliminary survey. Therefore the petitioners could not have come to know that a portion of their land had come into the corpus in this case and the petitioners had no cause to complain at the stage. It is only at the final survey that the petitioners

came to know that a portion of their land had been included into the corpus. Therefore the delay is explained up to that point. There after the petitioners had made an attempt to intervene into the partition action which was refused. The leave to appeal application which was filed against that order in the Provincial High Court was withdrawn on 05.03.2018.

4

In the case of Rathnayake Vs Sarath, Divisional Secretary

Thihagoda reported in (2004) 3 SLR 95 the petitioner had made an unsuccessful

application in the Provincial High Court of Matara causing delay and it was held that

in those circumstances the period during which the proceedings were pending in

the Provincial High Court is neither undue delay nor is it unexplained. In the case of

Bisomanika Vs Cyril De Alwis (1982) 1 SLR 368 it was held that if the petitioner had

been seeking relief elsewhere in a manner provided by law he cannot be guilty of

culpable delay. Therefore in this case the petitioners have explained the delay and

they are not guilty of laches.

Identification of the Corpus

Identification of the corpus is of paramount importance in a

partition action. In the case of Sopinona Vs. Pitipana Arachchi 2010 (1) SLR 87

where the parties had admitted the corpus shown in the preliminary plan Marsoof,

PCJ observed as follows;

"Before dealing with the first substantial question of law on which special leave had been granted by this Court in this appeal, it is necessary to deal with the question of identity of the land sought to be partitioned, which is a matter of vital importance in any partition case. Without proper identification of the corpus it would be impossible to conduct a praper investigation of title . ....... This is because clarity in regard to identity of the corpus is fundamental to the investigation of title in a partition cose. "

It is only after the identification of the corpu s that the

District Judge is embarked upon the task of investigation of title of the corpus.

Without proper identification of the corpus it would be impossible to conduct a

proper investigation of title.

In the schedule to the plaint the corpus in this case is described as follows,

The corpus in this case is a sub division of lot no. 4 of the final plan

no. 283 of DC Kalutara case no. 30701. The adjoining lot no. 3 of the same plan

claimed by the petitioners was also a lot partitioned in the same partition action.

The preliminary plan in this case shows that lot no. 3 borders the corpus to the East.

It is the case of the petitioners that a strip of land from lot no. 3 had been included

into the corpus at the final survey. It is apparent from the preliminary plan that

6

there are no physical demarcations of the boundaries of the corpus except on a

very small portion of the Eastern and Western boundaries towards the Northern

end where there is a wire fence and a wall in a comparatively very small extent in

those two boundaries. In the common boundary between the corpus and lot 3

which is in dispute there is no clear physical demarcation of the boundary such as

a wall, a wire fence or a live fence. The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent

submitted that the ditch shown in the preliminary plan is a physical demarcation of

the common boundary. We cannot agree with that submission. One cannot come

to the definite conclusion that it is a physical demarcation of the common boundary

as it can be a ditch formed by the natural flow of rain water and one cannot come

to the definite conclusion that the drain lies along the common boundary. In the

absence of such physical demarcations the plaintiff is not in a position to show the

exact boundary to the surveyor. In such a situation it is difficult to demarcate the

common boundary without superimposing, on the boundaries surveyed, the earlier

plans depicting the corpus. The schedule to the plaint refers to two earlier plans.

One is the final plan filed of record in the partition action no. 30701 upon which

lots 3 and 4 were partitioned. The other is the plan no. 976 upon which th e lot no.

4 was sub divided. The plaintiff had not made use of any of those plans to identify

the corpus. Superimposing the earlier partition plan no. 283 on the boundaries

surveyed in the preliminary plan was the best evidence to establish the identity of

the corpus and to demarcate the boundaries. That plan was available to the

plaintiff. But the plaintiff had not thought it fit to produce that plan to the

commissioner to identify the corpus properly. Therefore it can be presumed under

section 114-F of the evidence ordinance that if that plan was superimposed it

would be unfavorable to the plaintiff who withheld it. Therefore it appears that

7

there is some merit in what the petitioners say and they should be given an

opportunity to establish their case. The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent

and the defendant respondent submitted that the petitioners had not satisfied

court that there is an encroachment and there is no evidence to show that there is

an encroachment. Further the learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent

submitted that the petitioners did not complain to the surveyor about an

encroachment at the time of the preliminary survey. It is the case of the petitioners

that the surveyor did not demarcate the common boundary at the preliminary

survey. Therefore the petitioners could not have known at that stage that there is

an encroachment. As the petitioners were not parties to the partition action they

did not have an opportunity to show the encroachment in a plan. Had the surveyor

demarcated the boundary at the preliminary survey the petitioners could have

intervened at the preliminary survey as new claimants and shown the

encroachment in the preliminary plan. The petitioners had lost that opportunity. A

copy of the plaint is annexed to the commission for the preliminary survey. In the

schedule to the plaint the corpus is described as a sub division of lot no. 4 of the

final plan no. 283. Although a copy of the commission is not before us for perusal

the commissioner in his report had mentioned that the plan referred to in the

schedule to the plaint was not given to him by the plaintiff or the defendant. That

shows that the commissioner was conscious about his duty to identify the corpus

according to the earlier plan and depict in the preliminary plan the land described

in the schedu le to the plaint which is described with reference to the earlier

partition plan. In such a situation the commissioner shou ld have informed that fact

to court and sought further instructions from court before proceedings to

8

commence the preliminary survey. In the case of Uberis Vs. Jayawardhana 62 NlR

217 Basnayake, CJ held as follows;

"It is the duty of a Surveyor to whom the Commission is issued to adhere strictly to

its terms and locate and survey the land which is commissioned to survey. It is not

open to him to survey the land pointed out by one or more of the parties and prepare

and submit to Court the plan and report of such a survey. If he is unable to locate

the land he is commissioned to survey, he should so report to the Court and ask for

further instructions."

The Commissioner in this case had surveyed the corpus according

to the boundaries shown by the plaintiff and the plaintiff had not made any attempt

to give him a copy of the earlier partition plan. In the absence of physically

ascertainable boundaries and in the absence of the earlier partition plan the

Surveyor should have reported that to court and ask for further instructions before

surveying the land. Had he done so this litigation would not have arisen.

Citing the judgement of Paulis Vs. Joseph and Others

reported in 2005 (3) SLR 162 the learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent

submitted that as the petitioners were not parties to the partition action the

remedy of Restitutio - in - integrum is not available to the petitioners. The ratio

decidendi in that case will not apply to this case. In that case the petitioner was a

party to the action although she did not participate in the trial and following the

judgement of Kusumawathi Vs. Wijesinghe 2001 (1) SLR 238 th e Court of Appeal

held that it had power to grant the relief of Restitutio - In - Integrum. However it

is settled law that an application for Restitutio - In - Integrum can only be filed by

a party to a case (Perera Vs. Wijewickrama 15 NLR 411, Dissanayake Vs.

9

Elisinahami 1978/79 - (2) SLR 118, Ranasinghe Vs. Gunasekara 2006 - (2) SLR 393,

Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd Vs. Shanmugam 1995 - (1) SLR SS). But this is

not only an application for Restitutio - In - Integrum it is also an application for

revision. In the caption of the application it is stated thus "In the matter of an

Application for Revision or Restitutio integrum in terms of Article 138 and 145 of the

Constitution of Sri Lanka ....... "

In the case of Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thero Vs. Joslin reported in

2005 (3) SLR 25 the petitioner who was not a party to a partition action had filed a

revision application to set aside the judgement, interlocutory decree and the final

decree. In the circumstances of that case Justice Wimalachandra held that if the

Court of Appeal fails to invoke its power of revision grave injustice will result to the

petitioner and permitted the petitioner to intervene in the partition action and to

file a statement of claim.

In the case of Gnanapandithen and another Vs. Balanayagam and

another 1998 (1) SLR 391 the petitioner appellants had filed an application in the

Court of Appeal to set aside the judgement and the interlocutory decree entered

in a partition case. They were not parties to the partition action and they had

further sought an order directing the District Court to add them as party defendants

to the partition action and to permit them to file a statement of claim and

participate at the trial. The Court of Appeal had refused the application of the

petitioners. G.P.S. De Silva CJ held as follows;

"I am accordingly of the view thot the Court of Appeol was in serious error when it

declined to exercise its revisionary powers having regard to the very special ond

exceptional circumstonces of this partition case".

10

In the case of Somawathi Vs. Madawala and others 1983 (2) SLR

15 also a petitioner who was not a party to a partition action had moved the Court

of Appeal in revision and the Supreme Court held that the intervention should be

allowed. Soza J held as follows;

'The court will not hesitate to use its revisionary powers to give relief where a

miscarriage of justice has occurred . . . Indeed the facts of this case cry aloud for

the intervention of this court to prevent what otherwise would be a miscarriage

ofiustice".

Therefore th is court can intervene in the exercise of its revisionary

powers to set aside the judgement and interlocutory decree entered in this case to

avert the miscarriage of justice caused to the petitioners and exceptional

circumstances have arisen in this case for this court to exercise its extra ordinary

revisionary jurisdiction.

But in the circumstances of this case it is not necessary

to set aside the entire proceedings in the District Court which would cause

unnecessary hardship to the parties. There is no pedigree dispute in this case. The

petitioners are not challenging the pedigree and they are not claim ing for undivided

rights in the corpus. The dispute relates to the identification of the corpus.

Therefore we set aside the findings of the learned District Judge relating to the

identification of the corpus and direct the learned District Judge to permit the

petitioners to intervene in the partition action as added defendants, to permit

them to file a statement of claim and participate at the trial. We direct the learned

District Judge to amend the interlocutory decree accordingly after holding an

inquiry regarding the identification of the corpus.

11

The application of the petitioners is allowed. The plaintiff

respondent and the defendant respondent each shall pay a sum of Rs. 10,500.00 as

costs to the petitioners.
