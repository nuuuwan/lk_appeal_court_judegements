Before Menaka Wijesundera J.

Neil Iddawala J.

Counsel Janajith De Silva with Eranga Rathnayake for the petitioner.

Argued On 10.08.2021

Decided On 21.09.2021

Menaka Wijesundera J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the order dated

17.3.2021 of the learned High Court Judge of Chi law.

The accused petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) has been taken in to

custody initially for being in possession of nearly 1kg of heroin on 26.12.2016.

The Government Analyst has identified it to be 771 grams of heroin.

When a party files an application of this nature the party filling the same has to

establish before this Court that there are exceptional circumstances which shock the

Page 4 of 5

conscious of this Court. This principle has been very carefully set out in the following

two cases,

Dharmaratne and Another Vs Palm Paradise Cabanas Limited and others [2003] 3 Sri LR

24 at page 30.

Thus the existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the Court

selects the cases in respect of which this extraordinary method of rectification should

be adopted.

The practice of Court to insist on the exsistance of exceptional circumstances for the

exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep root in our law and has got hardened

into a rule which should not be lightly disturbed

Bank of Ceylon vs. Kaleel and Others. [2004] 1 Sri LR 284 at Page 287

In any event, for this Court to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged

must have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go beyond

an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it. In

other words, the order complained of is of such a nature which would have shocked the

conscience of Court.

In the instant application the Counsel for the Petitioner stated that he being a single

parent of a small child and the child suffering from a disease in blood the attention of

the Petitioner is very important and his incarceration is hampering the said situation

and he urged this Court to consider it as exceptional.

In the impugned order of the learned High Court Judge it has been said very correctly

that to substantiate the medical grounds of the child the Petitioner had not submitted

Page 5 of 5

any medical certificates. The position taken up by the Petitioner in this Court is that he

has annexed the same to the petition filed in this Court.

But we very strongly make a note that the said medical certificates have not been

submitted to the learned High Court Judge therefore the petitioner is submitting the

same to this Court for the first time.

But in an application for revision what the Court exercising the revisionary jurisdiction

must consider are the illegalities in the impugned order based on the material

submitted at the original court.

Therefore the position taken up by the Petitioner regarding the medical reports of the

child has not been put to the learned High Court Judge at the time of making the

impugned order. Therefore the said medical certificates are in fact new material which

has not been given the chance for the learned High Court Judge to consider.

Therefore upon the material submitted to the learned High Court Judge the impugned

order has been made in which we do not see any illegality, procedural irregularity, or

impropriety in the said order.

Therefore we do not see any exceptional circumstances to issue notices on the

respondents. Hence the instant application is dismissed.

Judge of the Court Of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
