It is clear these Writs come within the purview of administrative law which is a branch of law that has been developed by courts for the control of the exercise of governmental or statutory powers by mainly public authorities. The distinction between the Public Law and Private Law, which is a concept of recent origin in English law but, which has been a basic concept of Roman Law should be borne in mind in considering this matter.",

It is only granted to compel the performance of duties of a public nature and not merely of a private character that is to say for the enforcement of a mere private right stemming from a contract of the parties. The petitioner has failed to satisfy this court that he has a statutory right against the 01st to 03rd Respondents. Accordingly, we see no merit in the Application of the Petitioner. For all the above reasons, this court is not disposed to grant the discretionary remedy asked for. The Application is dismissed with cost.",
