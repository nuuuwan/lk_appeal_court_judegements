    "text": "The Petitioner was thereafter required to re-submit the budget for further consideration of the Pradeshiya Sabha. The Petitioner has partially complied with this obligation by re-submitting the budget on 21st December 2020. Having done so, the Petitioner has failed to afford the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha an opportunity of further considering the said budget. The Petitioner has also failed to have the budget passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha. As submitted by the learned Senior State Counsel for the 1st Respondent and the learned Presidents Counsel for the 4th -8th, 10th, 11th, 13th and 16th Respondents, the Petitioner has thrown all democratic norms out of the window. It is not disputed that the concession granted by Section 169 to enable a Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha to function in office even where a duly submitted budget has not been passed by a majority comes to an end after two years of being elected as Chairman, and that the provisions contained in the proviso to Section 169 is applicable thereafter. Once the budget is submitted to the Pradeshiya Sabha and debated and whatever the modifications or additions that a Chairman may agree during or after such debate, the budget must be submitted by the Chairman to the Pradeshiya Sabha for its decision. This is mandatory and is confirmed by the use of the word, decision in the proviso to Section 169. In terms of Section 14(1) read together with Section 14(2), a decision would mean a vote. I am therefore of the view that the Chairman agreeing to any modifications or additions that may be proposed by one or more or even all members does not suffice in order to claim that the budget has been passed. The claim that the Chairman agreed with the modifications and amendments and therefore the budget has been passed is a red herring. The budget must be passed by a majority vote if the Chairman wishes to avoid the deemed resignation being triggered. Where the Chairman re-submits the budget, he must provide the members an opportunity of further considering it and thereafter he must have the budget passed by a majority vote of the Pradeshiya Sabha. In my view, the crux of the matter is that the Chairman must ensure that he has in place a budget duly passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha by the due date. If he fails in this regard at whatever point of the process, he is deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman by operation of law. A Chairman who does not take a vote cannot be in a better position than a",

The Petitioner has failed in his obligation to have the budget passed in terms of Section 169 and therefore the consequence set out in the proviso to Section 169 has been triggered. The Petitioner is therefore deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman of the 1st Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha. The result is that there is a vacancy in the office of Chairman. This in my view is what was intended by the legislature when it introduced the proviso to Section 169 in 2012. I am therefore unable to agree with the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the factual circumstances of this application are outside the scope of the proviso to Section 169 of the Act. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that in any event, the impugned notice X18 is ultra vires the powers conferred on the 1st Respondent by Section 223 of the Act and Section 2 of the Provincial Councils (Consequential Provisions) Act No. 12 of 1989. To me, the series of events that followed the refusal by the Petitioner to place the re-submitted budget to a vote and have it passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha reflects the desperation on the part of the Respondents to ensure that the provisions of Section 169 are complied with. Even if the argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is accepted, nothing flows from X18 for the reason that X18 is only an intimation of a factual position that prevailed as at that date. In the above circumstances, I see no legal basis to issue formal notice of this application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.",
