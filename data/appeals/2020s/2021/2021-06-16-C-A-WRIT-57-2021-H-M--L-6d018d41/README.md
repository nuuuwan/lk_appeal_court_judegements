Before: Arjuna Obeyesekere, J / President of the Court of Appeal Mayadunne Corea, J Counsel: Thusitha Wijeskoon for the Petitioner

2021 Written Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 19th April 2021 Submissions:

Tendered on behalf of the 1st Respondent and 7th - 17th Respondents on 20th April 2021

Tendered on behalf of the 4th 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th and 16th Respondents on 22nd April 2021 Decided on: 10th June 2021 Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

The issue in this application relates to the failure on the part of the Petitioner, the

Chairman of the 1st Respondent, Padiyathalawa Pradeshiya Sabha to have the budget

of the 1st Respondent for the year 2021 passed by the members of the 1st

Respondent (i.e. the 3rd 21st Respondents), and the consequences that should flow

from such failure.

The Pradeshiya Sabha Act (the Act) has been enacted to provide for the

establishment of Pradeshiya Sabhas with a view to provide greater opportunities for

the people to participate effectively in the decision-making process relating to

administrative and development activities at a local level. In terms of Section 2(1) of

the Act, the Minister may, with a view to facilitating the effective participation of the

people in local government and development functions, by Order published in the

Gazette declare any area to be a Pradeshiya Sabha area for the purposes of the Act.

Section 3 provides that, the Pradeshiya Sabha constituted for each Pradeshiya Sabha

4

area shall be the local authority within such area and be charged with the regulation,

control and administration of all matters relating to public health, public utility

services and public thoroughfares and generally with the protection and promotion of

the comfort, convenience and welfare of the people and all amenities within such

area. It is observed that in addition to the above, the relevant Pradeshiya Sabhas are

responsible for the maintenance of public drains, waterways, public fairs, local

markets, lighting of streets and public places etc. Thus, a Pradeshiya Sabha plays a

very important role in the day to day lives of our people.

Members are elected by the People to the Pradeshiya Sabha every five years, with an

expectation that the members so elected would address the day to day issues of the

ward in an expeditious and efficient manner. However, not only should the elected

representatives of the People be efficient, they should ensure good governance at all

times and maintain strict financial discipline in respect of the funds of the local

authority and refrain from any abuse of power.

I shall at the outset consider the four provisions of the Act, which are particularly

relevant to the issue that has arisen for the determination of this Court, namely

Sections 14, 168, 169 and the proviso to Section 169 of the Act.

I shall commence with Section 168, in terms of which:

(1) The Chairman of every Pradeshiya Sabha shall each year on or before such

date and in such form as may be specified by rules, prepare and submit to

the Pradeshiya Sabha, a budget for the next succeeding year, and

containing an estimate of the available income and details of the proposed

expenditure for the ensuing year.

(2) Every Pradeshiya Sabha shall finally consider and adopt the budget

together with the amendments, if any, before the commencement of the

year to which such budget relates.

(3) The Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha may at any time prepare a

supplementary budget and lay it before the Pradeshiya Sabha

5

(4) The Pradeshiya Sabha may pass, modify or reject all or any of the items in

any budget or supplementary budget or add any item thereto.

The necessity for a Pradeshiya Sabha to have a budget for each year and the

obligation of the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha to take responsibility for the

preparation of the budget in terms of the law and thereafter submit the said budget

to the Pradeshiya Sabha for the Sabha to finally consider and pass the budget is

clearly established by Section 168.

As submitted by the learned Presidents Counsel for the 4th 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th and

16th Respondents, the ability of the Pradeshiya Sabha to carry out its statutory

functions in the following year is intrinsically linked to having a budget duly passed by

the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha, and demonstrates the ability of the Chairman

to command the confidence of the majority of the Pradeshiya Sabha as well as have

the necessary finances to attend to the day to day operations and the vital

developmental activities of the Sabha.

The next provision that is relevant to this application is Section 169 which reads as

follows:

If the Pradeshiya Sabha modifies or rejects all or any of the items in any or

supplementary budget or adds any item thereto and the Chairman does not

agree with any such decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha he shall re-submit the

budget or supplementary budget to the Pradeshiya Sabha for further

consideration. Where a budget or supplementary budget is not passed by the

Pradeshiya Sabha within two weeks after it is re-submitted, such budget or

supplementary budget shall, notwithstanding that it has not been passed by the

Pradeshiya Sabha, be deemed to be the duly adopted budget or supplementary

budget of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

The effect of Section 169 is that by operation of law, the budget submitted by the

Chairman shall be considered as the duly adopted budget of a Pradeshiya Sabha,

even though the said budget has not been passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha and

therefore does not have the support of the majority of the members of the

Pradeshiya Sabha. The law therefore has provided a concession to a Chairman of a

6

Pradeshiya Sabha to function for a period of two years, notwithstanding that he may

not have the support of the majority of the Pradeshiya Sabha to pass the budget. It

must be kept in mind that notwithstanding the above deeming provision, the

obligation placed on the Chairman by Section 168 to submit the budget to the

Pradeshiya Sabha must still be complied with, and that the concession under Section

169 extends only to a Chairman who submits a budget to the Pradeshiya Sabha and

permits the members to vote on the said budget.

It must be noted that in terms of Section 14 of the Act:

(1) All matters or questions authorized by this Act or by any other written law

to be decided by a Pradeshiya Sabha shall be decided upon by the

majority of members present at any meeting of the Pradeshiya Sabha held

in accordance with the provisions of this Act

(2) Where the votes of the members present at any meeting are equally

divided in regard to any question, the Chairman, Vice-Chairman or other

member presiding at the meeting shall, in addition to his vote as a

member, have a casting vote.

Thus, wherever the Act refers to a decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha or requires a

decision to be taken by the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha, it is imperative that

such decision is taken by way of a vote of the members present at a general or

special meeting of the Pradeshiya Sabha. This position is clearly reflected in Section

169 of the Act which requires a decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha upon the

submission of the budget and upon re-submission.

Section 169 was amended by Section 17 of the Local Authorities (Special Provisions)

Act No. 21 of 2012 by the insertion of the following proviso:

Provided that, if the Council according to sections 168 and 169 of this Act

modifies or rejects all or any items in any budget or supplementary budget or

adds any item thereto which was submitted to the Council at any time by the

Chairman after a period of two years since the commencement of the term of

office of the Council, and

7

if the Chairman does not agree to such decision of the Council,

he shall resubmit the said budget to the Council for further consideration.

Where a budget or supplementary budget is not passed by the Council within

two weeks after it is resubmitted for the second time,

the Chairman shall be deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman at

the end of the said period of two weeks.

Thus, with the introduction of the proviso in 2012, the concession provided to a

Chairman by Section 169 to continue in office notwithstanding his inability to have

the duly submitted budget passed by a majority of the members of the Pradeshiya

Sabha has been limited to the first two years of office. After the first two years, it is

not only imperative that the budget is submitted to the Pradeshiya Sabha, it is also

imperative that the budget is passed by a majority decision. The law has provided a

Chairman with two opportunities to do so. The difference between the first two

years and the next two years is that, in the latter two years, if the Chairman fails to

submit and have the budget approved at least at the second opportunity, the

Chairman shall be deemed to have resigned from his office.

In my view, Section 169 and the proviso contemplates two decisions of the

Pradeshiya Sabha which attracts the provisions of Section 14 and therefore requires a

vote by the Pradeshiya Sabha. The first is the decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha to

modify, add or reject the budget. The acceptance of a modification and/or an

addition, or the rejection of the budget as a whole, should be by way of a majority

vote of the Pradeshiya Sabha. The second is the decision of the Pradeshiya Sabha

whether to pass the budget that has been re-submitted by the Chairman.

The above provisions can be summarised as follows:

a) The obligation of preparing the budget is with the Chairman vide Section 168;

b) The obligation of submitting the budget to the Pradeshiya Sabha is with the

Chairman vide Section 168;

8

c) The budget must be passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha and the obligation of

having it passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha is at all times with the Chairman vide

Section 169;

d) In the first two years however, even if the budget is not passed, by operation of

law, the budget submitted by the Chairman is the duly adopted budget of the

Pradeshiya Sabha vide Section 169;

e) After the first two years, the Chairman must have the budget passed by the

Pradeshiya Sabha, for which he has been provided two opportunities vide the

proviso to Section 169;

f) After the first two years, the failure on the part of the Chairman to have the

budget passed on the two occasions afforded to him would attract the

consequences set out in the proviso to Section 169 i.e. the Chairman is

deemed to have resigned from office.

I shall now consider the facts of this application.

The Petitioner states that he contested the Local Government elections held in 2002

and was elected as a member of the 1st Respondent. He had thereafter been elected

as a member of the 1st Respondent in 2006, 2011 and 2018. The Petitioner has

functioned as the Leader of the Opposition until 2006 and has been the Chairman of

the 1st Respondent since then.

The Petitioner states further that the budgets submitted by him for 2019 and 2020

were passed without any dispute. He states that since the middle of 2019, he has had

issues with the 3rd Respondent, who is the Vice Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

He claims that the 3rd Respondent had tarnished his reputation which has resulted in

the Petitioner being suspended from his membership in the Sri Lanka Podujana

Peramuna. The Petitioner claims further that the 3rd Respondent is making all

endeavours to remove him from the post of Chairman, and that there is a division

among the members of the 1st Respondent elected from the Sri Lanka Podujana

Peramuna.

9

The Petitioner admits that he submitted the budget for the year 2021 to the Sabha at

its meeting held on 20th November 2020. The minutes of the meeting have been

marked X9. He states that only the 18th Respondent had proposed amendments to

the budget and that he accepted all the amendments that were presented. The 3rd

Respondent had thereafter called for a vote, to which the Petitioner had agreed, and

the budget had been defeated by 11 votes to 7, with the 18th Respondent too voting

against the budget. The Petitioner however states that in terms of Section 169 of the

Act, the budget of 2021 presented by the Petitioner should be considered as a duly

approved budget by the Sabha.

On 14th December 2020 - the 24th Respondent, the Assistant Commissioner of Local

Government, Ampara - had served on the Petitioner a letter dated 10th December

2020 marked X13 issued by the 23rd Respondent, the Commissioner of Local

Government, Eastern Province informing the Petitioner that if he is in agreement

with the amendments, he must incorporate same and re-submit to the Pradeshiya

Sabha for its approval. The Petitioner has disregarded the above intimation.

The Petitioner states that by letter dated 21st December 2020, he sought a

clarification from the 26th Respondent, the Secretary, State Ministry of Provincial

Councils and Local Government Affairs. A copy of the said letter sent by the

Petitioner has not been produced to this Court. The 26th Respondent has replied the

above letter on the same date vide X12 where he has stated that the Chairman

must re-submit the budget if the Chairman is not agreeable with the rejection. The

26th Respondent then goes onto state that in view of the reasons set out in the letter

sent by the Petitioner, it appears that the proviso in Section 169 does not apply as

the Petitioner has agreed with all the amendments proposed and that the budget

submitted by the Petitioner is the approved budget for 2021. Quite apart from the

letter by which advise has been sought not being tendered to this Court, in my view

X12 does not set out the correct legal position, particularly in respect of the

mandatory requirement in Section 169 of the Act to have the budget passed by the

vote of the Pradeshiya Sabha.

10

The next meeting of the 1st Respondent has been held on 28th December 2020.

According to the minutes of the said meeting marked X10, the following had

transpired:1

2021 jraIfha whjeh ixfYdaOs; iys;j iNd iusu; lsrSu 2021 jraIfha whjeh ixfYdaOk iys;j iNd iusu; lsrSug .re uka;S% vs.tus.oquskao

The Petitioner had thereafter made the following statement:2

It is clear from X10 that even though the Petitioner has re-submitted the budget on

28th December 2020:

a) The Petitioner has not provided the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha an

opportunity of further considering the budget;

b) The Petitioner has not called for a vote on the said amended budget;

c) The budget has not been passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha.

1 Vide page 19 of X10. 2 Vide page 19 of X10.

11

Instead, the Petitioner had declared that the amended budget has been duly

adopted.

The refusal of the Petitioner to act in terms of Section 169 and its proviso had

triggered a series of events culminating in the filing of this application.

The first is a letter dated 31st December 2021 marked X14 sent to the Petitioner by

the 24th Respondent, the Regional Assistant Commissioner of Local Government

informing the Petitioner that he cannot incur any capital expenditure as there is no

valid budget for 2021 due to the failure on the part of the Petitioner to have the

budget passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha.

The second is an Order made in terms of Section 185(3) of the Act and published in

Extraordinary Gazette No. 2209/73 dated 8th January 2021 by which the 22nd

Respondent, the Governor of the Eastern Province had suspended the Petitioner

from office. This Order had however been revoked by a further Order published in

Extraordinary Gazette No. 2212/21 dated 27th January 2021.

The third is the following notice issued by the 22nd Respondent marked X18:3

The Chairman of Padiyathalawa Pradeshiya Sabha within the Province of the

East has submitted and failed to get adopted the Budget of the year 2021, as

the power vested in him under Section 168 and 169 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act

No. 15 of 1987, thus the said Chairman of the said Pradeshiya Sabha , as

provided under Section 17 of the Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Act, No.

21 of 2012, is deemed to have been resigned from the office of the Chairman

effective from 31.12.2020 and that the office of the Chairman of that Pradeshiya

Sabha become vacant effective from that date.

The fourth is a letter dated 29th January 2021 marked X19 issued by the 24th

Respondent to the Secretary of the 1st Respondent informing that the Petitioner has

ceased to hold office as Chairman of the 1st Respondent due to his failure to have the

budget of the 1st Respondent for 2021 approved by 31st December 2020.

3 This notice, which has been published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 2212/23 dated 27th January 2021 has been issued in terms of Section 223 of the Act.

12

Aggrieved by the above decisions of the 22nd 24th Respondents, the Petitioner filed

this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision in X18, X19 and X204 that the

Office of Chairman of the 1st Respondent has fallen vacant;

(b) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the Respondents from taking steps on the basis

that the Office of Chairman of the 1st Respondent has fallen vacant.

It is clear that X18, X19 and X20 have been issued due to the failure on the part of

the Petitioner to have the budget passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha. In considering the

legality of the decisions contained therein, the primary issue that arises for

determination is whether the budget of the 1st Respondent has been passed in terms

of the law, and if not, whether the Petitioner is deemed to have resigned from the

office of Chairman as provided for by the proviso to Section 169 of the Act.

The principal argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was that

where the Chairman agrees with the amendments or modifications proposed by the

members, the necessity for him to re-submit the amended budget does not arise. He

therefore submitted that the factual circumstances of this application do not fall

within the proviso to Section 169 and that the deeming provision that the Chairman

has resigned too does not apply.

I shall now consider whether the Petitioner has complied with the several obligations

cast on a Chairman by the Act with regard to the budget. The first obligation is to

prepare the budget, which the Petitioner has complied with. The second is to submit

the budget to the Pradeshiya Sabha, which too the Petitioner has complied with. The

third obligation is to have the budget so submitted, passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha.

As I have noted, the Petitioner has two opportunities to have the budget passed. The

Petitioner has faltered at the first opportunity as a result of the budget being

defeated on 20th November 2020.

4 X20 is the Sinhala translation of X19.

13

The Petitioner was thereafter required to re-submit the budget for further consideration of the Pradeshiya Sabha. The Petitioner has partially complied with this obligation by re-submitting the budget on 21st December 2020. Having done so, the Petitioner has failed to afford the members of the Pradeshiya Sabha an opportunity of further considering the said budget. The Petitioner has also failed to have the budget passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha. As submitted by the learned Senior State Counsel for the 1st Respondent and the learned Presidents Counsel for the 4th -8th, 10th, 11th, 13th and 16th Respondents, the Petitioner has thrown all democratic norms out of the window. It is not disputed that the concession granted by Section 169 to enable a Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha to function in office even where a duly submitted budget has not been passed by a majority comes to an end after two years of being elected as Chairman, and that the provisions contained in the proviso to Section 169 is applicable thereafter. Once the budget is submitted to the Pradeshiya Sabha and debated and whatever the modifications or additions that a Chairman may agree during or after such debate, the budget must be submitted by the Chairman to the Pradeshiya Sabha for its decision. This is mandatory and is confirmed by the use of the word, decision in the proviso to Section 169. In terms of Section 14(1) read together with Section 14(2), a decision would mean a vote. I am therefore of the view that the Chairman agreeing to any modifications or additions that may be proposed by one or more or even all members does not suffice in order to claim that the budget has been passed. The claim that the Chairman agreed with the modifications and amendments and therefore the budget has been passed is a red herring. The budget must be passed by a majority vote if the Chairman wishes to avoid the deemed resignation being triggered. Where the Chairman re-submits the budget, he must provide the members an opportunity of further considering it and thereafter he must have the budget passed by a majority vote of the Pradeshiya Sabha. In my view, the crux of the matter is that the Chairman must ensure that he has in place a budget duly passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha by the due date. If he fails in this regard at whatever point of the process, he is deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman by operation of law. A Chairman who does not take a vote cannot be in a better position than a

14

Chairman who has re-submitted the budget and taken a vote, only to have the budget defeated by the Pradeshiya Sabha. The Petitioner has failed in his obligation to have the budget passed in terms of Section 169 and therefore the consequence set out in the proviso to Section 169 has been triggered. The Petitioner is therefore deemed to have resigned from the office of Chairman of the 1st Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha. The result is that there is a vacancy in the office of Chairman. This in my view is what was intended by the legislature when it introduced the proviso to Section 169 in 2012. I am therefore unable to agree with the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the factual circumstances of this application are outside the scope of the proviso to Section 169 of the Act. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that in any event, the impugned notice X18 is ultra vires the powers conferred on the 1st Respondent by Section 223 of the Act and Section 2 of the Provincial Councils (Consequential Provisions) Act No. 12 of 1989. To me, the series of events that followed the refusal by the Petitioner to place the re-submitted budget to a vote and have it passed by the Pradeshiya Sabha reflects the desperation on the part of the Respondents to ensure that the provisions of Section 169 are complied with. Even if the argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is accepted, nothing flows from X18 for the reason that X18 is only an intimation of a factual position that prevailed as at that date. In the above circumstances, I see no legal basis to issue formal notice of this application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
