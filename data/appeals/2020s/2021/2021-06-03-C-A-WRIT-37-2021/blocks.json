He submitted further that the said decision has been taken independent of any findings of the PCOI and that in any event, the 1st Respondent is not in receipt of any communication, recommendation or directive from the PCOI regarding the reinstatement of the 13th Respondent. This submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General goes to the root of the Petitioners case, and if correct, would mean that the application of the Petitioner is misconceived. The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that by a letter dated 3rd January 2020 marked 13R1, the 13th Respondent had requested the 2nd Respondent, the Chairman of the 1st Respondent to consider reinstating him in service for the reasons set out in the said letter. Thereafter, the 2nd Respondent, by letter dated 6th February 2020 marked X4, had appointed a retired Judge of the High Court to reconsider the disciplinary action taken against the 13th Respondent. By his report dated 24th February 2020 marked 13R2, the retired Judge of the High Court had recommended that the 13th Respondent be reinstated in service. In the meantime, the 13th Respondent had lodged a complaint with the three member Political Victimisation Committee chaired by the then State Minister of Irrigation and Regional Development. Having considered the complaint of the 13th Respondent, by his letter dated 29th May 2020, the Chairman of the said Committee Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena had recommended that the Petitioner be reinstated in service. It is evident from the proceedings before the Labour Tribunal that by August 2020, discussions were ongoing between the 1st and 13th Respondents relating to his reinstatement vide proceedings of 27th August 2020, marked 13R3a and proceedings of 21st September 2020, marked 13R3b. The 13th Respondent had thereafter by letter dated 15th October 2020 marked P18 written to the 14th Respondent, the Minister of Energy, once again seeking reinstatement. Although this letter had been referred to the 1st Respondent, it was the position of the learned Additional Solicitor General that the 1st Respondent did not act on the said letter. Reinstatement of the 13th Respondent which had been recommended by the above Committee as well as by 13R2 had thereafter been considered by the Board of the 1st Respondent on three occasions, namely:",

It is clear from the above sequence of events that parallel to the complaint of the 13th Respondent to the PCOI, the 1st Respondent had considered the appeal made by the 13th Respondent seeking reinstatement in service. Thus, even if the PCOI has recommended the reinstatement of the 13th Respondent, which is yet to be conveyed to the 1st Respondent, it is clear that the decision of the 1st Respondent to reinstate the 13th Respondent has been taken independent of the inquiry and/or any recommendation by the PCOI. I am therefore in agreement with the submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General, and take the view that the application of the Petitioner is misconceived. Taking into consideration all of the above facts, I see no legal basis to issue formal notice of this application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.",
