MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioners in this application have invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court

under Article 140 of the Constitution seeking, inter alia, for the following relief:

c) a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to

acquire the land in terms of the Land Acquisition Act as stated in the

Parliamentary Sub Committee Proposal No. 829 dated 05.05.2009 (2/2/7/

/2009/28) and morefully set out in the document marked P-06.

d) a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus directing the 2nd to 9th

Respondents as stated in the Parliamentary Sub Committee Proposal No. 829

dated 05.05.2009 (2/2/7/ /2009/28) and morefully set out in the

document marked P-06 and the establish the Andaragasyaya Wewa in terms of

the said proposal.

When this matter was taken up for argument, both parties had consented to dispose

the matter by way of written submissions that have already been tendered.

The Petitioners state that themselves and the 10th Respondent are paddy cultivators

of adjoining lands situated in Mahawa. The Petitioners claim that they have been

using water from the Andaragasyaya Wewa and due to a personal dispute between

themselves and the 10th Respondent, the 10th Respondent obstructed the said

Andaragasyaya Wewa and prevented the water from the said stream from reaching the

Petitioners paddy land for cultivation.

The Petitioners state that by a Proposal bearing No. 829 dated 05.05.2009 (2/2/7/

/2009/28), the Parliamentary Advisory Sub Committee of Kurunagela District was

recommended to the 2nd Respondent that the said Andaragasyaya Wewa situated at

Maho, in the Kurunegela District and morefully described as Lot No. 296 of Form 5

of the Final Village Plan (FVP) No. 1851 should be acquired by the State for use of the

said reservoir to retain water and to serve paddy land in the vicinity.

The Petitioners state that thereafter, there were numerous correspondence and

communications exchanged between the Respondents and/or various State

Page 5 of 7

institutions with copy to the 1st Petitioner on the preliminary acquisition process

(vide P-07 to P-21). However, the Petitioners state that notwithstanding the decision

taken on 05.05.2009 that the said land falling with the Andaragasyaya Wewa is required

for a public purpose, one or more of the 1st to 9th Respondents have failed to take steps

towards acquiring the said land in terms of the Land Acquisition Act1.

The Petitioners state that the 10th Respondent is in the process of filling up the said

Andaragasyaya Wewa and thereby depriving the Petitioners the use of the said

Andaragasyaya Wewa for cultivation of their paddy lands. The Petitioners also state that

due to the failure on the part of one or more of the 1st to 9th Respondents in taking

steps towards acquiring the said land which forms part of the Andaragasyaya Wewa the

Petitioners are unable to cultivate on their paddy fields and are suffering grave loss.

The Petitioners further submitted that, they are being recipients of water from

Andaragasyaya Wewa for cultivation of the paddy field and view of the proposal to

acquire the said land for the public purpose of establishment of the said Andaragasyaya

Wewa, they have Legitimate Expectation, in view of Proposal No. 829 dated

05.05.2009 (2/2/7/ /2009/28) of the Parliamentary Advisory Sub Committee of

the Kurunagela District, the said land would be acquired for the public purpose of

Andaragasyaya Wewa as per the direction given to the 1st to 9th Respondents.

Having carefully scrutinise the materials before this Court, it is observed that the land

the Petitioners are cultivating is a state land and they appear to be in illegal

possession of such land (vide P-09). The land of the 10th Respondent is also a state

land given to him by way of a Grant dated 07.10.1996 (vide 2R3).

It is also apparent from the FVP bearing No. 1851 that at the time of the preparation

of the FVP there had been no such wewa as there is no depiction the theme FVP (vide

1R1 and 2R2). Furthermore, the Grant given to the 10th Respondent also does not

intimate the boundaries to include a wewa. Thus, the said corpus wewa has been

developed only recently. It is also clear that after the state land alienated by way of

Grants and Permits, the Petitioners had erected a barrier (bamma) on Lots 432 and

1 No. 09 of 1950 (as amended).

Page 6 of 7

434 and directed water from the natural wewa to create the new corpus wewa that is

in issue in the instant application.

It is also apparent from the document marked 2R4 that although the acquisition of

the land has been discussed, the 3rd Respondent has written to the 4th Respondent

stating that there is no possibility to acquire the said land for a wewa that is not in

existence in the Plans and upon the mere request of an individual. He has however stated that

in the event that there is a request made by the Agrarian Development Department

any alternate land falling outside the Grants land may be released.

In any event, by 2R6 dated 03.04.2014, the Land Ministry clearly determined that

since the said wewa is enjoyed by an individual person, it is not feasible for them to

acquire the land without a public purpose. In the same document, the Ministry has

noted that, however, steps may be taken to be explore the possibility of obtaining the

consent of the Grant holder (i.e., the 10th Respondent) through whose land the wewa

is said to accumulate, on the promise of an alternative land to him. However, there is

no material before this Court to show that any such settlement is reached between

the parties.

In view of the above, this Court further observed that the State still has not taken a

firm decision to demarcate the portion of the land included in the respective Grants

for the purposes of the wewa. The question whether the land should or should not be

acquired is one of policy to be determined by the relevant Minister [vide Gunasekara

vs. Minister of Lands and Agriculture (1963) 65 NLR 119] after carrying a careful

study. Therefore, this Court will not compel the State to acquire a land where the

policy decision has not been arrived to do so.

The Petitioners have also premised this application on Legitimate Expectation2. They

submitted that in view of P-06, they are legitimately expecting that the said land will

be acquired for the purposes of constructing the said wewa.

P-06 is a document which the Petitioner claim is a resolution of a meeting of the

District Land Use Planning Committee of Kurunegela to approve Proposal No. 829 of

2 Vide para 20 of the Petition.

the Parliamentary Advisory Sub Committee. However, the said Proposal is not placed

before this Court. Therefore, this Court is of the view that the Petitioners have failed

to put forward any sufficient materials to show that a clear, unequivocal and unambiguous

promise was made to them3. There was no lawful promise or assurance given by the

Minister or any proper authority to the Petitioners that the land will be released and

utilise for the construction of wewa. The legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred

only if it is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an established procedure

followed in regular and natural sequence [vide Union of India vs. Hindustan

Development Corporation 1994 AIR 988 at para 28].

In the circumstances, I see no merit in this application.

Therefore, I unhesitatingly dismiss the application of the Petitioners without costs.

Application dismissed.
