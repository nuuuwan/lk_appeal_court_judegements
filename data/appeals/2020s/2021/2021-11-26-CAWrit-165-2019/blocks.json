Both parties agreed to get the argument disposed by way of written submissions. Anyhow none of the parties have filed the written submissions. There are several connected matters that were taken up together with this matter. The court observers that the facts relating to each are different. The Petitioner states that he was an employee of the Prima Ceylon Ltd since 24.07.2003. While he was serving at Prima Ceylon Ltd., he had been granted a tenancy in respect of the premises at F-16 in Daanyagama Housing Scheme, China Bay, Trincomalee. On 29.09.2014, upon a Lease Agreement (marked as P4) has been entered into between the Petitioner and the Food Commissioner for a period of one year based on its annual renewal. However, the Petitioner is no more an employee at the Prima Ceylon Ltd and is currently employed at the National Water Supply and Drainage Board with effect from 11.04.2018. Despite being employed at the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, the Petitioner still remains in the possession of the said premises. Petitioner further states that when he attempted to pay his monthly rental, the said rentals were rejected by the then Food Commissioner. Later on, the Petitioner has been served with a quit notice in term of the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No.03 of 1971, dated 18th February 2019 (P11) demanding him to hand over the vacant possession of the said premises alleging that the Petitioner has acted in breach of the terms of the said Lease Agreement. In spite of such circumstances, the Petitioner has made this application moving for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit notice marked P11 stating that the purported quit notice is bad in law for the reasons mentioned below.",
