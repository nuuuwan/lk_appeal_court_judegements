The only contention may be that the discounts are available post-sale, but this condition, in my view, falls within the similar circumstances mentioned in the definition under Section 83. The crucial factor is that the availability of the discount, its terms, and how the varying percentages are assigned, must be known to all customers of the Respondent at the time of supply, which appears to be the case on the facts before this Court. It must also be the case that the discount is available on equal terms, regardless of the VAT registration status of the customer.

Section 20 (6) (a), which specifies the contents of a commercial invoice, mandates the mention of only the total consideration, including the tax charged.

It is suggested that where a supplier considers the employment of a post-sale quantity discount, it should utilise the procedure employed by the taxpayer in Oriflame, so that the invoice is issued after all applicable discounts have been applied.
