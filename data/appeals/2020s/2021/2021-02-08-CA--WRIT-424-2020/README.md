Arjuna Obeyesekere, J., P/CA

This matter was taken up for support together with CA (Writ) Application No. 423/2020.

All learned Counsel agreed that the issues to be decided by this Court in CA (Writ)

Application No. 423/2020 are identical to the issues that are to be decided in this

application. All learned Counsel therefore moved that this Court can determine CA

(Writ) Application No. 423/2020, and that all parties to this application will be bound by

the Order that would be made in CA (Writ) Application No. 423/2020.

By an Order delivered today in CA (Writ) Application No. 423/2020, I have held that I do

not see any legal basis to issue notice on the Respondents in that application, and

dismissed the said application, without costs. Hence, in view of the aforementioned

agreement of the parties, this application must also stand dismissed, without costs.

President of the Court of Appeal

Sobhitha Rajakaruna, J
