S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

By this Application for Revision and restitutio in integrum, the 1st and the 2nd Petitioner-

Petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the 1st and the 2nd Petitioners) seek reliefs inter alia,

to revise and set aside the judgement pronounced and interlocutory decree entered in the

partition action bearing No. P/11188 in the District Court of Kandy, direct the District

Judge to make the 1st and the 2nd Petitioners as parties to the action, permit them to file

their statements of claim and investigate their title to the subject matter of the action.

The 1st and the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 1st and

the 2nd Plaintiffs) instituted the partition action by plaint dated 06.12.1983. against the 1st

to 6th Defendant-Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 1st - 6th

Defendants) seeking to partition an amalgamated land identified and known as Rambuke-

ela Kumbura which consists of two lands mournfully described in Schedules A and B

in the plaint. The case has proceeded to trial on 20 points of contest between the parties

and the learned District Judge, by the judgement dated 08.10.1996. (marked as P6) ordered

to partition the subject matter allocating shares to the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs and the 1st, 2nd

and 6th Defendants as per the judgement.

Thereafter, interlocutory decree (marked as P6a) was entered and the commission was

issued to prepare the partition plan. Accordingly, the partition was done and the final plan

and the report (marked as P5) was returned by the Surveyor to the Court. In the meantime,

filing a petition and affidavit dated 26.07.2002, the 1st and the 2nd Petitioners sought reliefs

from the District Court inter alia, to add them as parties to the action and declare that they

are entitled to 39/152 share of the land and amend the interlocutory decree accordingly.

5

The parties who were declared to be entitled to the shares of the subject matter by the

judgment had objected to the application of the Petitioners. From the order dated

09.05.2003, the learned District Judge upholding their objection has dismissed the

application of the Petitioners. Being aggrieved by the said order, the 1st and 2nd Petitioners

filed the instant applications for Revision and the restitutio in integrum. The parties who

were declared to be entitled to the shares of the subject matter by the District Court have

objected to that application. When the matter came up for argument, both parties

consented to abide by an order delivered by the Court on their written submissions

dispensing with their rights to make oral submissions.

The 1st and 2nd Petitioners allege inter alia, that one Omar Lebbe was entitled on deed No.

643 dated 20.11.1929. (marked as P7) to a 39/152 share of the land described in Schedule

A to the plaint which forms the amalgamated land sought to be partitioned, he had

mortgaged his share by deed of mortgage No. 7343 dated 25.009.1937. (marked as P8) to

Mohammad Ismil Lebbe. They had acquired prescriptive title to the share of Omar Lebbe,

after the death of Mohammed Ismil Lebbe on 30.09.1977, his rights were devolved on the

1st and 2nd Petitioners being his son and the nephew respectively and by possessing the land

for nearly 40 years they have acquired prescriptive title to the land sought to be partitioned.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioners argue that if the proxy holding Attorney-at-Law

for the Plaintiffs had done a search in the Land Registry after the partition action was

registered as a lis pendens under the Registration of Documents Ordinance, and before

filing the declaration under section 12 (1) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977 (the Partition

Law), he could have traced the entries concerning to the above stated deeds which the

Petitioners are relied on and should have been made Omar Lebbe and/or Mohammad Ismil

Lebbe parties to the action. Therefore, the learned Counsel for the Petitioners argue that

the failure/omission of the Attorney-at-Law for the Plaintiffs to do a search of the entries

in the Land Registry and include the names of the persons in the plaint who should have

been made parties to the action as required by section 5 of the Partition Law is a violation

of a mandatory requirement which makes the entire proceedings, judgement and the

interlocutory decree a nullity.

6

Section 12 (1) of the Partition Law, enacts that;

After a partition action is registered as a lis pendens under the Registration of

Documents Ordinance and after the return of the duplicate referred to in section 11, the

plaintiff in the action shall file or cause to be filed in Court a declaration under the hand

of an Attorney-at-Law certifying that all such entries in the register maintained under that

Ordinance as relate to the land constituting the subject-matter of the action have been

personally inspected by that Attorney-at-Law after the registration of the action as a lis

pendens, and containing a statement of the name of every person found upon the inspection

of those entries to be a person whom the plaintiff is required by section 5 to include in the

plaint as a party to the action and also, if an address of that person is registered in the

aforesaid register, that address.

Therefore, as provided by section 12, the plaintiff is required upon inspection of the entries

in the Land Registry to file in Court a statement containing the name of every person

whom he is required by section 5 to include in the plaint a party to the action and also, if

an address of that person is registered in the register maintained in the Land Registry, that

address.

Section 5 of the Partition Law, stipulates the persons who should be named as parties in

the plaint in the following manner.

The plaintiff in a partition action shall include in his plaint as parties to the action

all persons who, whether in actual possession or not, to his knowledge are entitled or

claim to be entitled-

(a) to any right, share or interest to, of, or in the land to which the action relates,

whether vested or contingent, and whether by way of mortgage, lease, usufruct, servitude,

trust, life interest, or otherwise, or

(b) to any improvements made or effected on or to the land:

Provided that in the case of a mortgage, the mortgagee or any person claiming any

interest under him shall be included as a party only if he has registered an address for

service of legal documents in terms of sections 6 and 28 of the Mortgage Act:

7

Provided further that if such mortgagee or person aforesaid claims under an

instrument executed more than fifteen years prior to the institution of the action, he shall

not be a necessary party to such action, unless he has registered an address for service of

legal documents in terms of the aforesaid provisions of the Mortgage Act within a period

of ten years prior to the date of institution of the action.

Therefore, in the case of a mortgage, the plaintiff should make the mortgagee or any other

person who claims any interest under the mortgage, a party to the action only if an address

is registered for service of legal documents in terms of the provisos to the section 5 of the

Partition Law.

In terms of section 6 (1) of the Mortgage Act, No. 6 of 1949 (the Mortgage Act)

application for the registration of an address for the service of legal documents should be

made substantially in the form set out in the First Schedule to the Mortgage Act and in

terms of section 6 (2) of the Mortgage Act, the address for service should be registered in

or in continuation of the folio in which is registered the mortgage of the land in respect of

which the applicant has an interest.

The folios of the Land Registry in which the transactions over the land sought to be

partitioned in the instant case are registered were tendered to the Court marked as P9, P9a

and P9b. Nevertheless, it cannot be observed that in those folios the address/addresses of

the mortgagee or the Petitioners were registered as the address/addresses which the legal

documents could be served on them in terms of section 6 of the Mortgage Act. Under such

circumstances, it is quite clear that the mortgagee or the Petitioners had failed to act in

terms of section 6 of the Mortgage Act and therefore, in terms of section 5 of the Partition

Law, they cannot be considered as necessary parties to the partition action.

For the reasons mentioned above, the Court cannot agree with the argument of the learned

Counsel for the Petitioners that non-inclusion of the Petitioners as parties to the partition

action is a violation of the provisions of section 12 (1) of the Partition Law, which makes

the entire proceedings, judgement and the interlocutory decree a nullity.

8

The learned Counsel for the Petitioners cited Somawathie vs. Madawala (1983 2 SLR 15

at p. 30, 31) in which Mr. R. B. Madawala who was entitled to the rights of the subject

matter on a deed of transfer had not made a party to the partition action. The Court has

held that as a result, a miscarriage of justice has been caused to Mr. Madawala. But in the

instant action as decided hereinbefore, the Petitioners cannot be considered as necessary

parties to the action, the authority cited by the learned Counsel has no relevance to the

instant action.

Considering all the above stated facts, I hold that the Petitioners have failed to satisfy the

Court that a failure of justice or miscarriage of justice has been caused to them and

exceptional circumstances exist for this Court to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction.

The position of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners is that the Petitioners and their

predecessors in title possessed the land sought to be partitioned for 65 years to the date of

the institution of the partition action on 06.12.1983. and they acquired prescriptive title to

the land. If that fact is true, they could have intervened to the action when the notices

regarding the partition action were dispatched in the Grama Niladharis office or on the

land in terms of sections 15 (1) and section 15(3) respectively, and/or after the Surveyor

orally proclaimed and beaten tom-tom on the land in terms of section 17(2), and/or at the

execution of the commission in terms of section 18, and/or on an application to the District

Court by the Petitioners in terms of section 69 (1) (b) of the Partition Law and establish

their prescriptive rights and title to the land sought to be partitioned at the trial.

Nevertheless, the Petitioners have failed to do so.

Since the Petitioners are not parties to the partition action, in terms of section 48 (5) of the

Partition Law, if they could have satisfied the District Judge that the District Court of

Kandy had no jurisdiction to enter the interlocutory decree, they would not be bound by

the final and conclusive effect given to the interlocutory decree by section 48 (1) of the

Partition Law. But their position is not that the District Court of Kandy was lack of

complete jurisdiction to enter the interlocutory decree.

9

Upon consideration of the above stated facts, I hold that the Petitioners are not entitled to

any relief by way of restitutio in integrum either.

For the reason that the Petitioners have failed to satisfy the Court that they are entitled to

any relief by way of revision or restitutio in integrum, I hold that the application of the

Petitioners is without merit. Hence, I affirm the judgement pronounced and the

interlocutory decree entered by the learned District Judge dismissing the Application of the

Petitioners. Each Petitioner should pay Rs. 10,000/- each to the 1st, 2nd Plaintiffs, 1st, 2nd

and 6th Defendants as costs of this Application.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

I agree.
