The accused appellants were indicted in the High Court of Nuwara Eliya, that

on or about the 10th September 2001, the accused committed the murder of one

Karupaiah Vanarajah at Kandapola an offence punishable under Section 296 of the

Penal Code. After trial all 3 accused were convicted and death sentence was imposed.

Being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence, on the following grounds

of appeal the accused appellants have preferred their appeal.

I. Did the learned High Court Judge fail to consider the serious infirmities in

the evidence of main witness for the prosecution, Anura Wijesooriya

(PW 5)?

3

II. Did the learned High Court Judge fail to consider whether the prosecution

witnesses are credible and /or consistent witnesses?

III. Whether the learned High Court Judge has failed to fairly and properly

analyze the contradictions?

IV. Whether the learned High Court Judge has failed to fairly evaluate the

dock statements of the accused?

V. Whether the prosecution has failed to produce sufficient circumstantial

evidence?

VI. Whether the learned High Court Judge has failed to fairly and properly

analyze the uncorroborated evidence of PW 9 regarding the identification

of the body of the deceased?

VII. Whether the learned High Court Judge has delivered the judgment without

sufficiently analyzing the evidence presented in this case?

The facts of the case, albeit briefly, are as follows;

According to the wife of the deceased PW 2 Pakya Leela , the deceased was

a watcher at St Johns Estate. He was also employed by one Kelum Mudalali to guard

the railway sleepers that were lying by the side of the Kandapola -Nuwara Eliya

main road which was about 225 to 250 meters away from their home.

It was submitted that the deceased usually leaves home around 6.00 pm, with

his torch and a sword and returns home around 6.00 am on the following day. When

4

he failed to return from guarding the sleepers on the morning of September 10th 2001,

after searching for him she had complained to the police. During the search with the

police the body of the deceased with injuries all over was found at a place called

Kupana. Only a torn trouser had been on his body and the shirt, belt and his jerkin

which were found was identified as items worn by the deceased when he left for

work on the night of the 9th September 2001.

Two contradictions were marked from the evidence of PW 2 to the effect that

at the inquest before the learned Magistrate she had stated that the deceased left at 9

pm on the 9th (V1) and not at 6 pm as she had stated in evidence. V 2 is on the basis

her stating that the deceased had came back in the night to take the sword, when in

evidence she has stated that he took the sword along with him when he went for

work at 6.00 pm.

However it was apparent on perusal of the evidence of PW 2 before the trial

court her unwavering evidence has been that the deceased left at 6.00 pm

The trial judge has stated that these contradiction do not go to the root of the

case and decided that they did not affect the credibility of the evidence of PW 2.

At the hearing of the appeal the learned counsel for the appellants contended

that V1 is a material contradiction on the basis that if the deceased left at 9.00 pm in

the night , when considered with the evidence of PW 5 who has stated that it was

around 8.30 in the night that the three accused came to his house and, if that was the

case the accused were not in a position to harm the deceased.

5

If a contradiction is to be material it should be sufficient to create a reasonable

doubt in the evidence of the witness concerned. There was no reason to disbelieve

PW 2 when she said the deceased left at 6 pm. She had no opportunity to know that

the accused appellants were planning on using the alleged discrepancy of the time,

which is based on her evidence at the inquest, to their advantage. Thus, it appears

that the contradiction is highlighted not to create a doubt in the evidence of PW 2,

but to formulate a defence. Therefore, it is my considered view that the learned trial

judge has arrived at the correct decision that the contradictions failed to create a

reasonable doubt in the evidence of PW 2.

The brother of the deceased Karupiah Pugaladan PW 4 who had searched for

the missing brother and later identified the body has given evidence explaining that

the body had suffered much damage and the trouser was in tatters. A contradiction

V 4 was marked on the basis that in his statement to the police he had stated that his

brother had once told him that until he was paid money for his services he will not

allow the sleepers to be taken away. Before V4 was marked, several questions were

asked as to whether the brother told him that Kelum mudalali was not giving money

for guarding the sleepers. However, he has repeatedly stated that he cannot

remember saying anything to that effect. This contradiction the learned High Court

Judge has quite correctly not considered as a vital or material contradiction, as it did

not affect the root of the case.

The crucial and the main witness is PW 5 Anura Wijesuriya , who was earlier

a suspect for this murder and was remanded with the other 3 suspects for over 3

months in the Magistrates Court. He is the first cousin of the third accused Gamini

Wijesuriya. According to him when he was sleeping at home on the fateful night, the

3rd accused together with Nalin Usuf, the 1st accused and Sajeewa the 2nd accused,

both known to him , have come in the white Elf vehicle driven by Gamini the 3rd

accused and asked his assistance to unload and keep the 2 sleepers that was in the

lorry which he and the third accused had unloaded. Thereafter, he had been asked to

6

accompany them to drop off Nalin Usuf and Sajeewa to their respective homes. The

third accused had asked PW 5 to sleep at his place. (page 151 of the brief). It was

stated that because of their close relationship there was nothing to suspect or to be

afraid of. All four have travelled in the front seat of the lorry and on the way the 3rd

accused has stated that a tamil person who was knocked down by the lorry was inside

the lorry and threatened to kill PW 5 if he divulged it to anyone.

In page 153 of the brief it is stated as follows,

: ?

: .

.

In page 159 of the brief PW 5 goes on to say that the 3rd accused mentioned

that Nalin and Sajeewa had stabbed a person with a knife when a fight ensued when

the sleepers were taken.

Thereafter, at the Kura estate boundary, Sajeeva after checking under the

lorry had informed that the body had fallen off. However, when they were returning

they have observed the body fallen on the road but had driven off, leaving the body

there.

According to PW 5 he had not looked at the body and V5 contradiction was

marked in page 167 of the brief as follows.

:

. ?

7

However, in page 157 of the brief PW 5 in evidence in chief has admitted that

he was told that the person was tied to the axle bar of the lorry. This position was

clarified in page 167 when he was cross examined where he had admitted seeing a

person tied to the axle of the lorry.

It was unchallenged that PW 5 was a suspect in the Magistrates Court and

was later named as a prosecution witness. The suggestion by the counsel for the

appellant that he gave evidence implicating the accused as he was angry with them

was vehemently denied by him.

It is to be considered that if PW 5 was not in good terms with his cousin the

3rd accused, stolen goods would not have been brought to his place nor would he

have travelled in the vehicle. Thus, it is apparent that the suggestions by the counsel

for the accused that it was PW 5 who was responsible for the incident and the person

who took away the sleepers were without any logical basis.

PW 6 Nelson Wijesuriya the brother of PW 5 has testified that the sleepers

that were in a drain in the cabbage patch in their garden was taken by the police.

PW 8 Osman de Silva had stated that his driver the 3rd accused had taken the white

Nissan Atlas lorry on the 9th and returned it only on the 11th. The Ragala Police had

taken the vehicle in to custody on the night of the 13th. PW 5 has been referring to

the white lorry as an ELF lorry but in fact it was a Nissan Atlas. However, it was the

description of the make of the lorry which was incorrect but there was no issue about

the identification of the vehicle.

PW 09, JMO Dr Kithsiri Samarasinghe has testified that the face and body

of the deceased was severely damaged and injured and opined that it could have

being caused by a serious accident or being dragged by a vehicle. (page 216 of the

8

brief). The large blood vessels in the chest area had been damaged and parts of the

liver, gall bladder, lungs and some muscles were missing. It was also stated that the

major organs such as the brain, lungs and liver was sixty percent damaged and the

other organs 40 percent damaged and with that percentage the injuries were

necessarily fatal.

Further, he has observed three stab injuries on the head, chest and right side

of the hip area and a tyre mark on the right leg below the genetical organs. An opinion

has been given that this sort of injury could have occurred by the body being dragged

along the road tied to the vehicle. The cause of death according to the post mortem

report is dragged on the road by tying a wire on the right side of the leg after

stabbing.

The evidence of PW 10 given at the non summary inquiry was admitted under

section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance. He has observed blood marks near the

sleepers. The body had been discovered quite a distance from where the sleepers

were kept. All three accused have been arrested by this witness. On the statement of

the 1st accused, a knife hidden under the seat of the lorry and on the statement of the

3rd accused, the lorry, a wire and the sleepers have been recovered.

PW 13, the government analyst had examined the vehicle on 27.09.2001, 17

days after the incident. The vehicle had been at the Ragala Police Station well

covered. Human blood has been detected on the rear left mud guard, inside the mud

flap, inside the left front mud guard, side of the left seat and on the spare wheel.

Some hairs also have been recovered. The pieces of cloth and thread that were

recovered had matched the clothes worn by the deceased. It was also stated that the

damage to the clothes could have been caused by being dragged on the road.

9

All three accused have given their statements from the Dock, denying the

allegation levelled against them. They have stated that they were assaulted by the

police and their signatures were placed on some papers. The first accused further

stated that his finger prints were placed on a knife. The learned trial judge has

considered the Dock Statements and rejected them stating that no doubt was created

in the prosecution case by the Dock Statements.

It is noted that the items of evidence found by the government analyst is not

from easily visible open places, but from hidden locations. The evidence from the

owner of the lorry established that the vehicle was in the custody of the 3rd accused

who is the driver from the 9th to the 12th. PW 5 identified the vehicle in which the

three accused visited him with the sleepers, which were later taken by the police and

marked as productions at the trial. The sleepers, the lorry and the wire were recovered

as section 27 recoveries. This evidence has not been challenged by the accused

appellants.

It is trite law that the burden of proof is on the prosecution in a criminal trial.

In Queen vs Sumanasena 66 NLR 351 it was held that;

. suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt nor does the

proof of any number of suspicious circumstances relieve the

prosecution of its burden of proving the case against the accused

beyond reasonable doubt.

At the hearing of the appeal, the counsel for the appellants contended that the

failure to mention section 32 of the Penal Code in the indictment is an irregularity

which the learned trial judge has not considered.

10

In CA Appeal 78-80 2001, decided on 01.10.2007, Ranjith Silva, J has held that,

.Although Section 32 of Penal Code was not mentioned, it

is clear that the basis on which accused-appellants were found guilty

was that they acted in furtherance of a common intention. It is not

necessary to mention Section 32 of the Penal Code when all the

accused are charged for committing the offence.

In Attorney General V Munasinghe 70 NLR 241, it was stated that,

.the fact that no reference was made in the indictment to

the common intention set out in section 32 of the Penal Code was not

an error or omission which could prevent the court from convicting

the 2nd and 3rd accused for count 1 of the indictment.

In Ranji Singh V State of Bihar AIR 2001 SC 3853 Ashok Bihan J. held

.even in the absence of the charge under Section 34 the

conviction could be maintained by the courts below.

..Counsel for appellants could not show that any prejudice

was caused to either of the accused person because of the non-framing

of charge under section 34.

It is apparent on a perusal of the judgment at pages 338 and 339 of the brief

that the learned judge has considered the liability of each accused separately.

Although he has failed to set out the law that he has applied in express terms, he has

nevertheless considered the ingredients of common intention when he arrived at the

conclusion. Accordingly, the argument of the counsel for the appellants on that point

cannot be sustained.

11

Another question agitated by the counsel for the appellants is the probability

factor on the basis that it was not probable that the three accused appellants would

be travelling with a dead body with stolen goods to PW 5s house and divulging their

mis deeds then threatening to kill him.

It has to be conceded that there is no hard and fast rule how different people

will act in different situations. PW 5 has testified that the 3rd accused invited him to

spend the night with him, after dropping off the other two. However, it appears that

there was a change of plans and in the end PW 5 was brought home and the 3rd

accused had gone to his place.

In the absence of any contrary evidence, it is a fair assumption that PW 5 was

asked to accompany them so that after dropping off the other two accused appellants,

the 3rd accused would not be alone to travel back to his house with a dead body in

the vehicle as originally planned. The body falling off from where it was tied would

not have been anticipated when PW 5 was invited to accompany them. In such

circumstances, the behaviour of the accused appellants cannot be considered as

improbable.

The case for the prosecution depended to a very large extent on the evidence

of PW 5 although the prosecution was also based on circumstantial evidence.

PW 5 had testified that the three accused came to his house with the sleepers

and that they travelled in the lorry and looked for a body underneath the lorry and

later observed a body fallen off on to the road. The accused appellants have not

disputed or challenged this evidence in cross examination. All that was suggested to

the witness was that he has falsely implicated the accused and that it was PW 5 who

should be charged.

12

The learned trial judge has correctly held that PW 5 cannot be considered as

an accomplice. It is clear that PW 5 who according to the evidence cannot be

considered as a guilty associate who willingly participated in the crime, when there

is no such evidence against him.

According to the available evidence, it is quite obvious that PW 5 did not

know of the incident which led to the death of a person and the subsequent

arrangement to dispose the body. However the body has fallen off from where it was

tied to the vehicle and was left behind to be discovered by the police.

The counsel for the appellants contended that the learned trial judge was in

error when PW 5 was referred to as an eye witness in page 336 of the judgment.

It is apparent that PW 5 is not an eye witness to the incident that led to the

death of the deceased. However, it is not incorrect to say he is an eye witness to

certain incidents such as the three accused coming to his house and unloading the

sleepers, thereafter, travelling in the vehicle, looking for the body underneath the

vehicle, witnessing the dead body on the road and dropping off the accused.

Therefore, it cannot be said that the learned judge was incorrect altogether stating

that PW 5 was an eye witness.

The counsel for the respondent has referred to the following authority in

support of his position.

13

State of Uttar Pradesh Vs M.K. Anthony (184) SCJ 236/(1985) CRI.L.J.493 at

498/499 where the Indian Supreme Court held;

while appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as whole appears to have ring

of truth, Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary

for the court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in

view the deficiencies, drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the

evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against

the general tenor of the evidence given by the witness and whether the

earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of

belief.

As stated earlier in the judgment the evidence of PW 5 was not challenged.

Only a suggestion that due to his animosity with the accused appellants

PW 5 was implicating them. This suggestion was without any

acceptable basis and has to be rejected. When the evidence of PW 5 is

unchallenged that evidence is admissible.

In Fradd vs Brown and Company 20 NLR 282 at 283 it was held

It is rare that a decision of a Judge so express, so explicit upon a

point of fact purely is over ruled by a Court of Appeal, because Courts

of Appeal recognize the priceless advantage which a judge of first

instance has in matters of that kind, as contrasted with any judge of a

Court of Appeal, who can only learn from papers or from narrative of

those who were present. It is very rare, in questions of veracity so

direct and so specific as these, a Court of Appeal will over rule a

Judge of first instance.

14

The unchallenged evidence of PW 5 is that a person was struck by the lorry

driven by the 3rd accused, (tyre marks observed in the report) stabbed by the 2nd and

3rd accused which is corroborated by medical evidence, the vehicle was driven with

the person tied to the axle of the lorry and being dragged in that manner has sustained

extensive injuries in the body which again was corroborated by medical evidence

and the evidence of the government analyst.

The participation of each of the accused and the joint responsibility and

liability has been very well established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.

In AG Vs. Potta Naufer and others 2007(2) SLR 144 Thilakawardhena J held that;

When relying on circumstantial evidence to establish the charge of

conspiracy to commit murder and the charge of murder, the proved

items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly

point towards the only inference that the accused committed the

offence.

In Kusumadasa Vs. State 2011(1) SLR 240 Sisira de Abrew J has decided that;

The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused

had the opportunity of committing the offence. The accused can be

found guilty only and only if the proved items of circumstantial

evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent with their

innocence.

In Sarath Fernando Vs. Attorney General 2014 (1) SLR 16 it was held that;

In order to justify the inference of guilty from purely circumstantial

evidence the inculpatory facts be incompatible with the innocence of

the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable

hypothesis than that of his guilt.

15

In Premawansa V Attorney General 2009 (2) SLR 205 Sisira de Abrew J has held

that;

In a case of circumstantial evidence if an inference of guilt is to be

drawn, such an inference must be the one and only irresistible and

inescapable conclusion that the accused committed the offence.

On the totality of the evidence led in the case and in the light of the above

authorities, the only irresistible and inescapable conclusion that can be arrived with

the proved items of circumstantial evidence is that the three accused appellants had

committed the murder of Karupaiah Vanarajah at Kandapola.

Accordingly, the conviction and the sentence of all three appellants are

affirmed. The appeal is dismissed.

The registrar is directed to send a copy of the judgment together with the

original case record to the High Court of Nuwara Eliya.
