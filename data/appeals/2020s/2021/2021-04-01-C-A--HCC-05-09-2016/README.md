R. Gurusinghe, J.

The seven Accused-Appellants together with two others (who were deceased at

the time of the trial) were indicted in the High Court of Tangalle on five counts.

On the first count the Accused-Appellants were charged with being the

members of an unlawful assembly on or about 19.03.1989, in which the

common object was to abduct L.M. Andirishamy an offence punishable under

Section 140 of the Penal Code.

On the second count they were charged with the abduction of the said

Andirishamy with the common intention to murder the said Andirishamy an

offence punishable under Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

4

On the third count they were charged with being members of the said unlawful

assembly in which the common object was to kill the said Andirishamy an

offence punishable under Section 355 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code.

On the fourth count they were charged with committing the murder of the said

Andiris Appuhamy in the same transaction, an offence punishable under

Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

The fifth count was for being members of the said unlawful assembly whose

common object was to murder L.M. Andirishamy an offence punishable under

Section 296 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code.

At the trial, the prosecution led evidence of PW1, a son of the deceased and

PW2, a daughter of the deceased. The rest of the witnesses were official

witnesses.

The evidence of PW1 was that at the time of the incident there was no

electricity; they were using a bottle lamp ( ). Around 9.30 p.m. upon

hearing the dogs barking he had gone up to the stile (). At that point he

had seen a crowd of about 15-12 people gathered around his house. He could

not identify them and as he was trying to come inside, one person had poked a

gun inside his ear. PW1 further said that he could not identify that person as

that person had covered his face. He further stated that the people had come

in search of his father, the deceased. After a while PW1 called out to the

deceased and the deceased had come out. The witness had followed his father

for about 20 feet and at that moment he had lost consciousness upon being

attacked on the head and when he regained consciousness, he was inside the

house.

This witness had further stated that the persons who had abducted his father

were armed with guns and swords, and about five minutes later he heard two-

5

or three-gun shots from the direction of the main road. He and his brother had

come out from a window and had gone towards the direction of the beach, as

his brother had said to him that the sound of earlier gunshots came from the

direction of the beach. He had seen his fathers body and another persons

body on the beach.

It was the evidence of PW1 that he had identified the persons who had

abducted his father through their voice. He made a complaint to the police on

the following day. He did not mention the names of the persons who had

abducted his father out of fear that they would kill him and other members of

the family. He had made a second statement to the police in 1992, mentioning

the names of nine persons as the people who had abducted his father. The

Attorney General indicted those nine people in the High Court of Tangalle.

The main ground of appeal of the accused-appellants is that the evidence

relating to identity of the accused-appellants is wholly unsafe. They also urged

the belatedness of the complaint and few other grounds of appeal.

PW1 stated in his evidence in chief that he had identified the accused by their

voice as the accused were from the same village and the adjoining village.

He had stated as follows at page 187 of the brief.

This is the evidence with regard to the identification of the accused.

PW2 in her evidence had said that she had identified Lal, the 1st accused.

(1st accused was deceased when the trial took place in the High Court)

However, even after three years later when she had made a second statement

to the police, she had not mentioned the name of Lal in her statement.

At page 255 of the brief, she had stated as follows:

PW2 had stated that the 1st accused, Lal had questioned,

?.

She further said that the 1st accused had put the gun point to her chest.

However, her position was that she had forgotten to mention Lals name in her

statement to the police.

PW1 made a complaint to the police on the 20th March 1992 where he said that

about 20-25 people had come to his house and abducted his father and later

his fathers body was found on the beach. He further stated that all the people

who had come to his house were either wearing sun glasses or covering their

faces with black cloths and he could not identify anyone of them. He had made

a further statement in January 1992 naming about ten people as the persons

who abducted his father.

In his evidence in the High Court his position was that although the persons

who had come to his house were covering their faces with black cloths, he had

identified them through their voice and their body shape.

PW2 had also given evidence and stated that the accused were there among the

people who abducted her father. She had conveniently omitted to say that the

people who had come to her house were covering their faces. However, it was

the position of both PW1 and PW2 that all the accused were either from their

village or the adjoining village and they could be identified by their voice.

The learned High Court Judge had quoted a passage from E.R.S.R.

Coomaraswamys book on The Law of Evidence Volume 1 page 257.

Passage is as follows:

Identification of accused by voice

Some witnesses purport to identify a person by his voice. It is not safe to rely on

such identification and the liability to error is great. This is particularly for when

the identification was at night. But when the accused was intimately known to

the witnesses who identify him by his voice and gait, the Supreme Court of India

decline to hold that identification was unsafe. In South Africa voice identification

parades have been held with dubious results

This passage also emphasises the fact that generally voice identification is

unsafe to rely on. It is to be noted that accurate voice identification is very

difficult than visual identification.

In Nilesh Dinkar Paradkar vs State of Maharashtra on 9 March, 2011

(https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/187034258, accessed on 18.032021.)

The Supreme Court of India Stated as follows;

31. Chapter 14 of Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice discuss

the law in England with regard to Evidence of Identification. Section 1 of this

Chapter deals with Visual Identification and Section II relates

to Voice Identification. Here again, it is emphasized that voice identification is

more difficult than visual identification. Therefore, the precautions to be observed

should be even more stringent than the precautions which ought to be taken in

relation to visual identification. Speaking of lay listeners (including police

10

officers), it enumerates the factors which would be relevant to judge the ability of

such lay listener to correctly identify the voices

In Pratap Singh vs The State of M.P. decided on 17 May, 2017, paragraph 23

states as follow;

23. Identification by voice has to be considered carefully by the court as

accurate voice identification is much more difficult than visual identification. The

Courts have to be extremely cautious in basing a conviction purely on the

evidence of voice identification. Voice identification alone, that too from the

chorus voices of quarrel or scuffle, without any corroborative evidence is always

risky to relied upon to base the conviction. The voice of the speaker should be

clearly audible and not lost or distorted by other sounds or disturbances. The

ability of the individual to identify voices in general and the familiarity of the

listener with the known voice; and even a confident recognition of a

familiar voice by a listener must be established beyond all reasonable doubts by

cogent, positive, affirmative and evidence.

(https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/102967741/)

Courts have emphasized that Courts have to be extremely cautious in basing a

conviction purely on the evidence of voice identification. Before relying on voice

identification, a witness should be examined as to how he was acquainted with

the accused and how he knew the voice of the accused. Identification from the

voice of the accused may be possible, if there had been sufficient evidence to

show that the witness was sufficiently acquainted with the accused in order to

recognize him by voice.

11

In this case, PW1 and PW2 only stated that the accused were from their village

or from the adjoining village. PW1 admitted in evidence that there were about

600 to 700 people in his village alone. Even though the accused were from the

same village or from the adjoining village, there was no sufficient evidence to

show that any of the accused were intimately known to him to recognize them

by their voice. No questions were put to PW1 as to how he knew the voice of

each of the accused. Furthermore, PW1 has admitted that only one or two

persons had spoken to him at the incident. Out of these one or two people, one

was the first accused who had deceased by the time when the trial started.

PW1 had stated that only two persons had spoken to him. One of them was

Lal, the first accused who is dead. The position of both PW1 and PW2 was that

the 1st accused Lal had asked ? This is the only specific

thing that had uttered by any of the accused. Since the first accused is dead, if

at all, there can only be one other person who had spoken to PW1. PW1 has

not specified that any other person spoken to him. Leaving the 1st accused,

there are eight others as accused. PW1 or PW2 has not described how they

had identified each of the accused.

The incident occurred at about 9.30 p.m. There was no electricity, only a bottle

lamp was burning inside the house. Moon light was there as per the evidence

of PW1 and PW2. However, none of the accused was identified by visually

recognizing their faces. According to PW2 there were about 20-25 people and as

per PW1, there were about 15-20 people. Almost after three years PW1 had

given a statement to the police isolating the nine accused out of that 15-25

people.

Except for the bare statement that all the accused were from their village or

from the adjoining village, the prosecution has not led evidence to show that

12

there was sufficient opportunity for the witnesses to identify the accused by

voice.

E.R.S.R. Coomarasway states, when the accused was intimately known to the

witness who identify him by his voice and gait, the Supreme Court of India

decline to hold identification unsafe.

The incident of this case happened at night and there was no electricity, there

was no face recognition. Witnesses had not spoken about gait, height,

complexion, limp or any other physical features of body or special character of

voice of any of the accused. Witness No. 2 being a woman probably could not

have known the voice of the accused intimately. She had not given evidence

with regard to the opportunities that would allow her to acquaint with the

accused so closely in order to identify them by voice. Furthermore, the people

who had come to their house were covering their faces and that would distort

their voice. These two witnesses had not described how each accused could

be identified by voice or by body shape or silhouette.

Therefore, the proposition is that identification by voice is a weak piece of

evidence. It is the duty of the prosecution to lead cogent and affirmative

evidence to prove the case for the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. The

opportunity to make errors regarding the identities of the accused in a

situation like the incident in this case is great.

It is to be noted that the witness had stated to the police in 1989 that they

could not identify the assailants. They have given the names of the accused

almost three years after the incident. Their position was that they had not

divulged the names of the accused out of fear of their life. This could be

13

accepted as reasonable. However, they had given the names of the accused in

January 1992. There was a considerable delay. However, I do not wish to go

into whether the delay is reasonable or sufficiently explained because the

identities of the accused were not established beyond reasonable doubt.

For the reasons set out above, I hold that the identities of the persons who had

come to abduct the deceased were not established beyond reasonable doubt.

Therefore, I set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed on the accused

and acquit them of all the charges. Appeal is allowed.
