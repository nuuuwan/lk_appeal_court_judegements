MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to revise the order of the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 16.10.20. At this point this court

has to consider whether the notices should be issued on the respondents or

not.

It is trite law that when a party files a revision application the party filling the

same must convince this court that there are exceptional circumstances

which shocks the conscious of this court in the impugned order , and it had

been held in Dharmaratne and another vs. Palm Paradise Cabanas ltd 2003

(3) SLR24 by Amaratunga J.

In the instant matter the petitioner had been indicted in the High Court of

Colombo under section 454 and 459 and upon conclusion of the trial before

the learned High Court Judge the petitioner had been convicted, and the said

judgment is being canvassed in the instant revision application.

According to the submissions of the petitioner the entire case is based on

P34 which is an arbitration award and the learned High Court Judge has

decided this to be a forged document. But the petitioner urges that the said

document had been decided to be a genuine document by the Commercial

High Court decided on 14.5.12. The said order had been appealed to the

Supreme Court and the Supreme Court has refused the leave to appeal

application on the basis that the said application as being out of time.

Therefore the petitioner stated before this court that under the provisions of

the Constitution the learned High Court Judge had no jurisdiction to hear and

determine the matter.

The learned High Court Judge had observed that the order regarding the

arbitration award made on 14.5.12, which declared that the said award was

not a forgery had been made by a civil court and the criminal court is not

bound by the said order. But the position of the petitioner is that since the

Supreme Court has dismissed the leave to appeal application, the learned

High Court Judge is bound by the same.

The Counsel appearing for the respondents raised two preliminary objections

on issuing notices, they are,

1) The petitioner had not added the parties to the caption of the petitioner

referred to in the petition,

2) The petitioner had filed an appeal against the instant impugned order

therefore the instant application for revision is redundant.

Upon perusal of the petition the petitioner has made references to the Board

of Investments but the same had not been added as a party. But this court

observes the petitioner had not sought any relief from the BOI.

Secondly the petitioner concedes that he has filed an appeal against the

impugned judgment, therefore this court has to consider whether a party can

file a revision and an appeal simultaneously. Hence at this point this court

would very briefly state the difference between an appeal and a revision. It is

trite law that revision is a discretionary power of court and an appeal is a

statutory right of a party. Therefore when the right of appeal is provided by

statute the question is, can a party file a revision application as well. It has

been held in ,K.W.Ranjith Samarasinghe vs. K.W. Wilbert CA (PHC) 127/99

by Abrew J. that it is well established principle that a party who has an

alternative remedy can invoke revisionary jurisdiction of a superior court

Page 5 of 6

only upon establishment of exceptional circumstances. The same has been

held in Rustom vs. Hapangama 78-79 NLR 225.

Therefore it is very clear that when a right of appeal lies if a revision

application is filed the petitioner has to satisfy court that there are

exceptional circumstances. The exceptionality in the instant matter, the

petitioner urges is that the document upon which the entire prosecution

case lies has been held to be a genuine document by a parallel civil

jurisdiction, and the relevant leave to appeal application by the Supreme

Court has been dismissed and therefore the learned High Court Judge had no

jurisdiction to hear and determine the case.

The learned High Court Judge has very correctly held that the criminal court

is not bound by an order of a civil court , and also the dismissal of the leave

to appeal application in the Supreme Court has been based based only on

the appealable time period pertaining to the Arbitration Act no 11 of 1995

and had not gone in to the validity of the document referred to in the instant

matter, hence this court is unable to agree with the submissions of the

learned Presidents Counsel that the learned High Court Judge had no

jurisdiction to hear and determine the trial in the instant case.

Therefore upon consideration of the above submissions of the petitioner and

the respondents on the preliminary objection, this court decides not to issue

notices in the instant application.

Therefore the instant application is dismissed.
