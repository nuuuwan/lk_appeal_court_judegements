Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the claimant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the appellant) in terms of Article 138 of The Constitution.

The appellant is the absolute owner of the vehicle bearing the registration

number SG-PH 4430, which had been confiscated by the learned Magistrate of

Kuchchaveli.

Nine accused persons had been charged before the learned Magistrate of

Kuchchaveli by the Officer-in-Charge of the Pulmoddai Police for committing the

following offences.

1. The accused trespassed into the protected forest, namely Elandamunei

forest reserve, without proper authority on 12-12-2016, and thereby

committed an offence punishable in terms of section 6(2)(a) of the Forest

Ordinance as amended.

2. At the same time and at the same transaction, they dug the soil of the said

reserve forest, and thereby committed an offence punishable in terms of

section 6(2)(p) of the Forest Ordinance as amended.

3. At the same time and at the same transaction, the accused conducted

digging of the said reserve forest with the intention of exploring antiquities,

and thereby committed an offence punishable in terms of section 6 of the

Antiquities Ordinance as amended, read with the Increase of Fines Act

No. 12 of 2005.

In the plaint filed in that regard, the complainant has listed several witnesses

and had listed the following as productions.

1. Nissan Caravan white-coloured vehicle numbered SG-PH 4430 and its

ignition key.

2. One mamoty of 8 x 14 size.

3. One picas.

When the accused were charged before the learned Magistrate of Kuchchaveli,

they have pleaded guilty to all three counts preferred against them.

Based on their own plea, the learned Magistrate has sentenced them, and

thereafter, has decided to hold an inquiry in relation to the vehicle mentioned as

a production on the basis that the 1st and the 2nd count preferred against them

are counts under the Forest Ordinance and hence, the earlier mentioned vehicle

is subject to confiscation in terms of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance.

At the inquiry held in that regard, the petitioner who had been the absolute

owner of the vehicle has come forward and claimed the vehicle. It is clear from

the certificate of registration of the relevant motor vehicle produced in the Court

that, the 1st accused charged before the Magistrates Court had been the

registered owner of the vehicle, which explains the application by the absolute

owner, rather than the registered owner.

After the conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Magistrate of Kuchchaveli by the

order dated 23-08-2017 had decided to confiscate the vehicle on the basis that

the absolute owner has failed to establish the fact that he had meaningful control

over the vehicle at the time of the commission of the offence, and the owner of

the vehicle has failed to show that he took the necessary precautions to prevent

the offence being committed.

Being dissatisfied by the said order, the appellant has preferred an application

in revision in terms of Article 154P of The Constitution to the Provincial High

Court of the Eastern Province Holden in Trincomalee.

After hearing the application, the learned Provincial High Court Judge of the

Eastern Province Holden in Trincomalee has dismissed the said application by

the judgment dated 15-10-2018, on the basis that there are no exceptional

circumstances for the Court to interfere with the order of the learned Magistrate

of Kuchchaveli.

It is against this judgment the appellant has preferred this appeal.

Page 6 of 10

At the hearing of this appeal, the position taken up by the learned Counsel for

the appellant was that this was not a charge or charges where section 40(1) of

the Forest Ordinance becomes applicable, and hence, the learned Magistrate has

ordered an inquiry in terms of the said section without a legal basis. Therefore,

the order of the learned Magistrate as well as the judgment of the learned

Provincial High Court Judge has no validity before the law.

His contention was that, to attract the provisions of section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance, there must be an allegation or a charge to the effect such tool, vehicle,

implement, cattle, or the machine was used in committing the offence mentioned

in the charge or charges.

It was pointed out that though the vehicle in question has been mentioned as a

production before the Magistrates Court case, no charge has been formulated

on the basis that the said vehicle was used in committing any offence. The

learned Counsel for the appellant moved for the release of the vehicle on the

basis that it had been confiscated not in accordance with the law.

The learned State Counsel who represented the complainant-respondent-

respondents was of the view that the charge need not explain the modus operandi

of the accused. He was of the view that the learned Magistrate has well

considered who can claim a vehicle under section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance

and has correctly come to her decision after analyzing the relevant legal

principles which needs no disturbance from this Court.

He contended further that the learned Provincial High Court Judge has also

considered the relevant legal provisions in his judgment and had come to a

correct determination when it was decided to dismiss the revision application

filed before the High Court. The learned State Counsel moved for the dismissal

of the appeal.

Having considered the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the

appellant, I find that this was not a position taken up when the matter was heard

before the learned Magistrate of Kuchchaveli or argued at the hearing of the

revision application before the learned Provincial High Court Judge. However,

since the matter taken up before this Court was a pure question of law, I find

that this question of law can be taken up before this Court at the hearing of this

appeal.

As the argument revolves around the interpretation of section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance, I find it relevant to reproduce the relevant section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance as amended by the Forest (Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009, which

reads as follows;

40. (1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence-

a) All timber or forest produce which is not the property of the

state in respect of which such offence has been committed;

and

b) All tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in

committing such offence (the emphasis is mine)

shall in addition to any other punishment specified of such

offence be confiscated by the order of the convicting

Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements, and machines used in the commission of such offence,

is a third party, no order of confiscation shall be made if such owner

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

cattle and machines, as the case maybe for the commission of the

offence. (the emphasis is mine)

Page 8 of 10

In view of the above section which is the relevant section under which a

confiscation order can be made, it is abundantly clear that the intention of the

legislature had been to confiscate the items mentioned in the section if the said

item has been used in committing any of the offences mentioned in terms of the

Forest Ordinance.

I am in agreement with the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant

that the only way for an accused person to know that he is being charged for

using an item which can be subjected to confiscation in terms of section 40(1) of

the Forest Ordinance would be by stating that the offence was committed using

the relevant vehicle or any other item mentioned in section 40(1) and also

mentioning the relevant section in the charge itself.

I am of the view that only by mentioning the relevant offence in detail and the

relevant sections the accused person has violated, the necessary ingredients of

a charge in terms of section 164 and 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

can be fulfilled which amounts to giving sufficient notice of the charge preferred

against an accused person.

As I have stated before, the 1st and the 2nd count preferred against the accused-

appellant had been under the Forest Ordinance for trespassing the mentioned

reserve forest and digging inside the said reserve forest.

The only section which may attract a confiscation of a vehicle was the 1st count,

where the allegation had been that the accused trespassed into the protected

reserve forest. If the intention of the complainant was to charge the accused for

using a vehicle to trespass into the reserve forest, the charge in that regard

should reflect that fact, indicating the vehicle used for such trespassing into the

reserve forest.

I am of the view that by mere inclusion of a vehicle as a production in the plaint

filed against the accused would not be sufficient to fulfill the mandatory

requirements of a charge.

Page 9 of 10

For the matters considered as above, I am of the view that there was no legally

valid basis for the learned Magistrate of Kuchchaveli to direct the owner of the

vehicle to show cause as to why the vehicle should not be confiscated, since there

had been no allegation that the vehicle was used in committing any of the

relevant two counts mentioned in the charge sheet preferred against the accused

in the Magistrates Court case.

I find that in the order of the learned Magistrate, the evidence has been

considered on the basis that the vehicle had been used in the commissioning of

the offence, whereas there was no basis for such a conclusion.

Under the circumstances, I find that all the decided cases of our Superior Courts

considered by the learned Magistrate and the learned Provincial High Court

Judge are cases where the charges were on the footing that the relevant vehicles

considered in those decided cases were used in the commission of the offence,

which has been specifically mentioned in the relevant charges filed before the

relevant Magistrates Court.

I find that this was not the case in the charges filed before the learned Magistrate

of Kuchchaveli in the action under consideration. If it was so, it can be safely

determined that the learned Magistrate, as well as the learned Provincial High

Court Judge, was correct in their determinations. However, as I have determined

previously, since there had been no allegation that the vehicle concerned had

been used in committing the mentioned offence, I find that the relevant

confiscation order had been made without a legal basis in terms of section 40(1)

of the Forest Ordinance in that regard.

Accordingly, agreeing with the legal submissions made by the learned Counsel

for the appellant, I set aside the order dated 23-08-2017 of the learned

Magistrate of Kuchchaveli and the judgment dated 15-10-2018 of the learned

Provincial High Court Judge of Eastern Province Holden in Trincomalee as both

the said order and the judgment cannot be allowed to stand.

I direct that the vehicle numbered SG-PH 4430 shall be released to the appellant,

who claimed the vehicle as the absolute owner of the same.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the

Provincial High Court of the Eastern Province Holden in Trincomalee together

with the original case record.

The Registrar is also directed to send a copy of this judgment to the Magistrates

Court of Kuchchaveli for necessary action and compliance.
