However, it is also pertinent to note that the Petitioner has failed to establish this ground through any independent evidence other than to submit two medical reports to demonstrate that she had been sick and that medicines had been prescribed for her illness. The said medical reports were marked as P20 with the affidavit she had tendered to the arbitration Court marked as P22. The medical report was issued for 5 days and covers the date for which the arbitration proceedings were to be held. However, the Petitioner has failed to submit any material to establish her attempts to communicate with her Counsel and the failure to do so. The Petitioner contends that the arbitrator should have acted under Section 17(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act and have used his discretion fairly and reasonably but by not doing so the arbitrators award is impugned on the basis that it violates the rules of natural justice, error on the face of record and also on the basis that it violates her legitimate expectations.",

Further, this fact is substantiated by her birth certificate marked as P1. The dispute had been referred for arbitration and the arbitrator has been appointed by letters marked as P6 and P7 which are dated 03.01.2023 and 28.12.2022 (paragraph 4 of the Petition). Hence, it is established by the Petitioners own documents that by the time the arbitrator was appointed and the matter was referred for arbitration, the Petitioner had retired. It is observed that the said referral had been made nearly two years after the Petitioners retirement. With her retirement, the employer-employee relationship the Petitioner had with the 1st Respondent comes to an end. Hence, after 15.01.2020 there is no contractual relationship between the parties in the capacity of employer and employee. With the cessation of such relationship there cannot be a live industrial dispute between the parties to refer to an industrial arbitration under Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act.",

He has merely to form an opinion whether the dispute was a minor dispute that could be settled by compulsory arbitration. Once he forms that view he is only concerned with taking the preliminary step of ordering a reference to have the dispute settled by arbitration. The power he exercises is of a purely administrative nature and it is his duty to see that there is industrial peace in the country. There is nothing in the Act itself to indicate that once he makes an order his powers are exhausted nor are there any expressed prohibitions on the exercise of that power. As the exercise of the powers of Minister of Labour were being questioned he should properly have been made a party to the petition before the Court of Appeal from the very outset.",
