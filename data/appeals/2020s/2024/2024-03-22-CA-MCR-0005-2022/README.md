Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application by the respondent-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

petitioner) invoking the revisionary jurisdiction granted to this Court in terms of

Article 138 of The Constitution.

Although the petitioner has stated in the heading of his petition that, he is

making this application in terms of Article 154 of the Constitution read with the

Provisions of Chapter XXIX of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and Section 9

of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, I find

that the petitioner has mentioned these provisions either purposely or

Page 4 of 9

misdirected as to the relevant law. Article 154 of The Constitution has several

sub-articles, which does not refer to any power of the Court of Appeal in

exercising its jurisdiction. The only sub-article, which refers to the judiciary is

the Article 154P, where the High Court of the relevant province has been

conferred with the power to exercise appellate, revisionary, and limited writ

jurisdiction under certain limited circumstances in relation to judgments and

orders pronounced by the Magistrates Court and the Primary Courts within its

jurisdiction.

The only Article that refers to the Court of Appeal is Article 154P (6) which reads

as follows:

(6) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and any law, any

person aggrieved by a final order, judgement or sentence of any Court,

in the exercise of its jurisdiction under paragraph (3) (b) or (3) (c) or

(4) may appeal therefrom to the Court Appeal in accordance with

Article 138.

The above sub-article has no relevance to the application before this Court, as

this is not an appeal, but an application seeking the discretionary remedy of

revision from this Court.

Chapter XXIX of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act is a Chapter where certain

procedural aspects of hearing and determining of an application in revision has

been stipulated.

The mentioned Section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

Act No. 19 of 1990 refers to an appeal to the Supreme Court from the High Court

in certain cases, which has nothing to do with the application before this Court.

In accordance with the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, the High Court of

the Provinces was established in terms of Article 154P of The Constitution. After

its establishment, the appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of the

convictions, sentences and orders by Magistrates Courts or Primary Courts

Page 5 of 9

within the province, stands exclusively within the powers of the relevant

Provincial High Court.

The relevant Article 154P (3) (b) reads as follows,

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any law,

exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by Magistrates

Court and Primary Courts within the province.

This Article clearly shows that the intention of the legislature had been to grant

revisionary and appellate powers to the relevant Provincial High Court as

mentioned in the Article.

It is my considered view that in view of the provisions of Article 154P of the

Constitution, Article 138 of the Constitution should be read and understood

subject to Article 154P (3) (b), where it states that notwithstanding anything in

Article 138, the provision of Article 154P shall become operative.

The petitioner has come before this Court seeking to challenge the orders

pronounced by the learned Additional Magistrate of Negombo on 25-04-2022 and

29-04-2022, in the Magistrates Court of Negombo Case Number M/49423.

The said orders have been pronounced by the learned Magistrate in terms of

Section 4 and 5 of the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act No. 34 of 2005

(hereinafter referred to as the Act), which are orders against the petitioner.

These orders are essentially temporary orders until the relevant Court considers

the application and decides whether to grant protection orders as stipulated in

the said Act.

Section 17 of the Act has provided for the right of appeal for a person who is

dissatisfied with an order made by the Magistrate under Section 6 or 7, which

are the sections under which a protection order can be granted.

Page 6 of 9

In terms of the said section, an appeal can be preferred to the High Court

established under Article 154P of the Constitution, challenging the order.

Since it is clear that the relevant Act had not provided for an appeal to be

preferred against an interim order as in this case, if dissatisfied of an interim

order, the constitutionally guaranteed remedy available to the petitioner, is to

file an application seeking to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the relevant

Provincial High Court in terms of Article 154P of the Constitution.

I am of the view that the petitioner has circumvented the Constitutionally

guaranteed remedy available to him by using the powers vested in the Court of

Appeal in terms of Article 138 of The Constitution and the provisions of Section

12 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 on

the basis that the Court of Appeal still can entertain a direct application in

revision, challenging a decision of a Magistrates Court.

I find that this is not in line with the intention of the legislature and the spirit of

the Constitution. I view this as a practice that should not be encouraged under

any circumstances. However, since this Court has previously decided to

entertain this application and issue notice of it to the mentioned respondent, it

was decided by this Court to consider the application on its merit.

The only basis upon which the petitioner can succeed in this application is by

establishing that he has exceptional circumstances, which require the

intervention of this Court, by invoking the extraordinary discretionary remedy of

revision of this Court.

It was held in the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. Vs. Mercantile Hotels

Management Ltd. (1987) 1 SLR 05 that;

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the appellate

Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist

warranting its intervention.

Page 7 of 9

In the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Thamaratnam, (Srikantha Law Reports Vol-IV

page 47) it was held that;

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the

Court.

In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd. Vs. Jayasekare (1997) 2 SLR 365 it

was held thus;

Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has

occurred due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only

when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of

justice.

In his petition before this Court, under Paragraph 16, the petitioner has

mentioned several grounds, which he has termed as exceptional grounds

available to him. Therefore, it is my view that the petitioner needs to establish

that the mentioned exceptional circumstances exist for him to succeed in this

application.

The petitioner is seeking to revise or set aside interim protection orders made by

the learned Additional Magistrate of Negombo on 25-04-2022 and 29-04-2022.

On 25-04-2022, the learned Additional Magistrate of Negombo has heard the

application made under the provision of the Act. After hearing evidence of the

aggrieved party and other witnesses, the learned Magistrate has pronounced the

said interim protection order. Thereafter, the said interim order had been served

on the petitioner. It needs to be noted that when this matter was taken up for

hearing, the petitioner has also been present with legal representation and he

has been allowed to cross-examine the witnesses.

When this matter was mentioned again on 29-04-2022, the learned Magistrate

has extended the interim protection order for 14 days and the matter has been

fixed on further inquiry on 20-05-2022.

Page 8 of 9

Although the petitioner has come before this Court challenging the above two

orders, the petitioner has failed to enlighten this Court as to the present status

of this application, and whether a protection order was issued against him.

Once an interim protection order is issued, any respondent against whom the

interim order is issued can appear before the Court and show cause as to why a

protection order should not be issued against him.

When it comes to the facts relating to this case, since the petitioner has had legal

representation even at the stage of issuing of an interim protection order, there

is no material before this Court to assume that the petitioner was not afforded

an opportunity to show cause. There is no material before this Court as to what

was the final result of this application or whether it is still pending before the

Court.

It is clear from the material placed before the Court that there had been a

previous application as well between the parties, where a protection order has

been issued. Since it has been issued for a specific period, the present action

has been instituted by the police on the basis that the aggrieved party still needs

protection under the provisions of the Act.

Although the learned Counsel for the petitioner argued that the police took steps

to initiate proceedings in the Magistrates Court without even recording a

statement from the petitioner, and there was no evidence before the Court to

issue an interim protection order, I find no basis for such a contention. I am of

the view that the intention of the legislature by enacting this law has been to

prevent domestic violence. The provisions of the Act are clear that a Magistrate

can act, depending on the relevant facts and the circumstances in order to

prevent domestic violence.

The Act has clearly stipulated the procedure that has to be followed in issuing

interim orders in that regard. I am of the view that, having considered the nature

of the issue, recording a statement from the petitioner who was the respondent

named in the action before the Magistrates Court was not a must.

Page 9 of 9

Besides that, this is an order, not made ex parte but after an inter parte inquiry.

The petitioner has been allowed to cross-examine the witnesses. It is clear from

the interim protection order that the learned Magistrate has considered all the

relevant facts and the circumstances, and also has considered the evidence

placed before the Court in issuing the interim protection order.

As the Act itself has provided a solution for the petitioner to show cause before

the Court if he was dissatisfied with the interim protection order, he has no bar

to go before the same Court and establish his case rather than seeking to

challenge the interim protection order, which is a temporary order.

If the petitioner is dissatisfied with any final protection order pronounced by the

learned Magistrate, he has the right to appeal against such an order in terms of

Section 17 of the Act to the relevant Provincial High Court.

For the reasons considered as above, I find no basis to conclude that the

petitioner has any exceptional circumstances to seek the discretionary remedy

of revision from this Court. Accordingly, the revision application is dismissed.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the

relevant Magistrates Court of Negombo for information.
