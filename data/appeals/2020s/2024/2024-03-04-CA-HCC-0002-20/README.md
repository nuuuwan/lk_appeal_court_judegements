JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam J

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing the murder

of Mumthaj Begam on or about 21/09/2014 which is an offence punishable

under Section 296 of Penal Code.

After a non-jury trial, the Learned Trial Judge convicted the Appellant on the

count of murder and sentenced him to death on 05/02/2020.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court seeking to set aside the conviction and

sentence imposed on him. Deceased was a work mate of the Appellant and

was responsible for paying salary to the workers employed by the Appellant.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

had given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. During the argument he was connected via zoom from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. Did the Learned trial Judge fail to properly evaluate the evidence of the

prosecution and the defence?

2. Did the Learned Trial Judge fail in considering whether complying with

Section 109 (1) (2) and (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15

of 1979 by the prosecution amounts to an unfair trial for the accused?

3. Did the Learned Trial Judge failed to appreciate and give the benefit of

the prosecutions failure not calling the fingerprint on the Kerosene oil

bottle marked P2 as stated by PW7, as it creates a reasonable doubt

of prosecutions case as to whether the deceased herself set fire on

her?

Back ground of the case

On the day of the incident witness PW1, 3rd son of the deceased, who was

only 9 years old at that time, was at home when the incident had taken place.

He has two brothers who had gone to play on the date of incident. The

Appellant who is a frequent visitor had come to his house at about 3.00pm

and had chat with his mother for about 15 minutes inside the 1st room of

the house. As he was having his food in the hall, he had no idea as to what

they spoke about. When the deceased stepped out of the room after the

conversation, the Appellant had dealt a blow on her cheek. Then the

deceased had moved into the 2nd room and the witness watched inside of the

room through a window. The witness had seen the Appellant taking a

kerosene oil can from the corner of the 2nd room and placing the same next

to the window of the 2nd room. Thereafter he had seen the Appellant pouring

kerosene oil over the deceased and setting fire on the deceased. At that time,

he had cried for help. Then the deceased stepped out of the house, but the

Appellant was seeing merely seated inside the 2nd room. PW1 had gone to

the next door and informed the neighbour about the incident and when he

came with the neighbour, the villagers had gathered there and doused the

fire. The deceased was taken to hospital in the three-wheeler of PW5. The

Appellant also went in the three-wheeler. The deceased had passed away

while receiving treatment in the hospital. Due to serious burn injuries this

witness could not speak to his mother. After the incident the Appellant never

came to his house.

PW5, Imran was a three-wheeler driver by profession lived within the walking

distance of the deceaseds house. After receiving the information, he had

CA/HCC/0002/20

4 | P a g e

gone to deceaseds house with his three-wheeler and taken the deceased to

the hospital. When he went to the deceaseds house, he had seen the

deceased was seated with burn injuries.

PW13 JMO Wijewardena had conducted the post-mortem examination and

confirmed that the deceased had suffered 95% burn injuries on her body

surface area caused by short lasted intense flame burn due to oxidative and

ignition of clothing of victim. The JMO further opined that there is medical

evidence of pre-mortem violence, upright posture of the victim and upward

trend of the flames and defence movements against the rising flames. Back

of the trunk was more affected than the front.

As there was a case to answer, the Learned High Court Judge had called for

the defence and the Appellant made a dock statement and took up the

position that he was unaware as to how the deceased got burnt. The

Appellant further said that he worked with the deceased at salt reservoir,

and he entrusted the deceased to pay salaries to other workers. He was a

frequent visitor of the deceaseds house and deceased used to prepare food

for him. The village mosque had furthermore advised the Appellant not to

visit the deceaseds house. His brothers also warned him not to visit the

deceased. When he told this to the deceased and left the house, he had seen

the deceased was engulfed with flames. According to him, he had

surrendered to the police.

In the first ground of Appeal the Learned Counsel contended that the

Learned High Court had failed to evaluate the evidence of the prosecution

and the defence.

In this case PW1 was 09 years old when he witnessed the gruesome incident.

When he gave evidence in the High Court, he was 14 years old.

In Ranjeet Kumar Ram v. State of Bihar [2015] SCC Online SC 500 the

court held that:

Evidence of the child witness and its credibility would depend upon the

circumstances of each case. Only precaution which the court has to bear

in mind while assessing the evidence of a child witness is that the

witness must be a reliable one.

Learned High Court Judge in his judgment considered the age of PW1 and

discussed how he is going to analyse his evidence in his judgment. The

relevant portion is re-produced below:

In this case, PW1 is an eye witness. Hence, admissibility of the evidence of

an eye witness needs to be discussed very clearly.

Eyewitness testimony is one of the most important kinds of criminal

evidence. In criminal cases, the judges regularly face the difficult but crucial

task of evaluating eyewitnesss testimony. This sometimes means checking

whether the witnesss story fits with other established facts of the case.

However, the veracity of such a story cannot always be verified or falsified

directly. In such cases, judges will have to look at whether the statement

comes from a reliable source.

CA/HCC/0002/20

6 | P a g e

Further, an eyewitnesss testimony is probably the most persuasive form of

evidence presented in court, but in many cases, its accuracy is dubious.

There is also evidence that mistaken eyewitness evidence can lead to

wrongful convictionsending people to prison for years or decades, even to

death row, for crimes they did not commit.

In considering the evidence of an eye witness, the Court should look at the

demeanour of the witness, the inherent probability of the account, any

internal inconsistencies in the account, whether the account is consistent

with previous statements by the witness, whether the witness has any bias

against the accused or any family or group to which the accused belongs,

whether the evidence at the crime scene supports the account, and whether

the witnesss testimony is supported by the testimony of other witnesses.

These factors are very important as the burden of proof is on the prosecution

in all criminal cases.

In The Queen v. K.A. Santin Singho 65 NLR 447 the court held that:

It is fundamental that the burden is on the prosecution. Whether the

evidence the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the burden

is the same. This burden is not altered by the failure of the appellant to

give evidence and explain the circumstances.

The credibility of the witness does not stand impeached merely by proving

contradictions on record. It is required for the defence side to show that

prosecution witnesses may deliberately depose change or improve their

original statement in order to cause prejudice to the accused. Similarly,

minor omission or discrepancy in evidence is not enough to hold the accused

not guilty.

The Learned High Court Judge had very extensively analysed the evidence of

PW1 and considered the contradictions and omission and decided to accept

his evidence as true in this case. The relevant portion of the judgment is re-

produced below:

Learned High Court in his judgment had extensively considered the dock

statement of the Appellant and given his reasons as to why he rejected the

dock statement and accepted the evidence given by PW1.

Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the Learned High Court Judge had not

considered evidence presented by both parties. Hence, the 1st ground urged

by the Appellant is devoid any merit.

In the second ground of appeal the Counsel contended that the Learned Trial

Judge failed to consider whether not complying with Section 109 (1) (2) and

(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 by the prosecution

amount to an unfair trial for the accused.

Section 109 (1) (2) and (3) states as follows:

(1) Every information relating to the commission of an offence may be

given orally or in writing to a police officer or inquirer.

(2) If such information is given orally to a police officer or to an inquirer,

it shall be reduced to writing by him in the language in which it is given

and be read over to the informant; Provided that if it is not possible for

the officer or inquirer to record the information in the language in which

it is given the officer or inquirer shall request that the information be

given in writing. If the informant is unable to give it in writing, the officer

or inquirer shall record the information in one of the national languages

after recording the reasons for doing so and shall read over the record to

the informant or interpret it in the language he understands.

(3) Every such information, whether given in writing or reduced to writing

as aforesaid, shall be signed by the person giving it and such information

CA/HCC/0002/20

8 | P a g e

or a copy thereof as is feasible shall be entered without delay by such

police officer or inquirer in a book hereinafter referred to as " the

Information Book " to be kept by the officer in charge of the police station

at his police station or by the inquirer as the case may be. Such

Information Book shall be in such form as the Minister may provide by

regulations made in that behalf;

Provided that until the Minister by regulations provides the form of the

Information Book, the form, or forms in use on the day immediately

preceding the appointed date shall continue to be valid for use.

PW10, Jayatilaka had recorded the statements of the eye witness PW1 and

PW2 who is the brother of PW1. As both were unable to speak Sinhala

language, their statements had been recorded in Sinhala after being

translated to Tamil to Sinhala by one of the uncles of the witnesses namely

Davud Salma. PW10 had correctly followed the Section 109 (1) (2) and (3) of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

The Court also provided a translator to the witnesses when they gave

evidence during the trial. Therefore, the Appellant had not been subjected to

an unfair trial in this case. Hence, this ground is also devoid of any merit.

In the third ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned Trial

Judge failed to appreciate and give the benefit of the prosecutions failure no

calling the fingerprint on the Kerosene oil bottle marked P2 as stated by PW7,

as it creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecutions case as to whether the

deceased, herself set fire on her.

PW1 had clearly seen the incident that the Appellant had poured kerosene

oil on the deceased and set fire to her. His evidence is clear, believable and

unambiguous. Hence, not taking finger print on the kerosene oil bottle will

not cause any doubt in the prosecution case. Therefore, this ground also has

no merit.

CA/HCC/0002/20

9 | P a g e

As this case solely relies on the evidence of the eye witness and other

circumstantial evidence, I conclude that the prosecution had succeeded in

adducing highly incriminating evidence against the Appellant and thereby

established a strong prima-facie case against him. As such we conclude that

this is not an appropriate case in which to interfere with the findings of the

Learned High Court Judge of Puttalam dated 05/02/2020. Hence, we

dismiss the Appeal.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Puttalam along with the original case record.
