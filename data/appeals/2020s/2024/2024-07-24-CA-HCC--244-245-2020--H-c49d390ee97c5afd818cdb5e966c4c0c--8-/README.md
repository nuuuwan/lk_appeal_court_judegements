The above-named 4th and 5th Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as

5. At the same time and same place, and in the course of the same

transaction the accused caused the death of the afore named

The trial commenced before the Judge of the High Court of Colombo as the

Appellants and other Accused had opted for a non-jury trial. After the

conclusion of the prosecutions case, the learned High Court Judge had

called for the defence. The Appellants and other Accused had made dock

statements and had denied the charges. After the case was fixed for

Judgement, the 3rd Accused had absconded the court. Hence, evidence was

led under Section 241(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and fixed the

case in absentia of the 3rd Accused. After considering the evidence presented

by both parties, the learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellants

and the 3rd Accused as charged and acquitted the 1st and 2nd Accused from

the case. The 3rd Accused and the Appellants were sentenced as follows:

CA/HCC/244-245/20

5

First Count 06 months rigorous imprisonment each.

Second Count death sentence passed against the 3rd Accused

and the Appellants.

Third Court 07 years rigorous imprisonment with Rs.5000/- fine

with a default sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment

against the 3rd Accused and the Appellants.

Fourth Court 03 years rigorous imprisonment with Rs.5000/-

fine with a default sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment

against the 3rd Accused and the Appellants.

5th ,6th, and 7th are alternative counts.

Open warrant had been issued against the 3rd Accused by the Court. Being

aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants preferred

this appeal to this court. For clarity the arraignment of the Appellants in the

High Court Trial is as follows:

1st Appellant (4th Accused in the indictment)

2nd Appellant (5th Accused in the indictment)

The learned Counsels for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants had given consent for this matter to be argued in their absence.

Background of the Case

In this case, the deceased, along with his wife and two sons (PW2 and PW3),

resided in the upper part of a house belonging to the father of the 3rd

Accused. The eldest son of the deceased had eloped with the sister of the 3rd

Accused, which led to an enmity between the deceased and the 3rd Accused's

faction. As the deceased suspected of a possible assault of him and his

family, had gone to lodge a complaint at the Peliyagoda Police Station on the

date of the incident.

CA/HCC/244-245/20

According to PW2 and PW3, their father had instructed them to keep the

house lights off until his return. At the time of the incident, PW2 was 16

years old and PW3 was 14. Following their father's instructions, they

remained at home when the 1st and 3rd Accused arrived, tore down the front

door curtain, assaulted their dog, and left. This incident occurred around

7:00 pm. Despite the lights being off, the individuals' movements were visible

due to the streetlights.

When their parents returned home, a van arrived with approximately six

individuals who disembarked and approached the house. As the door was

not opened, the group broke in, dragged PW2 outside, and assaulted him

under a jackfruit tree. When the deceased intervened to save his son, the 3rd

Accused and the Appellants attacked him with a hockey stick and assaulted

both PW2 and PW3. The witnesses unequivocally identified the 3rd Accused

and the Appellants. The deceased succumbed to his injuries in the hospital,

while PW2 and PW3 received treatment for their injuries. As such, both could

not attend the funeral of their father. PW2 had sustained injuries on his

forehead, hand, and legs. PW3 had sustained fracture on his hand and

undergone a surgery.

The JMO who conducted the postmortem of the deceased had noted 12

injuries on all over the deceaseds body. The cause of death was due to Cranio

cerebral injuries due to assault with heavy, rigid, and elongated blunt

weapons. Medico-Legal Reports of PW2 and PW3 were also marked at the

trial.

Having satisfied that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case

against the Appellants, the learned Trial Judge had called for the defense

and all the Appellants had made dock statements and denied the charges.

The Appellants had separately canvassed their Appeal grounds through their

Counsel.

CA/HCC/244-245/20

7

The First Appellant had filed following grounds of appeal.

1. The Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the evidence against

the 1st Appellant is wholly inadequate to convict him for the charges.

2. The Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the identification of

the 1st Appellant at the material time of the incident has not been

established beyond reasonable doubt.

3. The Learned Trial Judge had shifted the burden on the 1st Appellant

to rebut the evidence of prosecution witnesses.

4. The Learned Trial Judge had misdirected himself on law by applying

the Ellenborough dictum to the facts of the case where there is no

strong prima facie evidence against the 1st Appellant to warranting

an explanation from him.

5. The Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the evidence favorable

to the 1st Appellant and thereby denied a fair trial.

The 2nd Appellant had filed following grounds of appeal.

The Counsel for the 2nd Appellant, while agreeing with grounds 1-4 of the

appeal raised by the 1st Appellant, submitted the following two additional

grounds on behalf of the 2nd Appellant.

1. The Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the omissions on the

evidence of PW2 and PW3 which creates a reasonable doubt on the

prosecution case.

2. The Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the inter se

contradictions of the evidence given by PW2 and PW3 which too create

a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case.

As the appeal grounds raised by the Appellants are interconnected, all

grounds will be considered together hereinafter.

CA/HCC/244-245/20

The Sri Lankan Constitution by Article 13(3) expressly guarantees the right

of a person charged with an offence to be heard by person or by an Attorney-

at-law at a fair trial by a competent Court. The right to a fair trial led to

determine whether an accused is innocent or guilty. This is an

internationally recognised human right. Fair trials help to establish the truth

and are vital for everyone involved in a case. They are a cornerstone of

democracy, helping to ensure fair and just societies, and limiting abuse by

governments and state authorities.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim

the benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side,

and a Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an

umpire to see that the rules of the game are applied by both sides.

A Judge is an administrator of justice, not merely a figure-head,

he has not only to direct and control the proceedings according to

recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done.

In this case, all Accused named in the indictment had been given a fair trial

by the trial judge. All Appellants have been represented by a Counsel

throughout the trial. The court has followed all procedures correctly and had

treated all parties equally.

Accordingly, the Appellants were convicted for Unlawful Assembly, Murder,

Attempted Murder and Causing Grievous Hurt. Although sentences were

passed on counts 5, 6, and 7, these are alternative counts.

Under Section 138 of the Penal Code, an assembly of five or more persons is

an unlawful assembly if it has a common object to contravene domestic law.

In Kulatunga v Mudalihamy (1940) 18 TLR 21 the court held that:

To prove a charge of unlawful assembly punishable under Section 140

of the Penal Code against an accused person it must be established that

CA/HCC/244-245/20

9

the accused knew the common object; and that he intentionally joined

the unlawful assembly and was a member of the unlawful assembly.

In Samy and Others v Attorney General (Bindunuwewa Murder case)

[2007] 2 SLR 216 the court held that:

It is settled law that mere presence of a person at the place where the

members of an unlawful assembly had gathered for carrying out their

illegal common objects does not make him a member of such assembly.

The presumption of innocence would preclude such a conclusion.

Hence, the case against every individual accused must be considered

separately and that omnibus evidence of general character must be closely

scrutinized in order to eliminate false or mistaken implications of innocent

persons.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at pages 27 and 28 had very

clearly analysed the evidence given by the lay witnesses against Appellants.

Further, the Learned High Court Judge, after considering the legal analysis

of unlawful assembly had very correctly found that the Appellants including

3rd Accused guilty to the charges.

Identification evidence is utilized by the prosecution in a criminal trial to

ascertain the individual accused of committing a crime. Various forms of

identification evidence exist, including visual identification, fingerprint

analysis, and DNA profiling. Visual identification evidence involves an

eyewitness recognizing a suspect based on memory.

The court must consider the inherent risks associated with relying on visual

identification evidence, as even sincere witnesses with ample opportunity for

keen observation frequently make erroneous identifications.

CA/HCC/244-245/20

10

The Attorney General v. Joseph Aloysius and Others [1992] 2 Sri L.R.264

the Court held that:

identification may be excluded only if the Court finds that its

admission would have an adverse effect on the fairness of the

proceedings.

In this case, PW2 and PW3 had clearly identified the Appellants through the

lights emanating from the street as the incident had happened on the road.

Further, investigating officer had gone to the place of incident immediately

after the information and had very well observed the light condition of the

area, especially where the deceased was fallen down. The Learned High Court

Judge in his judgment at pages 24-25 very clearly and accurately had

considered the identification evidence and given plausible reasons as to why

he believed the evidence given by PW2 and PW3 with regard to the

identification of the Appellants.

The presumption of innocence is a cornerstone of justice, operating under

the premise that an accused individual is deemed innocent until proven

guilty. Shifting the burden of proof undermines this principle by obliging the

accused to demonstrate their innocence, thereby inverting the traditional

burden of proof. This practice can lead to unjust outcomes, as it unfairly

compels the accused to substantiate a negative assertion. Such a shift is

often regarded as inequitable, placing the onus on the accused rather than

the prosecution. Conversely, the accused may bear the legal responsibility of

refuting a statutory presumption or establishing a statutory defence or

exception to liability.

Considering the judgement of the High Court Judge, we are of the opinion

that nowhere in the judgement the Learned High Court Judge had reversed

the burden on the Appellants to prove their innocence.

CA/HCC/244-245/20

11

In this case the evidence given by PW2 and PW3 are cogent without any

ambiguity. When this gruesome incident happened PW2 was only 16 years

and PW3 was only 14 years. Their father had been assaulted in front of them.

Even though both were children at the time of the incident, both had given

evidence without any contradiction of the main incident. As such, the Trial

Judge is very correct to conclude that the prosecution had presented prima

facie a case against the Appellant. Hence, referring to the Ellenborough

dictum, the judgement had not caused any prejudice to the Appellant.

The Learned High Court Judge, in his judgment, considered all the evidence

presented by both parties and provided reasons for accepting the

prosecution's version while rejecting the defences version.

The Learned Counsel for the 2nd Appellant contended that the omissions

highlighted are important and sufficient to affect the credibility of PW2 and

PW3. The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had very correctly

considered the said omissions and had correctly held that the omissions

highlighted are not sufficient enough to disturb the core of the case.

In Bandara v. The State [2001] 1 SLR 63 the Court held that:

Discrepancies and inconsistencies which do not relate to the core of the

prosecution case, ought to be disregarded especially when all

probability factors echo in favour of the version narrated by a witness.

In this case the learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence

presented by both parties to arrive at his decision. He had properly analyzed

the evidence given by both sides in his judgment. As the evidence adduced

by the Appellants failed to create a doubt over the prosecution case, the

conclusion reached by the Learned High Court Judge in this case cannot be

faulted.

CA/HCC/244-245/20

12

The subsequent conduct of the two Appellants who avoided the police nearly

three weeks after the incident also go on to show that they were acting

together in this case.

As discussed under the appeal grounds advanced by the Appellants, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating evidence against the

Appellants. The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly analyzed all

the evidence presented by all the parties and come to a correct finding that

the Appellants were guilty of the charges levelled against them. Therefore, I

dismiss the Appeal and affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed on

them on 13.02.2020 by the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgement to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
