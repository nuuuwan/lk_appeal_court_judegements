VI. The petitioner has preferred an appeal on 09.08.2021 against the said decision of the PSC and the AAT has decided to retire the petitioner from service with effect from 29.01.2018 (the date of the Notice of VOP) as a merciful alternative. VII. The petitioner has also preferred a re-appeal to the PSC on the same day and made a request to consider the Cabinets Decision dated 18th January 2021 on implementing the recommendations of Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate Incidents of Political Revenge. VIII. However, the implementation of the aforesaid Cabinets Decision had been temporarily suspended and the same has been communicated to the Secretary to the Ministry of National Security by the Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers by the letter dated 10th November 2021 and as such there was no basis to consider the re-appeal made by the petitioner. IX. The Secretary to the Public Service Commission had informed the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice in writing by the letter dated 1st February 2022, copied to the petitioner, that the re-appeal of the petitioner cannot be considered in view of the aforesaid communication, as the said re-appeal is based on the Cabinets Decision, operation of which had been temporarily suspended. X. Subsequent to the above, the PSC has informed the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms by their letter dated 9th February 2023 that steps should be taken to implement the order of AAT by which a decision",

Therefore, the sole basis on which the PSC had chosen to reject the appeal of the petitioner was on the basis that the appeal had been tendered outside the time limit for submitting appeals. Quite apart from the question as to whether a right of appeal should be restricted by the PSC by enforcing a time limit, the rules of the PSC allow that the Commission is able to consider an appeal even though it has been tendered outside the time limits since it is quite evident that the circumstances in which the petitioner had to flee the country are exceptional. There was a real threat to his liberty and to his life. The letter of vacation of post itself was sent to his address in Sri Lanka when he was in the United States.

The police would be the last place he would want to go in such circumstances. Moreover, the AAT has failed to appreciate the fact that the petitioner left the country in order to safeguard himself from an illegal, arbitrary, unjust and unfair arrest, they simply accepted the position of the PSC that there was a valid VOP. The AAT has failed to appreciate that in fact his superiors were aware of the threat to his life. Under these circumstances the order of the AAT appears to be irrational and unreasonable.",
