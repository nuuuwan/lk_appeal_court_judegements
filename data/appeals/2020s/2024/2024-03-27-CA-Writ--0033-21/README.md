Written submissions tendered on:

18.07.2023 by the Petitioner

Argued on: 22.05.2023

Argument concluded by way of written submissions.

Decided on: 27.03.2024.

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner is an Officer in the rank of Lieutenant in the Volunteer Naval Force in

the Sri Lanka Navy and served as a hospitality manager in several naval bases which

are administered by the Sri Lanka Navy. On 05.01.2019, the Petitioner by a letter

marked as P-7 addressed to the Commander of the Navy, requested to be placed him on

compulsory unpaid leave with effect from 26.02.2019. Nevertheless, no specific period

for which he requires leave has been mentioned in P7. By the letter dated 25.03.2019

marked as P-8 issued by the Acting Commanding Officer of the Volunteer Naval

Headquarters, the Petitioner was informed that his request for compulsory unpaid leave

was approved by the Commander of the Navy. During his compulsory unpaid leave

period, he faced the written and practical tests for his next promotion to the rank of

Lieutenant Commander and also participated in the weekly camps held at the Naval

4

Base in Welisara. On 25.12.2019 by a letter marked as P-11, the Petitioner sought

permission from the Commander of the Navy to report back to the active service.

However, by a letter dated 19.02.2020 marked as P-12 issued on behalf of the then

Commander of the Navy (the 2nd Respondent) the Petitioner was informed that his

request to report for active service was refused by the 2nd Respondent, nevertheless, P-

12 does not give any reason to support the 2nd Respondents decision. The Petitioner

again sought permission to report for work from the incumbent Commander of the Navy

(the 1st Respondent) on 05.08.2020 by a letter marked as P-13 but once again his request

was rejected by a letter dated 16.09.2020 marked as P-14 by the 1st Respondent without

assigning any reasons. The Petitioner challenges in the instant Application the decisions

of the 2nd Respondent (P-12) and the 1st Respondent (P-14) not to allow the Petitioner

to report back for work on the basis that those decisions are ultra vires, illegal, contrary

to the Navy Act and the Regulations, malicious, vindicative, devoid of legal reason,

violative of principles of Natural Justice, frustrative of the Petitioners legitimate

expectations, arbitrary, unreasonable, irrational, capricious and unfair.

In this Writ Application, the Petitioner is seeking the following reliefs, inter alia,

a) For the grant and issuance of an order in the nature of Writ of Certiorari

quashing the decision of the 1st Respondent contained in P-14

b) For the grant and issuance of an order in the nature of Writ of Certiorari

quashing the decision of the 2nd Respondent contained in P-12

c) For the grant and issuance of an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus

directing the 1st and 4th Respondents to permit the Petitioner to report for active

service in the Sri Lanka Volunteer Naval Force

5

d) For the grant and issuance of an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus

directing the 1st and 4th Respondents to pay the Petitioner his salary, allowance

and other emoluments with effect from February 2020

By way of preliminary objections, the learned SC appearing for the Respondents argues

that this Writ Application cannot be maintained on several grounds. Firstly, the learned

SC argue that the Petitioner is guilty of laches and has failed to explain the inordinate

delay. However, the Petitioner in his Petition to this Writ Application and Counter

Affidavit, has duly explained the reasons for the delay in seeking redress of this Court

such being that the non-functioning of the Court due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation

prevailed in the country back then. The Court will accept the said position of the

Petitioner and conclude that the delay has been explained by the Petitioner to the

satisfaction of the Court.

Secondly, the learned SC argues that the Petitioner is barred from seeking reliefs from

the Court as he had failed to exhaust the statutory remedy available to him as provided

in the Navy (Redress of Grievances) Regulations of Gazette No.10, 431 of 01 August

1952 marked as R-5 (the Regulations). The Regulations provide that,

Where an officer is aggrieved by any action of and is unsuccessful in obtaining

redress from, his Commanding Officer, he may make a written appeal for redress

to the Commander of the Navy, and where he is aggrieved by any action of the

Commander of the Navy, either in respect of his appeal or in respect of any other

matter, he may make a written appeal to His Excellency the President. An order

made by His Excellency the President on any such appeal shall be final.

[Emphasis added]

6

Accordingly, it appears to this Court that the Regulations provide an adequate remedy

for the Petitioner. Under such circumstances, it is pertinent to consider whether the

Petitioner is entitled to relief from this Court bypassing the remedy provided by the

Regulations. When perusing the language used in the Regulations, the Court is attentive

to the inclusion of the word may which is generally used to denote a permissive

provision and implies that some degree of discretion is vested in the aggrieved party. In

Rajender Mohan Rana & Ors Vs Prem Prakash Chaudhary & Ors1, it was held that,

Naturally, the word may mean discretion and is not mandatory. In the present

case, we do not see any reason why the word may in Section 55 should be read

as must or shall. Courts do not interpret the word may as shall unless

such interpretation is necessary and required to void absurdity, inconvenient

consequence or is mandated by the legislatures intent, which is collected from

other parts of the statute. [emphasis added]

The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner quoted Amarasinghe Vs. Azath Sally2

in which their Lordships of the Court of Appeal held that,

Provisions for some specific statutory remedy cannot be considered as a

limitation of other remedies, provided by law, especially in the absence of any

specific provisions excluding such remedies. [emphasis added]

Accordingly, it is apparent that the Regulations do not include any specific words which

exclude the other remedies and the legislature intends that the Regulations must not

affect the jurisdiction of any competent court. In terms of Section 13D of the Navy Act,

1 LPA No. 554/2011 2 (2004) 2 SLR 159

7

any person subject to the Naval law could be tried for any civil offence committed

before a court exercising civil jurisdiction. Further, Section 132 of the Navy Act

provides that a court exercising writ jurisdiction could issue writs in respect of decisions

of any naval Officer exercising judicial powers under the Navy Act. Under such

circumstances, it is clear that the Petitioner in the instant Application is not restricted to

seek other remedies prescribed by law including writs. However, the general principle

is that since the prerogative Writs are discretionary remedies, the petitioner is not

entitled to invoke the Writ jurisdiction when there is an alternative remedy available to

him. Therefore, Writ Applications are not maintainable under Article 140 where an

equal, efficient, and adequate alternative remedy is available3. Therefore, the next

question that arises is on what grounds an aggrieved party could invoke Writ

jurisdiction in such circumstances. In Pinnaduwage Baby Mallika Chandraseana Vs

C.W Abeysuriya, Acquiring Officer, Greater Colombo Flood Control Project, Kaduwela

Divisional Secretariat Division, Sri Lanka Land Development Corporation4, Justice

Mohammed Laffar emphasized that,

It is to be noted that, the alternative remedy is, always, not a bar to invoke the

Writ jurisdiction of this Court. If the Court is of the view that, the alternative

remedy is inadequate, where there has been a violation of the principle of

Natural Justice, where the impugned order is without jurisdiction and there are

errors on the face of the record, the Petitioner is permitted to invoke the Writ

jurisdiction before exhausting the alternative remedies provided in law.

[emphasis added]

Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere in the case of Wickremasinghage Francis Kulasooriya Vs.

Office ill Charge, Police Station Kirindiwela5, held,

"The question that arises for consideration in this application is what should a

Court exercising Writ jurisdiction do, when confronted with an argument that

an alternative remedy is available to the Petitioner and that such alternative

remedy should be resorted to? This Court is of the view that a rigid principle

cannot be laid down and that the appropriate decision would depend on the

facts and circumstances of each case. That said, where the statute provides a

specific alternative remedy, a person dissatisfied with a decision of a statutory

body should pursue that statutory remedy instead of invoking a discretionary

remedy of this Court. That remedy should be equally effective and should be

able to prevent an injustice that a Petitioner is seeking to avert. Furthermore,

if the Writ jurisdiction is invoked where an equally effective remedy is available,

an explanation should be offered as to why that equally effective remedy has

not been resorted to. [Emphasis Added]

In the instant case, the Petitioner argues that the exhaustion of the statutory remedy

provided in the Regulations cannot be considered an effective and adequate remedy

available to him on three grounds.

First, the Petitioner argues that preferring an appeal to His Excellency the President

cannot be considered as an effective alternative remedy available to him because it had

to be logged through the 2nd Respondent who allegedly harboured malice against the

Petitioner. However, it is observed by this Court that according to the Regulations, when

an officer is aggrieved by any action of the Commander of the Navy, he can directly

5 CA (Writ) Application No. 3381-2011

9

make a written appeal to His Excellency the President. There is no requirement in the

Regulations that such appeal must be submitted through the Commander of the Navy.

Therefore, I am of the view that the above-stated position of the Petitioner is devoid of

merit.

Secondly, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argues that in such an appeal

no hearing would be granted to the Petitioner and His Excellency the President would

act upon the observations called from the Commander of the Navy which this Court

could admit as a viable reason why the statutory remedy of preferring an appeal to His

Excellency the President would not be effective, appropriate and able to prevent the

alleged injustice caused to the Petitioner.

Thirdly, the learned Counsel argues that even to make an appeal to His Excellency the

President the Petitioner was unaware of the basis on which the 1st and 2nd Respondents

arrived at their impugned decisions until the Respondents filed their Statement of

Objections in this Application. There is no material before this Court for its satisfaction

that reasons were provided for the 1st and 2nd Respondents' decisions mentioned in P12

and P14. The Court could accept that since the 1st and 2nd Respondents failed to give

reasons for their decisions the Petitioner had prevented from seeking alternative remedy

provided in the Navy Act, namely preferring an appeal to the President.

In Whirlpool Corporation Vs. Registrar of Trademarks, Mumbai & Ors.6, wherein the

Apex Court of India held,

Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court, having regard to the

facts of the case, has a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition.

6 (1998) 8 SCC 1.

10

But the High Court has imposed upon itself certain restrictions, one of which is

that if an effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High Court would

not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has been

consistently held by this Court not to operate as a bar in at least three

contingencies, namely, where the writ petition has been filed for the

enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights or where there has been a

violation of the principle of natural justice or where the order or proceedings

are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged.

[Emphasis added]

In Harbanslal Sahnia v Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd7, wherein the Apex Court carved out the

exceptions mentioned in Whirlpool Corporation Vs. Registrar of Trademarks, Mumbai

& Ors. (supra) as thus:

In an appropriate case, in spite of availability of the alternative

remedy, the High Court may still exercise its writ jurisdiction in at least

three contingencies: (i) where the writ petition seeks enforcement of any

of the fundamental rights; (ii) where there is failure of principles of

natural justice; or (iii) where the orders or proceedings are wholly

without jurisdiction, or the vires of an Act is challenged. [emphasis

added]

It is trite law that the decision-makers have a duty to give reasons for the decisions they

make. Lord Denning MR in Breen Vs. AEU 8 held that,

7 (2003) 2 SCC 107 8 1971] 1 All E.R. 1148, 1154

11

"Indeed, to omit reasons is not only to take away the "good" in the

administration but also to instill bad administration in society. The giving of

reasons is a fundamental requirement of fairness and is necessary for the

satisfaction of parties. The concepts of fairness, justice and reason are

interchangeable and one cannot be achieved without the other. Reasons are the

link between the decision and the mind of the decision maker.

Whenever there is a duty owed by one person to another, there is a correspondent right

on that person to ensure that the duty is fulfilled. Accordingly, it is possible to enforce

the duty to provide reasons as a constitutional right as well. Progressive legal thought

has taken the stance that natural justice demands reasons for decisions even in the

absence of an explicit statutory provision or legislation requiring them. According

to Lord Donaldson MR in R Vs. Civil Service Appeal Board, exp. Cunningham9,

"There is a principle of natural justice that a public law authority should always

or even usually give reasons for its decision."

In addition, the current position seems to be that the courts are more likely to require

justification or reasons for decisions if there is a right of appeal or judicial review. In R

Vs. Crown Court at Harrow, exp. Dave10, the Crown Court gave a decision without

reason. There was an appeal. The decision was quashed for the absence of reasons; that

absence made it impossible to exercise the right of appeal. In the case of Mahabir

Prasad Vs. State of U.P.11, the Supreme Court of India similarly held that,

9 [1991] 4 All E.R. 310 10 [1994] 1 All E.R. 315 11 [1970]1 SCC 764

12

if a quasi-judicial order is subject to appeal the law necessarily implies the

requirement of reasons otherwise the right of appeal shall become an empty

formality,

Furthermore, the duty to provide justification shall apply in cases where it is reasonable

to assume that a misuse of authority has occurred. In Padfield Vs. Minister of

Agriculture, Fisheries and Food12, it was held, obiter, that the court could come to the

conclusion that there was no rational reason if no reason was provided, even though the

relevant Act did not specifically require one. In this case, the Minister's decision not to

refer a take-over bid was challenged for irrationality. The House of Lords held,

"The absence of reasons for a decision where there is no duty to give them

cannot of itself provide any support for the suggested irrationality of the

decision. The only significance of the absence of reasons is that if all the other

known facts and circumstances point overwhelmingly in favour of a different

conclusion, the decision-maker who has given no reasons cannot complain if

the court draws the inference that he had no rational reason for his

decision."[emphasis added]

In the instant Application, it manifests that the 1st and 2nd Respondents had failed to

provide any reason for denying the Petitioners request to report back to active service

before the Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this Court. However, in the statement

of objections filed by the Respondents have taken up the position that the decisions

embodied in P-12 and P-14 were based on the letters of warning produced marked

R3(a), R3(b) and R3 (c) issued on the Petitioner.

12 [1968] 1 All E.R. 694 HL

13

The letter of warning dated 04.07.2014 marked R3(a) has been issued to the

Petitioner by the Commandant of the Sri Lanka Navy Ship "Parakrama"

consequent to an incident that happened in the Lighthouse Restaurant on 04.08

.2013. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner submits that as per the

"Navy General 051349 January 2010" issued by the Sri Lanka Navy (C-1

annexed to the Counter Affidavit) the valid period of a letter of warning is 03

years and by the time of the impugned decisions embodied in P-14 and P-12

were taken the letter of warning produced marked R3(a) had already been

expired.

The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner drew the attention of the Court

that the letter of warning dated 27.09.2018 produced marked as R3(b) had been

issued by the 2nd Respondent while the Petitioner was serving in the Naval Rest

Mihinthale and prior to the issuance of the said letter of warning R3(b) no

inquiry or investigation was held against the Petitioner and no allegation or

charge was communicated to the Petitioner and argues that even though the

Respondents in their statement of objections claims that the said letter of

warning R3(b) was issued after holding an inquiry no proof of such inquiry

which led to the issuance of R3(b) was produced along with their statement of

objections.

In respect of the third Letter of Warning marked as R-3(c), the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner argues that since the Petitioner was placed on compulsory

unpaid leave, that letter of warning was never received by the Petitioner and the

Respondents have also failed to provide any proof of acknowledgement of

R3(c).

14

The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner further argues that if it is the position

of the Respondents, that the decisions embodied in P-12 and P-14 were made as a

punishment consequent to the letters of warning produced marked R3(a), R3(b) and

R3(c) since the Petitioner was not given any hearing before impose the said punishment

and he is unaware for how long this punishment will last and therefore the decisions of

the 1st and 2nd Respondents not to permit the Petitioner to report back to work is

disproportionate.

The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner further argues that the Petitioner had

a legitimate expectation that he would be permitted to report back to duty when he

makes such an application and that if there were disciplinary reasons disqualifying the

Petitioner serving in the Voluntary Naval Force, the Respondents should not have

approved his leave and instead the Petitioner should have been disciplinarily dealt with.

Under the above-stated circumstance, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner

argues that the impugned decisions taken by the 1st and 2nd Respondents denying the

Petitioners request to report back to active service is unfair, unreasonable,

disproportionate, in violation of the Petitioners legitimate expectations, tainted with

malice and in violation of the principles of Natural Justice.

As discussed above, considering all the facts and circumstances I hold that the decisions

contained in P12 and P14 taken by the 1st and 2nd Respondents without offering the

Petitioner an opportunity to be heard and without assigning reasons are unfair,

unreasonable, against the legitimate expectation of the Petitioner and natural justice.

Therefore, the Court decides to issue Writs of Certiorari quashing the decisions

containing in P12 and P14 as prayed for in prayer (c) and (d) to the Petition and a Writ

of Mandamus compelling the 1st and 4th Respondents to permit the Petitioner to report

15

for active service of the Navy as prayed for in prayer (e) of the Petition. In prayer (f)

the Petitioner has sought a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and 4th Respondents to

pay him the salary, allowances and other emoluments since he sought permission to

report for work in February 2020. Nevertheless, his request has been turned down.

Therefore, the Court cannot order to pay him the salary for a period which he has not

served, i.e. from 26.02.2019 to the date of reassuming duties. Nevertheless, that period

should be considered as a period in which he was in active service in deciding all other

benefits he should and should have been entitled to other than the salary. The period in

which the Petitioner was unable to report to the active service should not affect the

promotions of the Petitioner. The 2nd Respondent should personally pay Rs. 200,000/-

to the Petitioner as compensation and Rs. 25,000/- as costs of this Application.

Application allowed.
