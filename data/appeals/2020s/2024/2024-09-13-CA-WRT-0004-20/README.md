separate several lots from and out of the land which has been

Facts of the case

3) The Petitioner had instituted this action to issue a Writ of

Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to grant a deed of transfer

in favour of the Petitioner in respect of the property which is

described in the schedule to the petition.

4) The crux of this case is the father of the Petitioner had served as

the caretaker of a land known as Jakotuwawatta, which is in

extent of 22 acres located in Wellampitiya.

5) The aforesaid land originally belonged to a company named J.L.D

Peiris Company. In recognition of the Petitioners fathers service

as a caretaker, the said company had promised to grant 4 acres

from the aforesaid land to the Petitioners father.

6) Subsequently, the said portion was granted to the Petitioners

father who then independently possessed the said 4 acres of land.

7) Following his demise, the Petitioners mother K.A Lusihamy, along

with her children, including the Petitioner, continued to occupy the

said land.

8) On or around the year 1975 the entire main land was vested with

the 1st Respondent. Thereafter, the Petitioners mother had

preferred a claim to the 1st Respondent to divest the portion

occupied by her family.

9) In response, the Land Reform Commission had decided to grant 5

separate portions of the said land to K.A Lusihamy and her

children.

C.A. WRIT 04 - 2020

10) After complying with the Land Reform Commission procedures to

obtain the valuation in respect of the separate lots, the relevant

charges, including handling charges, legal fees, and the appraised

value, were deposited by K.A Lusihamy and her children.

11) Despite fulfilling these financial obligations, the Land Reform

Commission had failed to issue the deeds. Thus, K.A Lusihamy had

appealed to the Prime Minister and the relevant authorities.

However, the Land Reform Commission has yet to issue the deeds

since 1975.

12) K.A Lusihamys family had been paying the assessment tax for the

said property to the Kotikawatte Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha

and the Petitioner had been registered as a voter from this location.

13) The Petitioners mother, K.A Lusihamy passed away on 30th

December 2018 and the Petitioner and her siblings inherited her

portion of the land. Subsequently, the Petitioner became aware of

the Land Reform Commissions intention to conduct a further

survey to partition a portion of the lot allotted to K.A Lusihamy

without informing the Petitioner or her siblings.

14) Further, the 1st Respondent, the Land Reform Commission had

issued deeds to several other occupants of the larger estate without

considering the issuance of transfer deeds to the Petitioner. On

that, the Land Reform Commission has acted ultra vires and with

malafide.

15) On the aforesaid grounds the Petitioner had sought reliefs from

this court under Writ Jurisdiction.

Objections of the 1st Respondent

16) The 1st Respondent raised a preliminary objection on the grounds

that the Petitioner is not legally or factually entitled to maintain

the present action.

17) Further, the Petitioner has failed to bring the necessary parties

before this court.

18) Therefore, this application is bad in Law. And cannot be

maintained.

19) Further, the 1st Respondent had contended that the Petitioner is

not entitled in Law to invoke discretionary remedies and that the

Petitioner has failed ex facie to disclose any statutory entitlements

to obtain the land in dispute and/or statutory obligation on the

part of the 1st Respondent.

20) Furthermore, the 1st Respondent had stated that there is a

boundary dispute between the Petitioner and a neighbouring party.

21) Therefore, the 1st Respondent is unable to alienate the allotted land

to the Petitioner.

22) On the said grounds, the 1st Respondent had moved to dismiss the

application made by the Petitioner.

Disputed facts

23) Considering the arguments raised by the Counsels for both the

Petitioner and the Respondents, and on perusal of the documents

and the written submissions, I have to consider the following

disputed facts, to arrive at a conclusion.

I. Is the land described in the schedule to the petition dated 13th

January 2020 part of Jakotuwawatte which encompasses an

extent of 22 acres?

C.A. WRIT 04 - 2020

6

II. Did the owners of the said land promise to allot 4 acres of the land

to the Petitioners father?

III. If so, on the said grounds after the demise of the Petitioners

father, did the Petitioners mother and siblings reside on the said

land?

IV. After the demise of the Petitioners mother, had the 1st Respondent

agreed to allot that land to the Petitioner?

V. Is there any boundary dispute to the land referred to in the

schedule to the Petitioner?

VI. Has the Petitioner made respective procedural payments and

fulfilled the conditions to obtain the said allotted land?

VII. If so, can the Petitioner maintain this action to obtain reliefs under

Writ Jurisdiction?

I Is the land referred to in the schedule to the petition dated 13th

January 2020 part of Jakotuwawatte which is in extent of 22

acres?

24) Referring to P1, P1 (a) Plan No. 366 prepared by surveyor K.W. D.

Chandrani and which is reproduced by the 1st Respondent as 1R1

and 1R2 confirms the land referred to in the schedule to the

petition dated 13th January 2020 is a part of Jakotuwawatte.

25) The 1st Respondent had not challenged the said position.

Therefore, it must be accepted prima facie that the disputed land

described in the schedule to the petition is an allotted lot of the

Jakotuwawatte land.

C.A. WRIT 04 - 2020

7

II. Did the owners of the said land, promise to allot 4 acres of the

land to the Petitioners father?

26) As per the facts related in the petition from paragraph 5 to

paragraph 14, the Petitioners father was the caretaker of the 22

acre Jakotuwawatte land. As per the facts contained in the

petition, the position taken by the Petitioner is that the original

owners of the Jakotuwawatte which is known as J.L.D Peiris

Company had granted a portion of 4 acres of the aforesaid

Jakotuwawatte to the Petitioners father.

27) Although there are no documents to substantiate this position the

1st Respondent has not contested any of the facts related to the

title received by the Petitioners predecessor.

28) Therefore, as the Petitioner and her siblings had possessed the

said allotments which are referred to in P1 and P1 (a) for an

extended period, both before and after the said land was vested

with the 1st Respondent, it is abundantly clear that the allotments

occupied by the Petitioner and the family members had been

received from the Petitioners father.

III. If so, on the said grounds after the demise of the Petitioners

father did the Petitioners mother and siblings reside on the

said land?

29) There is no doubt, based on the facts outlined in the petition and

the grounds argued by both counsels had not challenged that after

the Petitioners fathers demise the Petitioners mother, the

Petitioner and siblings had not occupied the said land.

30) None of these facts had been addressed by the Respondents in

their objections. Therefore, it is evident that the disputed

C.A. WRIT 04 - 2020

8

allotments had been occupied by the Petitioners mother K.A

Lusihamy, the Petitioner and her siblings.

31) These facts are strengthened by the documents marked and

produced as P2 to P8.

IV. Before and after the demise of the Petitioners mother had the

1st Respondent agreed to allot that land to the Petitioner?

32) The 1st Respondent had agreed to allocate lot numbers referred to

in the P1 plan to the mother of the Petitioner, Petitioner, and the

siblings of the Petitioner. The said fact is supported by the report

which is attached to the P1 plan.

33) Further, the 1st Respondent had obtained a valuation report and

requested that the Petitioner deposit the asset value for an

allotment which is referred to in the schedule to the petition. The

said fact is confirmed by P2 (a) and P2 (b) documents issued by the

1st Respondent to the Petitioner.

34) It is abundantly clear P2 (a) and P2 (b) tax invoices has been

issued to the allotment 20 referred to in P1 (a), which corresponds

to the property described in the schedule to the petition.

35) However, despite taking all these steps the 1st Respondent had

failed to execute deeds in favour of the Petitioner. It is noteworthy

to refer paragraph 12 of the statement of objections filed by the

1stRespondent dated 4th July 2023. I reproduce the said paragraph

as follows;

C.A. WRIT 04 - 2020

9

36) The reason given in the aforesaid paragraph 12 of the 1st

Respondents objections that there is a land dispute between the

Petitioner and a neighbour of the Petitioner. However, the 1st

Respondent had failed to produce any single document to support

the said contention.

37) Therefore, I am of the view there is ample evidence to support that

the 1st Respondent is committed to execute deeds in favour of the

Petitioner in respect of the subject matter referred to in the

schedule to the petition.

V. Is there any boundary dispute to the land referred to in the

schedule to the Petitioner?

38) As I have reproduced paragraph 12 of the 1st Respondent objections

in the 4th disputed point, I have explained that the 1st Respondent

had failed to produce any document to substantiate the claim of a

boundary dispute in respect of the land claim by the Petitioner.

39) This fact was raised when the matter was argued between the

parties. Subsequently, with the agreement of the parties, a report

was requested from the same surveyor who prepared the P1 plan.

40) The said report is marked and produced as X. Hence, I reproduce

the said document in which the surveyor had emphasized that in

allotment No 20 there is no disputed boundary. The line shown

cutting across the said allotment is referred to as a ridge and it

does not divide the said allotment No 20 as two lots.

C.A. WRIT 04 - 2020

10

C.A. WRIT 04 - 2020

11

41) The said report of the surveyor K.W.D Chandrani had confirmed

there is no boundary dispute to the allotment No 20 land referred

to in the schedule to the petition.

42) On the said grounds, I accept the position taken by the Petitioner

that there is no land dispute related to the land allotted to the

Petitioner referred to in schedule to the petition.

VI. Has the Petitioner made respective procedural payments and

fulfilled the conditions to obtain the said allotted land?

43) I have already analyzed this fact under disputed point No IV.

However, again I will refer to the following documents which

demonstrate that the Petitioner had taken steps to fulfill the

obligations to obtain allotment No 20, which is referred to in P1

Plan and the schedule to the Petitioner.

44) On perusal of P2 (a) and P2 (b) tax invoices, it is evident that the

Petitioner has made the payments requested by the 1st Respondent

after the 1st Respondent obtained P1 Plan.

45) The said asset values are accepted and those tax invoices had been

issued by the 1st Respondent.

46) As the 1st Respondent had delayed to execute the deed allotted to

the Petitioner, the Petitioner had written several letters to the

chairman of the land reform commission and the relevant ministry

and the President of Sri Lanka.

47) Those facts are supported by P 3 to P5 (b) documents.

48) It should be noted that the Petitioner had made payment of

assessment tax as evident by documents P6 (a) to P6 (f), for the

said allotment referred to in the schedule to the petition.

49) The Kotikawatta-mulleriya Pradeshiya Saba had confirmed by P7

(a) letter that they had issued assessment numbers to the

C.A. WRIT 04 - 2020

12

Petitioner. And for the said assessment numbers Petitioner had

made tax payment as evident by P7 (b) to P7 (e) receipts.

50) Further, by P8 document it is submitted that the Petitioner is a

listed voter for the assessment number referred to in the property

related to the schedule to the petition.

51) Subsequently, the Land Reform Commission had issued letters,

marked as P9 (a), P9 (b) and P9(c) to resurvey the same allotments

again to confirm the boundaries.

52) Considering the aforesaid facts, it is evident that the 1st

Respondent had already surveyed the allotments and valued the

said allotments for the occupants to make the relevant payments.

53) Considering the said valuation, the Petitioner had made payments

to the 1st Respondent by P2 (a) and P2 (b) receipts and the 1st

Respondent had accepted it.

54) Therefore, I see no reason why the 1st Respondent should not

execute the deed for the allotments referred to in the schedule to

the petition, as claimed by the Petitioner.

55) On perusal of document P10 the Petitioner has taken steps to send

a letter of demand to the 1st Respondent to execute a deed for the

allotment referred to in the schedule to the petition for which the

1st Respondent had failed.

56) Thus, I am of the view that the Petitioner has a legitimate

expectation to obtain the deed to the said allotment from the 1st

Respondent.

VII. If so, can the Petitioner maintain this action to obtain reliefs

under Writ Jurisdiction?

57) Considering the arguments, documents, and the written

submissions, I am of the view that the Petitioner is entitled to

maintain this action to seek reliefs for Writ of Mandamus and Writ

C.A. WRIT 04 - 2020

13

of Prohibition prayed in the prayer of the petition. Hence, I reject

the preliminary objections raised by the 1st Respondent.

58) Having fulfilled all the obligations preferred by the 1st Respondent

to grant a deed for the property referred to the schedule to the

petition. The first 1stRespondent had failed the duty cast upon him

to execute a deed for the said subject matter.

59) The only excuse provided by the 1st Respondent is in paragraph 12

of the statement of objections that the 1st Respondent is unable to

execute a deed due to a land dispute between the Petitioner and a

neighbour, related to the subject matter.

60) Nonetheless, as I have mentioned before, I have decided there is no

land dispute related to the subject matter referred to in the

schedule to the petition. And there is no document to support a

land dispute to the property referred to the schedule to the

petition.

61) Thus, it is evident the 1st Respondent for no given reason delaying

the execution of the deed to the property referred to the schedule

to the petition.

62) In the case of Podimahathmaya v The Land Reform

Commission 1 Palakidar J articulated as follows;

This Court can interfere when there is a manifest

unreasonableness in an administrative act. The

test is whether the administrative authority has

acted within the rules of reason and justice.

In the case of Welikanna v Inspector General of police and

others 2 Amarathunga J observed that;

The absence of precedent does not deter me

when I am convinced that only effective remedy 1 [1990] 2 SLR 416 at 419 2 [2002] 2 SLR 287 at 300

C.A. WRIT 04 - 2020

14

the injustice caused to the petitioners is an Oder

of Mandamus.

63) Therefore, if a conduct of a given official is illegal/ unreasonable,

if the said official is not executing his duties, a party is entitled to

seek reliefs under Writ Jurisdiction.

64) It is proven by the Petitioner in the instant application that they

are entitled to the reliefs claimed by them.

65) Further, the Petitioner had sought the Writ of Prohibition to draw

new surveyor plans. As I have analyzed it is sufficient to the 1st

Respondent to demarcate the boundaries referred to the lot no

20.

66) Hence, a Writ of Prohibition can be issued against the 1st

Respondent.

67) As per Sunil F.A Coorey in his book of Principles of

Administrative Law in Sri Lanka3

the circumstances in which Certiorari and Prohibition

will be available have been summed by Lord Justice

Atkin an English Judge, in the following famous words

which on numerous occasions have been cited and

followed by our courts.;

Whenever anybody of persons having legal authority to

determine affecting the rights of subjects, and having

the duty to act judicially, act in excess of their legal

authority they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction

of the Kings Bench Division exercised in these Writs.

3 Coorey. F.A., 2001. Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka. 2nd ed.

C.A. WRIT 04 - 2020

15

68) In the book of Administrative Law4 by Wade and Forsyth it was

stated;

Although a prohibiting Order was originally used to

prevent tribunals from meddling with cases over which

they had no jurisdiction, it was equally effective, and

equally often used, to prohibit the execution of some

decision already taken but ultra vires. So long as the

tribunal or administrative authority still had some

power to exercise as a consequence of the wrongful

decision, the exercise of that power could be restrained

by a prohibiting Order.

69) Hence, Issuance of a Prohibition Order will restrain the 1st

Respondent wrongfully surveying the subject matter. Therefore,

the Petitioner is entitled to the reliefs under Writ Jurisdiction.

CONCLUSION

70) In considering the facts, arguments and written submissions, the

Petitioner has proved his case to obtain the reliefs of the prayer of

the petition dated 13.01.2020.

71) Thus, I grant reliefs b,c,d in the prayer of the petition dated

13.01.2024
