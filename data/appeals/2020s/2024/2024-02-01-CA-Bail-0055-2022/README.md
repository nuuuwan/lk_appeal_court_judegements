Ridma Kuruwita, SC for the Respondents.

Argued on: 12.01.2023

Decided on: 01.02.2023

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail for the suspect by

the name of Lakshan Gunasekera (hereinafter referred to as the suspect),

under the provisions of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of

Crime and Witnesses Act.

The suspect had been arrested on 14.2.2022 for the instant offence while

being on bail for a complaint of assault on 22.10.2021 for which facts had

been reported and the case of assault had been referred to the

Mediation Board.

The suspect has several cases pending and some previous convictions of

similar nature which the suspect has not denied.

The State Counsel appearing for the Respondents objected to the instant

application on the basis of the number of cases pending before the

suspect and the previous convictions.

At the time this matter was taken up for argument the Counsel appearing

for the petitioner was not in Court but a junior counsel appeared and was

unable to assist Court suitably. Hence in the interest of justice Court

directed the suspect to file written submissions.

The main contention of the suspect is that he has been in remand since

his arrest without his matter reaching a conclusion.

The purpose of the instant act is to safeguard the rights of victims and

witnesses, but the act also emphasizes the fact that matters under this

act should be speedily concluded. But in the instant act the investigations

are not yet over and the suspect is in remand for nearly a period of 11

months.

The law pertaining to bail under the instant act is that a suspect or an

accused produced or charged under this act can be granted bail only

upon exceptional circumstances by the Court of Appeal and the term

exceptional has not been defined in the statute. But in many of our

decided cases it has been held that exceptional circumstances differ form

case to case.

In the instant matter this Court observes that the suspect has been

granted bail for the complaint received on 22.10.2021 and soon

afterwards he is being produced for an offence under this act for which

bail can be granted only by the Court of Appeal.

Hence although the respondents have stated that the suspect had been

a kind of nuisance to the society in the area if that is so the investigating

authorities should conclude the investigations without delay, hence

considering the long delay in concluding the investigations this Court is

of the view that it is only but fair to enlarge the above mentioned suspect

on bail.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed and we direct the

learned Magistrate to enlarge suspect above named on suitable

conditions of bail.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
