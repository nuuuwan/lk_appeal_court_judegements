JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted along with 2nd Accused by the Attorney General for

committing the offence as mentioned below:

1. On or around November 17th, 2008, in Rajagiriya within this court's

jurisdiction, the accused, named above, either intended to cause the

death of Raja Ananda Edirisinghe, or participated in actions

supporting a shared intention to cause death, or conspired to cause

death. As a result of this conspiracy, the death of Raja Ananda

Edirisinghe occurred, constituting an offense punishable under

Section 296 read with Sections 113B and 102 of the Penal Code.

2. During the same transaction, on the same date and at the same

location, the accused mentioned above caused the death of Raja

Ananda Edirisinghe, thereby committing an offense punishable under

Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

In this case, the Hon. Attorney General had forwarded a direct indictment

against the Appellants and the 2nd Accused under Section 3 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act No. 42 of 2007.

As the Appellants and the 2nd Accused opted for a non-jury trial, the trial

commenced before the judge and the prosecution had led twenty witnesses

and marked production P1-33 (a) and closed the case. The Learned High

Court Judge having satisfied that evidence presented by the prosecution

CA/HCC/0340-341/18

4 | P a g e

warranted a case to answer, called for the defence and explained the rights

of the accused. Having selected the right to make a statement from the dock,

the Appellants and the 2nd Accused had proceeded to deny the charges.

After considering the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the

defence, the Learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellants as

charged and sentenced them to death on 17/10/2018.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent to argue this matter in their absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. At the hearing the Appellants were connected via

Zoom platform from prison.

As the Counsels appearing for the Appellants had advanced same grounds,

all grounds will be considered together hereinafter. Additionally, the Counsel

for the 1st Appellant had raised an issue pertaining to identity of the 1st

Appellant.

Grounds of Appeal

In the first ground of appeal, the Appellants contended that the Learned High

Court Judge erred in law by his failure to follow the settled law and relevant

legal principles relating to a case entirely based on circumstantial evidence.

Circumstantial evidence refers to indirect evidence that, while not directly

proving a fact in question, prompts a logical inference that the fact exists.

Utilizing circumstantial evidence entails drawing further reasonable

inferences to substantiate the assertion.

In general, courts allow the admission of circumstantial evidence.

Nevertheless, courts exercise caution when circumstantial evidence

constitutes the sole evidence in a case, should be assessed alongside other

forms of evidence.

CA/HCC/0340-341/18

5 | P a g e

Relying solely on a single instance of circumstantial evidence for a conviction

is viewed cautiously by the courts, as it may not provide conclusive proof of

guilt. However, when multiple independent pieces of circumstantial evidence

point towards the same conclusion, their combined strength strengthens the

case for conviction. In such instances, the court is more likely to consider

the evidence as a cohesive whole, contributing to a more robust assessment

of the defendant's culpability.

In order to convict an Accused person on the basis of circumstantial evidence

it is the duty of the trial judge to be satisfied that that the facts proved are

only consistent with the guilt of the Accused and the facts proved to exclude

every other possibility other than the guilt of the Accused.

In King v Abeywickrama [1943] 44 NLR 254 the Court held that:

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the Jury must

be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the

accused and inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of his

innocence.

In Gunawardena v the Republic [1981] 2 SLR 315 the Court held that

Each piece of circumstantial evidence is not a link in a chain for if one

link breaks the chain would fail. Circumstantial evidence is more like a

rope composed of several cords. One strand of rope may be insufficient

to sustain the weight but three stranded together may be quite

sufficient.

CA/HCC/0340-341/18

6 | P a g e

In Hanumant v State of M.P [1952] AIR SC 343; 1953 Cri LJ 129 the Court

laid down following guidelines to follow when a case is solely rests on

circumstantial evidence.

(i) The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn

should be fully established. The circumstances concerned must or

should and not may be established;

(ii) The facts so established should be consistent only with the

hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, that should not be

explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty;

(iii) The circumstances should be conclusive;

(iv) They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be

proved.

(v) There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any

reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of

the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must

have been done by the accused.

Now I consider whether the Learned High Court Judge had deviated from the

above guide lines in considering circumstantial evidence as contended by the

Appellants.

According to PW1, Podimenike Vidanapathirana, the deceased is her

husband and he was engaged several businesses after his retirement from

government service. The incident had taken place in their residence situated

in Rajagiriya. PW1 had stayed in the ground floor with her domestic maid

while the 2nd Appellant who was an employee (Manager) for a long time in

the deceaseds business had been provided accommodation in the upper

floor.

CA/HCC/0340-341/18

7 | P a g e

On the day of the incident in the morning, while making coffee in the kitchen

PW1 had seen the 2nd Appellant entering their house from the rear side of

the kitchen. After having coffee, when the 2nd Appellant left the kitchen PW1

heard shouting of the deceased, Ammo Ammo. When she came out of the

kitchen and told the 2nd Appellant to look into what was it, the 2nd Appellant

had told her to not to panic but remained silent. After realising that the

deceased was not in his room in the ground floor and when she tried to go

upstairs, the 2nd Appellant had purposefully prevented her going upstairs,

forced her to sit on the settee. As she felt suspicious about the conduct of

the 2nd Appellant, she went to upstairs and knocked the room door very hard.

Then, the door was slightly opened about 6 inches. She saw a man inside

the room, but could not recognize due to the darkness prevailed in the room.

As the door was locked inside, she could not open it. As the key was with the

2nd Appellant, she requested him to open the door but the 2nd Appellant

without panicking took about 5 minutes to open the door.

When she entered the room, she had seen the deceased lying on the floor

fallen with blood oozing from his head. She also noted blood flashes on the

wall. After opening of the door, the 2nd Appellant had left the place. PW1 had

come downstairs and wanted to give a call to her brother but she was

prevented by the 2nd Appellant saying that he would give him a call. As the

2nd Appellant left the place without calling her brother, PW1 had given a call

to her brother. According to PW1, the 2nd Appellant did not attend the funeral

of the deceased.

On a previous occasion a hand grenade was lobed into deceaseds room, but

was defused by the police. No complaint was lodged.

PW4, Manjula was a police constable, who was on a special duty closer to

the deceaseds house on the day of the incident as it was a Parliament

functioning day. He reported to duty at about 6.10am. While he was on duty,

he had seen a person who came in a Pajaro Jeep speaking to the deceased.

At that time the deceased had spoken to PW4 as well. At that time 2nd

CA/HCC/0340-341/18

8 | P a g e

Appellant called the deceased inside the house. In a short while, he had seen

a person clad in a sarong and a shirt come out of the gate and walking away.

After some time, the 2nd Appellant also came out from the house and went

towards Battaramulla.

While he was continuing his duty on the road, another police officer came

and asked PW4 where the murder had taken place. Until such time he was

not aware about the deceaseds murder. He identified the 1st Appellant as

the person who walked away from the deceased house on the date of

incident. Further, he had also identified the 2nd Appellant as well at the

identification parade.

PW5, Gunatilaka a three-wheeler driver confirmed that the 2nd Appellant had

hired his vehicle to go to Battaramulla on 17.11.2008 at about 6.30am. He

too identified the 2nd Appellant at the identification parade.

PW7 Mohamed Rizan, a three-wheeler driver from Trincomalle testified that

the 1st Appellant had hired his vehicle to go to Kantale. As the 1st Appellant

also informed that he might extend the hire to Dambulla, his brother-in-law

accompanied him as he did not possess a driving licence. At Kantale, the 1st

Appellant with 2nd Accused who was introduced him as Bandula had

extended the hire to Colombo. They had reached Colombo at about 2.30am

on 17.11.2008 and 1st Appellant had paid Rs.10,000/- to this witness as his

hire charge. As he was not familiar with Colombo roads, he returned to

Trincomalee on the same day itself. Before leaving he had seen the 1st

Appellant and the 2nd Accused going in another three-wheeler to Rajagiriya.

PW8, Sujeewa Kumara a friend of the 2nd Appellant on a previous occasion

purchased a hand grenade from a person in Trincomalee for the 2nd

Appellant. Subsequently he had come to know that although the hand

grenade was thrown at the deceased, it did not go off. As such the police had

defused the same. After the grenade was given to the 2nd Appellant,

CA/HCC/0340-341/18

9 | P a g e

Rs.50,000/- had been deposited to his wifes account. Upon instruction the

said money was handed over to 1st Appellant by this witness.

PW11, Prasanna a resident of Trincomalee confirmed that the mobile No.

0713530048 was used by the 1st Appellant.

PW12, Priyantha also a resident of Trincomalee confirmed that the 1st

Appellant had given him a cheque valued of Rs.400,000/- for encashment

through his bank account. He could not encash the cheque due to

insufficient funds. As such the cheque was referred to the drawer.

PW13 Malani the wife of PW12 confirmed that the 2nd Appellant had

deposited Rs.80,000/- on three occasions prior to the murder of the

deceased. She had withdrawn the said amount and given it to her husband

PW12.

PW14, a bank witness confirmed that the cheque in issue was issued from a

current account of the 2nd Appellant.

According to PW18 Attanayake, a resident of Wellawaya, in the month of

November 2008, the father of the village priest called him and handed over

the 2nd Appellant to him requesting him to give accommodation as the 2nd

Appellant had come there to commit suicide due to his family problem. He

had entrusted the 2nd Appellant to his brother who was engaged in chena

cultivation and cattle farming. Before he went with his brother, the 2nd

Appellant had given him Rs.30,000/- and mobile phone without a sim. After

few days officers from the CID had come there and questioned him about a

mobile phone of the 2nd Appellant. Upon receiving the information, the CID

officers had gone to the Wadiya (place of staying) and apprehended the 2nd

Appellant who ran after seen the CID officers.

Initially, investigation was commenced by the Welika Police Station with use

a police cannel who went up to a three-wheeler park. Upon inquiry, PW5 had

confirmed that the 2nd Appellant had hired in his three-wheeler to go to

CA/HCC/0340-341/18

10 | P a g e

Battaramulla on the date of incident at about 6.30am. PS 10609 Hemapala

of Welikada Police confirmed this.

PS 28844 Rajapaksha is the Crime Scene Investigation Officer attached to

Nugegoda Division had visited the crime scene on 17.11.2008 and prepared

a sketch which had been marked as P26. He had seen pool of blood and

blood splash on the wall. A ligature was seen over the neck of the deceased.

An iron pipe, a fertilizer bag, few pieces of leather, a plastic chair, and water

jar, and a knife were also found in the crime scene. He had noticed a stair

case leading to upstairs from the outside of the house. A foot print was seen

close to the rear wall of the house.

Finger Print Report and the Identification Reports were admitted by the

defence. Hence the prosecution had proved the presence of finger prints of

Appellants and the identification of the Appellants by PW4, PW5 and PW7

without any dispute.

PW47, Dr.Amarasinghe had conducted the Post-mortem on the deceaseds

body. According to him he had observed 12 cut injuries on the dead body.

According to him the cause of death is due to ligature strangulation, blunt

weapon trauma to the head and stab injury to the abdomen.

In this case, the 3rd Appellant had made a confession under Section 127(3)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. The confession was

recorded by the Additional Magistrate Colombo which had been marked as

P28. After recording evidence of PW45, the Learned Magistrate who recorded

the confession, marked it as P28 as the defence did not challenge the same.

Hence, no voire dire inquiry was held. The contents of the confession of the

3rd Appellant accrued to the proceedings remained unchallenged.

The judgment is a pivotal document for all parties involved, particularly for

the Judge, who places utmost importance on the rationale behind the

judgment. Clear and concise thinking is fundamental to producing a well-

written judgment. An eloquently expressed judgment not only showcases the

CA/HCC/0340-341/18

11 | P a g e

Judge's interest in the matter but also illustrates the meticulous legal

reasoning underlying the decision.

The reasons articulated by a Judge in a judgment offer insights into their

cognitive process, approach, understanding of the factual and legal issues at

hand, and the depth of their legal knowledge. Essentially, the judgment

serves as a reflection of the Judge's persona. Therefore, it is imperative that

it is crafted with precision, after thorough consideration and contemplation.

The Learned High Court Judge in formulating his judgment he had

considered all-important aspects in writing of the judgment. He has been

mindful of the presumption of innocence burden of proof, evaluation of

circumstantial evidence with special consideration to human testimony and

the tests that should be applied in a judgment.

The Learned High Court Judge had correctly held that this case totally rests

on circumstantial evidence. Hence, he had meticulously considered the

evidence of all prosecution witnesses to arrive at his decision. This is clearly

reflected in pages 1153 to 1191 of the brief. Thereafter, the defence evidence

relating to the Appellants in the form of their Dock Statements had also been

duly considered and evaluated in the judgment. After applying the required

test to assess circumstantial evidence, it is determined that the only

reasonable inference drawn from the established circumstantial evidence

implicates the guilt of the Appellants regarding the charges levelled against

them. Conversely, the 2nd Accused is rightfully acquitted due to the lack of

evidence against them.

In this case, the Learned High Court Judge was mindful and very much alive

to the evaluation of circumstantial, even though he had not included any

reported authority pertaining to evaluation of circumstantial evidence.

Therefore, the 1st ground advanced by the Appellants is devoid of any merit.

CA/HCC/0340-341/18

12 | P a g e

In the 2nd ground, the Appellants contend that the Learned High Court Judge

convicted the Appellants only on suspicious circumstances.

It is well settled judicial pronouncement that suspicion circumstances,

however strong cannot prove a case.

In this case, the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had considered

all evidence presented by both parties before he reached his final decision.

This is clearly reflected at pages 1153-1191 and 1214-1222 of the brief.

Further, the Learned High Court Judge had only considered evidence which

was clear and cogent in his judgment. No ambiguous or conflicting evidence

considered to form his decision. All evidence presented is considered at

length and given reasons as to why he relied on to come to his decision. As

the circumstances considered is devoid of suspicion and ambiguity, the

finding that the Appellants are guilty of the charges is quite tenable in this

case. Hence, I conclude that this ground of appeal is without any merit.

In the 3rd ground of appeal, the Appellants argue that the Learned High Court

Judge had taken an erroneous approach in interpreting conspiracy and

common intention.

As submitted by the Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General, though certain

authorities with regard to conspiracy and common intention are referred to

in their respective written submissions, the Appellants had failed to highlight

how the Court had faulted in appreciating these concepts as complained by

them.

In his judgment, at pages 1193-1194 and 1127-1128 of the brief, the Learned

High Court Judge had discussed the legal principle relating to conspiracy

and common intention although it is not necessary to explain in detail. The

judgment does not contain any indication or evidence supporting the

assertion that the Learned High Court Judge had been misled in this matter.

Therefore, this ground also devoid any merit.

CA/HCC/0340-341/18

13 | P a g e

In the final common ground of appeal, the Appellants contended that the

Learned High Court Judge had not evaluated the defence evidence from the

correct perspective and rejected the same in in the wrong premise.

In this case the Appellants and the 2nd Accused had made dock statements

to conclude their case. The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at

page 1214 of the brief clearly expressed the admissibility of a dock statement

of an accused in a criminal trial and followed several tests to evaluate the

dock statements of each of the Appellants and the 2nd Accused.

The Learned High Court Judge had considered and evaluated the Dock

Statement of the Appellants separately before he could come to the final

decision.

Although the 1st Appellant in his Dock Statement took up the position that

he had previously visited the deceaseds house, this vital position was not

put to PW1 when she was cross examined. Next, the 1st Appellant took up

the position that the cheque for Rs. 400,000/- was given to him by 2nd

Accused to lease out a shop space in Trincomalee. As this also a vital piece

of evidence but the 1st Appellant had failed to put this position to the relevant

prosecution witnesses to iron out the issue raised by him.

The 2nd Appellant in his Dock Statement did not deny his presence at the

crime scene. Although matters incriminatory against the 2nd Appellant was

revealed in his own confession made to the Magistrate, lack of explanation

of those matters led to the rejection of his Dock Statement by the Learned

High Court Judge.

As the evidence adduced by the prosecution overweighted the defence case,

rejection of the defence by the Learned High Court Judge quite justifiable

and does not cause any prejudice either legally or circumstantially. Hence,

this Court has no option but to accept the prosecutions version. Therefore,

this ground also has no merit.

CA/HCC/0340-341/18

14 | P a g e

Addition to above discussed appeal grounds jointly raised by the Appellant,

the 1st Appellant contended that his identity was not established beyond

reasonable doubt.

In this case, the defence had admitted the identification notes which had

been marked as P32 under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act No. 15 no 1979. The acceptance of the identification parade notes does

not create any doubt in the prosecution case.

PW4 asserted that he observed the 1st Appellant departing from the

deceased's residence between 6:30 and 6:45 a.m. on the day of the incident.

W7 had brought the 1st Appellant to Colombo in the early hours of the date

of incident. According to the Identification Notes the witnesses had no

difficulty in identifying the 1st and 2nd Appellants at the identification parade.

At the trial, the relevant witnesses had identified the Appellants in open

court.

As this is not a case of fleeting glance identification, principles enunciated in

Turnbull case is not necessary. The Learned High Court Judge had

accurately discussed the circumstances upon which the witnesses had

identified the Appellants. Therefore, this ground is not forceful enough to

create a doubt about the identity of the Appellants. Hence, no substantial

miscarriage of justice had occurred to the 1st and 2nd Appellants. When the

identification evidence presented against the Appellants is considered,

positive evidence had been led to establish the identity of the Appellants.

Therefore, I conclude that the prosecution had succeeded in adducing highly

incriminating evidence against the Appellants and thereby established the

charges beyond reasonable doubt.

CA/HCC/0340-341/18

15 | P a g e

As such, I conclude, that this is not an appropriate case in which to interfere

with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated

17.10.2018. Hence, I dismiss the Appeal.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
