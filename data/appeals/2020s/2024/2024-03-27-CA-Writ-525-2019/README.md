Chandima Induwara for the 1st - 5th Respondents.

Written submissions tendered on:

01.07.2022 and 12.12.2022 by the Petitioner.

Argued on: 18.10.2022 and 02.11.2022.

Decided on: 27.03.2024.

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The 1st Petitioner to this Writ Application is a duly incorporated Company registered

under the Companies Act, No. 17 of 1982 and the 2nd Petitioner is the Managing

Director of the 1st Petitioner Company. A tender was called by the Peoples Bank (the

1st Respondent Bank) on 09.03.2019 (marked as P12), inviting suppliers who are

capable of printing and supplying appropriate quality materials for 250,000 units of

Cash Deposit Slips, within the stipulated time period mentioned in the tender notice.

The Petitioner Company submitted its bid for the said tender by letter dated 26.03.2019

4

for a sum of Rs. 18,487,500.00/-. The 2nd and the 3rd Respondents of the 1st Respondent

Bank informed the Petitioner Company that its tender bid had been rejected. On

19.07.2019 by the letter marked as P15, the Petitioner Company submitted a written

request inquiring the grounds upon which its tender was rejected. The 1st Respondent

Bank by P16 replied emphasizing Clause 17 of the Tender Notice marked as P12 which

states as follows;

The Bank reserves to itself the right without question to reject any or all

tenders and the right to accept any portion of a tender without assigning

reasons and the Bank will not entertain correspondence from suppliers for

acceptance or non-acceptance of offers and the Bank is not bound to accept the

lowest bid.

The Petitioner argues that the 1st Respondent Bank having the right to reject any bid

without question, and to do so, without assigning reasons thereto as per Clause 17

is completely obnoxious to any sense of reasonableness and justice, especially in the

context of public procurement and, no public body should be permitted to rely on such

a patently illegal and unreasonable clause.

By the letter dated 21.08.2019 (marked as P18), the 4th Respondent of the 1st

Respondent Bank informed the Attorney at Law of the Petitioner that the acceptance or

rejection of the tender depends solely on the discretion of the Bank. The Petitioner

alleges that the 1st Respondent Bank is seeking refuge under Clause 17 of the tender

5

document which contradicts the principles of vires, equity, fairness, rationality, and

natural justice under the Public Procurement Guidelines of 2006. The learned

Presidents Counsel appearing for the Petitioners argue that every bidder whose bid is

rejected, ought to be made aware of the reason for rejection for the following reasons;

a. Natural justice demands that a decision-maker should give reasons for his

decisions.

b. Natural justice demands that the bidder be given an opportunity to clarify any

issue with the bid.

c. Natural justice demands that the bidder be given an opportunity to clarify any

issue, particularly pertaining to any past performances of its tenders and/or

contracts.

d. Natural justice demands that the bidder be made known of the reasons for the

rejection of its bid, as the bidder would be able to rectify such issues in future

tenders.

Further, the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the Petitioners argues that Clause

17 of the Tender Notice violates the Procedure Manual for Procurement, Supplies,

Stores and Inventory of Peoples Bank (R9) pertaining to the tenders which set out the

guiding principles that ought to guide procurements.

In the performance of a previous tender in 2017 submitted by the Petitioner Company

to the 1st Respondent Bank regarding a similar supply of stationaries, the 1st Respondent

6

Bank by the letter dated 07.07.2017 (marked as P25) informed the Petitioners that

certain slips were incomplete as the carbonized duplicates were missing. In response

thereto, by letter dated 11.07.2017 (marked as P26), the Petitioners clarified the

impossibility of such misplacement and in any event, requested the 1st Respondent Bank

to return the boxes of the slips which had the issue, so that the Petitioner could rectify

the same. However, the 1st Respondent Bank has not responded to the said letter and

therefore, the Petitioners assumed that the said issue had been resolved. The position of

the learned Presidents Counsel is that the said issue has been conjured up by the

Respondents in evaluating the Petitioners bid relating to the tender Notice marked as

P12 in 2019 which is the subject matter of this Application. The learned Presidents

Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argues that if the alleged issue pertaining to the

incomplete deposit slips in 2017 was so grave and was the reason that led the

Respondent in rejecting the Petitioner's bid, the 1st Respondent should have already

blacklisted the Petitioner as per Clause 9.16 of the Manual of the 1st Respondent Bank

marked as R9, but the 1st Respondent had not done so. At the hearing of this Writ

Application, the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the Petitioners informed this

Court that the Petitioners are confining their reliefs only to prayer (i) in the Petition

which is as follows,

(i) Issue a writ of Mandamus, directing the 1st Respondent and the 2nd Respondent

and his successors in office, when calling for, evaluating and awarding any

tenders in the future for the supply of deposit slip cash -213DP and any other

7

printed documents and/or printed material and/or printed forms to duly call for,

evaluate and award such tenders, strictly in due accordance with

government/public procurement process including inter-alia, the Government

Procurement Guidelines of 2006 and all such other formal guidelines and/or

other rules and principles of law governing public procurements, as well as any

other rules stipulated by the National Procurement Commission, as well as in

terms of the rule of law, and a transparent and objective manner and based on

intelligible criteria;

The Respondents submitted that the Tender No. P/20021/2019 contested by the

Petitioners in the instant writ Application, was called adopting the National

Competitive Bidding method as the approximate value of the purchase order exceeded

Rs. 20 Million and the Tender Notices were published on the website of the 1st

Respondent Bank and national newspapers (marked as R4 and R5, and Article 2.4 of

the Procurement Manual). As the purchase order exceeded Rs. 20 Million, the members

of the Technical Evaluation Committee were appointed to evaluate bids and make

recommendations to the Procurement Committee (vide marked as R6(c), Article 6 of

the Procurement Manual). Bids were received for consideration from 10 suppliers

which included the 1st Petitioner as well (marked as R6(d)).

In 2017, the Petitioner was awarded Tender No. P/1510/2017 for the purchase of 30,000

units of cash deposit slips as the lowest complying bid (marked as R1(a), R1(b), R1(c)

8

and R1(d)), which the Respondent later encountered missing carbonized duplicate

copies and the Petitioners were directed to replace the defective pads with immediate

effect by the letter marked P25. However, the Petitioners failed and neglected to take

any action. In the evaluation of the bids received, it is the responsibility of the Technical

Evaluation Committee to adhere to Article 5, Chapter 1 of the Procurement Manual

(marked as R9) which states,

"To provide a continuous and uninterrupted flow of banking activities by

obtaining and ensuring the delivery of acceptable quality goods and services, at

the right price, at the right time, in the right quality in correct quantity from the

right source.

Further, Article 5.2 and Article 5.5 in the same document respectively state that the

Technical Evaluation Committee has the responsibility to ensure the Bank gets the

best Value for Money spent on all purchases and all complaints regarding goods

purchased to be resolved in the best interest of the Bank. The learned Counsel

appearing for the Respondents argues that the Technical Evaluation Committee is

mandated to consider the past performance of a supplier and complaints received in

relation to the delivery of inferior quality goods as material considerations which is

relevant to the evaluation of bids received. Therefore, the learned Counsel appearing

for the Respondents submitted that the Technical Evaluation Committee has no

obligation to accept the lowest bid without considering such material factors as per

9

Article 9.13, Chapter 1 of the Procurement Manual (marked as R9) and the rejection of

the bid by the Petitioner is completely justified. Further, the learned Counsel appearing

for the Respondents submitted that the Technical Evaluation Committee acted in

accordance with the mandate of the Procurement Manual in arriving at the

recommendation to award the tender to the second lowest bid.

The contention of the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the Petitioners is that

the discretion of the 1st Respondent Bank to reject any or all tenders without giving

reasons as per Clause 17 of the Tender document (marked as P12) is in contradiction

with the objectives of the Government Procurement Procedure 2006. The learned

Presidents Counsel argued that the Respondents have an obligation to conduct the

tender procedure as stipulated in the Government Procurement Guidelines of 2006.

The Petitioners agreed to confine the reliefs sought in the Petition only to prayer (i). By

that prayer, the Petitioners seek a Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to

strictly follow the government/public procurement process including inter-alia, the

Government Procurement Guidelines of 2006 and all such other formal guidelines

and/or other rules and principles of law governing public procurements, as well as any

other rules stipulated by the National Procurement Commission, as well as in terms of

the rule of law, and a transparent and objective manner and based on intelligible criteria

in the future tender procedures.

The said Government Procurement Guidelines of 2006 are intended to guide the tender

procedures in the State Institutions. In the case of Daewoo Engineering and

Construction Co. Ltd Vs Amarasekera1 where the Guidelines on Government Tender

Procedure of 1997 was applicable, Sripavan, J. observed that,

The preface to the "Guidelines on Government Tender Procedure" states that

Government institutions are expected to follow the tender procedure to obtain goods

and services in order to achieve the following objectives: -

1. To keep the process fully transparent and honest.

2. To speed up the process.

3. To obtain financially the most advantageous and qualitatively the best

services and supplies for the country.

Sripavan, J. further held in the case of Daewoo Engineering and Construction Co. Ltd

(supra) that the guidelines should be followed by all Government Institutions inclusive

of Ministries, Departments, Public Corporations and Statutory Bodies, Fully Owned

Government Companies, Provincial Councils and Local Authorities for the

procurement of works, services and supplies and disposal of Government Assets.

In the case of SmithKline Beecham Biologicals S.A. and another Vs. State

Pharmaceutical Corporation of Sri Lanka and others2 Dr. Amerasinghe, J. held that,

the Guidelines make it clear that a Tender Board may only consider bids which

are responsive and qualified by substantially conforming with the tender

documents. The State and its agencies are bound by and must rigorously and

scrupulously observe the procedures laid down by them on pain of invalidation of

an act in violation of them.

In Pamkayu (M) SND BHD (Appearing by Its Attorney, Hemachandra) Vs. P.

Liyanaarachchi, Secretary, Ministry of Transport and Highways3, Amerasinghe, J. held

that,

The President of the Republic and Minister of Finance & Planning states in the

Preface to the Guidelines on Government Tender Procedure that they were

designed, inter alia, 'To keep the process fully transparent and honest.

The State and its agencies are bound by and must rigorously and scrupulously

observe the procedures laid down by the Executive on pain of invalidation of an

act or omission in violation of them. An executive agency must be rigorously held

to the standards by which it professes its conduct is to be judged: Accordingly, if

an action is based on a defined procedure, that procedure must be scrupulously

observed.

3 (2001) 1 Sri L.R. 118.

K. Sripavan, C.J., in Noble Resources International Pte Limited Vs. Hon. Ranjith

Siyambalapitiya and others4 held that,

it is essential to the maintenance of the rule of law that every organ of the State

must act within the limits of its power When specific provisions are laid down in

the Government Procurement Guidelines- 2006 and in the Bid Documents, the rule

of law will imply that the requirements of those provisions are not violated.

When considering the above-stated decisions it is clear that the Court endorses the

importance of following the Government Procurement Guidelines when awarding

tenders in the State institutions to keep the process fully transparent and honest and to

protect equity, fairness, rationality, and natural justice in tender processes. Under such

circumstances, no prejudice would be caused to the Respondents if the Court grants the

relief prayed by the Petitioners in prayer (i).

Therefore, considering the above-stated facts and circumstances, this Court issues a

Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to strictly follow the government/public

procurement process including inter-alia, the Government Procurement Guidelines of

2006 and all such other formal guidelines and/or other rules and principles of law

governing public procurements, as well as any other rules stipulated by the National

Procurement Commission, as well as in terms of the rule of law, and a transparent and

awarding any tenders in the future. No costs ordered.
