Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the 3rd accused-appellant, namely Kandana

Arachchige Nalin Sampath Pushpakumara (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant), who was the 3rd accused in the High Court of Gampaha Case Number

HC/75/2005.

The appellant, along with two other accused were indicted before the High Court

of Gampaha for causing the death of one Nimal Indrasiri Rohana Mayadunna on

11-07-2000, and thereby committing the offence of murder, punishable in terms

of section 296 of the Penal Code.

The said three accused were also indicted for causing the death of one

Jayasundera Mudiyanselage Shelton at the same time and at the same

transaction, and thereby committing the offence of murder, punishable in terms

of section 296 of the Penal Code.

After the indictment was filed before the High Court, it has been reported that

the 2nd accused indicted has passed away. Accordingly, the indictment had been

amended to reflect that fact on the two charges against the remaining accused.

The two charges have also been amended to include section 32 of the Penal Code

to be read along with section 296.

The trial has proceeded without a jury against the two remaining accused

including the appellant. After the conclusion of the prosecution case, it has been

reported to the Court that the 1st accused indicted has also been deceased.

Accordingly, the case has proceeded to a conclusion only against the appellant,

who was the third accused indicted.

The learned High Court Judge of Gampaha of his judgement dated 15-12-2022

had found the appellant guilty to the 1st count preferred against him. The

appellant had been acquitted on the 2nd count due to lack of evidence.

Accordingly, the appellant had been sentenced to death.

Page 4 of 21

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant has

preferred this appeal.

Facts in Brief

PW-01 was the wife of the deceased Nimal Indrasiri Rohana Mayadunna, the

deceased person mentioned in the 1st count preferred against the appellant.

Although this was an incident which was said to have occurred on 11-07-2000,

PW-01 has given evidence at the trial almost 19 years after the incident. At the

time she was giving evidence, she was a person of ailing health, and the trial

Court was unable to conclude her evidence on the day she gave evidence initially,

and for that reason, her evidence has been concluded sometime thereafter.

On the day of the incident, her husband has gone to his brothers house which

was nearby, to help him with some building construction work. The other person

who died in this incident, namely Shelton, was a friend of her husband. The said

Shelton has also helped in the construction work. After finishing the work for

the day, both her husband and Shelton have returned home and had their

dinner. After dinner, both of them had left the house between 9.00 and 10.00

p.m. to buy cigarettes from a shop situated near his brothers house.

While seated on a bench in front of their house expecting her husband to return,

she has heard the voice of her husband screaming from the direction

of the paddy field adjoining their house. After recognizing her husbands voice,

the witness has run towards the direction of the cry. She has stated that there

was bright moonlight on that day.

She has found her husband fallen near the well located on the paddy field, which

belongs to a person called Jinadasa, who was a neighbour. When she reached

her husband, she has seen him in pain, but he has stated to her that Heman

cut him, and that Raja and Nalin were also present.

She has identified the person whom her husband referred to as Heman, who was

a relative, as the 1st accused, while the person mentioned as Raja as the then

Page 5 of 21

deceased 2nd accused. She has identified the person mentioned as Nalin as the

3rd accused who was the brother-in-law of the 1st accused.

Subsequently, hearing her cries, the neighbours have come. The brother of the

deceased had also come and had taken steps to admit the deceased to the

hospital. She has stated that she did not see where the other deceased, namely

Shelton, was at that time, but later, he was found in the paddy field further down

the place where her husband was found fallen.

It has been her evidence that when she was running towards her husband, she

saw the three accused persons running away from the place where her husband

was found fallen. She has stated that she was able to recognize them because of

the bright moonlight available.

When she was subjected to cross-examination, she has stated that she cannot

remember whether she told at the non-summary inquiry, that her husband went

out to buy cigarettes at 10.30 p.m., but has stated she heard the screaming of

her husband after about 45 minutes of his leaving the house. She has stated

further that she was waiting outside of her house as the husband was getting

late.

At the non-summary inquiry, the witness has stated that she saw the other

deceased person fallen near where her husband was, when she reached the

place.

Since the witness has maintained the position that she only saw Shelton

subsequently, the said portion of the evidence has been marked as the

contradiction marked 1V1, and a similar contradiction in that regard has also

been marked as 1V2.

PW-01 has testified that when she reached the place where her husband was

found, her neighbour Jinadasa was not there, and he and his family members

came only after hearing her cries. She has told the son of Jinadasa to inform the

Page 6 of 21

incident to her husbands brother. She has denied the claim that it was Shammi

Kumara, the son of Jinadasa, who informed her about her husband.

The brother of the deceased, namely Sunil Shantha Mayadunna (PW-02), also

has given evidence in this case. He has confirmed that on 11-07-2000, his

brother and the other deceased, namely Shelton, came to his house to assist in

his construction work. It was his evidence that after finishing the work, both of

them left, and later, he met his brother and Shelton around 9.00 p.m. near the

boutique situated close to his house. The deceased has informed him that he

came to buy cigarettes, and has left with Shelton.

The witness has stated that his brother lived about 150 meters away from his

house. The witness had been watching TV when Jinadasas son Shammi, who

was a neighbor of his brother, came and informed him that his brother had been

attacked. After informing his other brother to bring a van to take him to the

hospital, he and his mother, who was living with him, has run towards the place

where his brother had been fallen.

When he reached the place, he has not seen the injuries suffered by his brother

initially and he was conscious. When inquired as to what happened from his

brother, he has informed that Heman, Raja and Nalin attacked and cut them.

When he asked from his brother where Shelton is, he has been told that he is

fallen in the paddy field. When he reached the place where Shelton was fallen,

he has observed cut injuries all over his body and had realized that he was

already dead.

Thereafter, he has taken steps to take his brother, as well as the body of Shelton,

to the hospital. He has identified Heman as the 1st accused, who was also a

relative. He has mentioned the person named Raja as deceased and has

identified the person mentioned as Nalin by his brother as the appellant. He has

stated further that when he was taking his brother to the hospital in the van, he

stopped near his house to wear a shirt and at that point, his brother told him to

hurry up as his body is getting cold.

Page 7 of 21

After admitting the brother to the hospital, he has gone to the Kadawata police

around 1.00 a.m. on the 12th and has lodged a complaint. Later, he has come to

know that his brother has succumbed to his injuries.

Under cross-examination, he has re-confirmed that the distance from his house

to the place where the deceased was found fallen was about 150 meters. He has

also stated that the distance from his brothers house to the place whether his

brother was found fallen was about 10-12 meters and the earlier mentioned

Jinadasas house was the closest house to the place where his brother was

found.

It has been suggested to the witness that he was lying about what his brother

told him. The witness has denied the suggestion and has stated that there were

about 20-25 persons at that time, and all of them heard what his brother said.

He has stated that it took about 15 minutes for them to take the deceased

Shelton and his brother to the van to be transported to the hospital, and has

stated his brother spoke until then, although he was in pain due to the injuries

suffered by him. When questioned about what he has stated at the inquest held

two days after to the effect that his brother did not speak while he was being

taken to the hospital, he has clarified that his brother was conscious until the

vehicle stopped near his house and did not say anything after that.

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted the post-mortem on both the

deceased persons has given evidence in this action. He has marked the Post-

Mortem Report in relation to Shelton Jayasundera, who was the deceased

mentioned in the 2nd count preferred against the appellant as P-01. The JMO

has observed 19 cut injuries on his body. He has described the cut injuries and

has opined that the injuries are necessarily fatal injuries.

The JMO has marked the Post-Mortem Report regarding Indrasiri Rohana

Mayadunna, the deceased person in relation to the 1st count preferred against

the appellant as P-02. He has observed two cut injuries and a linear abrasion on

his body. The first cut injury was 15 inches long, caused to the heart cavity and

Page 8 of 21

the lung cavity on the right side of the heart, and the stomach, which has caused

cut injuries to the liver, several ribs, and other internal organs. The second cut

injury was to the right hand, where the JMO has opined as a defensive injury.

He has described the first injury as a necessarily fatal injury, and has opined

that when a person receives injuries of this nature, death occurs due to the shock

and such a person will be able to talk until that shock occurs. He has opined

that a person with injuries of this nature can be conscious and will be able to

talk for about half an hour to one hour depending on the physical strength of

the said person.

When it was suggested to him under cross-examination that a person with this

type of injuries will suffer shock earlier than half an hour, the JMO has opined

that the deceased person was a healthy 32-year-old and it takes more than half

an hour for such a person to come to a state of shock. The JMO has well

explained what he meant by the cut he observed in the diaphragm of the

deceased, stating that it was only a superficial cut which has not prevented the

deceaseds ability to talk. He has explained that only if the diaphragm was fully

cut, a person cannot breathe, and as a result will not be able to speak.

The police officers who conducted the investigation relating to the incident has

given their evidence.

PW-06 who was the other brother of the deceased, who came later to the scene

and transported the deceased to the hospital, has been treated as an adverse

witness to the prosecution due to the fact of him stating that he did not hear

what his brother said, contrary to what he has stated to the police in his

statement.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case, when the appellant as well as the 1st

accused indicted was called upon for their defence, both of them had made dock

statements.

The appellant has claimed in his dock statement that on the date of the incident

and around the time of the alleged attack to the deceased, he was having liquor

Page 9 of 21

at a shop belonging to one Sisira and went home around 11.00 p.m. When he

reached home, he met his mother in his house and the mother informed him

that the deceased persons have been attacked, and Heman is also not at home

and to go and bring him. Since he could not do that, he left the area in his three-

wheeler and went to his wifes house. Since there was insufficient space in the

house, he went to a neighbours house and slept.

According to him, he has come to know that he is a suspect in the case where

the deceased were killed, and later surrendered to the police. He has claimed

that the evidence given by the PW-01 stating that she saw him running away

was a lie, and has claimed that he was unaware of this incident and had no

connection whatsoever.

On behalf of the appellant, the person called Sisira mentioned by him in his dock

statement has been called to give evidence. He has claimed that on the day of

the incident, the 3rd appellant came to his shop around 8.30 in the night and

inquired whether he is attending the funeral at the village, for which he stated

he would do so after closing his shop. He has claimed that thereafter, the

appellant went and brought some liquor and consumed it in his shop. He has

stated that around 10.00 - 10.30 in the night, the appellants mother came to

the shop and wanted him to come with her, at which point the appellant left his

shop. Under cross-examination, he has claimed that he did not know about the

incident where two persons have died in his village.

It appears from what the appellant had stated in his dock statement and the

evidence of the witness called on his behalf that the appellant has attempted to

claim an alibi.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant urged the

following two grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

Page 10 of 21

1. The learned High Court Judge has convicted the accused-appellant on

insufficient and doubtful evidence of the prosecution.

2. Defence evidence has been rejected on unreasonable grounds.

As the two grounds of appeal urged are different to each other, I will now proceed

to consider the said grounds of appeal separately.

The First Ground of Appeal:-

This is a matter where there were no eyewitnesses to the actual incident where

the deceased had received cut injuries. Therefore, the prosecution has relied on

the dying declarations alleged to have been made by the deceased Nimal Rohana

Mayadunne to his wife, who reached the place of the incident soon after it

occurred, and to his elder brother PW-02, few minutes thereafter.

It was the position of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the alleged dying

declarations made by the deceased to PW-01 and PW-02 are different to each

other and cannot be accepted without any doubt. It was his position that the

said alleged dying declarations are not cogent enough to be believed.

It was also his position that the claim made by PW-01, that she saw the appellant

running away from the place of the incident along with the other two accused

was also doubtful and cannot be believed in view of the discrepancies in that

regard.

He pointed out that there was insufficient light for her to make a positive

identification, even she may have seen somebody running away. It was his

position that there was insufficient evidence to establish whether the witnesses

knew the 3rd accused and has identified him properly at the trial.

In this regard, it was the submission of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor

General (SDSG) on behalf of the respondent that the evidence of a person treated

as an adverse witness cannot be taken advantage of by either party in a trial. He

cited several cases to support his contention. It was his position that the two

dying declarations made by the deceased can be relied upon. He submitted to

Page 11 of 21

the Court that the full moon Poya day of July in the year 2000 was the 16th,

whereas the incident has occurred on the 11th, to show that the evidence of PW-

01 can be believed when she said that she was able identify the persons fleeing

the scene of the crime. He submitted further that the differences in the two dying

declarations can be well explained, since the said declarations had been made

on two occasions where it can have slight differences. It was his position that the

JMO has clearly established the fact that the deceased was able to talk after the

incident, which substantiates the evidence of PW-01 and that of PW-02. He

contended further that there was no issue as to the identity of the appellant as

the evidence had been to the effect that both the witnesses knew him well,

although they had no close connection with him.

Since it was argued that the two dying declarations alleged to have been made

by the deceased to PW-01 and PW-02 should not have been accepted by the trial

Judge, I find it necessary to consider whether that argument has any merit.

Dying Declarations can be admitted as evidence in terms of Section 32(1) of the

Evidence Ordinance, which reads thus;

32. Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person

who is dead, who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of

giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without any

amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the

case, appears to the Court unreasonable, are themselves relevant

facts in the following cases.

(1) When the statement is made by a person as to the cause of

his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction

which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that

persons death comes into question.

Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them was or was

not, at the time when they were made under expectation of death, and whatever

Page 12 of 21

may be the nature of the proceedings in which the cause of his death comes into

question.

E.R.S.R Coomaraswamy in his book The Law of Evidence Volume 1 at page

466 summarizes the conditions of admissibility of a dying declaration in Sri

Lanka with reference to several decided cases of our Superior Courts in the

following manner.

1. Death of the declarant before the proceedings.

2. The statement must relate to the cause of his death or any of the

circumstances of the transaction in which resulted in his death.

3. The case must be such that the cause of the declarants death must

come into question.

4. The competency of the declarant to testify may have to be established

depending upon the circumstances of each case, but strict rules of

competency do not apply.

5. The statement must be a complete verbal statement, though it may take

the form of question and answers or appropriate gestures it must be

complete in itself and capable of a definite meaning. Although there is

authority in Sri Lanka for the view that the very words of the deceased

person must be given in evidence, there is South African authority to

the contrary. The Indian Supreme Court has insisted on the exact

words which must be complete in meaning.

In the case of Ranasinghe Vs. The Attorney General (2007) 1 SLR 218, it was

held:

i. When a dying declaration is considered as an item of evidence against

an accused person in a criminal trial the trial Judge/jury must bear in mind

the following weaknesses;

a. The statement of the deceased person was not made under oath.

b. The statement of the deceased has not been tested by cross-

examination.

Page 13 of 21

ii. The trial Judge/jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the

following matters;

a. Whether the deceased in fact made such a statement.

b. Whether the statement made by the deceased is true and accurate.

c. Whether the statement made by the deceased could be accepted

beyond reasonable doubt.

d. Whether the evidence of the witness who testifies about the dying

declaration could be accepted beyond reasonable doubt.

e. Whether the witness is telling the truth

f. Whether the deceased was able to speak at the time the alleged

declaration was made.

The above guidelines clearly provide that when a trial Court is considering a

dying declaration, it has to take the evidence of the person or persons to whom

the alleged dying declaration has been made by the deceased along with other

relevant evidence to satisfy itself whether such a declaration can be accepted as

evidence.

As I have stated previously, this is not a case where a single dying declaration

heard by two persons when it was made, but a case where the deceased has

made two separate statements on two occasions to his wife and the elder

brother.

The wife has come to the scene of the incident soon after hearing the cries of

her husband. When questioned as to what happened, he has stated to her that

Heman cut him and Raja and Nalin were also present.

For matters of clarity, I would now reproduce the relevant portion of the evidence

of PW-01 (at page 148 of the Appeal brief).

Page 14 of 21

The evidence of PW-02, the elder brother of the deceased in that regard reads as

follows (at page 159 of the brief).

: ?

: . , , .

: . .

I am in no position to agree with the contention that the two statements made

are different to each other. I find that what the deceased had told PW-01 was

similar to what he has told PW-02. He has informed both of them that it was

Heman, Raja and Nalin who attacked and caused cut injuries to them. He has

told specifically to PW-01 who came soon after the incident that it was Heman,

the now deceased 1st accused who caused the cut injuries. When asked by PW-

02 subsequently, he has made a general statement in that regard involving all 3

accused indicted before the High Court. That does not mean the statements

made by the deceased are different to each other. I find that the deceased has

accurately stated the transaction, which resulted in his death, to the two

witnesses.

In this regard, I find it necessary to examine whether the deceased had the

capacity to talk due to the injuries sustained by him. The evidence of PW-01 and

PW-02 is clear that he spoke to them as well as others who were present until

Page 15 of 21

he was taken in the van to the hospital. PW-02 has been specific that he spoke

to him until the van was stopped near his house for him to wear a shirt. The

JMO who testified before the Court as to the ability of the deceased to talk after

receiving injuries that led to his death, and has given clear evidence that a person

of physical strength and age such as the deceased, could have spoken up to half

an hour or one hour after the injuries caused to him. He has been specific as to

the injuries that had been caused to the diaphragm of the deceased explaining

that the injuries in that area were superficial and the deceased had the ability to

speak with such injuries.

I do not find any reason to believe that the witnesses were not telling the truth

about what they heard from the deceased. When considering the evidence of the

JMO and the two Post-Mortem Reports relating to the two deceased persons, it

becomes clear that the cut injuries have been caused using a heavy sharp cutting

instrument. It is clear that all the injuries caused to the two persons had been

caused by using a single weapon, which clearly allies with the dying declaration

to the effect that only one person caused cut inures to him and the other two

were present along with him.

Since the indictment has been preferred on the basis of Section 32 of the Penal

Code where, when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the

common intention of all, each of such person is liable for that act in the same

manner as if it were done by him alone. I find that, if not for the common

intention of causing injuries to the deceased persons, there was no other reason

for the 2nd and 3rd accused indicted which includes the appellant, to be present

at that time of the day along with the 1st accused indicted.

The learned Presidents Counsel contended that there was insufficient light

conditions for the wife of the deceased to positively identify the assailants as

claimed by her in her evidence, although she may have seen somebody running

away. It was also contended that there was a doubt as to whether the PW-01

knew the appellant sufficiently for her to identify him in such light conditions.

Page 16 of 21

At the hearing of this appeal, it was established before this Court that the date

of the incident was few days prior to the full moon Poya day of the month. The

evidence shows that, the place of the incident was just in front of the deceased

Nimal Mayadunnes house and was a paddy field adjacent to the house. There

was undisputed evidence that the distance between the house and the place

where the deceased was found fallen was about 10-12 meters. The evidence of

the wife shows that she had been waiting outside of the house when she heard

her husbands voice, which had prompted her to run towards the direction where

it emanated. Her evidence has been that she saw the 3 accused persons indicted

running away when she was approaching the place. This evidence goes on to

show that the PW-01 has been able to reach the place where she heard her

husband shouting within few seconds of her hearing his voice. She does not say

that she saw the persons attacking her husband or the other person who died in

this incident, but only the fact that the accused persons were seen moving away

from the direction of the place of the incident.

All the accused persons indicted are well known to the witness. The 1st accused

being a relative, I find no basis to accept that the appellant was a person not

properly known to her. In fact, the appellant was the brother-in-law of the 1st

accused indicted. And also, the house of the 1st accused was in the

neighbourhood of the place of the incident. I am of the view that there was

sufficient light, given the possible distance from where PW-01 had seen the

accused persons when she saw them running away, and PW-01 had positively

identified the three persons.

The two contradictions marked when PW-01 was giving evidence were in relation

to the fact that whether she saw the other deceased person, namely Shelton,

before she saw her husband. In her evidence before the Court, she has stated

that it was her husband that she saw and only after going near him, she came

to know that the other deceased person was injured and fallen into the nearby

paddy field. I am of the view that this question of fact has not created any doubt

in relation to the evidence PW-01.

Page 17 of 21

As considered correctly by the learned High Court Judge, the witness has given

evidence nearly 20 years after the incident. Such a witness can very well forget

details of that nature when giving evidence after a lapse of such a long period.

I am in no position to agree that the learned High Court Judge has considered

insufficient and doubtful evidence of the prosecution to convict the appellant.

It is abundantly clear from the judgement that the learned High Court Judge has

been well aware of the evaluation of evidence and the necessary legal principles

he needs to be mindful in his task. The learned High Court Judge has considered

all aspects of the relevant evidence in coming to his findings; therefore, I find no

merit in the first ground of appeal urged by the learned Counsel.

The Second Ground of Appeal:-

In the second ground of appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant contended

that the learned High Court Judge has rejected the defence evidence on

unreasonable grounds.

After the conclusion of the prosecution evidence, and when the appellant was

called upon for a defence, he has chosen to make a dock statement. In analyzing

the defence case, the learned High Court Judge has well considered the weight

that can be attached to a dock statement made by an accused person.

It is well settled law that a dock statement also can be considered as a form of

evidence subjected to infirmities attached to it, being an unsworn statement not

tested by cross-examination.

In the case of Gunapala and Others Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1994) 3

SLR 180, it was held:

The jury must not only be informed that a statement from the dock must be

looked upon as evidence subject to the infirmities which attached to

statements that are unsworn and not tested by cross-examination, but they

must also be directed that,

Page 18 of 21

a. If they believe the unsworn statement, it must be acted

upon,

b. If it raised a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case

of the prosecution, the defence must succeed; and

c. It should not be used against another accused.

It is clear from the judgement that the learned High Court Judge has looked at

the dock statement of the appellant with the above legal principles in mind.

In his dock statement, the appellant has taken up an alibi to the effect that he

was elsewhere and consuming liquor at a shop situated in the village to suggest

that he was not at the place of the incident. He has called a witness to

substantiate that fact.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant is that the learned High

Court Judge has failed to consider the alibi taken up by the appellant in its

correct perspective. However, I am not in a position to agree with the said

submission.

The learned High Court Judge has decided to consider the alibi taken up by the

appellant on the basis that he has taken up that position when he made his

statement to the police after his arrest. He has determined that, hence, it

becomes relevant in terms of Section 126A(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act. Thereafter, the learned High Court Judge has considered his alibi

and the fact that he was evading arrest for over a month as relevant facts, and

has determined that the prosecution evidence has proved the appellants

presence in the place of the crime beyond reasonable doubt.

The learned High Court Judge has also considered whether his presence at the

scene of the crime constitutes common intention in terms of Section 32 of the

Penal Code.

It has been determined that no doubt has been created or a reasonable

explanation has been provided which can be considered in favour of the

Page 19 of 21

appellant. The learned High Court Judge has come to the finding that the

prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, only after well

considering the evidence placed before him as a whole, which was the correct

way to come to a finding in a criminal case.

It appears that although the learned High Court Judge has referred to the alibi

taken up by the appellant as a defence of alibi, in fact, it is clear that the learned

High Court Judge was mindful of the legal principles in relation to an alibi.

It needs to be mentioned that because of the fact that most of the legal texts and

judgements refer to an alibi as a defence of an alibi, such inadvertent

misdirection may occur. However, in fact, an alibi is a question of fact.

Once an alibi is taken up, it becomes imperative for a trial Judge to consider that

fact in relation to the other evidence led before him and decide whether a doubt

arises as to the prosecution case because of the alibi.

Considering an alibi which is not a general or special exception, T.S. Fernando,

J. in the case of Martin Singho Vs. Queen 69 CLW 21 at page 22, remarked

as follows;

As this Court has pointed out on many occasions in the past, where an

accused person is not relying on a general or special exception contained in

the Penal Code, there is no burden on him to establish any fact. In this case,

the appellant not relying on any such exception; even if the Jury declined to

believe the appellants version, he was yet entitled to be acquitted on the

charge if his version raised in the mind of the Jury a reasonable doubt as to

the truth of the prosecution case.

At this juncture, I must emphasize that any alibi taken up by an accused must

be to the effect that there was no possibility, given the facts of the matter, for

him to be present at the scene of the crime or participate in the crime. Mere

saying that he was not there would not do.

In the instant case, the position taken up by the appellant had been not an

impossibility, but to say that he was elsewhere in the same village having liquor

at a store. That does not speak about an impossibility for him to be at the scene

of the crime when it was committed.

Although a witness has been called to say that he was at his shop which was

situated in the village itself, and was consuming liquor, that in itself does not

establish that fact to create a doubt in the prosecution evidence.

In the case of The King Vs. Marshall (1948) 51 NLR 157 at 159, Dias, J.

having considered several legal principles and judgements in relation to how the

trial Court should test an alibi observed as follows;

An alibi is not an exception to criminal liability like a plea of private defence

or grave and sudden provocation. An alibi is nothing more than an

evidentiary fact, which like other facts relied on by an accused must be

weighed in the scale against the case for the prosecution. In a case where

an alibi is pleaded, if the prisoner succeeds thereby in creating a sufficient

doubt in the minds of the Jury as to whether he was present at the scene at

the time the offence was committed, then the prosecution has not

established its case beyond all reasonable doubt, and the accused is

entitled to be acquitted- Rex vs. Chandrasekera (1942) 44 NLR at page

126 and Rex vs. Fernando (1947) 48 NLR at page 251. Although the

learned Judge did not deal with the alibi in this way, a study of the evidence

shows that no miscarriage of justice resulted thereby. There are

contradictions between the evidence of the second accused and his witness

Premasiri which may have induced the Jury to reject the alibi. In regard to

the case against the second accused there was ample evidence before the

Jury, which, if believed, justified the verdict which they returned. We

therefore think the conviction of the second accused is justified and we

dismiss his application.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered whether this

question of fact of an alibi raised by the appellant has created any doubt in the

prosecution case and had determined that it was not so. That determination had

been reached after evaluating the relevant evidence in its correct perspective.

Hence, I am in no reason to disagree with the reasons given by the learned High

Court Judge in that regard.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the second ground of

appeal urged on behalf of the accused-appellant.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit.

The conviction and the sentence dated 15-12-2022 by the learned High Court

Judge of Gampaha affirmed.
