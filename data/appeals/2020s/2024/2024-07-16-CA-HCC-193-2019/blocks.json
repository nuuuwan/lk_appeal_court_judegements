However, these contradictions and omissions are minor, which do not go to the root of the prosecutions case.

Therefore, we see no merit in the first ground of appeal. The second ground of appeal is the fact that the trial judge had rejected the defence case due to minor contradictions but we observe that the defence witness, that is the wife of the accused, had omitted to state some of the facts mentioned by the accused in the dock statement and in the cross examination put to the witness of the prosecution.Therefore, this court is of the opinion that the trial judge is correct in rejecting the Defences case.
