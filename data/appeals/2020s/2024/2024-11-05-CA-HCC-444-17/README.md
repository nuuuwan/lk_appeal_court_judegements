JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Director General of the Bribery Commission

in the High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo on the following

charges:

1. Between 01.12.2007 and 26.12.2007 at Ampara the Appellant

did solicit a gratification of Rs.50,000/- from a person by the

name of Ganhewalage Punchi Nona as an inducement or reward

to secure a government job for her son Jayasundara

Mudiyanseage Janaka Bandara, preferably in the Ceylon

CA/HCC/0444/2017

3 | P a g e

Electricity Board and thereby committed an offence punishable

Under Section 20(b)iv of the Bribery Act.

2. On or about 26.12.2007 at Ampara the Appellant did accept a

gratification of Rs.50,000/- from a person by the name of

Ganhewalage Punchi Nona as an inducement or reward to

secure a government job for her son Jayasundara

Mudiyanselage Janaka Bandara, preferably in the Ceylon

Electricity Board and thereby committed an offence punishable

Under Section 20(b)iv of the Bribery Act.

As the Appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges levelled against him, the

trial proceeded, and the prosecution had called five witnesses, marked

productions P1 to P5 and closed their case. As the prosecution had presented

a prima facie case against the Appellant, the learned High Court Judge had

called for the defence. The Appellant had given evidence from the witness

box, called five witnesses, and marked V1 to V12 in support of his case and

closed his case. After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the

learned High Court Judge had found the Appellant guilty on the charges and

has imposed the following sentences on the Appellant on 02/11/2017:

1. For the first count 04 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine

of Rs.5,000/- and with a default sentence of 01-month simple

imprisonment.

2. For the second count 4 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine

of Rs.5000/- and with a default sentence of 01-month simple

imprisonment.

Further the learned High Court Judge has ordered the four-year

sentence imposed on 1st and 2nd counts to run concurrent to each

other.

CA/HCC/0444/2017

4 | P a g e

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this Court.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider;

1. that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable

doubt.

2. That the evidence which was led at the trial is insufficient to make an

order of conviction.

3. that the evidence of the Appellant had not been given any consideration

by the learned High Court Judge.

4. that the learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence

for the prosecution taking into consideration the obvious infirmities

and contradictions in his judgment.

5. that the failure on the part of the trial judge to consider the date of

commission of the offence is conduct which reflects partial bias on the

part of the High Court Judge.

6. that the Judge who wrote the judgment had failed to observe the

demeanour and deportment of the witnesses.

Background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

PW1, Punchi Nona a village lass was living in Nagaswewa, Dehiattakandiya

with her family of 09 members with much difficulty as her only source of

income was the earnings from cultivation of paddy in a land of two and half

acres in extent. None in her family were permanently employed. As such, she

had sought assistance to secure a permanent employment to her son-in-law

PW2 in a government department, preferably in the Ceylon Electricity Board.

The Appellant was an Attorney-At-Law cum local politician to whom PW1

had extended her support. Due to this connection PW1 had requested the

Appellant to secure a government job for PW2, preferably in the Ceylon

Electricity Board. The Appellant had solicited Rs.50,000/- for the job. As she

CA/HCC/0444/2017

5 | P a g e

did not possess Rs.50,000/-, she had mortgaged a portion of her cultivated

land to the village Funeral Donation Society and obtained a loan of

Rs.50,000/- and had handed over the money to the Appellant at his office in

the presence of her son-in-law PW2 on 26.12.2007.

As the Appellant had failed to secure a government employment for PW2 as

promised, she had requested the money back from the Appellant. She had

made this request as her financial situation had further deteriorated. The

Appellant had issued a cheque for Rs.50,000/- without retuning the money

which he had accepted from PW1. But the cheque had bounced when it was

presented to the relevant bank for clearance. After the cheque was

dishonoured, the Appellant had deposited Rs.25,000/- to the PW2s account.

As the payment of the remaining Rs.25,000/- was delayed by the Appellant,

PW1 had lodged a complaint at the Bribery Commission. When he got to

know that a complaint had been lodged against him at the Bribery

Commission, the Appellant had sent Rs.25,000/- through a person to PW1.

The Appellant had received the purported money when he was functioning

as the Chief District Organiser of a political party. The Appellant is an

Attorney-At-Law by profession and was a member of parliament and held the

post of a Deputy Minister. According to the Appellant, he had received this

Rs.50,000/- from PW1 as a contribution for the construction of his party

office when he was functioning as the District Organiser.

To prove a bribery case, the prosecution must demonstrate that a thing of

value was offered and accepted, that there was an illegal intent, and the

intent was to pay money and receive something in return that was illegal.

In a criminal trial, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the Appellant to prove his

innocence. This is the Golden Thread that was discussed in Woolmington

v. DPP [1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held that:

CA/HCC/0444/2017

6 | P a g e

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner...the prosecution has not made out the

case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

Rodrigo J, in James Silva V The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2SLR Page

167 citing Jayasena V the Queen 72 NLR Page 313, Held that;

..A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is

to consider all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the

prosecution or by the defence in its totality without compartmentalising

and, ask himself whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the

particular case, he believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty

- see the Privy Council Judgment in Jayasena v The Queen.

As the raised grounds of appeal are interconnected, all grounds will be

considered together in this appeal.

The assessment of the credibility of witnesses primarily depends on the

testimony given by them either for the prosecution or for the defence during

the examination-in-chief, cross examination, and re-examination. In this

case the learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence of all the

prosecution witnesses, evaluated their evidence extensively and was satisfied

himself that their evidence passed the test of consistency and the test of

probability.

Under the first charge the prosecution had led evidence that the solicitation

had taken place between 01.12.2007 to 26.12.2007. PW1 had given evidence

after about five years of the incident. She had given evidence of the incident

without deviating from her original stance. Her evidence was very well

corroborated by the evidence of PW2 and PW3.

CA/HCC/0444/2017

7 | P a g e

As per Section 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979, the

Appellant had been given reasonable notice regarding the time of incident.

For clarity the Section 165 of CPC is re-produced below:

Particulars as to time, place and person.

(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place

of the alleged offence and as to the person (if any) against whom and

as to the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed as are

reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with

which he is charged and to show that the offence is not prescribed.

(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or

dishonest misappropriation of movable property, it shall be sufficient

to specify the gross sum or, as the case may be, the gross quantity in

respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and

the dates between which the offence is alleged to have been committed

without specifying particular items or exact dates, and the charge so

framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the

meaning of section 174:

Provided that the time included between the first and last of such dates

shall not exceed one year.

(3) When the nature of the case is such that the particulars mentioned

in section 164 and the preceding subsections of this section do not

give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he is

charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner

in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that

purpose.

In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat (supra) the court held further:

In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an

occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work on the

CA/HCC/0444/2017

8 | P a g e

spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect

people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters.

It is unrealistic to expect a witness to be a human tape recorder.

In R. v. Dossai 13 Cr.App.R. 158 the court held that:

A date specified in an indictment is not a material matter unless it is

an essential part of the alleged offence; the defendant may be convicted

although the jury finds that the offence was committed on a date other

than that specified in the indictment. Amendment of the indictment is

unnecessary, although it will be good practice to do so (provided that

there is no prejudice below) where it is clear on the evidence that if the

offence was committed at all, it was committed on the day other than

that specified.

As the Appellant had been given sufficient notice regarding the date of offence

under which he had been indicted and led plausible evidence through

witnesses regarding the period, I conclude that this has not caused any

prejudice or failure of justice as the Appellant had raised a totally different

issue in the trial.

PW1 is from a remote area of Dehiattakandiya and she had had her

education up to Ordinary Level. She had mixed up the institution in which

she requested the Appellant to secure a government job for her son-in-law.

But this had been cleared and given reasons as to why she mixed up the

institution in her evidence. The relevant portion her evidence is re-produced

below:

As accurately argued by the Senior Deputy Solicitor General, the learned

High Court Judge had meticulously evaluated the evidence and had given

plausible reasons as to why he did not give weight to the confusion with

regarding the government institution.

CA/HCC/0444/2017

10 | P a g e

The learned Presidents Counsel contended that the learned High Court

Judge who wrote the judgment did not have the advantage of observing the

demeanour and deportment of key witnesses thereby the Appellant was not

given a fair trial in this case.

Section 48 of the Judicature Act states;

In the case of death, sickness, resignation, removal from office,

absence from Sri Lanka, or other disability of any Judge before whom

any action, prosecution, proceeding or matter, whether on any inquiry

preliminary to committal for trial or otherwise, has been instituted or

is pending, such action, prosecution, proceeding or matter may be

continued before the successor of such Judge who shall have power to

act on the evidence already recorded by his predecessor, or partly

recorded by his predecessor and partly recorded by him or, if he thinks

fit, to resummon the witness and commence the proceedings afresh:

Provided that where any criminal prosecution, proceeding or matter

(except on an inquiry preliminary to committal for trial) is continued

before the successor of any such judge, the accused may demand that

the witnesses be resummoned and reheard.

In this case the trial had been conducted by several High Court Judges and

two defence witnesses had testified before the learned High Court Judge who

wrote the judgment.

The Appellant was very well represented by Counsels during the trial. The

learned Defence Counsel has agreed to continue the case under Section 48

of the Judicature Act at all times when a new High Court Judge had taken

up the proceedings. Hence the Appellant cannot presently take up the

position that the learned High Court Judge who wrote the judgment had not

observed the demeanour and deportment of the witnesses. But the learned

High Court Judge who wrote the judgment had very well analysed the

evidence recorded in his judgment.

CA/HCC/0444/2017

11 | P a g e

In Dharmaratane v Dassanayake and Others (2006) 3 Sri L. R. 130 the

court held that;

In view of the provisions of section 48 of the Judicature Act - as amended

a party to an action has no right to demand a trial de novo but where an

application is made for a trial de novo there is a discretion vested in the

judge to decide whether a trial de novo should be ordered or not.

In Vimala Dissanayake and Others v Leslie Dharmaratne (2008) 2 SLR

184 the court held that;

(1) It is necessary for a succeeding Judge to continue proceedings since

there are change of Judges holding office in a particular Court due to

transfers, promotions and the like. It is in these circumstances that

Section 48 was amended giving discretion to a Judge to continue with

the proceedings.

(2) The exercise of such discretion should not be disturbed unless there are

serious issues with regard to the demeanour of any witnesses recorded

by the Judge who previously heard the case.

In Herath Mudiyanselage Aruyaratna v. Republic of Sri Lanka

CA/307/2006 decided on 17/07/2013 that:

Transfer of a judge to another station covers the words other disability

as stated in Section 48 of the Judicature Act, hence the succeeding judge

has no disability to continue with a trial.

CA/HCC/0444/2017

12 | P a g e

This Court already held in Case No.CA/HCC/0168/2015 decided on

24/02/2022 that:

In the case under consideration, it is clear from the proceedings that the

succeeding High Court Judge has decided to continue with the case by

calling the remaining witnesses as formally adopting the evidence

previously recorded was not a matter that needed the attention of the

Learned High Court Judge, as there was no such requirement and the

provision is for the continuation of the trial.

.. although it has been the long-standing practice of our judges to

formally adopt the evidence led before their predecessors, it is not a

mandatory requirement.

In this case, the Appellant had taken up the position that he did not solicit

the sum mentioned in the indictment but had received the same as a

donation to build the party office. This was refuted by PW1.

The learned SDSG very correctly submitted that PW1 Punchi Nona is not a

rich woman to donate money to the Appellant to fund a party office for him.

She was only a supporter of the political party to which the Appellant

belonged. PW1 specifically stated that she had tried to secure a government

job for her son-in-law through the Appellant, due to their destitute living

conditions. As the Appellant had demanded money, she had mortgaged the

only property she owned to the village Death Donation Society to obtain

Rs.50,000/- which she had then given to the Appellant in the presence of

PW2.

An accused has the right to explain evidence and the right to present

evidence or witnesses for his own defence. In this case the Appellant does

not deny that he received money from the complainant. But his position was

that the money received was a donation for the purpose of funding the Party

Office. Punchi Nona in her evidence had categorically stated that she

CA/HCC/0444/2017

13 | P a g e

mortgaged her only paddy land to the Death Donation Society and obtained

a loan for the sole purpose of obtaining a government job for her son-in-law

who had no permanent job at that time.

The learned High Court Judge had given his reasons as to why he

disregarded the defence evidence. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

This goes to show that the prosecution had proven that the Appellant had

solicited and accepted the gratification as disclosed by PW1. The learned

High Court Judge found the prosecutions evidence to be very persuasive.

The learned High Court Judge in his judgment carefully considered the

evidence led by both parties to come to his conclusion. Hence, the learned

CA/HCC/0444/2017

15 | P a g e

High Court Judge had been satisfied with the credibility of the witnesses who

had given evidence on behalf of the prosecution.

In this case the evidence presented by the prosecution is overwhelming. No

contradictory position existed among the prosecution witnesses. The learned

High Court Judge had considered the inter se and per se contradictions of

prosecution witnesses and held that the prosecution had adduced cogent,

consistent, and believable evidence. Therefore, I conclude that the grounds

of appeal raised by the Appellant have no merit.

When considering the totality of the evidence, it is clear that the prosecution

has proven the charges in the indictment against the Appellant beyond

reasonable doubt.

Therefore, the appeal is dismissed, and the conviction and the sentence are

affirmed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
