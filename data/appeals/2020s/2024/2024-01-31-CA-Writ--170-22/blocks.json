In all such occasions, the gate of the Petitioner's house had been locked with a padlock. Hence, the members of the Interview Board were unable to conduct a site inspection. Nevertheless, the Petitioner claims that during the entire month of December 2021 and the month of January 2022, the Petitioner and his family were at their alleged residence. The Petitioner states that, on some days the Petitioner was out of Kandy for his Visa processing works and on 29.12.2021 he went to Kurunegala to obtain medical treatments leaving his wife and children at his wifes mothers house at Pilimathalawa. The Petitioner further stated that on the occasions when he was not at home, his wife went to her mothers house to stay with their children because she could not attend to all the work on her own. It is not in dispute that the involvement of the Petitioners day-to-day essential professional and personal commitments need to be attended to and could not be disturbed. However, the Petitioners awareness of the impending visit for a site inspection at any time during that period must also be taken into consideration. Under such circumstances, a duty would be cast on the Petitioner to take all reasonable measures to be present at the residence in anticipation of such site inspection. Therefore, the Petitioner cannot be allowed to waive all responsibility to be present at the residence at all possible times during that period owing to his personal involvements and difficulties. It is also difficult for this Court to accept the claim that the Petitioner was away from his residence on all the 7 occasions the members of the Interview Board visited the Petitioner's house due to his professional and personal commitments.",

    "text": "On the above circumstances, I am of the view that the selection process for admission had been conducted by the Interview Board and the Appeal Board complying with the relevant provisions of the Circular and the Respondents had had all the valid, reasonable and lawful grounds to reach at its impugned decision. Therefore, the Respondents do not owe any public duty towards the Petitioner to admit his daughter to Grade 01 of Mahamaya Girls School Kandy as the Petitioner had failed to establish the residency of the Petitioner under the category of Children of residents in close proximity to the school during the physical site inspections. The Petitioner seeks a Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st, 3rd and 4th Respondents to enroll his child to the Mahamaya Girls School Kandy. The foundation of a Writ of Mandamus is the existence of a legal right. A court generally should not issue a Writ of Mandamus to enforce a right which is not legal and is not based upon a public duty (see Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka vs. M/S Jafferjee (Pvt) Limited 2005 1SLR 89). Accordingly, I view that the Petitioner is not entitled to a Writ of Mandamus as prayed for in the prayer to Petition.",
