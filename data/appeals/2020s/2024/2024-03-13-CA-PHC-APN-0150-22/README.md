JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Complainant filed a charge sheet Under Section 63(1) (a) of the

Mines and Minerals Act No.33 of 1992 as amended by Act No.66 of

2009 against the Accused in the Magistrate Court of Ambalantota for

mining sand without a valid license issued by the Geological Survey

and Mines Bureau using an Excavator Machine bearing registration No.

SK 200. As the Accused pleaded guilty to the charge sheet, the Learned

Magistrate of Ambalantota had convicted the Accused and imposed a

fine of Rs.50,000/- and fixed for an inquiry under Section 63 (b) (1) of

the Mines and Minerals Act to decide whether to confiscate the

Excavator Machine bearing No. SK 200.

CA (PHC) APN 150/2022

4 | P a g e

At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate had decided to

confiscate the aforesaid machine by his order dated 25.11.2021. At the

inquiry only the Registered Applicant-Appellant-Petitioner (Hereinafter

referred to as the Petitioner) had given evidence on him behalf.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Magistrate, the Appellant filed a

Revision Application in the Provincial High Court of Southern Province

Holden at Hambantota to revise the order of the Learned Magistrate of

Hambantota.

After an inquiry, the Learned High Court Judge had dismissed the said

Revision Application of the Petitioner on the basis that the Petitioner

had failed to take necessary precaution to prevent misuse of the

aforesaid Excavator Machine bearing No. SK 200.

Now the Petitioner filed this Revision Application in terms of Article

154-P (6) of the Constitution to set aside the order of the Learned High

Court Judge of Southern Province Holden at Hambantota dated

06/07/2022.

The Appellant submitted following exceptional circumstances:

i. It is respectfully submitted that the order dated 06/07/2022 of

the Honourable High Court Judge is void, bad in law and illegal

in as much as the same has been delivered on without giving

due courtesy to the Section 63 (b) (1) of the Mine and Minerals

Act No 66 of 2009.

ii. It is respectfully submitted that the Honourable Judge of the

Provincial High Court has erroneously drawn an inference that

the Petitioner could not take any precaution to prevent

commission of offence using Excavator.

CA (PHC) APN 150/2022

iii. The Honourable Judge of the Provincial High Court has

erroneously come to the conclusion that the test used by the

Court in Aruna Pradeep Prasanna vs Attorney General CA

(PHC) No 61/2012 to decide whether the vehicle of the appellant

was used for transportation of liquor without his knowledge or

not in terms of the Excise ordinance, should be applied to this

matter.

iv. The Honourable Judge of the Provincial High Court has

erroneously come to the conclusion that in the case of Aruna

Pradeep Prasanna vs Attorney General CA (PHC) No 61/2012

the Court of Appeal has imposed extent of burden of proof to the

applicant as to why the goods which were used for the criminal

offence should not be confiscated in terms of the section 54 (1)

(2) of excise ordinance is same under the section 63 (b) (1) of the

Mine and Mineral Act.

v. The Honourable Judge of the Provincial High Court has failed to

give due consideration to the different words used in section 54

(1) (2) of excise ordinance and section 63 (b) (1) of Mine and

Mineral Act as in the section 54 (1) (2) of Excise Ordinance has

indicated as shall be liable to confiscation but in section 63 (b)

(1) of Mine and Mineral Act has indicated as may make order to

be confiscated.

vi. The Honourable Judge of the High Court has assigned burden of

proof to the applicant who asking the goods in terms of the

section 63 (b) (1) of the Mine and Mineral Act and that extent of

burden of proof is not intended to be assigned by the Parliament.

vii. The Honourable Judge of the High Court has erroneously used

the judgment delivered under the Excise Ordinance to this

matter without considering relevant facts of the present matter

viii. The Honourable Judge of the High Court has come to conclusion

that the evidence given by the Petitioner in the Magistrate Court

is contrary to the law

It is settled law that revision is a discretionary remedy, and such power

shall be invoked only upon demonstration of exceptional

circumstances.

In Marian Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed 69 CLW 34 the court held that:

Power of revision is an extraordinary power of the court

which is independent and distinct from the appellate

jurisdiction. The object of revisionary jurisdiction is to ensure

the due administration of justice and the correction of all

errors in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice.

In the case of Rasheed Ali v.Mohammed Ali and Others [1981] 1 SLR

262, the court held that:

the powers of revision vested in the Court of Appeal are

very wide and the Court can in a fit case exercise that power

whether or not an appeal lies. When, however, the law does

not give a right of appeal and makes the order final, the

Court of Appeal may nevertheless exercise its powers of

revision, but it should do so only in exceptional

circumstances. Ordinarily the Court will not interfere by way

of review, particularly when the law has expressly given an

aggrieved party an alternative remedy such as the right to

CA (PHC) APN 150/2022

7 | P a g e

file a separate action, except when non-interference will

cause a denial of justice or irremediable harm.

In Commissioner of Police v. Tanes (1957-58) 68 CLR 383, the court

held that:

"It is a deep-rooted principle of the law that before anyone

can be punished or prejudiced in his person or his property

by any judicial or quasi-judicial procedure, he must be

afforded adequate opportunity of being heard ... "

In this case the Learned High Court Judge only considering the order of

the Magistrate Court of Hambantota decided to dismiss the revision

application stating that that the Petitioner had failed to prove that he

did not had knowledge about committing of the offence.

In this case an Excavator Machine had been confiscated for mining

sand without a valid license.

The Learned Magistrate has dismissed the application on the basis that

the Petitioner had failed to show that he took all necessary precautions

to prevent a crime being committed by using the Excavator Machine.

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted that the evidence

led at the vehicle inquiry had disclosed that the Petitioner had no

knowledge of commission of the offence. According to the Petitioner, he

had rented the Excavator Machine to one Pradeep Kumar who is the

license holder of the place of mining of sand. The Petitioner had entered

in to a verbal agreement with Pradeep Kumar who said have obtained

mining license from the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau. The

Petitioner had given specific instructions to the Accused not to use the

Excavator Machine for any illegal work and use the same for mining of

sand only at the relevant place.

In Manawadu V. The Attorney General (1987) 2 SLR 30, it was held

that:

"By Section 7 of Act No. 13 of 1981? it was not intended to deprive

an owner, of his vehicle used by the offender; in committing a

'forest offence' without his (owner's) knowledge and without his

participation. The word 'forfeited' must be given the meaning 'liable

t:) be forfeited' so as to avoid the injustice that would flow on the

construction that forfeiture of the vehicle is automatic on the

conviction of the accused. The amended sub-section 40 does not

exclude by necessary implication 'he rule of 'audi alteram partem' .

The owner of the lorry not a party to' the case is entitled to be

heard on the question of forfeiture of the lorry, if he satisfies the

court that the accused committed the offence without his

lt710wledge or participation, his lorry will not be liable to forfeiture.

The Magistrate must hear the owner of the lorry on the question of

showing cause why the lorry is not liable to be forfeited. If the

Magistrate is satisfied with the cause shown, he must restore the

lorry to the owner. The Magistrate may consider the question of

releasing the lorry to the owner pending inquiry, on his entering

into a bond with sufficient security to abide by the order that may

ultimately be binding on him"

The Petitioner has given evidence in the Court and has claimed that he

was unaware of the crime being committed as he has given the vehicle

on rent to excavate sand only.

In this case the Petitioner, further had given evidence and explained to

the Court that he had taken all the possible and necessary precautions

to prevent the vehicle being used for illegal purposes. Previously, the

vehicle was not used for any illegal activities by the Accused at any

stage. According to the evidence of the Petitioner he had given

instructions to the Accused not to use for any illegal activities. He has

placed full trust on the Accused when he gave the vehicle to him.

Hence, it is not correct to say that the Petitioner had not taken any

action to prevent the vehicle being used for illegal purposes.

The Learned Magistrate should have considered that there had been no

previous or pending case against in respect of the vehicle that had been

used for illegal activities and the Accused is not a habitual offender.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge only considering the order of

the Magistrate Court of Hambantota and decided to dismiss the

Revision Application stating that that the Petitioner had failed establish

to that he did not have any knowledge of committing the offence.

It is apparent that in the absence of the Petitioner having had

knowledge of mining sand illegally and /or having had any monetary or

personal benefit from the crime committed cannot be deemed as the

person behind the illegal operation.

Hence, the Learned Magistrate simply dismissing the application on the

basis that the Petitioner had failed to show that he took all necessary

precautions to prevent a crime being committed is not correct in this

case.

Hence, I set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Hambantota dated 06.07.2022 and the order of Learned Magistrate

Court of Hambantota dated 25.11.2021.

Therefore, this Revision Application is allowed.

I direct that the Excavator Machine bearing No. SK 200 be released to

the Petitioner.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgment to the

High Court of Hambantota and the Magistrate Court of Hambantota.
