The learned magistrate had been retired at the time he had given evidence and he had done so after 28 years since retiring. According to his evidence, the accused-appellant was produced to his chamber by the police on 08/04/1982 and the accused-appellant had expressed his desire to make a confession. According to his evidence, he had explained verbally the legal implications of a confession and had ordered the prison authorities to keep him in a separate room until the next date for him to reconsider the decision to make a confession. As the next date had been a Saturday and as he had not been able to get the assistance of a stenographer, the learned magistrate himself had proceeded to write it in his own handwriting. Before doing so he had proceeded to question the appellant whether he was under any promise, threat or inducement. All those questioning had been recorded in his own hand writing before the commencement of the confession. As the answers had been in the negative, he had proceeded to write down the entire confession in his own handwriting. The witness had been extensively cross examined as to the propriety and the legality of the confession but he had stood the test of cross- examination satisfactorily. The position of the defence had been that the appellant never made a confession. At the end of the confession, the learned magistrate has recorded the affirmation that the appellant made the confession voluntarily and it was recorded rightly and correctly. After concluding the evidence of the learned magistrate, the learned trial judge had heard the submissions of both parties and had proceeded to admit the confession in evidence.",

Following on the lines of the position in English law, it has been constantly held by our courts that it is the burden of the prosecution to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the confession is not rendered irrelevant by any inducement, threat or promise as stated in Section 24. If it appears to a court that any of the vitiating factors of Section 24 appears to have caused the accused to make a statement, the court should rule that the statement is irrelevant. E.H.T Gunasekara J, in the case of Queen v Cecilin, observed that the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code referred to above and of Section 24 should be read together. On this basis he stated as follows: In my Opinion a confession is made voluntarily if it made is circumstances that do not render it inadmissible by reason of the provisions of Section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance.",

    "text": "This we observe to be wholly incorrect because the accused-appellant hadbeen very clearly implicated in the confession and it had been corroborated by the circumstantial evidence played by PW-01, PW-03, police and the doctor. all these portions of evidence have been meticulously analysed by the trial judge. This is very clear by Paragraph 2 in page 16 of the judgement, where he had said that the accused-appellant, along with the dead first accused and two others, unknown to the prosecution, had committed this offence on a pre-arranged plan. The murderous intention of the accused-appellant is clearly displayed by the description of the accused-appellant of the incident. In light of the evidence placed by the prosecution, the accused-appellant had made statement from the dock, in which he has not denied the fact that he made a confession to the magistrate, but has gone on to state that he had been tortured by the police while in remand custody. But the learned trial judge had observed that at the time he had been produced to make a confession, he had not stated anything with regard to the torture he had to undergo in the hands of the police. Therefore, he has rejected the dock statement and had concluded that since the confession had been admitted in evidence, which has explained the culpability of the accused-appellant and those factors had been circumstantially corroborated by PW-01, PW-03, police and the doctor.",
