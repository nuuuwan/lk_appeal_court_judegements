MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the judgement dated, 12.10.2016 of the

High Court of Chilaw.

The accused appellant has been indicted under section 383, two charges under

section 296, and in the alternative section 394 of the Penal Code.

The accused-appellant hereinafter referred to as the appellant has pleaded not guilty

and the trial has proceeded against him. Thereafter, upon the conclusion of the trial

the learned High Court Judge has said that it can be presumed that the appellant

has committed the offences referred to in charges one, two, three and four of the

indictment (page 443 of the brief).

Thereafter, he had convicted the appellant for charges number 2, 3 and 4 only and

had said that charge number 1 is in the alternative to charge number 2 and charge

number 5 is in the alternative to charge number 4. Therefore, he has not pronounced

any sentence or conviction on charges 1 and 5.

But this I find to be erroneous because charge number 1 is not the alternative charge

of charge number 2 because charge number 2 is actually the aggravated form of

charge number 1.

But they both can be in one indictment under section 175 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

At this point I wish to consider as to what the learned trial judge had meant by

presuming (at page 443 and 439 of the brief) that the appellant has committed the

offences under charges 1, 2, 3 and 4. The meaning of the term presume, according

to the Blacks Law Dictionary 9th edition page 1304, is that to assume

beforehand; to suppose to be true in the absence of proof. Therefore, the learned

trial judge cannot by all means presume after considering the evidence that the

appellant is guilty of any offence but what he is required to do is to decide on his

guilt or innocence, because as defined in the Blacks Law dictionary, presuming is

something before proof or assuming beforehand. But in the instant matter the trial

3

judge had said so after analyzing the evidence of the prosecution and the defense of

the appellant.

Therefore, it is the opinion of this Court that the statement at page 439 and 443 of

the brief by the trial judge is erroneous and illegal.

The standard of proof for a criminal case is beyond a reasonable doubt, which is

engraved in our law.

In the case of SC Appeal 208/2012 decided on 22nd January 2021 by Yasantha

Kodagoda PC, J, in which the effect and the impact of the principle of reasonable

doubt , was stated thus:-

The principle that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt

and the accused is entitled to an acquittal if there exists a reasonable doubt has

been engraved in the criminal justice system of this country and in the rest of the

common law world. That is to ensure that only those actually guilty of having

committed crimes are convicted and the innocent are acquitted. Thus, the

application of this principle should cause the advancement of the primary

objective of criminal justice and not frustrate it.

In the instant matter we find that the trial judge has failed to say the standard of

proof he applied in deciding in the instant case. He had merelyreferred to the

evidenceof both parties and presumed ( in his own words ) with regard to the guilt of

the appellant.

In the same above mentioned judgement by Justice Yasantha Kodagoda his lordship

has referred to Marcus Stone in Proof of Fact in Criminal Trials (Published by

W. Green & Son, 1984 at page 354), has explained what proof beyond reasonable

doubt is in the following manner

The tribunal of fact could not convict unless it was actually convinced of guilt to

that extent it must believe in the reality of guilt. A mere Mechanical comparison of

probabilities, however strong this might point to guilt, would not be enough. The

4

criterion is human and not mathematical it is a judgement that the facts are

established.

The phrase beyond reasonable doubt is the essential verbal formulation which

has been devised by law to express the necessary standard of belief for criminal

conviction. Attempts improve on or to elaborate on that formulation are

discouraged by appeal courts. The phrase appears to be as precise as any other

words which could be substituted for its proof facts in court inevitably falls short

of absolute certainty.

Therefore, in the instant matter the trial judge had failed to mention the standard of

proof he has applied. Thus the failure on part of the trial judge to do so is a

fundamental error, as such, it is fatal to the conviction he has imposed on the

appellant.

If that is so, then this Court has to consider whether the instant matter should be

sent for a retrial.

Upon the consideration of the submissions of both parties this is a case based on

circumstantial evidence.

The counsel appearing for the appellant raised the following grounds of appeal

1. The improbability of the prosecution version not being considered by the High

Court Judge.

2. Challenging the section 27(1) recovery made by the police.

3. Evaluation of circumstantial evidence being erroneous.

When a case is based on circumstantial evidence every item of evidence of the

prosecution should finally point to the guilt of the accused, like the different strands

of a rope finally forming the entire rope. This has been so said in the case of King v

Appuhamy (supra) that,

5

in order to justify the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial evidence,

the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and

incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis that of his guilt

In a more recent judgement of Karunaratne v Attorney General (2005) 1 Sri LR

233, this Court re-emphasized the following principles;

In the case State of V.P. vs Dr. Ravindra Prakash Mittal (1992) 2 SCJ 549, it

was held that the essential ingredients to prove guilt of an accused person by

circumstantial evidence are:-

1. The circumstances from which the conclusion was drawn should be fully proved:

2. The circumstances should be conclusive in nature;

3. All the facts so established should be consistent with the hypothesis of guilt and

inconsistent with innocence;

4. The circumstance should; to a moral certainty, exclude the possibility of guilt of

any person other than the accused.

In the case of Podi Singho vs King 53 N.L.R 49, it was held that,in a case of

circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the trial judge to tell the jury that such

evidence must be totally inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and must

only be consistent with his guilt. In the case of King vs Appuhamy 46 N.L.R 128,

Keuneman J held that, in order to justify the inference guilt purely on circumstantial

evidence, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the

accused incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than that

of guilt. In the case of State of Tamil Nadu vs Rajendran 1999 Cri. L.J. 4552,

Justice Pittanaik observed that In a case of circumstantial evidence when an

incriminating circumstance is put to the accused and the said accused either offers

no explanation or offers an explanation which is found to be untrue, then the same

becomes an additional link in the chain of circumstance to make it complete

In the instant matter, the circumstantial evidence led by the prosecution against the

appellant is as follows.

6

1. Evidence of PW01, says that the two deceased people are the mother and the

son and they lived at the place of incident and that he has worked as their

driver and he has seen the appellant working in the house of the deceased

persons. He had been told by PW-02 to come to the place of incident on the

date of incident in the morning stating that there was an emergency. He further

says that when he went there, he had not seen the motorcycle of the deceased

son which was parked in the car porch the previous day.

2. PW-02, who has been the brother and son of the deceased persons, had lived a

few houses away from the place of incident and when he came to his mothers

house on 25th of April 2001 at around 7.20 in the morning when informed by

the neighbour, Leelawathi, that his mother was sick. He had found the brother

dead in the room, mother severely injured and certain items mentioned in the

indictment which belong to him, had been lost and later he had identified them

when shown in court. He says that the accused had been working for his

mother and the items were found in the abandoned bag of the appellant. These

had been items which he had brought from abroad and had been kept for safe

keeping at the place of incident.

3. PW-03, a public health inspector has had his office in the place of incident and

he too had seen the accused working for the deceased persons.

4. The doctor who had conducted the postmortems on the two deceased persons

on 25.04.2001 had identified the axe shown by the police as a possible weapon

which could have caused the injuries on the deceased.

5. PW-09 Leelawathi, who had been the deceased persons neighbour, had seen

the deceased seated on a chair in the morning of the date of offence but had

not spoken to her therefore she has suspected the deceased to be sick. As such

she had informed PW-02. She says at that time, the dogs of the deceased

7

person were untied and they were very ferocious animals who did not tolerate

any visitors coming into the land.

6. Witness Leelawathi furthersays that she had been prompted to go out because

an unknown woman had come to her land asking for the PHI next door, then

she had gone out to see and had seen the deceased number 1 seated in an

unusual manner which had prompted her to inform PW-02.

7. The evidence of the investigating officers revealed that

The first complaint has been received on the 25th of April 2001 in the morning

at about 8,30 am.

One deceased person had been in the house, the other in the hospital

Certain electrical items were noted to be missing by PW-02 from the scene

crime.

On the very same day at around 5.30 am the Kochchikade police, who were at

a check point at the Thoppuva bridge, had stopped a motor bicycle to search.

At that point the person on the bicycle had run away leaving everything

behind on the bicycle there had been a bag which had contained a

gramasevakas certificate on which the appellants name had been revealed

The motor bike had been identified by PW-02 as belonging to his deceased

brother

Inside the bag there had been several electrical items, which PW-02 had

identified to be his belongings, had gone missing after the date of incident

from his mothers place

On the gramasevaka certificate found in the bag the appellant was arrested on

25th of April 2001 by the Vaikkal police later in the evening.

On his statement, the mamoty marked in court had been recovered with stains

of blood, and the Government Analyst had identified it to be human blood.

An identification parade has been held and PW-07, who had been on duty at

the Thoppuwa check point on the 25th morning, had identified the appellant

8

and the said notes had been admitted at the trial under section 420 of the

CPC.

In the instant there is evidence of the appellant immediately after the murder and the

robbery , been found with items which had been identified by the PW-02 as being the

belongings of the deceased persons house.

Illustration (a) of section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance provides that,

It can be presumed that when a man is in possession of stolen goods soon after

the theft is either the thief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen

unless he can account for his possession.

In the instant matter also the trial judge had rightfully had applied the above and

had found him guilty for the charges of murder also, but he had failed to state the

standard of proof he has applied to come to the said conclusion.

In the book of The Law of Evidence in Sri Lanka by G.L. Peiris it has been said

that the above presumption is not confined to cases of theft but applies to all crimes.

This has been so held in the case of Anuruddha Samaranayake and Four Others

vs Attorney General CA 36-40/2007 decided on 25th March 2011 by Salam J,

However, it is not right on the part of the trial court to convict a possessor of

such property on the sole ground of recovery of it from him. Though the court can

draw a presumption under Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance, simply on the

recovery of stolen articles, no inference can be drawn that a person in possession

of the stolen articles is guilty of the offence of murder and robbery. The

culpability of the offence will depend on other circumstantial evidence, is any.

Further the presumption permitted to be drawn under Section 114 must be read

along with the time factor. If the articles recovered are found in possession of a

person soon after murder, a presumption of guilt may be rightly permitted. On the

other hand, a presumption cannot be permitted after a considerable interval. On

this aspect of the matter, one has to be also mindful of the distance between the

9

place where the offence in respect of the articles was committed and the place

where they were later found.

In the same judgement it has been held that:

A long line of authorities both in Sri Lanka and in India favour the extension of

the application of the presumption to offences other than retention of stolen

property, only after exercise of great care, particularly when direct evidence

clearly exonerates the possess of stolen articles from having participated in the

commotion of the principal offence

In the instant matter the circumstantial evidence points out to the fact that the day

the two deceased persons were found dead the accused appellant was found riding

the diseased persons bicycle with household items belonging to the diseased family

in his possession. The moment the investigating officers at the checkpoint detected

him he has run away leaving the bicycle and his bag of goods behind. Then after, few

hours later he had been taken into custody.

Hence, the proximity of time and location from where the accused appellant was

found in possession of goods identified by PW-02 can be considered under Section

114 (a) of the Evidence Ordinance and an adverse inference can be drawn against the

appellant.

Therefore, upon considering the above mentioned items of evidence, it can be

concluded that the prosecution had led very serious items of circumstantial evidence

against the appellant, to which the appellant has made a dock statement denying the

entire incident.

Hence, although the trial judge had misdirected himself on the burden of proof, the

cogency of the said evidence cannot be ignored.

As such, this Court has to seriously consider whether this is a fit case to be sent for a

retrial.

10

This Court is very much aware of the fact that this pertains to an incident which had

taken place in 2001 and the trial has been concluded in 2016 but it would be a

travesty of justice if the appellant is set free upon only the consideration of the

nonapplication of the legal principles by the trial judge.

As such, it is the opinion of this Court that, although much time has passed since

the date of offence, it is nothing but just and fair that the instant matter should be

sent for a retrial.

As such, we set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial judge but

we order that a retrial be held in the instant and we also order that this be concluded

expeditiously without any further delay by the relevant High Court.
