JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (d) and 54(A) (b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for

Possession and Trafficking of 3.78 grams of Heroin (diacetylmorphine) on

11th January 2017.

After trial, the Appellant was found guilty only for the 1st count and the

Learned High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed life imprisonment on the

Appellant on 21/01/2020.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid

19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. The raid is false.

2. No fair investigation.

3. The contradictions inter se and per se not considered.

4. That the manifest false narrative of the raid was not considered.

In this case the raid was conducted in the absence of any specific information

received. The raid was headed by PW1 with seven police officers from the

Crime Prevention Unit of Wellawatta Police Station. All have been named as

witnesses in the indictment including the Government Analyst. The

prosecution had called PW1, PW2, PW5, PW6 and PW8 closed their case. The

Government Analyst report was admitted under Section 420 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. The prosecution marked production

P1-P10.

When the defence was called, the Appellant made a statement from the Dock

closed the defence case.

Background of the case.

On 11/01/2011 IP/Danapala attached to the Crime Prevention Unit

functioned under Wellawatta Police Station had gone for a routine crime

prevention duty with 07 police officers in a van belonging to the said unit.

The team had left the police station at about 09.00am. All officers were clad

in civil dress. Among other items, they had taken sealing and measuring

instruments with them. Firstly, they had gone to Keselwatte police area but

were not successful. As such the team proceeded to Granspass police area

for crime prevention duty. While IP/Danapala was on his way, his private

informant provided information that a person named Chaturanga- clad in

blue coloured pair of shorts and a black tshirt was engaging in selling Heroin

in smaller packets at Pasalwatte, Madampitiya. This information divulged

assisted in conducting a successful raid. The informer had further provided

the details of the location describing it to be a place where the houses were

CA/HCC/198/20

4 | P a g e

demolished. After briefing about the information to all officers in the team,

PW1 had told PW2, PW3 and PW4 to come with him to conduct the raid. All

of them went to the place of raid on foot. Four persons including the

Appellant was seen at the place where the Appellant was arrested. The police

tried to apprehend all persons, but could not apprehend others except the

Appellant. When the Appellant was searched, PW1 had observed a pink

coloured cellophane bag with something in it in the right pocket of the shorts

pocket. PW1 took the parcel into his custody and inspected the same. The

parcel contained 132 small packets with some brown coloured substance.

As it reacted for Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) the Appellant was arrested

immediately. The arresting time was 5.00pm. The Appellant was taken to the

Letchumi Jewellers situated in Kosgas Junction, to weigh the substance. The

Appellant was taken to the Jewellers by PW1 and the three officers to weigh

the substances. The parcel contained 10610 milligrams of substances. After

entering notes, the Appellant and the productions were handed over to the

Grandpass Police Station under PR No.160/2017 at 8.00pm.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden never

shifts. Hence an accused person has no burden to prove his case unless he

pleads a general or a special exception in the Penal Code.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

CA/HCC/198/20

In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states thus:

[1987} 1 SLR 155

"The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence.

His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his

guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in

a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is

well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of

probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond

the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility

in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, of course it is

possible, but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond

reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.

As the appeal grounds raised by the Appellant are inter-related, the grounds

will be considered together in this case.

Probability holds a very important role when it comes to convincing the judge

on a specific point as more the probability of the assumption more will be

chances for the judge to get convinced. Probability, it is of utmost importance

during criminal investigation and is used to assess the significance of various

types of evidence. To accuse someone beyond reasonable doubt it becomes

quintessential to have strong evidence and for the sake of that one has to

make few assumptions to reach certain conclusions, the possibility of these

assumptions to be true is specifically know as principle of probability in legal

terms.

In this case, only 04 police officers had conducted the raid. They had set off

from the police station without any specific information. According to PW1

he had received the information after seven hours of leaving their unit and

the Appellant was arrested at 5.00pm. The Appellant was taken to a jewellery

shop named Letchumi Jewellery at 5.30pm and weighed the substances

which took about two and half hours and the Appellant was produced to

Grandpass Police Station at 8.00pm. The gross quantity said to have

recovered from the Appellant is 10610 milligrams. To weigh this meagre,

amount the police officers had taken two and half hours, which is highly

improbable considering the circumstances of the case.

According to PW1, when he set off for the crime prevention duty on the

11.01.2017, he had taken a Criminal Note Pad, Sealing and Weighing Kit,

his Pistol, and cash Rs.2000/-.When he was questioned as to why he did not

note down the information in the Criminal Note Pad, PW1 had stated that he

did not possess a pad on which he could have written the information. This

is a per se contradiction which certainly impacts adversely in his evidence.

PW1 was the Officer-in-Charge of the Colombo South Crime Prevention Unit

that came under the direct supervision of the Deputy Inspector General of

Colombo and it is a specialized unit to combat crime. As such crime

prevention duty is not restricted to any particular crime, but include all

crimes. With this intention PW1 had taken sealing and weighing Kit along

with them. Instead of using the same, he had gone to a jewellery shop to

weigh the Heroin said to have recovered from the Appellant. When PW1 was

confronted of this point, he had simply said that he did not take the sealing

kit but had taken the measuring kit to measure illicit liquor. This too raises

doubt in the prosecutions case to some extent.

Although the Appellant was arrested at Madampitiya Road, Colombo-14,

where he also resides, PW1 had not taken any meaningful action to search

his house nor common sense approach to investigate the person from whom

he received the Heroin packets for sale. This lethargic attitude of the raiding

CA/HCC/198/20

officers will certainly fail the probability test which certainly favours the

Appellants claim.

The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed by the

prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim

the benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side,

and a Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an

umpire to see that the rules of the game are applied by both sides.

A Judge is an administrator of justice, not merely a figure-head,

he has not only to direct and control the proceedings according to

recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done.

The burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute.

It is often associated with the Latin maxim semper necessitas probandi

incumbit ei qui agit, a translation of which is: "the necessity of proof always

lies with the person who lays charges."

To determine whether you are innocent or guilty, the trial judge must

consider the evidence presented by both sides with an open mind.

In this case the defence suggested to PW1 that the Appellant was not the

person arrested first, a person called Dhamma was arrested first and Heroin

was recovered from a toilet ceiling of an old house situated close to

Dhammas house. The Appellant in his Dock Statement too had taken up the

position that this was an introduction which he never possessed.

PW1, under cross examination vehemently denied the fact that he arrested

a person called Dhamma on that day. According to him on that day he had

only arrested the Appellant and nobody else. The relevant portion of the

evidence is re-produced below:

Learned Counsel for the Appellant, with the permission of the Court filed a

motion on 14.02.2023 and filed a Magistrate Court proceeding in the

Maligakanda Magistrate Court No. 1083/17. A suspect was arrested on

11.01.2017 by PW1 with PW08 for possession of Cannabis Sativa L in the

Police Division of Grandpass and was handed over to Grandpass Police

Station. The production recovered from the suspect was entered under PR

No.161/17 which was the number next to the production number of this

case. But PW1 vehemently denied of arrest another person on that day in

the Grandpass Police area. With the defence taken up by the Appellant,

concealing the arrest of another person for a narcotic offence clearly raise

very serious doubt in the prosecution case.

In this case the raid was conducted without any specific information. The

information pertaining to this case was received while they were going to

Grandpass Police Division. The information was not recorded in the note

book taken by PW1. Further, recovery and weighing the production has failed

to pass the probability test in this case. Further, the defences case had led

to very serious doubt in the prosecutions case. Had the Learned Trial Judge

CA/HCC/198/20

9 | P a g e

looked in to the evidence presented in its correct perspective, he should have

accepted the evidence adduced by the Appellant.

Although the Appellant was arrested on the allegation of trafficking Heroin,

he was acquitted on the count of trafficking and was convicted only for

possession of 3.78 grams of Heroin.

Therefore, considering all the evidence presented in the trial, I conclude that

the appeal grounds advanced by the Appellant have very serious impact on

the prosecutions case.

As the prosecution had failed its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable

doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge of Colombo dated 21/01/2020 on the Appellant. Therefore, he

is acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
