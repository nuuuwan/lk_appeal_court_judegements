Decided on: 31.07.2024

S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

This case has been transmitted to this Court in terms of Section 170 of the Inland

Revenue Act, No.10 of 2006 seeking for an opinion to the questions of law mentioned

in the "case stated" formulated the Tax Appeals Commission established under the Tax

Appeals Commission Act, No.23 of 2011.

The Ceylinco Leasing Corporation Ltd, the Appellant is a limited liability Company

incorporated in Sri Lanka engaged in the business of leasing, hire purchase and earning

rental income. The Appellant submitted its return of income for the year of assessment

2012/2013 and by letter date 23.11.20151 the Deputy Commissioner of the Department

of Inland Revenue informed the Appellant that the return of income was rejected for

the reason that the Appellant remains the owner of the Staana Vaasi Portfolio despite

CLC Asset Management Ltd enjoy the economic benefits accrued on the lease portfolio

due to a Participatory Agreement and considering the fact that the Appellant has

declared lease rentals arising from Staana Vaasi Portfolio in the VAT Return.

Thereafter, the Notice of Assessment dated 27.11.20152 was issued to the Appellant.

By letter dated 23.12.2015, the Appellant made an appeal to the Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue (the Respondent) against the said assessment. The Respondent made

2 at page 338 J of the appeal brief.

his determination confirming the said assessment and communicated the same to the

Appellant by letter dated 15.12.2017.3 Being aggrieved by the said determination, the

Appellant appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission (the TAC) by the Petition dated

14.03.2018. After hearing the appeal, the TAC confirming the determination made by

the Respondent dismissed the appeal and the Appellant was informed the decision of

the TAC by the letter dated 08.12.2021.4

Accordingly, with the view of forming an opinion, in terms of Section 170(6) of the

Act No.10 of 2006, this Court considered the questions of law raised in the "case

stated". The questions of law to which the opinion is sought are as follows:

1. Has the Tax Appeals Commission erred in failing to consider that the Appellant

has derecognised its entitlements to the income of the Sthaana Vaasi Financing

Portfolio (SVF Portfolio) in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards as

more fully described in Item 1.10.2 if the Accounting Policies of the Financial

Statements of the Appellant for the year ended 31st March 2013?

2. Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in failing to consider as to whether

there had been a sale as contemplated by law of the income entitlement of the

SVF Portfolio from the Appellant to CLC Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd?

3. Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in determining that the entitlement

to the income of the SVF Portfolio remained with the Appellant for the purpose

3 at page 338 d of the appeal brief.

4 at page 432 of the appeal brief.

4

of determining the profit and income of the Appellant for the year of assessment

2012/2013?

4. Was the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue estopped from determining

the appeal against the Appellant on the basis of the determination for the year of

assessment 2013/2014 on the identical issue being determined in favour of the

Appellant?

5. Has the Tax Appeals Commission erred in law in failing to consider whether

any determination which results in the entitlement to the SVF Portfolio

remaining with the Appellant would give rise to double taxation on the income

since such income was also recognised by CLC Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd?

The questions of law are addressed by this Court as follows.

1. Has the Tax Appeals Commission erred in failing to consider that the Appellant

has derecognised its entitlements to the income of the Sthaana Vaasi Financing

Portfolio (SVF Portfolio) in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standards as

more fully described in Item 1.10.2 of the Accounting Policies of the Financial

Statements of the Appellant for the year ended 31st March 2013?

The Appellant submits that it has derecognized its entitlements to the income of the

Sthaana Vaasi Financing Portfolio (SVF Portfolio) in accordance with the Sri Lanka

Accounting Standards as described in Item 1.10.25 of the Accounting Policies of the

5 at page 261 of the appeal brief.

5

Financial Statements of the Appellant for the financial year ended 31st March 2013 and

considered the SVF Portfolios as Finance Leasing Facilities since the lands and

buildings were sold by the Appellant Company on finance lease terms. As provided,

the legal definition of a lease is a written agreement in which the owner of property

(either real estate or some object like an automobile) allows to use of the property for a

specified period of time (term) for specific periodic payments (rent), and other

conditions.

However, the Tax Appeal Commission (the TAC) has held that the SVF Portfolios

are not Finance Leasing Facilities, but Operating Lease Stock/Facilities granted by

the Appellant on the basis that the Appellant retains the ownership of the assets. Also,

even if the SVF Portfolio is considered as Finance Leasing Facilities, the lease rentals

collected by the lessor (Appellant) should be regarded as income according to the

accounting treatment for finance lease facilities. The position of the Respondent is that

the Appellant (lessor) shall recognize assets held under a finance lease in their statement

of financial position and present them as receivables at an amount equal to the net

investment in the lease. As per the tax treatment for Finance Lease Facilities, even in a

finance leasing portfolio, the lease rentals are treated as part and parcel of the profits

and income of the lessor, and liable for both VAT and Tax purposes of the lessor. This

Court is in agreement with the said view of the Respondent that even if the SVF

Portfolio is to be considered as a Finance Lease Facility, the lease rentals collected by

the lessor is regarded as income of the Appellant.

6

In terms of Sri Lankan Accounting Standard LKAS 32 Financial Instruments

Presentation, a financial asset is defined as an asset, inter alia, to receive cash or

another financial asset from another entity. The Appellant contends that the SVF

Portfolio has been derecognized as a financial asset in the Statement of Financial

Position6 for the year of assessment 2012/2013. However, this Court agrees with the

determination of the Respondent and the determination of the TAC for the reasons that

even though the assets have been derecognized in the Statement of Financial Position,

the Appellant being the lessor of the properties under lease agreements, has retained the

ownership of the assets while the lessees of such properties are in possession.

E. Gooneratne states, in his work titled Income Tax in Sri Lanka7: that

Evidence that a particular practice has been followed in preparing the

accounts of a trader has no value if that practice conflicts with any of the

provisions in the taxing statute.

Even if the Appellant has derecognized the SVF Portfolio in its financial statements,

the Appellant had continued to have the ownership of the assets and all the risks are

still vested on the Appellant. Therefore, the Court is of the view that the Assessor is

justifiable in attributing the income accrued by the SVF Portfolio to the Appellant and

accordingly, the TAC also did not err in affirming the decision of the CGIR on the

6 at page 261 of the appeal brief.

7 M. Weerasooriya and E. Gooneratne, Income Tax in Sri Lanka, Second Edition, 2009. at p.522

above matter. The Court answer the first question of law in the negative and favour of

the Respondent.

2. Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in failing to consider as to whether

there had been a sale as contemplated by law of the income entitlement of the

SVF Portfolio from the Appellant to CLC Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd?

The contention of the Appellant is that income entitlement of the SVF Portfolio has

already been transferred to CLC Asset Management by the Participation Agreement

and submitted that in terms of Clause 1(a)(i) of the Participation Agreement, the sales

agreement has been concluded. Clause 1(a)(i) of the Participation Agreement reads as

follows.

Clause 1(a)(i) The Seller does hereby sell to the Participant a 100%

entitlement (each, a "Participation") in the Sthana Vaasi Financing (as

hereinafter defined) which shall for the avoidance of doubt include the amounts

due or to become due thereunder, for the purchase price therefore (the

"Purchase Price"), and such other details as the Seller deems appropriate.

The position of the Appellant is that in terms of the above Clause, 100% income

entitlement of the SVF Portfolio has been sold by the Appellant and, hence there has

been a sale effected under the Participation Agreement, any income under SVF

portfolio should not be considered as an income of the Appellant. The TAC and the

8

Respondent held a contrary view to that the Appellant has entered into a financing

arrangement to obtain funds from CLC Asset Management and the rentals collected

from obligators has been utilized to pay back the liability the Appellant had towards

CLC Asset Management. As per Clause 5 (Sellers rights and duties) and Schedule No.

2 (Administration and Management) of the Agreement, the Appellant Company has all

the rights and authority in respect of any participation (the SVF Portfolio) and as per

Clause 3, the right to collection of due rentals from obligators also kept with the

Appellant. Further, as per Clause 7 of the Agreement in sub paragraph (a) reads as;

The participant shall be made all payments in Sri Lankan Rupees in immediately

available funds, to such account of the seller in such location as the seller may

designate, without deduction, setoff or counterclaim.. Therefore, it has been held that

the Appellant had obtained funds from CLC Asset Management and settled the funds

granted with the collected rentals from Obligators and Guarantors and hence, the

Appellant has continued to be benefitted from the income from the SVF Portfolio.

In Union Planters National Bank of Memphis v. United States8, the Sixth Circuit it is

stated that,

In cases where the legal characterization of economic facts is decisive, the

principle is well established that the tax consequences should be determined by

8 426 F.2d 115 (6th Cir. 1970)

9

the economic substance of the transaction, not the labels put on it for property

law (or tax avoidance) purposes.

When considering the above stated provisions in the Participation Agreement, it is clear

that the TAC has carefully considered and evaluated the evidence before it when

arriving at its decision. Therefore, this Court agrees with the conclusion of the TAC

that there has been no sale of the SVF Portfolio from the Appellant to CLC Asset

Management (Pvt) Ltd for the reason that the Appellant has continued to be benefitted

from SVF portfolio and utilized the collected rentals to set off the funds that has been

granted by CLC Asset Management.

Under the above said circumstances, my opinion is that the TAC also did not err in

affirming the decision of the CGIR on the above matter. I answer the second question

of law in the negative and in favour of the Respondent.

3. Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in determining that the entitlement to

the income of the SVF Portfolio remained with the Appellant for the purpose of

determining the profit and income of the Appellant for the year of assessment

2012/2013?

This question of law considers whether the income of the SVF Portfolio could be

considered as profit and income of the Appellant. The Appellant argues that, no profit

or income was generated after the right to receive economic benefits from the Staana

Vaasi Portfolio was sold to the CLC Assets Management and for the reason that the

10

Appellant carried on the business does not amount him to be liable to pay income tax

under Section 3 of the Act as the Appellant is not entitled on such income. The TAC in

its determination considering Section 3 of the Act, has concluded that the Appellant is

the one who carries on the business and the relationship with the CLC Assets

Management is a financial arrangement and therefore the Appellant is liable to pay

income tax on the lease rentals collected by them.

Now the question to be considered is whether the lease rentals collected by the

Appellant could be considered as profits and income earned by the Appellant from

the business within the ambit of Section 3 (a) of the Act. Section 3 (a) reads thus,

3. For the purpose of this Act, profits and income or profits or income

means

c) the profits from any trade, business, profession or vocation for

however short a period carried on or exercised;

The Stana Vaasi Portforlio is a portfolio of land and buildings sold by the Appellant on

finance lease terms where customers buy the properties by the payment of monthly

lease rentals and final payments to transfer the ownership of the property at the end of

the lease period. The Appellant by the Participation Agreement (Clause 1(a)(i)) had

agreed to sell 100% entitlement of the SVF Portfolio to CLC Assets Management,

however, the Appellant remains the owner of the SVF Portfolio. Moreover, in terms of

the Participation Agreement, Sthaana Vaasi Portfolio also entitles the Seller to receive

from Obligators the lease rentals and/or rents relating to the properties until the

11

properties are transferred to the Obligators and the right to collect the lease rentals

from the Obligators or Guarantors lies with the Appellant. The Appellant had paid back

the lease rentals so collected to settle the funds granted by the CLC Assets Management.

TAC in its determination has observed as follows, Accordingly, it can be seen that the

Contracts of the Leases between the Appellant and the respective lessees exist without

any change. Therefore, the Appellant was bound to adhere to the respective agreements

made with the lessees of the assets which were still under lease agreements. Therefore,

it is clear that, the Appellant being the lessor of the properties under lease agreements,

should retain the ownership of the assets while the lessees of such properties are in the

possession of such assets. Under the lease agreements, the authority to collect the lease

rentals from the customers of SVF Portfolio imposed on the Appellant as the lessor.

The Appellant also was under obligation to transfer of the ownership of immovable

property to the obligator after specified periods of time, subject to the full payment of

lease rentals. Under these circumstances, the Appellant Company is the person who

carried on the business. It is obvious that, under the provisions of the Inland Revenue

Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended, the income tax liability is on the person who carries

on the business.

In Sri Lankan Airlines Limited vs. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue9 Dr.

Ruwan Fernando, J. observed that, it is necessary for the assessor to ascertain and

9 CA/TAX/0002/2010 CA Minutes dated 28.02.2023.

12

identify the source of income for the purposes of determining the profits and income

chargeable with income tax, and the rates applicable to such source of income.

As mentioned hereinbefore the TAC has correctly identified the sources of income of

the Appellant for the purpose of determining the profit. Even though the right to

entitlement for the economic benefits derived by the SVF Portfolio has been sold to

CLC Assets Management by the participation agreement, the Appellant remains the

legal owner of the SVF Portfolio. Therefore, the lease rentals collected by the Appellant

become part and parcel of the profit of the Appellant.

Hence, the Court is of the opinion the view that the Assessor is correct in attributing

the income accrued by the SVF Portfolio to the Appellant and accordingly, the TAC

also did not err in affirming the decision of the CGIR on the above matter. The Court

answer the third question of law in the negative and in favour of the Respondent.

4. Was the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue estopped from determining

the appeal against the Appellant on the basis of the determination for the year of

assessment 2013/2014 on the identical issue being determined in favour of the

Appellant?

The Respondent has determined (the Annexture) in favour of the Appellant on the

issue whether the rentals collected from Obligators and Guarantors under SVF Portfolio

for the 2014/2015 financial year and held that the Appellant Company has transferred

13

all of its entitlements including risks and rewards (economic benefits) of ownership to

CLC Asset Management with effect from the date of the Participation Agreement.

Further, the Respondent in response to the contention of the Appellant the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue binds by his previous decisions, argues that

the annual income tax and the decision given in a particular year of assessment does

not have a binding effect on another year of assessment. The determination of TAC in

the subsequent case bearing No. TAC/IT/058/2019 filed by the Appellant in this case

citing the case of Abdul Gaffor Vs CIT10, the TAC and the Respondent has concluded

that in matters of recurring annual tax, a decision of the Appeal with regard to one year

cannot operate as res judicata in respect of an assessment of another year and refused

to accept the contention of the Appellant.

It is the view of this Court that the general rule that has been applied over many years

is that the principle of estoppel does not apply in respect of an identical issue in different

financial years and the doctrine of res judicata is not applicable in tax matters. The

principle underlying is that no one should present same set of facts differently to reach

different conclusions in different financial years. The Appellant relying on the decision

of Radhasoami Satsang Vs Commissioner of Inland Revenue11 argues in the Written

Submissions dated 30.10.2022 that the subsequent determination of the CGIR for the

year of assessment 2014/2015 estoppes the CGIR from determining the matter

10 3CT 96.

11 1991 Indlaw SC 948

14

differently for the financial year 2012/2013. In Radhasoami Satsang case (Supra), the

Supreme Court observed that,

We are aware of the fact that strictly speaking res judicata does not apply to

income tax proceedings. Again, each assessment year being a unit, what is

decided in one year may not apply in the following year but where a

fundamental aspect permeating through the different assessment years has been

found as a fact one way or the other and parties have allowed that position to

be sustained by not challenging the order, it would not be at all appropriate to

allow the position to be changed in a subsequent year.

However, in Instalment Supply (Pvt.) Ltd12 the Supreme Court of India held that in tax

matters there is no question of res judicata because each year's assessment is final only

for that year and does not apply later years. Hence, this Court does not accept the

position that the determination of the Respondent for the subsequent year estoppes the

Respondent from determining the case related to this Appeal in contrary and does not

create a retrospective effect of a pre-determined matter.

For the reasons enumerated above, the decision of the Tax Appeals Commission to

confirm the determination made by the Respondent and to dismiss the appeal of the

Appellant is according to law.

12 AIR 1962 SC 53

15

Therefore, the Court answer the fourth question of law in the negative and in favour of

the Respondent.

5. Has the Tax Appeals Commission erred in law in failing to consider whether

any determination which results in the entitlement to the SVF Portfolio

remaining with the Appellant would give rise to double taxation on the income

since such income was also recognised by CLC Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd?

The Appellant has submitted in its Written Submissions that the determination of the

Respondent would give rise to double taxation of the income since CLC Asset

Management would have recognized the income from SVF Portfolio in its financial

statements and would have duly paid tax on such lease rentals collected by the

Appellant on behalf of the CLC Asset Management. Even though double taxation is a

fundamental principle in tax law, the Appellant has neither raised that issue before the

Respondent or the TAC nor established his position by providing evidence. In terms of

TAC Act, the Court of Appeal has the power to determine questions of law before it,

and the substantial matters should be decided by the CGIR and TAC. In the case of

Cargills Agrifoods Ltd Vs Commissioner General of Inland Revenue13 Samarakoon, J.

observed that,

13 CA/Tax/0006/2013 CA Minutes dated 28.02.2023

16

The section 7(1) of the Tax Appeal Commission Act in two places, speaks about

the determination of the appeal. Hence, an appeal has to be determined

by the Tax Appeals Commission, which means the determination of the

substantial question, with regard to the tax, etc.

Samarakoon, J. further stated that,

What shall the Court of Appeal do when it receives such a case stated? Section

11A. (6) says,

11A. (6) Any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may hear and

determine any question of law arising on the stated case and may in

accordance with the decision of the Court upon such question, confirm,

reduce, increase or annul the assessment determined by the

Commission, or may remit the case to the Commission with the opinion

of the Court, thereon. Where a case is so remitted by the Court, the

Commission shall revise the assessment in accordance with the opinion

of the Court.

Hence, any two or more Judges of the Court of Appeal may,

(i) determine any question of law arising on the stated case, it does not

say may determine the determination of the Commission.

17

(ii) confirm, reduce, increase or annul the assessment determined by the

Commission,

(iii) or may remit the case to the Commission with the opinion of the Court,

thereon.

This may or may not be on the determination of the Commission, because the

term thereon refers to any question of law arising on the stated case.

(a) there can be a case stated on a question of law other than the

determination of the Commission on tax,

(b) the Court has power to remit the case to the Commission, with its

opinion on the question of law so arose and

(c) the Commission shall, on receiving such an opinion of the Court, revise

the assessment of the assessor.

Further, in the case of Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs Janashakthi

Insurance Company Limited14, Malalgoda, J. observed that,

As already observed by me, there are specific provisions in the TAC Act which

governs the process before the TAC as well as a case stated before the Court of

Appeal. In the said process, much importance has been given for identification

of the questions of law that is to be considered in the case stated by making

provisions for the TAC to reconsider the question that are submitted by the

14 SC Appeal No. 114/2019, SC Minutes dated 26.06.2020

18

Appellant and two Judges to consider them once again and referred it back to

TAC to reconsider them.

To determine whether the determination of the Respondent and TAC amounts to double

taxation, the Appellant should have produced evidence before the Respondent and the

burden of proof lies with the Appellant. This Court is not supposed to consider the

questions of facts but not questions of law. Since the Appellant has failed to raise this

matter before the Respondent and produce evidence to establish its position there is no

question of law for this Court to consider in terms of TAC Act, and hence I answer the

fifth question of law in the negative and in favour of the Respondent.

For the reasons, enumerated in this judgment, I hold that the decision of the Tax

Appeals Commission to affirm the determination of the Respondent and dismiss the

appeal is according to law.

Conclusion & Opinion of the Court

Under such circumstances, I answer the questions of law in favour of the Respondent

and against the Appellant as follows:

1. No

2. No

3. No

4. No

5. No

19

For those reasons mentioned in this judgment and subject to our observations, I affirm

the determination made by the Tax Appeals Commission dated 08.12.2021 and dismiss

the Appeal. The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a certified copy of this

judgment to the Tax Appeals Commission forthwith.
