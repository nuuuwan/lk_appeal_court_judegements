S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner to this Writ Application was commissioned in the Sri Lanka Army as a

Second Lieutenant and posted to the Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment. On 24.07.2019 he

and other two Army men were arrested by the Military Police while smoking a cigar

consisting of cannabis. Consequent to that incident, they were charge-sheeted for

committing two offences under the Army Act, No. 17 of 1949 (the Act) by the

commandant of the relevant Regimental Centre in which the Petitioner served. The

alleged two charges against the Petitioner were briefly as follows;

1. By using Cannabis, the Petitioner had committed an offence punishable under

Section 102(1) of the Act

2. By using Cannabis, he had behaved in an unsuitable way as a commissioned

officer and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 129(1) of

the Act.

At the summary trial held, the Petitioner pleaded guilty to both charges consequently,

he was reprimanded and severely reprimanded for two charges respectively. After

continuing the service in the Army, the Petitioner applied for the promotion to the rank

of Lieutenant and, prior to applying for the said promotion in or about July 2020, he

was informed verbally by the then Center Commandant of the Vijayabahu Infantry

Regiment that the 2nd Respondent had made a decision to withdraw his commission, to

which the Petitioner forwarded a Redress of Grievance (RoG) (marked as P4) to the

6

Commander of Army, the 1st Respondent. In regards to the RoG of the Petitioner, he

was summoned before a Board consisting of seven high-ranking Officers referred to as

the Army Selection Board No. 2 in September 2020 where he was questioned about the

aforesaid incident. The position of the Petitioner is that the decision of the Board was

never communicated to him. Thereafter, the Regiment that he was attached to was

instructed by the letter dated 18.05.2021 marked as P6 by the Centre Commandant of

the Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment to take action to withdraw the commission of the

Petitioner with effect from 31.07.2021 after recovering from him a sum of Rs.

1,000,000/- being the bond value entered by the Petitioner when he joined the Army.

The Petitioner states that the decision to withdraw the commission and dismiss him

from the Army was officially informed to him by a letter dated 19.05.2021, signed by

the 8th Respondent marked as P11. Consequent to the said decision, his salary for July

2021 was withheld/suspended.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner argues that in terms of Regulation 37 of the

Army Officers Service Regulations (Regular Force) 1992 (marked as P12), other than

His Excellency the President, no authority could persuade, require or induce an Officer

to retire or resign his commission, further that and under Section 39 of the said

Regulation an Officer may be called upon to retire or resign his commission for

misconduct or in any circumstances which in the opinion of H. E. the President, require

such action, such Officer may request an interview with the Secretary of Defence for

an opportunity to state his case. He further argues that the power to

7

cashier/dismiss/discharge an Officer is exclusively vested with a Court Martial under

Section 47 read with Section 133 of the Act and the decision to discharge the

commission of the Petitioner by P6 and P11 is an absolute nullity.

In that scenario, the Petitioner in this Writ application seeks the following substantive

reliefs, inter alia,

(g) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision

and/ or determination of the 1st and 2nd Respondents or any one of them to withdraw

the commission of the Petitioner referred to in the letters marked "P6" and "P 11"

and/or the letters therein referred to;

(h) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision

and/or determination of the 1st and 2nd Respondents or any one of them to

cashier/dismiss / discharge / remove the Petitioner from the Sri Lanka Army

reflected and/or disclosed in the letters marked "P6" and "P11" and/or the letters

therein referred to;

(i) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision

and/or determination and/or recommendation to withdraw the commission of the

Petitioner or to implement the decision of the 2nd Respondent, made by the Army

Selection Board No. 2 comprised of the 3rd to 5th Respondents and the parties to be

added as the 5A, 5B, 5C and 5D Respondents;

8

(j) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition on the Respondents

or any one or more of them prohibiting such Respondent / Respondents from

cashiering or dismissing or discharging or removing the Petitioner from the Sri

Lanka Army for the offences enumerated in the Charge-Sheet marked "P2" for which

the Petitioner has already been punished at a Summary Trial.

The position of the Respondents is that the Army Board No.3 convened on 06.05.2020

regarding the Promotion to the rank of Lieutenant and career progression, did not

recommend the Petitioner for the promotion to the rank of Lieutenant but recommended

to withdraw his commission, considering the earlier conviction for smoking a cigar

which considered cannabis. This decision was conveyed to the Center Commandant of

the Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment by letter dated 03.07.2020 (marked as R1) which

requested that the Petitioner be informed about the said Board decision. The

Respondents state that consequent to the RoG forwarded by the Petitioner, he was

granted an opportunity to present his grievances before the Army Review Board in

respect of Officers recommended to be retired from the Army due to AWOL and

Disciplinary Reasons, where the said Board decided to uphold the decision of the

Army Board No.3. The said decision was informed to the Center Commandant of the

Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment by letter dated 02.03.2021 (marked as R2) requesting to

inform the same to the Petitioner. However, the Petitioner argues that he was neither

summoned before the Army Board No.3 nor informed about the said recommendation

and the said Board had no authority whatsoever to recommend his commission to be

9

withdrawn. The Respondents deny the allegation of the Petitioner that he was not

officially informed of the decision to withdraw his commission and state that once an

administrative decision is taken with regards to an Officer, it is the standard procedure

to inform the said decision to his/her respective Regiment to take necessary action and

convey the decision to the Officer concerned.

The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argues that neither the Commander of

the Army nor any Board appointed by him has authority whatsoever to withdraw the

Petitioners commission and the power to withdraw the commission of the Petitioner is

vested with the President under Regulation 37 and therefore the decision to discharge

the commission of the Petitioner as mentioned in P6 and P11 is unlawful, illegal,

arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair, irrational and ultra vires the statutory powers. The

learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner further argues that even a Court Martial

cannot award punishments to an Officer mentioned in Section 133 (1) of the Act

including cashiering and dismissal from the Army for the reason that Section 58(c) of

the Act stipulates that a Court Martial shall not try a person who has been dealt with

summarily for an offence by his Commanding Officer or the Commander of the Army

or by any Officer of a rank not below that of Colonel, authorized in that behalf by the

Commander of the Army. Unless an Officer is discharged by a Court Martial, it is

apparent from Regulation 37 that only His Excellency the President has the power to

induce an Officer to retire or resign from his Commission. Regulation 37 reads as

follows;

10

37. No authority other than the President shall require, persuade, or induce an

officer to retire or resign his commission.

When considering the document marked R1, it is apparent that the Petitioner has been

summoned before the Army Board No. 3 and the Board has recommended to discharge

of the commission of the Petitioner and the Army Commander has approved the same.

However, no document has been placed before this Court to show that the approval of

the President has been granted in respect of the withdrawal of Petitioners commission.

The position of the learned DSG appearing for the Respondent is that before taking

further steps to obtain the approval of the President to withdraw the Commission of the

Petitioner he has filed this Writ Application and therefore the 1st Respondent was

prevented from getting approval of the President even though it has already been sent

to the Secretary of the Ministry of Defence.

P6 states thus,

The letter marked P11 written to the Petitioner titled withdrawal of commission and

payment of the bond reads thus;

As instructed by the vide ref ltr, hereby instructed you to pay the bond amount of

1,000,000 Rupees and hand over the deposit slip to this HQ before 21 May 2021

prior to the withdrawal of your commission on 31 July 2021.

It is apparent from the documents marked as P6 and P11 that, the Respondents had

decided to withdraw the commission of the Petitioner even before obtaining the

approval of the President. Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions Vs. Minister

for the Civil Service1 defines illegality as follows,

By illegality as a ground for judicial review, I mean that the decision-maker

must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and

must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable question

to be decided, in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, by whom the

judicial power of the state is exercisable.

In Francis Vs. Municipal Council of Kuala Lumpur2 where the plaintiff in that case was

employed by the Defendant Municipal Council as a clerk. The Council purported to

dismiss him. This dismissal was held to be ultra vires because in terms of the Ordinance

in which the Council is established the power to dismiss the plaintiff is not vested with

the Council but with its President.

In Kotakadeniya Vs. Kodithuwakku and Others3 where the Inspector General of Police

transferred the Petitioner who is a Senior Deputy Inspector-General of Police when the

power to transfer him is vested with the Public Service Commission, this Court held

that the Inspector General has no power or authority to transfer a S/DIG and the decision

is ultra vires.

In Gunaratne Vs. Chandrananda de Silva4 where a Senior Deputy Inspector-General of

Police had been placed on compulsory leave by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence

when the authority to do so was vested in the Public Service Commission (PSC), held

that the powers given to the PSC regarding disciplinary control had not been delegated

and therefore, the decision to place the Petitioner on compulsory leave has to be

considered as a personal decision of the PSC. Gunawardena, J. held that,

In these circumstances, therefore, the decision taken in this case, to place the

petitioner on compulsory leave, is a nullity or ultra vires and has no legal effect.

It is appropriate here to refer to the passage that was cited by learned President's

counsel for the petitioner from Wade and Forsyth Administrative Law, 7th

edition, page 43 Any administrative act or order which is ultra vires or outside

jurisdiction is void in law, ie deprived of legal effect. This is because in order to

be valid it needs statutory authorisation, and if it is not within the powers given

by the Act, it has no legal leg to stand on. The court will then quash it or declare

it to be unlawful or prohibit any action to enforce it.

Further, in that case, Gunawardena, J. observed that,

it is an inflexible and deep rooted principle of law that no act or decision which

is void at its inception can ever be ratified ... statutory power must be exercised

only by the body or officer in whom it has been reposed or confided unless sub

delegation of the power is authorized by express words or Necessary Implication

... one cannot act or decide on his own account when in fact one is devoid of

power to so act or decide and seek to validate that act or decision thereafter under

the colour of the concept of ratification.

When considering the above-stated facts and circumstances of the case at hand in the

light of the authorities mentioned, it is evident that the Respondents have decided to

withdraw the commission of the Petitioner as reflected in the documents marked as P6

and P11 without having the decision-making power taking into hand the powers of the

H. E. the President, who have the exclusive power to retire or resign the commission of

14

an Officer. The view of this Court is therefore that the decision to withdraw the

commission of the Petitioner reflected in P6 and P11 is illegal, arbitrary and ultra vires

the Regulation 37 of the Army Officers Service Regulations (Regular Force) 1992.

Considering all the above-stated facts this Court is of the view that the Petitioner is

entitled to the reliefs sought in the prayers (g) to (j) in the Petition. Therefore, the reliefs

sought in those prayers are granted. No costs ordered.

Application allowed.
