The learned Quazi of Negombo had issued notice to the Respondent to her address, bearing assessment No. 420/6, Shantha Lasaras Road, Periyamulla, Negombo requesting her to be present before the Quazi on 19-08-2017. When the matter was mentioned on 19-08-2017, the Respondent informed the learned Quazi that she had filed another Application before the learned Quazi of Colombo and requested the learned Quazi of Negombo to grant a good decision at his best. When the learned Quazi of Negombo was satisfied that he had jurisdiction to entertain the said Application, he issued notices to the Petitioner and the Respondent requesting them to be present on 16-09-2017. Since the Respondent was not present, once again the learned Quazi issued notice on the respondent returnable on 30-09-2017. In these circumstances, the Quazi of Negombo, on 25-11-2017 permitted the Petitioner to pronounce Talaq on the Respondent and ordered the Petitioner to pay the Respondent a sum of Rs. 30,000/- as Idda maintenance. Accordingly, after three months from the date of the pronouncement of Talaq, the pronouncement of Talaq was registered on 26-02-2018.",
