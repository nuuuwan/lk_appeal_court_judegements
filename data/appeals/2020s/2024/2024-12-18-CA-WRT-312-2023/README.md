JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Petitioner instituted this application by petition dated 08.06.2023 seeking inter alia a

Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision contained in the Documents marked as P2 and P16

(d) and prohibiting Respondents from taking further steps in relation to gratuity.

The facts of this case are briefly as follows:

The Petitioner, Lanka Milk Foods (CWE) Ltd is a company engaged in the production and

distribution of dairy products which is duly incorporated under the Companies Act No. 7 of

2007. The Petitioner states that the 5th Respondent joined the Petitioner Company on 1st

June 2005 as a Sales Representative and worked in the same position until his termination

on 28.01.2019.

The Petitioner states that, between September 2018 and January 2019, the Petitioner

received various complaints about the misappropriation of Company money and/or goods and

fraudulent practices engaged by the Area Sales Managers, Distribution Agents and Sales

Representatives. Upon inquiries, it was revealed that the 5th Respondent also had aided and

abetted such fraudulent activities.

The Petitioner further states that while the investigations were ongoing, the 5th Respondent

submitted a letter on 31.12.2018 marked P8 to the Director Operations of the Company

stating that K.A.P.K. Kularathne, the Acting Field Sales Manager also the Area Sales

Manager of the Company committed the fraudulent acts and/or the misappropriations over

a period of time and sought that the officers who have been involved in such fraudulent

activities be punished.

4

The Petitioner avers that thereafter, investigations were initiated which revealed that the

5th Respondent has aided and abetted the fraudulent activities during the time period he was

working under the said Area Manager. On these grounds, the Petitioner terminated the

service of the 5th Respondent by letter dated 28.01.2019 marked as P3.

The Petitioner avers that subsequent to the investigations, it was revealed that the value of

total loss incurred to the Petitioner due to the fraudulent activities of the said group of

employees including the 5th Respondent amounts to Rs. 20,102,187.03.

The Petitioner further states that the value of such misappropriation as stated in the said

letter marked P8 was corroborated by the letter marked P7 sent by the Owner of Sanduni

Distributors.

The Petitioner has lodged complaints in the Criminal Investigation Department and the

Crimes Division of the Mahabage Police Station against the said group of employees

including the 5th Respondent for criminal breach of trust, criminal misappropriation, fraud,

and undue enrichment on 16.08.2019.

The 5th Respondent has made an application to the Labour Commissioner in terms of the

Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983 as amended (hereinafter referred to as the Gratuity

Act) to determine the quantum of gratuity payable by the Petitioner. On 17.09.2019, the

Petitioner received a Notice signed by the 4th Respondent requesting the Petitioner to

participate in an inquiry on 02.10.2019 based on the allegation of non-payment of gratuity to

which a representative of the Petitioner company participated and submitted the requested

documents.

By letter dated 14.10.2019, the Petitioner informed the 1st to 4th Respondents that all the

necessary documents have been tendered to them on their request, and according to the law,

5

the issue on forfeiture should be canvassed in the Labour Tribunal therefore, requested the

Respondents to direct the 5th Respondent to file an application in the Labour Tribunal.

The Petitioner states that several correspondences were exchanged between the Petitioner

and the Respondents among which the letter dated 04.03.2020 marked P16(d) sent by the 4th

Respondent notified the Petitioner to deposit an amount of Rs. 281,385/- as gratuity payable

to the 5th Respondent. Further, to the utter dismay of the Petitioner, by letter dated

10.11.2022 marked as P2, the 2nd Respondent conveyed its decision that the 1st to 4th

Respondents have the jurisdiction to conduct the said inquiry. Further, it was held that the

forfeiture of gratuity of the 5th Respondent is wrongful, therefore, the 1st to 4th Respondents

would resort to legal actions against the Petitioner. Thereafter, the Res issued a Certificate

dated 20.01.2023 in terms of Section 8(1) of the said Act to the Learned magistrate of

Welisara. The Learned Magistrate of Welisara issued summons against the Petitioner for

bearing Case No. 7536/23 requiring the Petitioner to appear before the Court for the alleged

non-payment of gratuity on 09.05.2023.

The main gravamen of the Petitioner is that the decision contained in the documents marked

as P2 and P16(d) is illegal and ultra vires.

In this context, the Petitioner invokes the writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking a writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision contained in the documents marked as P2 and P16(d) on the

basis that since the 5th Respondent was terminated for misappropriation of funds of the

employer and particular gratuity was forfeited by the Petitioner.

Before going into the questions of law, this Court focuses on what basis gratuity is awarded

as broadly discussed in several judicial pronouncements.

6

In Independent Industrial and Commercial Employees Union (on behalf of P.T. Fernando) v.

Board of Directors, Co-operative Wholesale Establishment, Colombo 74 NLR 344 at 349 His

Lordship Alles J held that:

The word gratuity is used in common parlance as a retirement benefit available for

long and meritorious service rendered by the employee. A gratuity has now become a

legitimate claim, which a workman can make and which may be the subject of an

industrial dispute, and is intended to help a workman after his retirement, whether

the retirement is due to the rules of superannuation or physical disability or

otherwise. It is a benefit which an employee who has worked faithfully and loyally for

his employer can look forward to in the evening of his life and which a generous and

conscientious employer considers it just and equitable to offer for loyal and

meritorious service.

In The National Union of Workers v. The Scottish Ceylon Tea Company Limited 78 NLR 133

at 173, His Lordship Sharvananda J (as he was then) held that:

Now, what is the connotation of the word gratuity as used in Section 31B (1) (b) and

33(1) ( e) of the Industrial Disputes Act? The primary meaning of gratuity is that it

is a gift of money in addition to salary or wages voluntarily made to a retiring

employee for services rendered by him. This imports the conception of a gift or boon

otherwise described as ex gratia payment. In industrial law, this meaning has

undergone a fundamental change in its attribute of voluntariness. Gratuity can no

longer be regarded as an ex gratia payment or merely as a matter of boon.

Further held at page 174,

7

The granting of bonuses, gratuity, pension and the like to employees today is not out

of charity. They are given in order to make the employees more contented and to

enable them to have a sense of satisfaction and security without being always on the

brink of insecurity about their future.. However, long and faithful or meritorious

service is a condition precedent to the award of gratuity; for, gratuity still remains a

reward for faithful service rendered for a fairly substantial period.

Further at page 178,

It is manifest that the word gratuity has thus come to mean not only retiring

allowance or retiral benefit payable on retirement, but also terminal benefit payable

on termination of a long and faithful service consequent to resignation prior to retiring

age.

Further held at page 179,

In my considered view, a workman becomes entitled to payment of gratuity on hi

resignation or premature retirement also, provided he had rendered faithful service

for a considerable period.

This dictum was referred to by His Lordship Chief Justice De Silva in De Costa v. ANZ

Grindlays Bank Plc. (1996) 1 SLR 307.

The concept of gratuity therefore is a benefit granted to a workman by the employer

subsequent to the cessation of his services, to support the post-retirement era of such

workman as a plaudit for the faithful and meritorious service.

The concept of gratuity as a retirement benefit has been given legal recognition by the

introduction of Part IVA of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 by Amendment Act

8

No. 62 of 1957. Section 31B (1) is also included in the said Part IVA of the IDA which reads

as follows:

31 B. (1) A workman or a trade union on behalf of a workman who is a member of

that union, may make an application in writing to a labour tribunal for relief or

redress in respect of any of the following matters:-

(a)..

(b) the question whether any gratuity or other benefits are due to him from his

employer on termination of his services and the amount of such gratuity and

the nature and extent of any such benefits;

(c) .

In 1983, the prime legislation relating to gratuity was introduced which is the Payment of

Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983.

According to the said Act, Sections 5(1) and 6(2) deal with who is liable to pay gratuity and

how the gratuity is calculated respectively which read as follows:

5.(1) Every employer who employs or has employed fifteen or more workmen on any

day during the period of twelve months immediately preceding the termination of the

services of a workman in any industry shall, on termination (whether by the employer

or workman, or on retirement or by the death of the workman, or by operation of law,

or otherwise) of the services at any time after the coming into operation of this Act, of

a workman who has a period of service of not less than five completed years under

that employer, pay to that workman in respect of such services, and where the

termination is by the death of that workman, to his heirs, a gratuity computed in

9

accordance with the provisions of this Part within a period of thirty days of such

termination.

6. (2) A workman referred to in subsection. (1) of section 5 shall be entitled to receive

as gratuity, a sum equivalent to-

(a) half a month's, wage or salary for each year of completed service computed

at the rate of wage or salary last drawn by the workman, in the case of a

monthly rated workman; and

(b) in the case of any other workman, fourteen days' wage or salary for, each

year of completed service computed at the rate of wage or salary last drawn by

that workman:

Provided, however that, in the case of a piece rated workman the daily wage or salary

shall be , computed by dividing the total wage or salary received by him for a period

of three months immediately preceding the termination of his employment, by the

number of days worked by him in that period.

Further, another section was introduced where the employer can forfeit the gratuity.

According to Section 13 of the Gratuity Act, which reads as follows:

Any workman, to whom a gratuity is payable under Part II of this Act and, whose

services have been terminated for reasons of fraud, misappropriation of funds of the

employer, willful damage to property of the employer, or causing the loss of goods,

articles or property of the employer, shall forfeit such gratuity to the extent of the

damage or loss caused by him.

10

Furthermore, Sections 31B (1) (b) and ( c) of the IDA were amended through Section 17 of

the Gratuity Act.

For easy reference, Sections 31B (1)(b) and (c) are reproduced below.

(b) the question whether any gratuity or other benefits are due to him from his

employer on termination of his services and the amount of such gratuity and the

nature and extent of such benefits, where such workman has been employed in any

industry employing less than fifteen workmen on any date during the period of twelve

months preceding the termination of the services of the workman who makes the

application or in respect of whom the application is made to the tribunal;

(c) the question whether the forfeiture of a gratuity in terms of the Payment of

Gratuity Act, 1983 has been correctly made in terms of that Act,

In terms of Section 13, an employer can forfeit the gratuity of a workman if his services have

been terminated on the grounds of fraud or misappropriation on the part of the employee.

Our courts have considered that if the employer terminated the services of an employee on

these grounds, the correction of the decisions should go before the Labour Tribunal.

This Court is mindful of the procedure laid down in the Act relating to an industrial dispute

which was broadly discussed by His Lordship A.H.M.D. Nawaz J in M.A. Lanka (Pte.) Ltd.

v. Commissioner General of Labour and Others C.A. (Writ) Appl. No.387/2013 decided on

21.11.2017.

By way of another addendum, I must refer to Section 31B(1)(b) of the Industrial

Disputes Act which empowers a Labour Tribunal to award gratuity to a workman

when he has worked in an industry which has employed less than 15 workmen. By

11

way of contrast, Section 5 of the Payment of Gratuity Act empowers the Commissioner

of Labour to oversee the payment of gratuity to a workman when he has been

employed by an employer who has employed 15 or more workmen. Thus the

underlying metwand is that there are two regimes for payment of gratuity. An

employer who employs in terms of the Act is cast upon the liability to pay only if he

has employed 15 workmen or more, whereas the regime under the Industrial Disputes

Act empowers the Labour Tribunal to award gratuity when there are less than 15

employees. An additional jurisdiction given to the Labour Tribunal is that if an

employer who has or has had more than 15 workmen during the period of 1 year

preceding the date of termination of services of a workman has terminated the

services of the workman on grounds of misconduct as set out in Section 13, the Labour

Tribunal is bound to assess the correctness of the decision. Given that the services of

the 5th Respondent were terminated on disciplinary grounds such as fraud and

misappropriation, it would appear that Section 13 of the Act read with Section 31B

(1)( c) of the Industrial Disputes Act would be engaged and consequently it would be

the Labour Tribunal which has to go into the correctness of the decision to forfeit

gratuity. But the gravamen of the contention before this Court is that by letter dated

19.01.2012 (P3) the 5th Respondent~workman complained to the Assistant

Commissioner of Labour (East). It is before this forum namely the Assistant

Commissioner of Labour that the employer took up the jurisdictional objection viz~

the correctness of the forfeiture cannot be gone into by the Commissioner.

Further held that:

In other words since Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, No.l2 of 1983 only

applies to an industry where the employer has or has employed fifteen or more

12

workmen, it goes without saying that under Section 31B (1)(c) of the Industrial

Disputes Act, the Labour Tribunal would consider the correctness of forfeiture effected

in an industry which has employed fifteen or more workmen within a period of 12

months preceding the date of termination of services of a workman. It all boils down

that the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983 applies to an industry that has

employed IS or more employees. But even in such a situation, if there is a forfeiture

of gratuity on the grounds set out in Section 13 of the Act, the correctness of that

decision goes before the Labour Tribunal for a legal appraisal. It is only when there is

an industry having IS or more workmen but there is no allegation of fraud or

misappropriation as set out in Section 13, the Commissioner gets jurisdiction to go

into the question of gratuity.

A similar factual matrix was considered in Lanka Milk Foods (C.W.E) PLC v. B.A. Mahinda

Assistant Commissioner of Labour, CA Writ Application No: 0392/2019 decided on 05.04.2022

where His Lordship S.U.B. Karalliyadde J held that:

As per section 31 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, the labour tribunal has the

jurisdiction to determine the question of the correctness of a decision to forfeit the

payment of gratuity. In terms of section 13 of the Gratuity Act, an employer could

forfeit the gratuity of an employee only where the employees services have been

terminated for the reason of fraud, misappropriation of funds of the employer, willful

damage to property of the employer, or causing the loss of goods, articles or property

of the employer.

Both cases indicate that if the workman was terminated on the grounds of fraud, then the

workman should make an application under Section 31C to find out whether the allegation

made by the employer to forfeit the gratuity is genuine or not as the Labour Tribunal has the

13

power under Section 31C to make such inquiries and hear all such evidence which reads as

follows:

(1) Where an application under section 31B is made to a labour tribunal, it

shall be the duty of the tribunal in to make all such inquiries into that

application and hear all such evidence as the tribunal may consider necessary

and thereafter make, not later than six months form the date of such

application, such order as may appear to the tribunal to be just and equitable.

(2) A labour tribunal conducting an inquiry shall observe the procedure

prescribed under section 31A, in respect of the conduct of proceedings before

the tribunal.

I am of the view that when the employer takes a defence under Section 13 not to pay the

gratuity, the question will arise whether the said forfeiture of gratuity has been correctly

made. Then there should be an inquiry to find out the guilt of the employee. The above said

provision allows to have the inquiry and to assess the correction of the forfeiture of the

gratuity which means what is the damage caused to the employer by the act of the workman.

In other words, whether the employer is entitled to invoke Section 13 or has acted

erroneously.

In the instant application, the Petitioner has indicated the reasons for the termination of the

5th Respondent in the letter dated 28.01.2019 marked P3. For easy reference, an excerpt of

the said letter is reproduced below:

Whilst making inquiries with distributors into the recent debacle occurred at Lanka

Milk Foods (CWE) Plc on account of fraudulent misuse of money and goods of the

company and distributors, it has become evident that you too have aided and abated

14

for the actions of Area sales Managers and Sales Representatives, to claim fraudulent

allowances and other benefits given to Distributors, inclusive of transport rebate,

credits, free issues, incentives, and you have benefitted from the actions when you are

not entitled to the same and of which the Company has paid and settled. Further you

have fraudulently certified purchase orders, invoices, bills and statements and have

caused a massive loss to the company, quantum of which is being calculated and all

losses will be deducted from the payments due to you from the company. It has bee

revealed that you have misled the management and have engaged in selling not only

company products but of the competitors as well of which you have defaulted.

On the above it has been revealed that you are guilty of all accounts in your Letter of

Appointment and therefore you are Terminated in your services with immediate

effect.

In the instant case, it is clear that the 5th Respondent was terminated on the grounds of fraud

and misappropriation. This Court is mindful that as set out by our Courts, gratuity is paid

as a retirement benefit for the workman for faithful and meritorious service. The question

thus arises is if the 5th Respondent was terminated on the grounds of fraud and

misappropriation, is he still entitled to such gratuity. For the purpose of assessing and

finding out the truth as to the misconduct on the part of the employee, an application should

be made to the Labour Tribunal under Section 31B (1) ( c).

In the circumstances, this Court proceeds to quash the documents namely P2 and P16(d) by

way of writs of Certiorari. We allow the 5th Respondent to invoke the jurisdiction of the

Labour Tribunal in terms of Section 31B (1) ( c)of the Industrial Disputes Act.

15

No order for cost.
