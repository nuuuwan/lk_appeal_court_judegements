Immediately thereafter, the Judicial Medical Officer Colombo objected to the issuance of the said Circular and requested for immediate withdrawal of the same. The Petitioners have requested the Respondent not to withdraw the Circular without allowing them to be heard. Regardless of the said request, the 1st Respondent proceeded to issue another Circular dated 05.04.2007 marked P16 cancelling the earlier Circular P13 with immediate effect. The Petitioners state that the decision to cancel the above Circular P13 is arbitrary, vexatious, capricious and unreasonable. Accordingly, the Petitioners are seeking a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st Respondent reflected in P16.",
