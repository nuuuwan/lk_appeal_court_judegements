364(2) of the Penal Code.

5. At the same time and at the same transaction, the 2nd accused aided

and abetted the 1st and the 3rd accused to commit the offence of gang

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Negombo acquitted

the 1st accused indicted for the 1st, 2nd and 4th charges preferred against him.

The 2nd and the 3rd accused indicted were acquitted of the 1st charge preferred

However, both of them were convicted of the 2nd charge in the indictment, namely

the charge of robbery. The 2nd accused was also convicted of the 5th charge

preferred against him, namely the charge of aiding and abetting to commit gang

rape.

The 3rd accused was also convicted for the 3rd count preferred against him,

namely the charge of gang rape. Afterward, they were sentenced accordingly.

Being aggrieved of the conviction and the sentence, the 2nd accused-appellant

preferred this appeal.

The 2nd accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) has been

sentenced as follows.

1. On the 2nd count, for a rigorous imprisonment period of 8 years, and

ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000/-, with a default sentence of 6

months simple imprisonment.

2. For the 5th count, he was sentenced for a period of 10 years rigorous

imprisonment and ordered to pay Rs. 10,000/- as a fine, with a default

sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment.

The two sentences have been ordered to be served consecutive to each other.

Facts in Brief

The prosecutrix (PW-01) was a mother of a 3 months old child when this incident

happened. Although she could not remember the date of the offence, she has

stated in her evidence that it happened in December 2005. On that day, around

10.30 in the night, she has been with her husband and the child in their house,

which was a small house, built using wooden planks.

She has heard somebody calling her husband and when she opened the window

to inquire, she has seen three persons standing near the entrance gate to their

house. She has clearly identified the 1st accused whom she had known for some

time as Chootiya. Her husband, after having a chat with them had come and

Page 5 of 11

informed her that they wanted Rs. 3000/- from him, and if not, to give some

jewellery. It was the 1st accused who had made this demand. Since her husband

could not comply, the 1st accused has pushed and forced her husband to go with

him to a place away from their house with him. She has remained in the house.

She has stated in her evidence that there was a light inside their house and also

a street light near the entrance to their house.

After a little while, she has heard somebody entering the house and has seen two

boys coming in. She has stated they were the once whom she saw in the company

of the 1st accused. They have forcibly taken the jewellery she was wearing by

pointing a knife at her. According to what she has stated in her evidence in chief,

the appellant, namely the 2nd accused in the indictment, has pushed her onto

the bed, while the other person kept watch near the door of their house.

However, later in her evidence, she has stated that it was the 3rd accused who

pushed her onto the bed and thereafter committed rape on her. After the

incident, she has escaped from the grip of the 3rd accused and had run towards

her neighbours house and informed the neighbour of what happened. When the

neighbours came to inquire, the accused had already escaped.

It has been her evidence that she identified all three accused at the identification

parade held in that regard.

It reveals from the cross-examination of the witness that, at the identification

parade, she has failed to identify the appellant after going through the parade

twice. However, on the 3rd occasion, she has identified the appellant, but

conversely has stated that she cannot remember the face.

Another significant detail revealed during the cross-examination had been her

evidence, recorded on page 138 of the appeal brief. She has stated that when

those who came called for her husband, she saw them about 35 feet away. She

has stated that, initially, she saw the 1st accused whom she knew as Chootiya,

but she could not identify the other two because of the darkness. She has also

Page 6 of 11

stated that when they came inside the house, the light inside the room was

switched off by them (at page 149 of the appeal brief).

When PW-01 was cross-examined, several contradictions as to her original

statement to police has been marked by the defence.

The husband of the prosecutrix has given evidence as PW-02. He has confirmed

that someone came near his house and called him out on the night of the

incident. He has also confirmed that from his house to the gate, it was about 30

feet and the persons who came were near the gate of the house. According to

him, he has identified the 1st accused whom he knew as one of the persons who

came and called him. The other two were unknown to him.

When questioned about the light condition, he has stated that there was a light,

but the 1st accused wanted it to be switched off, and on his instructions, his wife

switched off the light.

It is clear from the evidence that what the witness has stated was about the light

that was available in their house, since it was the prosecutrix who has switched

it off. He has not spoken anything about a streetlight or a light near the gate,

situated about 30 feet away from their house.

Since he could not handover the money as demanded, the 1st accused has forced

him to come along with him to the main road and had attempted to extort money

from him, which he could not provide. When he returned home, his wife has

informed him that the jewellery she was wearing was robbed and she was also

raped.

He has stated at the trial that it was the 2nd accused-appellant and the 3rd

accused who did that.

He has testified that at the identification parade held in that regard, he identified

the 1st accused and the 3rd accused indicted, but not the appellant.

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who had examined the prosecutrix after the

incident and the police officers who conducted the investigation have given

evidence at the trial.

When a defence was called by the learned trial Judge at the conclusion of the

prosecution case, the appellant has made a dock statement stating that he was

14 years at that time and was arrested because he was a friend, which could

have been a reference to the 1st accused.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. The evidence in respect of the 2nd accused-appellant was doubtful as to

the identification.

2. The learned High Court Judge has not given any reason to reject the

dock statement of the appellant.

3. The sentence imposed was excessive.

The Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

The main contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant in this regard was

that the identification of the appellant, allegedly by the prosecutrix at the time

of committing this offence was highly doubtful.

He brought to the attention of the Court the discrepancies as to the light

conditions that were available for such an identification. He also pointed out to

the identification parade held in that regard and was of the view that even after

the 3rd time, there had been no positive identification of the 2nd appellant as an

accessory to the crime. He contended that based on the identity issue alone, the

learned High Court Judge had no basis to conclude that the charges against the

Page 8 of 11

appellant have been established beyond reasonable doubt, and urged that the

appellant should be acquitted of the charges upon which he was found guilty.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who represented the Hon. Attorney

General conceded during the hearing of this appeal that the question of identity

of the appellant by the prosecutrix at the time of the relevant incident has not

been properly considered by the learned High Court Judge in his judgment. She

also agreed that due to the discrepancies in the evidence in that regard, it could

not be concluded beyond reasonable doubt whether the 2nd appellant has been

identified positively by the prosecutrix.

This Court would like to express appreciation to the learned DSG for assisting

the Court in order to dispense justice as a responsible officer of the Court in this

regard.

Having considered the facts and the circumstances of this matter and the

evidence made available against the appellant before the High Court, I am of the

view that this is a matter where Turnbull Guidelines set forth in the case of

Regina Vs. Turnbull (1977) QB 224 would become relevant. It was held that

where a case against an accused depends wholly on the correctness of the

identity of that person, the Judge should warn the jury of the special need for

caution before relying on the correctness of the identification by the witness.

The said Turnbull guidelines require a trial Judge to be mindful that;

Caution is required to avoid the risk of injustice.

A witness who is honest may be wrong even if they are convinced,

they are right.

A witness who is convincing may still be wrong.

More than one witness may be wrong.

A witness who recognizes the defendant even when the witness

knows the defendant well may be wrong.

Page 9 of 11

Some of the circumstances a Judge should direct the jury to examine in order to

find out whether a correct identification has been made include;

The length of time the accused was observed by the witnesses.

The distance the witness was from the accused.

The state of the light.

The length of time elapsed between the original observation

and the subsequent identification.

There can be no doubt that the prosecutrix was raped, and her belongings were

robbed during this incident. However, what matters is whether she was able to

positively identify the 2nd accused-appellant as a member of the gang who

committed rape on her and robbed her jewellery.

Although she has given evidence in Court where she has stated that there was

light in her house as well as on the road so that she was able to identify the

appellant, the evidence, taken as a whole establishes otherwise. Under cross-

examination, she has clearly stated that when they looked out from the window

of the house, she was only able to identify the 1st accused, and could not identify

the other two because it was dark. Her evidence is to the effect that those who

came inside the house ordered the lights to be switched off, which shows that

she has not been able to identify the person who stood guard near the door of

the house while the other person committed rape on her. Even at the

identification parade held in this regard, she has failed to identify the appellant

after the 1st two attempts. She has identified him at the 3rd attempt, but has

stated that she could not remember his face, which does not give any indication

as to whether her identification was positive even at the identification parade.

I am of the view that if at all, the husband of the prosecutrix would have been

the person who had the best ability to identify the three persons who came to

their house on that day. According to his evidence, he is the person who went

outside of the house and spoke to the 1st accused. But he has never stated in his

Page 10 of 11

evidence that he identified the other two persons who accompanied the 1st

accused.

His evidence creates a grave doubt as to the source of light the prosecutrix says

that were available at the time the three persons came and called her husband.

She has stated that there was a streetlight near the gate of the house. However,

her husband has failed to speak about such a light being available at that time.

According to his evidence, the 1st accused had wanted the light emanating from

the house to be switched off and the prosecutrix had done so when her husband

wanted her to do it. That creates a reasonable doubt as to whether the

prosecutrix identified the appellant as she claimed, or whether it was an

afterthought after the appellants arrest.

Another matter that should have been considered in favour of the appellant was

the fact where the lights of the house was turned off by the prosecutrix when her

husband told her to do so. According to her evidence, after the initial demand of

money, her husband had been led away by the 1st accused. It is not clear whether

she turned on the lights of her house later. However, her evidence which says

that she only realized someone was coming inside the house because there was

floodwater inside their house and she heard someone walking on the floodwater

creates a doubt again, as to whether the house lights were switched on at that

time.

I find that in the judgment, the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider

any of these matters in relation to the fact whether the prosecutrix has made a

positive identification of the appellant. Although a person giving evidence some

10 years after the incident may forget some details of the incident, this is not a

situation where such a consideration can be held in favour of the prosecutrix, as

the identification of the appellant is not a matter that can be disregarded in such

a context.

Page 11 of 11

For the reasons considered above, I am of the view that this was a situation

where it was not safe to convict the 2nd accused-appellant for the counts

preferred against him.

Accordingly, I set aside the conviction of the 2nd accused-appellant and acquit

him of the 2nd and the 5th count of the indictment.

The appeal allowed.
