WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Matara for the

murder of Maduppuli Hewage Susantha, thereby committing the

offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code. The cause of

death according to the Judicial Medical Officer was fatal firearm injuries

on the chest. After trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the

accused-appellant for the murder by the Judgment dated 28.02.2023

and sentenced him to death. This appeal has been preferred against the

said Judgment.

Prior to the hearing of the appeal, written submissions had been filed

on behalf of both parties. At the hearing, the learned Counsel for the

appellant and the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the

respondent made oral submissions.

In the High Court, PW-1 and PW-2 had given evidence regarding the

incident. PW-1 was the wife of the deceased. PW-2 was the sister-in-law

of the deceased. PW-4, the mother of PW-1 had not seen the incident

and seen only the deceased lying on the ground after being shot. Other

witnesses for the prosecution are the Judicial Medical Officer and

Investigating Officers.

The grounds of appeal are as follows:

i. The learned High Court Judge gravely misdirected himself as

he failed to consider/evaluate the first information which is

the 119-emergency call.

ii. The identity of the appellant has not been proved beyond a

reasonable doubt.

iii. The learned High Court Judge had failed to consider/evaluate

that the prosecution has not established the lighting condition

at the time of the incident to prove a positive identification.

iv. The learned High Court Judge had erred in law in failing to

evaluate the evidence under the legal principles governing

circumstantial evidence and had rather acted on suspicious

circumstances.

v. The learned High Court Judge failed to provide the benefit of

Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance for the appellant.

vi. The learned High Court Judge had been influenced by facts

and circumstances not elicited during the trial.

vii. The learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself on the

infirmities in prosecution evidence.

viii. The conviction and sentence are bad in law.

Two main issues to be considered in this appeal is the identification of

the accused-appellant and some observations made by the learned Trial

Judge in evaluating the prosecution evidence.

After evaluating the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, the learned

High Court Judge has stated in his judgment that it can be concluded

after evaluating the entirety of the prosecution evidence that strong

circumstantial evidence has been presented by the prosecution to prove

beyond a reasonable doubt the fact that the accused-appellant shot the

deceased (Page 36 of the High Court Judgment).

Again, the learned High Court Judge has expressed the following view

in his Judgment:

.

,

. (Page 39 of the High Court Judgment)

Following the aforesaid observations, the learned Judge considered the

statement made by the accused-appellant from the dock and rejected.

It is apparent from the aforesaid observations that the learned High

Court Judge was of the view that the presumption of innocence of an

accused is operative only up to the point where the prosecution builds

a strong case.

I regret to state that this is a completely wrong view regarding the

presumption of innocence of an accused and the above observations are

contrary to the correct legal position that the learned High Court Judge

is obliged to follow. It was held in the case of Anthony Michael Morril

V. Attorney General Court of Appeal Case No. CA 26/06, decided on

25.05.2010 as follows: The learned trial judge has come to the

conclusion that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable

doubt before considering the defence evidence which rendered

subsequent consideration of the defence evidence. It is cardinal rule in

our criminal law that every person charged with an offence is entitled

to a fair trial and shall be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty.

(Article 13(3) and 13(5) of the constitution). This presumption of

innocence should be operative until the learned trial judge perused and

analyzed the entirety of the evidence led in the case, that of the

prosecution as well as that of the defence.

Therefore, the learned Judges observation that

Page 5 of 8

,

is wrong. The learned Trial Judge in this

case analyzed the defence case on the basis that the presumption of

innocence is operative only up to the point where the prosecution builds

a strong case. Therefore, the learned Trial Judge had done a grave error

in evaluating the evidence of the case.

Be that as it may, I proceed to deal with the other vital issue of the

identification of the accused-appellant. The learned Counsel for the

appellant contended that when the identity of the shooter was the main

issue of the entire case and the first information disclosed about

unidentified shooters, it was very unreasonable on the part of the

prosecution for not acting on the first information.

The learned Senior DSG for the respondent contended that an

information obtained through a 119 call cannot be reduced to writing

as stipulated in Section 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act but

no prejudice has been caused to the appellant by considering the 119

call as the first information.

The issue in this case is not that the first information was not reduced

to writing. As submitted by the learned Counsel for the appellant,

according to the first information received through a 119 call,

unidentified persons had shot the deceased. At page 273 of the Appeal

Brief, the first information received through a 119 call had been

recorded as an admission in terms of Section 420 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. Again, at pages 284 and 285 the said

admission has been recorded.

From the said admission, two clear points have been established.

Firstly, the wife of the deceased, PW-1 had given this first information.

Secondly, PW-1 had stated that unidentified persons had shot her

husband, the deceased. However, the learned High Court Judge

Page 6 of 8

misdirected himself in stating in his Judgment (Page 27 of the High

Court Judgment) that the first information was an anonymous call

because it is clear from the aforesaid admission recorded that PW-1,

the wife of the deceased gave the first information. The learned Senior

DSG admitted that the said observation of the learned Judge is wrong.

The serious issues arising from the said first information are the

credibility of PW-1 and the identity of the accused-appellant. In giving

evidence, PW-1 stated that she saw Mahesh, the accused-appellant

running towards the river on the western side with something like a

black pipe in his hand. She also stated that the appellant was a

neighbour and was known to her from his childhood. If the appellant

was a well-known neighbour and if PW-1 saw him running, soon after

the incident, a serious issue arises as to why she informed the police

through 119 call that unidentified people shot at her husband. If PW-1

saw the appellant running soon after the shooting, definitely she would

not inform the police that unidentified people shot at her husband.

Therefore, her evidence in the High Court that she saw the appellant

running immediately after the shooting cannot be believed. Even the

learned Senior DSG admitted that PW-1 is not a credible witness and

her evidence cannot be relied upon.

However, the learned Senior DSG contended that PW-2 is a truthful

witness and her evidence can be acted upon. Therefore, it has to be

considered whether the identification of the appellant is proved beyond

a reasonable doubt only on the evidence of PW-2 because no other

witness identified the appellant at the scene. PW-2 had stated in her

evidence that the appellant was a neighbour and he was known to her

from his childhood. As stated previously, PW-1 had also stated that she

knew the appellant from childhood. However, when PW-1 gave the first

information to the police through a 119 call, she informed that

unknown people shot at her husband. The question arises if PW-2 saw

the appellant fleeing from the place of the incident soon after the

Page 7 of 8

shooting, why PW-1 informed the police that unknown people shot the

deceased. Didnt PW-2 told PW-1 (the wife of the brother of her

husband) that I saw Mahesh running with something like a pipe in his

hand, immediately after the shooting? In these circumstances, a

reasonable doubt arises whether PW-2 in fact identified the appellant.

The learned Counsel for the appellant also contended that the

prosecution has not established that there was sufficient lighting

condition at the time of the incident to identify the appellant. The

learned Senior DSG contended that PW-1 and PW-9, the investigating

officer affirmed that bulbs were illuminated around the house. PW-9

stated in his evidence that the lighting condition could be seen by

looking at the photographs taken at the scene. However, no such

photographs have been marked in evidence. In addition, an admission

has been recorded that no notes were made in the information book in

respect of the lighting condition (Pages 242 and 243 of the appeal brief).

Apart from that, PW-9 stated in his evidence that they were searching

the place of the incident using a torch (Pages 255 and 256 of the appeal

brief). According to the aforementioned items of evidence, it is not

established whether there was sufficient light at the scene to identify a

person because, according to PW-1, the incident occurred between

10.00 and 10.30 at night.

Apart from the aforesaid infirmities in identifying the appellant, the

most important point to be considered in identifying the appellant is

that PW-2 identified the appellant not by seeing his face but by seeing

the back of the person. It is apparent from the following question and

answer that PW-2 did not see the face and only saw the back of the

person running and she stated that the said person was identified as

the appellant.

. (Page 138 of the appeal brief).

Page 8 of 8

Therefore, PW-2 had only seen a person running, turning his back.

PW-2 stated that even then, she identified that person as the appellant.

Even though PW-2 saw a person running, identifying a person when

running, turning his back, without seeing his face, is not an

identification that can be accepted beyond a reasonable doubt.

Therefore, in this case, there is no evidence regarding the identification

of the accused-appellant that can be accepted without a reasonable

doubt. For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the charge of murder

against the accused-appellant has not been proved beyond a reasonable

doubt. Hence, the decision of the learned High Court Judge to convict

the accused-appellant for the charge of murder is erred in law.

Accordingly, the Judgment dated 28.02.2023, the conviction and the

death sentence passed on the appellant are set aside. The accused-

appellant is acquitted of the charge of murder.

The appeal is allowed.
