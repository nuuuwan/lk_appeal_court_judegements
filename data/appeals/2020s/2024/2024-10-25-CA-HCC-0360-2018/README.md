Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

Nine accused persons including the 9th accused-appellant (hereinafter referred

as the appellant) were indicted before the High Court of Kegalle for committing

the following offences.

1. That they conspired on or about 24-03-2000 at a place called

Narangoda, Bogala Pathala within the jurisdiction of the High Court of

Kegalle to commit the offence of robbery of money belonging to Bogala

Graphite Limited amounting to Rs. 1,900,000/- using firearms and

committed the said offence of robbery as a result, and thereby

committed an offence punishable in terms of the section 113B, 102

and 380 of the Penal Code read with section 44(a) of the Firearms

Ordinance as amended by Firearms (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1966.

2. At the same time and at the same transaction, the said accused persons

committed the offence of robbery of a sum of Rs. 1,900,000/- and a

jeep numbered 31-1183 belonging to Bogala Graphite Limited from

the possession of Sooriyakumara Yatigammana, using firearms and

thereby committed the offence of robbery punishable in terms of the

sections 380 of the Penal Code read with section 44(a) of the Firearms

Ordinance as amended by Firearms (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1966.

The trial has proceeded against the 8th accused indicted in his absence in terms

of section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle found the appellant guilty as

charged of his judgment dated 12-12-2018. The 1st to 8th accused were acquitted

on the basis that the prosecution has failed to prove the charges against them

beyond reasonable doubt.

Page 4 of 19

After allowing the appellant to plead in mitigation and also having listened to the

prosecution as to the aggravating circumstances, the learned High Court Judge

has sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment on count 01. He was also

ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 5000/-, and in default, sentenced to a period of 3

months simple imprisonment.

On count 2, he was again sentenced to life imprisonment and was also ordered

to pay Rs. 5000/-with a default sentence of 3 months simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved of the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant preferred

this appeal.

Facts in Brief

This is an incident where the office premises of the Bogala Graphite Limited were

robbed by a group of robbers in the early hours of 24-03-2000. The group who

entered the said premises has unarmed and tied the security officers stationed

there and had entered the office premises where a sum of Rs. 1,900,000/- was

kept in an iron safe to pay the salaries of the workers on the following day. They

have removed the iron safe from the office premises and had loaded it into the

jeep numbered 31-1183 belonging to the factory, which was parked at the

premises and taken away the iron safe and the jeep. In the process, the group of

robbers has also fired some shots using firearms.

After being made aware of the incident, the management of the factory has

informed the incident to Pindeniya police. After receiving the information, the

Officer-in-Charge of Pindeniya police (PW-38) and a team of police officers have

commenced their investigations. They have visited the factory premises and had

recorded their observations. They have also found two spent cartridges at the

place of the incident. In the process of their investigations, they have also

recovered the jeep taken away by the group of robbers about 6 kilometers away,

abandoned at a rubber plantain and had taken steps to call the officers from the

Fingerprints Department to conduct their investigations.

Page 5 of 19

After receiving an information, the OIC and a group of police officers have gone

to the hotel known as Madilanda Walawwa, which was an old Walawwa

transformed into a boutique hotel. This hotel was situated about 35 kilometers

away from the Bogala Graphite Limited. They have reached the Walawwa around

8.50 a.m. on 26-03-2000 and when they reached there, only the 1st accused

indicted had been present as the caretaker of the premises.

When they searched behind the reception desk of the hotel, they have been able

to find a concealed firearm resembling a T-56 weapon with a magazine and also

a hand grenade. They have also observed a torn off rope. Since they had the

information that the iron safe robbed from the factory premises has been put

into the toilet pit of the hotel, the OIC has taken steps to open the pit and had

managed to recover the iron safe belonging to the factory. The iron safe has been

forced open, and there was no money inside. Subsequently, the police have

recovered several T-56 magazines and empty cartridges as well as some other

firearm bullets from the ceiling of the premises.

Around 12.30 p.m. on the same day, the police have arrested the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and

the 5th accused indicted when they came to the hotel and a sum of Rs. 137,240/-

has been recovered from the possession of the 2nd accused indicted. During the

process of their investigations, police have recovered Rs. 200,000/- concealed in

a baffle which was kept in the living area of the hotel and also a drill machine as

a result of the statement made by the 1st accused indicted. A sum of Rs.

100,000/- and another sum of Rs. 94,000/- has also been recovered from the

houses of the 3rd and the 4th as a result of the statements made by them to the

police. Another sum of Rs. 72,000/- has been recovered as a result of the

statement made to the police by the 5th accused indicted from his house, and yet

another sum of Rs. 130,000/- from a suitcase in the house of the 6th accused

indicted as a result of his statement made to the police. The 6th to 9th accused

had been arrested subsequently by the police. The 9th accused appellant had

been the person who has obtained the old Walawwa premises on lease and

running the boutique hotel.

Page 6 of 19

Upon investigations, the Registrar of Fingerprints has found a fingerprint

belonging to the 2nd accused indicted from the jeep that was robbed on the day

of the incident. The Government Analyst who conducted investigations had

confirmed that the 2 spent cartridges found in the factory premises had been

fired using the automatic weapon found at the hotel, which has been marked as

P-05 during the trial. The witnesses have also identified the iron safe and the

jeep found abandoned, as the safe and the jeep robbed from the factory premises

on the day of the incident.

Since the eyewitnesses to the incident had failed to identify any of the persons

who came to the factory premises and committed the robbery, PW-25 is the

person who was of paramount importance in this matter. PW-25 has been a

painter engaged to paint the hotel premises. He has been introduced to the hotel

management by the 3rd accused indicted and had been working there for about

a month by the time this incident occurred. He has come to know all the accused

indicted before the High Court during that period. He has identified the appellant

as the Manager of the establishment and the others as persons who frequented

the hotel. He has stated that the hotel had a three-wheeler where the 5th accused

indicted was the driver.

It has been his evidence that all the accused indicted were at the hotel on the

day of the incident from the morning, except for the 5th accused indicted who

came to the hotel in the afternoon. Between 9.00 and 10.00 p.m. on that night,

all of them have left the hotel in two three-wheelers including the one driven by

the 5th accused. The appellant has informed him that they are going to attend a

funeral in Aranayake area and for him to close the gate and sleep, and open the

gate when they return. He has observed all of them wearing black-coloured

clothes.

Although the appellant has stated that they are going to Aranayake, he has seen

the two three-wheelers going the opposite direction towards Awissawella.

Page 7 of 19

The persons have returned while he was sleeping in the corridor of the hotel, and

the PW-25 has opened the gate for them. Apart from the two three-wheelers, a

red-coloured jeep has also come into the compound and he has seen all the

vehicles going towards the garage situated at the back of the hotel. Thereafter,

he has heard something heavy being put on the ground and heard a sound like

a heavy metal box being dragged on the ground. He has also heard some sound

similar to cutting of iron and breaking something from the direction where the

vehicles went. After some time, he has also heard some heavy metal object being

dragged and a sound similar to putting a heavy thing into a pit. He has also

observed that the jeep and the two three-wheelers leaving the hotel on the same

night.

While he was attending to painting work on the 26th morning, a team of police

officers has come and questioned him, but not recorded any statement from him

or arrested him. According to his evidence, after some time, he has received a

letter from the police to come to the police station and has given a statement

thereafter. The fact that the said statement has been recorded 01 month and 9

days after the incident has been an admitted fact. It needs to be noted that the

evidence of PW-25 has not been challenged in any material terms.

When the prosecution case was concluded and all the accused were called upon

for their defence, they have made dock statements, and had denied that they

committed the offences under which they were indicted.

The 1st accused indicted has claimed that he came to the hotel to meet one

Jayaratne and he was arrested while waiting for him, and had claimed that he

has nothing to do with the crime.

The 2nd accused indicted has claimed that he is a permanent employee of Bogala

Graphite Limited, and he used to frequently sit and have his meals in the jeep

that was taken by the robbers and later abandoned, and has also denied that he

had any money with him when he was arrested.

Page 8 of 19

The other accused have also made similar denials, while the appellant, who was

the 9th accused indicted, has stated in his dock statement that he took charge of

the hotel as his friend who originally had the lease fell ill, and because he had

no knowledge of hotel keeping, he handed over the hotel to one of his friends

Upali Kokila Jayaratne.

He has claimed that by that time, he was conducting classes throughout Kegalle

district and because of that, he used to visit the hotel only 2-3 days a week. He

has claimed that on the day of the incident claimed by the police, he was in

Anuradhapura with his wife and child in order to fulfill a vow, and came home

two days thereafter. He has stated that while conducting his classes as he used

to be, the police team arrested him. He has denied any connection to the offence

as well.

In his judgment, the learned High Court Judge has decided to acquit the 1st

accused indicted on the basis that the only evidence against him was the fact

that he knew the place where the iron safe was thrown and that fact alone is not

sufficient to convict him for the offence.

2nd accused indicted also has been acquitted on the basis that since he was a

regular employee of Bogala Graphite Limited, having his fingerprint on the jeep

used in the robbery cannot be held against him.

The 3rd to 8th accused also have been acquitted on the basis that although money

have been recovered based on their statements to the police, that money has not

been produced before the trial Court, and also section 27 statement relied on by

the prosecution can only infer that the said accused knew the places where the

money was hidden and that alone is insufficient to convict them.

However, the learned High Court Judge has proceeded to convict the appellant

on the basis that he was the person who had the full control and possession of

the hotel, and PW-25s evidence has not been challenged as to the fact that the

appellant was in the hotel right throughout on the day of the incident, and left

the hotel in the night and returned. He has based his conviction on the evidence

Page 9 of 19

of PW-25 as to the things he heard and observed subsequently. The learned High

Court Judge has also determined the fact of the recovery of the automatic

weapon used for the crime from the same hotel premises should also be held

against the appellant who had the possession and control of the hotel.

The learned High Court Judge has rejected the dock statement made by the

appellant on the basis that it has failed to create a doubt as to the evidence

against him and also has failed to provide a reasonable explanation in that

regard.

The learned High Court Judge has also determined that the alibi taken up by

the appellant cannot be considered as he has failed to take necessary steps in

terms of section 126A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and has determined

that in any way, his alibi has not dented the credibility of the prosecution

evidence against the appellant.

Accordingly, the learned High Court Judge has acquitted the 1st to 8th accused

indicted while convicting the appellant for the two charges preferred against him.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel formulated the

following two grounds of appeal for the consideration of Court.

1. The learned High Court Judge has wrongly rejected the alibi taken up

by the appellant.

2. The learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself on the

circumstantial evidence in holding that the productions were in

exclusive possession of the appellant since there was evidence that

several other persons were also present in the premises.

The learned Presidents Counsel made submissions to the effect that the learned

High Court Judge has relied heavily on the evidence of PW-25 who has given the

same evidence on the other accused indicted who were acquitted. It was argued

that the learned High Court Judge has failed to give reasons as to why he decided

Page 10 of 19

to act on the evidence of PW-25 to convict the appellant and on the same evidence

to acquit the other accused indicted.

It was contended that the learned High Court Judge has failed to apply the

principles that govern the applicability of circumstantial evidence in its correct

perspective and has made a wrong determination based on the possession and

control of the hotel where the firearms and the iron safe was found.

He relied on the judgment pronounced by Their Lordships of the Supreme Court

in SC-Appeal No. TAB/001/23 decided on 08-08-2024 to stress his point that

the Court has failed to explain reasons for acquitting the other accused and

convicting the 9th accused based on the same evidence, and also submitted that

the appellant should also be acquitted as there was no evidence placed before

the Court that the appellant had exclusive possession of the hotel premises.

It was also submitted that the learned High Court Judge has refused to consider

the alibi based on wrong legal principles, whereas, it should have been

considered in favour of the appellant.

The Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who re-presented the complainant-

respondent was of the view that there was ample circumstantial evidence against

the appellant placed before the Court, and hence, the conviction should stand.

It was her position that although PW-25s statement has been recorded belatedly,

his evidence has not been challenged at the trial, and his evidence has been

cogent and truthful. It was also submitted by the learned DSG that the claim of

the appellant in his dock statement that he was away in Anuradhapura on the

day of the incident cannot be considered as an alibi in that sense, because such

a statement cannot rule out the possibility of the appellant committing the crime.

It was her position that the appeal should stand dismissed.

The Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

It is amply clear from the evidence placed before the trial court that the persons

who faced the incidents of robbery have failed to identify any of the persons who

Page 11 of 19

committed the crime. Therefore, this is a matter where the prosecution has relied

entirely on circumstantial evidence against the appellant as well as the other

accused indicted.

The evidence led at the trial clearly provides that after the incident, the police

team who conducted the investigations have recovered two spent cartridges from

the scene of the crime. It is undisputed that the police have raided the hotel on

the 26-03-2000 after receiving a tip-off with regard to the robbery. They have

recovered several weapons as well as the iron safe taken away from the factory

premises. They have also recovered the jeep taken away by the robbers some six

kilometers away from the scene of the crime.

The prosecution has also established that the police fingerprint experts had

extracted a fingerprint from the jeep belonging to the 2nd accused indicted. They

have also recovered money from several of the accused indicted, including the

appellant based on their statements made to the police, and had marked the

relevant extracts that led to the discovery in terms of section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance. The Government Analyst has opined that the spent cartridges

recovered from the scene of crime have been used in the T-56 weapon found in

the hotel premises.

Since this is a matter where circumstantial evidence has been used against the

appellant and the other accused indicted, I find it appropriate to mention the

relevant legal principles that have been established by way of case law in that

regard.

In the case of The King Vs. Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 it was held:

Per Soertsz, J.,

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the jury must be

satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused and

inconsistent with any reasonable hypotheses of his innocence.

Page 12 of 19

In the case of Don Sunny Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 01, it was

held:

1) When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the

proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must

irresistibly point towards only inference that the accused committed the

offence. On consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can

be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2) If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence, if an

inference can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the

accused, then one cannot say that the charges have been proved beyond

reasonable doubt.

3) If upon consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence the

only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the

offence, then they can be found guilty. The prosecution must prove that

no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of committing the

offence. The accused can be found guilty only if the proved items of

circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent

with their innocence.

However, when considering the circumstantial evidence, what has to be

considered is the totality of the circumstantial evidence before coming to a firm

finding as to the guilt of an accused, although each piece of circumstantial

evidence when taken separately, may only be suspicious in nature.

In the case of King Vs. Gunaratne 47 NLR 145, it was held:

In a case of circumstantial evidence, the facts given in evidence may, taken

cumulatively, be sufficient to rebut the presumption of innocence, although

each fact, when taken separately, may be a circumstance only of suspicion.

Page 13 of 19

The jury is entitled to draw inferences unfavourable to an accused where he

is not called to establish an innocent explanation of evidence given by the

prosecution, which, without such explanation, tells for his guilt.

In the case of Regina Vs. Exall (176 English Reports, Nisi Prius at page 853),

Pollock, C.B. considering the aspect of circumstantial evidence remarked;

It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to be considered as a chain,

and each piece of evidence as a link in a chain, but that is not so, for then,

if any one link broke, the chain would fall. It is more like of a rope composed

of several codes. One strand of the rope might be insufficient to sustain the

weight, but stranded together may be quite of sufficient strength.

It was observed in the case of Karunaratne Vs. Attorney-General (2005) 2 SLR

233,

Per Jagath Balapatabendi, J.,

The primary advantage of circumstantial evidence is that the risk of perjury

is minimized since it, unlike direct evidence, does not emanate from the

testimony of a single witness. It is therefore more difficult to fabricate

circumstantial evidence, than it is to resort to falsehood in the course of

giving direct evidence.

There is no principle of the law of evidence which precludes a conviction in

a criminal case based entirely on circumstantial evidence. There are no

uniform rules for the purpose of determining the probative value of

circumstantial evidence. This depends on the facts of each case.

In the case of Krishantha de Silva Vs. The Attorney General (2003) 1 SLR

162:

Per Edirisuriya, J.,

It is admitted that this is a case of circumstantial evidence. In such a case,

circumstances relied upon should be consistent with the guilt of the accused

Page 14 of 19

and inconsistent with his innocence. If the circumstantial evidence relied

upon can be accounted for on the supposition of innocence then the

circumstantial evidence fails. Circumstantial evidence can be acted upon

only if, from the circumstances relied upon the only reasonable inference to

be drawn is the inference of guilt. If the circumstances are consistent both

with guilt and with innocence then the case is not proved on circumstantial

evidence. The hypothesis of innocence must be excluded by the

circumstances relied upon and the circumstances must point to one

conclusion alone, i.e. the guilt of the accused. The learned trial Judge has in

detail discussed these principles to be followed in appreciating

circumstantial evidence in the instant case.

As I have stated before, the uncontradicted evidence of PW-25 clearly establishes

the fact that the appellant had been the person who had the control of the hotel.

Apart from that, his evidence shows beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant

along with the other persons indicted had been in the hotel throughout the day

where the incident of armed robbery took place. According to the evidence of PW-

25 who knew all the accused well, they have left the hotel in the night wearing

dark clothes stating that they are going to attend a funeral at Aranayake. But he

has observed them going the opposite direction towards Awissawella where the

Bogala Graphite mine is also situated.

They have returned on the same night in the two three-wheelers they left, and a

red-coloured jeep has also been driven into the hotel. In the evidence of PW-25

he has explained in detail the things he heard after the return of the accused,

which had not been disputed at any point.

The appellant has taken up an alibi to claim that he was away at Anuradhapura

on that day, when he was called upon for his defence.

It is well settled law that an alibi is not actually a defence, but a question of fact,

where it is the duty of the prosecution to eliminate such a possibility when an

alibi is taken up by an accused person.

Page 15 of 19

It is with that in mind, our legislature in its wisdom has brought in a specific

provision as to the requirement of notice of alibi by amending the Code Of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 by the Amendment Act No. 14 of 2005 by

introducing section 126A to the Act.

The relevant section reads as follows.

126A. (1) No person shall be entitled during a trial on indictment in

the High Court, to adduce evidence in support of the defence of an

alibi, unless he has

(a) stated such fact to the police at the time of his making his

statement during the investigation; or

(b) stated such fact at any time during the preliminary inquiry

; or

(c) raised such defence, after indictment has been served, with

notice to the Attorney-General at any time prior to fourteen

days of the date of commencement of the trial:

(2) The original statement should contain all such information as

to the time and place at which such person claims he was and

details as to the persons if any, who may furnish evidence in

support of his alibi.

(3) For the purposes of this section "evidence in support of an alibi"

means evidence tending to show that by reason of the presence of

the defendant at a particular place or in particular area at a

particular time he was not, or was not likely to have been, at the

place where the offence is alleged to have been committed at the

time of the alleged commission."

As determined correctly by the learned High Court Judge, the appellant has

failed to show that he fulfilled any of the requirements that make him entitled to

take up an alibi at the trial. He has taken up that position only when he was

Page 16 of 19

called upon for his defence. He has failed to show any reason that can be justified

as to his failure in taking up the alibi at that delayed stage of the trial.

He has failed to confront the PW-25 who has stated in no uncertain terms that

the appellant was present at the hotel throughout that day.

Besides that, it is also settled law that an alibi should not be a mere statement,

but taking up of the impossibility of a person being at the scene of a crime due

to the fact he was somewhere else. The appellant merely stating that he went to

Anuradhapura to fulfill a vow cannot exclude the possibility of him being a

participant in the crime.

In the case of Banda and Others Vs. The Attorney General (1999) 3 SLR 168,

it was held that:

There is no burden whatsoever on an accused who puts forward a plea of

alibi and the burden is always on the prosecution to establish beyond

reasonable doubt that the accused was not elsewhere but present at the

time of the commission of the criminal offence.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his book The Law of Evidence- Volume 01 at page

278, discusses the defence of alibi with reference to the relevant case law. At

page 279 it has been stated that;

An alibi is not an exception to penal liability like the general exceptions and

special exceptions laid down in the Penal Code. When the defence of alibi is

taken, there is no burden of proof on the accused. The defence evidence on

alibi has merely to be weighed in the balance with the prosecution evidence.

If the evidence of alibi is not believed, it fails. If it is believed, it succeeds.

But if it is neither believed nor disbelieved but creates a reasonable doubt

as to the prosecution case on identity, the accused is entitled to be

acquitted. (See- Pollock C.B. in Rex Vs. Muller (1864) 60 C.C.C. Sess.

Pap. 461, and Punchi Banda Vs. The State (1973) 76 NLR 293 at 307-

309)

Page 17 of 19

I am of the view that the prosecution has proved the case against the appellant

beyond reasonable doubt and the circumstantial evidence made available to the

Court shows that he was a member of the group that conspired to commit the

robbery using firearms and committed the offence as stated in the incitement.

I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge has correctly convicted the

appellant for the charges preferred against him.

However, I also find that the learned High Court Judge has been misdirected

when he decided to acquit the 1st to 8th accused indicted on the charges preferred

against them as there was ample circumstantial evidence against them as well.

I am of the view that since the complainant-respondent has failed to challenge

the judgment on that premise, the fact of not convicting the other accused on

the same evidence that led to the conviction of the appellant is not a thing that

can be made used to argue that the appellant should also have been acquitted.

I find that in the Supreme Court judgment in SC-Appeal No. TAB/001/23, the

determination had been that the High Court Trial-at-Bar was wrong in

determining that there was no evidence against the 1st accused indicted in that

case, whereas there was evidence against him, and using the same evidence to

convict the 2nd accused on the basis of his culpability to the crime.

However, as I stated before, in the matter under consideration in this appeal, the

circumstantial evidence has been overwhelming against all the accused indicted,

although the learned High Court Judge may have been misdirected in convicting

the appellant on the basis of the possession and control of the hotel, where the

weapons used in the crime and the looted iron safe was also recovered.

I find that in view of the provisions of Article 138 of the Constitution and as

provided in section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979,

and also the relevant case law, what needs to be looked at is whether the

irregularity in the consideration of the evidence has caused any material

prejudice to the appellant or has occasioned a failure of justice.

Page 18 of 19

The proviso of Article 138 of the Constitution reads as follows;

Provided that no judgment decree or order of any court shall be

revered or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which

has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned

a failure of justice.

The similar statutory provision in section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act reads as follows;

436. Subject to the provisions hereinbefore, contained in any

judgement passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be

reversed or altered on appeal or revision on account-

(a) Of any error, omission, or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrant, charge, judgment, summing up, or other

proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other

proceedings under this court; or

(b) Of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

Unless such error, omission, irregularity or want has occasioned a

failure of justice.

The following test was formulated by Viscount Simon L.C. in the case of Stirland

Vs. D. P. P.- (1944) A.C. 315 at 321, which reads;

A perverse jury might conceivably announce a verdict of acquittal in the

teeth of all the evidence, but the provision that the Court of Criminal Appeal

may dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of

justice has actually occurred in convicting the accused assumes a situation

where aa reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would, on the

evidence properly admissible, without doubt convict.

Page 19 of 19

In the case of Lafeer Vs. Queen 74 NLR 246, H.N.G.Fernando, C.J. stated;

There was thus both misdirection and non-direction on matters concerning

the standard of proof. Nevertheless, we are of opinion having regard to the

cogent and uncontradicted evidence that a jury properly directed could not

have reasonably returned a more favourable verdict. We therefore affirm the

conviction and sentence and dismiss the appeal.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no basis to agree with the learned

Presidents Counsel in that regard, as no miscarriage of justice has been

occasioned towards the appellant.

Accordingly, the appeal against the conviction is dismissed for want of merit,

and the conviction dated 12-12-2018 is affirmed.

However, when considering the sentences imposed upon the appellant it is clear

that the 2nd count preferred against him should have been considered as an

alternative count to that of the 1st count preferred, as both the counts relates to

one and the same incident. Therefore, I am of the view that there had been a

misdirection when the appellant was sentenced to both the counts. Hence, I set

aside the sentence imposed on the 2nd count preferred against him.

Subjected to the above variance to the sentence, the appeal against the sentence

is also dismissed.
