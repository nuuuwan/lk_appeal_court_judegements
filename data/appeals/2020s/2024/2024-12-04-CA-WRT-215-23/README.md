JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

The Petitioner has instituted this action by petition dated 26.04.2023 praying inter alia

for a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision dated 22nd of February 2023 marked P8,

made in the Debt Conciliation Board (hereinafter referred to as the Board) case bearing

No 44227 and a writ of mandamus compelling the 1st to 5th Respondents to dismiss the

application No. 44227 made by the 7th Respondent.

Briefly, the facts of this case are as follows:

According to the petition, Ambagahapitiyage Don Nadeesh Nuwan Perera has duly

appointed Danagala Athukoralalage Sudharma Manel as the power of Attorney holder for

this application. The Petitioner states the Petitioner purchased the property in question

Page 3 of 6

by the deed bearing No. 2693 dated 09.04.2008 attested by Hiranya Jayasekara, Notary

Public. The Petitioner further states that, after such purchase, upon request of the 7th

Respondent namely Galhenage Kularathna, the mother of the Petitioner gave the said

property on lease by the lease agreement bearing No. 2741 dated 16.05.2008 to the 7th

Respondent. This was denied by the 7th Respondent.

As stated by the Petitioner, after a letter of demand was sent, an action was filed in the

District Court of Colombo bearing No. DRE 06/2017 seeking inter alia for an enjoining

order. The Petitioner avers that, when the matter came up before the Learned District

Judge, the 7th Respondent raised an objection that an application was already filed before

the Board therefore the District Court has no jurisdiction to maintain the application.

However, this objection was overruled. The Petitioner further avers that the 7th

Respondent appealed against the said Order to the High Court of Civil Appeal in case

bearing No. WP/HCCA/76/2017 where the said matter is still pending before the Court.

In the meantime, the Petitioner received summons to appear before the Board.

According to the 7th Respondent, he has indicated to the Board, that he executed the said

deed No. 2693 for a money lending transaction and he never had the intention to transfer

the property. The Petitioner states that when the matter was taken up on 22.02.2023, the

Petitioner raised the following objections which are reproduced from the petition

verbatim:

a. Before the Act No 29 of 1999, the application shall be lodged to the Debt

Conciliation Board, within 3 years from the date of the execution, and when

the application is pending in the Debt Conciliation Board, no civil Court has

the Jurisdiction any matter PENDING before the Debt Conciliation Board.

b. When the application was made after 3 years from the date of the execution,

the Debt Conciliation Board rejects the acceptance of the said applications.

c. The Section 19 of the Debt conciliation Board Ordinance was amended by the

Act No 29 of 1999, and inserted the following wordings.

(1A) The Board shall not entertain any application by a debtor or

creditor in respect of a debt purporting to be secured by any such

transfer of immovable property as is a mortgage within the meaning

of this Ordinance, unless that application is made within three years

Page 4 of 6

of the date of the notarially executed instrument, effecting such

transfer:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall be read or construed

as preventing the Board from entertaining after the period referred

to in that subsection an application by a debtor who is in possession

of the property transferred.

d. By the said Act No 29 of 1999 or any of the subsequent amendment did not

amend the Section 56 of the Debt Conciliation Board Ordinance

e. Since the Section 19(1A) of the Debt conciliation Board reads "The Board shall

not entertain any application by a debtor or creditor in respect of a debt

purporting to be secured by any such transfer of immovable property as is a

mortgage within the meaning of this Ordinance, unless that application is

made within three years of the date of the notarially executed instrument,

effecting such transfer" the Debt Conciliation Board has no jurisdiction, by

operation of law, to entertain an application made after 3 years.

f. Since the question of possession (relating, to the application made after 3 years)

is a matter of fact and the Debt conciliation Board holds an inquiry (commonly

known as possessory inquiry) outside the Jurisdiction of the Debt conciliation

Board, and such possessory inquiry cannot be considered as an inquiry pending

before the Board (As Section 56 of the Debt Conciliation Board reads)

The Board delivered its Order dated 22.02.2023 marked as P8 stating inter alia that there

is no barrier for the application of the 7th Respondent to be maintained under Section 56

of the said Act.

In this context, the Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court seeking inter alia

to quash the said decision marked P8 by a writ of Certiorari.

According to the 7th Respondent, he instituted an action bearing No. 66550/06/17 in the

Magistrate Court of Colombo under Section 66 (1) of the Primary Procedure Code Act

Page 5 of 6

when the Petitioner tried to disturb the possession of the Respondent. The Magistrate by

order dated 08.01.2018 decided that the possession of the Respondent should not be

disturbed by the Petitioner. The 7th Respondent contends that the Petitioner has not

disclosed this fact to this Court.

The main contention of the Petitioner is that the order made by the said Board marked

as P8 is unlawful, unreasonable, and irrational thereby invoking the jurisdiction seeking

writ of Certiorari to quash the said decision.

According to the Petitioner, the Board has come to the conclusion that they have the

jurisdiction to decide this matter. The Petitioner contends that the Respondent has filed

this matter after 3 years.

According to the said Order, since the 7th Respondent is in continuous possession of the

property in dispute, he is not prevented from making the application before the Board in

terms of Section 19 (1A) of the said Act as amended which reads as follows:

(1A) The Board shall not entertain any application by a debtor or creditor in respect

of a debt purporting to be secured by any such transfer of immovable property as is

a mortgage within the meaning of this Ordinance, unless that application is made

within three years of the date of the notarially executed instrument, effecting such

transfer:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall be read or construed as

preventing the Board from entertaining, after the period referred to in that

subsection, an application by a debtor who is in possession of the property

transferred.

In Hilda Perera v. Lawrence Perera 67 NLR 186, His Lordship Tambiah J held that,

the date from which an application for relief under the Debt Conciliation

Ordinance is regarded as pending before the Board is the date when the

application is received by the Board and not the date when it is entertained by the

Board under Section 19 of the Ordinance.

In the instant case, the Petitioner has failed to prove that the 7th Respondent is not in

possession of the property. On the other hand, the 7th Respondent has established that he

Page 6 of 6

was in possession throughout, by the order of the Magistrates Court in the case bearing

No. 66550/06/17.

Further, this Court notes that Section 56 of the Act imposes the bar to any person to

institute any civil action in the District Court when the matter is pending before the

Board.

According to His Lordship Tambiah J, in Hilda Perera v. Lawrence Perera (supra) at page

187,

The Debt Conciliation Ordinance was enacted to provide for the establishment of

a debt conciliation Board and other matters connected with the purposes for which

it was established. It was clearly a piece of legislation intended to give relief to

debtors. The language of Section 56 of the Ordinance is plain. It states that no

civil court shall entertain any action in respect of any matter pending before the

Board. By the word matter, is meant the particulars in the application. In my

view, the moment the application is received by the Board, the matters stated in

the application are pending before the Board. Thereafter, it is for the Board to

decide as to whether they wish to entertain the application or not.

In the instant application, the Board has correctly applied Section 56 in its decision

marked P8.

Therefore, we hold that the decision of the Board is lawful and they have acted within the

powers conferred by the Debt Conciliation Act.

Application dismissed with costs.
