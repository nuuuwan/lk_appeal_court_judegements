The factual matrix of this case is as follows:

According to the petition, in or around 2014, the Petitioners expertise was sought by a

group of people to find investors for a potential brick manufacturing project in Sri Lanka

consequent to which the Petitioner introduced one Dr. Rahul Chaturvedi, the Chief

Executive Officer of Moolex LLC to them. The Petitioner states that it was conveyed to

her that the investment required for the said project would be approximately USD 10 to

15 Million. After discussions, Dr. Chaturvedi informed the parties that he would need a

transaction fee of USD 110,000 to be retained to find investors. Thereafter, the Petitioner

was introduced to the 2nd Respondent who had agreed to pay the said transaction fee of

USD 110,000 to Dr. Chaturvedi. However, since the 2nd Respondent could not remit the

said amount to Dr. Chaturvedi, she had deposited a sum of Rs. 16,200,000/- which is

equivalent to USD 110,000 to the Petitioners account at NDB Bank. The Petitioner

further states that the Petitioners uncle from Australia, Mr. N.S. Jeganathan showed

interest in the project when he was told about the project and its development who

deposited various sums amounting to the sum of USD 110,000 to Dr. Chaturvedis account

as a part of his investment with Dr. Chaturvedi.

Page 4 of 13

The Petitioner states that according to the correspondence between the parties, the 2nd

Respondent with full knowledge deposited the said sum to the Petitioner to utilize it in

securing investments. This was disputed by the 2nd Respondent.

The Petitioner states that since the project did not take off, the Petitioner sent an email

to Dr. Chaturvedi giving information about the cancellation of the said project. By an

email dated 15.03.2016, the Petitioner and the 2nd Respondent requested the immediate

return of the funds. The Petitioner states that the parties agreed to an arrangement

whereby Dr. Chaturvedi agreed to repay the said sum of USD 110,000 with an interest of

12% per annum on the said sum until it is paid to the 2nd Respondent. However, since Dr.

Chaturvedi did not pay the said money and due to the consistent requests of the

Petitioner, and the 2nd Respondent, on 07.10.2018, Dr. Chaturvedi created a WhatsApp

group called Suranjani Update with the Petitioner, 2nd Respondent and Dr. Chaturvedi

himself. In the said group, the 2nd Respondent continuously demanded the money from

Dr. Chaturvedi and not from the Petitioner. The Petitioner further states that due to the

continuous neglect by Dr. Chaturvedi, the 2nd Respondent wrote to one of Dr. Chaturvedis

friends alleging that a fraud had been perpetrated on her by Dr. Chaturvedi.

Nevertheless, a complaint was lodged by the 2nd Respondent with the Criminal

Investigation Department for which by letter dated 13.01.2023 the Petitioner was called

upon to provide information on 18.01.2023. However, due to short notice, the Petitioner

was unable to comply and instead, on 29.01.2023 promptly endeavored to provide the

investigators with the full details of the transactions. Thereafter, as requested by the

Petitioner, 24.03.2023 was granted to furnish the documentation. Anyhow, the Petitioner

was unable to attend on that date and informed her inability to the Department by a

letter. The Petitioner states that after this letter by the Petitioner, there was no

communication from the said Department.

Page 5 of 13

On 19.04.2023, persons claiming to be from the Bambalapitiya Police visited her house

and the Petitioner found out after the inquiries that the facts have been reported to the

Chief Magistrates Court of Colombo. The Petitioner later came to know that, on

13.03.2023 by a B report filed by the Criminal Investigation Department, the Chief

Magistrates Court of Colombo was informed that the Petitioner was not assisting the

investigations and a travel ban had been obtained against the Petitioner as a result.

The Petitioner further avers that due to the high likelihood of being arrested, she has filed

an application for anticipatory bail before the Magistrates Court of Colombo bearing case

No. 90290/01/23 by a Motion dated 21/04/2023. The Petitioner pleads that she cannot be

made a suspect in proceedings in B84731/01/23 in the Magistrates Court of Colombo on

the basis that she has not committed any criminal offence.

The Petitioner states that the Petitioner has reasons to believe that the 1st Respondent

without any material would arrest the Petitioner on the allegation of cheating as alleged

by the 2nd Respondent in the case bearing No. 90290/01/23.

The Petitioners contention is that such arrest is unwarranted, unlawful and without any

authority as there is no material whatsoever incriminating the Petitioner in any criminal

offence.

In this context, the Petitioner has invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking inter

alia a writ of Prohibition preventing the Respondent from arresting the Petitioner on the

ground that she has committed any offence as alleged in the B-Report filed in proceedings

bearing No. B84731/01/23 in the Magistrates Court of Colombo and or any other offence

in relation to the said sum of Rs. 16,200,000/-.

On the other hand, the Respondents raised the preliminary objections that there is an

alternative remedy available for the Petitioner and that the Petitioner has suppressed the

material facts.

Page 6 of 13

The question before this Court is whether the transaction between the Petitioner and 2nd

Respondent is a commercial transaction or whether the said transaction falls under

dishonest misappropriation. The main allegation made by the 2nd Respondent in her

Written Submission dated 06.12.2024 is that she never agreed that the money would be

paid as a transaction fee to Dr. Chaturvedi who was not named as a suspect in the B-

report.

According to the 1st Respondent, the Respondents have filed a B report on the basis that

the investigation regarding the Petitioner in respect of charges under Sections 403, 386

and 389 of the Penal Code in respect of an alleged financial fraud of Rs. 16,200,000/- by

the Petitioner to the 2nd Respondent. The purpose of filing this writ application is to

prevent the arrest on the basis that there is no incriminating evidence against the

Petitioner and that she never had the dishonest intention to misappropriate the said fund.

This Court notes that this transaction has taken place in the year 2016. But the 2nd

Respondent made a complaint only in 2022 stating that she was cheated by the Petitioner.

When we peruse the documents tendered by the Petitioner, there is no indication that the

2nd Respondent made a complaint that she was cheated by the Petitioner prior to the said

complaint in 2022.

According to the Petitioner, the money from the 2nd Respondent was to secure investment.

As per the documents marked X4(a), and X4(b), in 2016, the Petitioner and the 2nd

Respondent have decided jointly to cancel the said project and requested Dr. Chaturvedi

to return the transaction fee.

As per document marked X7, upon such request, Dr. Chaturvedi has assured that he will

be back in Sri Lanka with a cheque to return the 2nd Respondents money where the 2nd

Respondent has acknowledged that the money has been sent to Dr. Chaturvedi.

Page 7 of 13

This Court also notes that in the police complaint, the 2nd Respondent has not mentioned

the so-called Dr Chaturvedi. The document marked X9 which was addressed to one of Dr.

Chaturvedis friends also indicates that the money was taken by Dr. Chaturvedi for an

investment and the 2nd Respondent has requested him to return these funds. Therefore,

it seems to me that, this money is involved with the investment of the project given to one

Dr. Chaturvedi.

The question thus is whether the Petitioner had the intention to defraud the 2nd

Respondent.

The Police have referred this transaction under the following Sections of the Penal Code.

Section 386

Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use any movable

property shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term

which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both

Section 389

Whoever commits criminal breach of trust shall be punished with imprisonment

of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or

with both.

Section 403

Whoever cheats and there by dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver

any property to any person, or to make, alter, or destroy the whole or any part of a

valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of

being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment of

either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be

liable to fine.

Page 8 of 13

For all three offences, the prosecution needs to prove that there was a mental element of

dishonesty and fraudulence. What is meant by dishonestly and fraudulently is defined

in the following Sections of the Penal Code.

Section 22

Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person,

or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.

Section 23

A person is said to do a thing fraudulently if he does that thing with intent to

defraud, but not otherwise.

In the instant case, there is no evidence to show that the Petitioner had an intention to

dishonest the said transaction. The fact remains that the money is with a third party with

the knowledge of the 2nd Respondent and she has not made a complaint against the said

third party.

The gravamen of the submission of the counsel for the Petitioner is that there is no

evidence to show that the Petitioner has the mental element to dishonest the 2nd

Respondent. This was considered by His Lordship S.N. Silva J (as he was then) in

Attorney-General V. Dewapriya Walgamage and another (1990) 2 Sri LR 212 at 222 it

was held that;

Dishonest intention is the element of mens rea of the offence of criminal

misappropriation as defined in Section 386 of the Penal Code. The commission of

the offence should be accompanied by such intention.

Further held that;

Page 9 of 13

Furthermore, dishonesty is the element of mens rea in relation to all three offences

of theft, cheating and criminal misappropriation. Lines of demarcation cannot be

drawn in respect of these offences only with reference to the element of mens rea.

(His Lordship has further held that there should be initial innocence taking for the

purpose of constituting the offence of criminal misappropriation. The requirement of

initial innocence was overruled by His Lordship Mark Fernando J in Walgamage V. The

Attorney General (2000) 3 SLR 1 and held that initial innocence taking was not necessary

for the purpose of constituting the offence of criminal misappropriation of property.)

This was followed by His Lordship L.T.B. Dehideniya J. (P.CA) (as he then was) in

Gotabaya Nandasena Rajapaksa V. Pujith Jayasundara and others, Court of Appeal case

No. 391/2017 Decided on 29.11.2017 and held that:

The Petitioners contention is that there is no misappropriation of any money in

the transaction. It is only a commercial transaction. Further the certificate on the

face of it is wrong.

Further held that;

The learned President Counsel submits that this is a commercial transaction

entered into by and between the corporation and the Foundation. The learned

Presidents Counsel further argues that there is no dishonest misappropriation.

Under Section 22 of the Penal Code, dishonesty is defined as Whoever does

anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful

loss to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly. In the instant case the

Petitioner had not gained anything wrongfully and there is no wrongful loss to any

person. The Counsel further argues that there is no misappropriation. Counsel

argues that it to be a misappropriation, firstly there should be an appropriation of

Page 10 of 13

the money for his own use, but in the instant case there is no appropriation by the

Petitioner.

Further held that;

In the case of Attorney-General V. Dewapriya Walgamage and another (1990) 2

Sri LR 212 it was held that;

1. (a) There are two basic ingredients to the offence of criminal

misappropriation under S. 386 of the Penal Code

i. A mental element of dishonesty, and

ii. An act of misappropriation or conversion of movable property to

his own use by the accused.

In the present case there is evidence to establish that there was no mental element

of dishonesty and no misappropriation.

In the instant case, we observe that there is no dispute that the money was given to the

person called Dr. Chaturvedi and there is no indication that was given without the

consent of the 2nd Respondent. Further, there is no evidence to show that the Petitioner

had the dishonest intention to deceive the 2nd Respondent fraudulently or dishonestly

inducing the 2nd Respondent to deliver the money. We are mindful that the essential

ingredient to constitute the offence of cheating was considered in the following judgment.

In Ram Jas v State of Uttar Pradesh 1974 AIR 1811, 1971 SCR (2) 178, the Supreme

Court enumerated the essential ingredients required to constitute the offence of cheating

as follows:

(1) There should be fraudulent or dishonest inducement of a person by deceiving

him; (2) (a) the person so deceived should be induced to deliver any property to any

person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property; or

Page 11 of 13

(b) the person so deceived should be intentionally induced to do or omit to do

anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived; and

(3) in cases covered by (2) (b), the act or omission should cause or is likely to cause

damage or harm to the person induced in body, mind, reputation or property.

This was considered by His Lordship N. Bandula Karunarathna J. (as he was then) in

Athputharaja Wijayarajan Vs. Attorney General, Court of Appeal Case No. CA 235/2011,

decided on 22.11.2021 and held that;

On evidence led in this case, it is abundantly clear that the main ingredient of the

offence of cheating "deception" has not been practised by the accused-appellant

towards the complainant.

There is no evidence to show that the Petitioner has deceived the 2nd Respondent into

parting with a sum of Rs. 16,200,000/-. On the other hand, the Petitioners position is that

she has transferred the amount to a third party namely Dr. Chaturvedi. Therefore, the

Petitioner has not gained anything wrongfully. To prove misappropriation, there should

be evidence that the Petitioner has utilized such money for her own use. The documents

speak that there is no intention of defrauding.

Thus, this Court is of the opinion that criminal liability cannot be imposed on the

Petitioner as there is no evidence or material whatsoever to prove the intention of the

Petitioner to cheat and thereby dishonestly induce the 2nd Respondent to credit the said

transaction fee to the Petitioners bank account.

I am mindful of the principle of the Writ of Prohibition as discussed in the following

authorities.

MP Jain and S N Jain, Principles of Administrative Law, 7th edition 2011, Volume 02, at page 2388;

Similar is the case with prohibition. As Lord Denning observed in R v. Grater London Council;

Page 12 of 13

Just as the scope of Certiorari has been extended to administrative

authorities, so also with prohibition. It is available to prohibit

administrative authorities from exceeding their powers, r misusing them.

In particular, it can prohibit a licencing authority from making rules or

granting licences which permit conduct that is contrary to law.

Further,

On the other hand, the object of prohibition is prevention rather than cure.

Prohibition is issued when the proceedings before the concerned body are still

pending and the matter has not been disposed of but is still being considered by

the concerned decision-making body. The function of prohibition is to prohibit the

body concerned from proceeding with the matter further. If proceedings before the

concerned body have come to an end then only certiorari can be issued as there

remains nothing to prohibit.

For example, if a tribunal takes up for hearing a matter which lies outside its

jurisdiction, the concerned person can seek a writ of prohibition from the High

Court to prohibit the tribunal from continuing the proceedings further. If, on the

other hand, the tribunal has already rendered its decision, then the party

concerned seeks a certiorari to quash the decision of the tribunal. There may be a

proceeding before an inferior body where both certiorari and prohibition may lie.

If the tribunal has decided something without finally disposing of the matter, then

the interested person can seek certiorari to quash what has been decided and

prohibition to stop the tribunal from proceeding further in the matter. Thus,

certiorari and prohibition differ from each other from a functional point of view.

C.F. Forsyth and I.J. Ghosh, Wade and Forsyths Administrative Law, twelfth Edition,

page 483

Although a prohibiting order was originally used to prevent tribunals from

meddling with cases over which they had no jurisdiction, it was equally effective

(and equally often used) to prohibit the execution of an already-taken, ultra-vires

decision. As long as the tribunal or administrative authority still had some power

to exercise as a consequence of the wrongful decision, the exercise of that power

could be restrained by a prohibiting order.

Page 13 of 13

In view of the reasoning provided above, we hold that the transaction involved in this

application is purely a commercial transaction and there is no evidence incriminating the

Petitioner of the offences alleged. We further hold that the Petitioner has established the

grounds as prayed for in the petition. Therefore, this Court issues a writ in the nature of

Prohibition as prayed for in prayer (c), prohibiting the 1st Respondent from arresting the

Petitioner on the ground that she has committed any offence as set out/alleged in the B-

Report filed in proceedings bearing No. B84731/01/23 in the Magistrates Court of Colombo

produced marked X12 and/or any other offence in relation to the said sum of Rs

16,200,000/=.
