Background of the Petitioners case

3) There are 94 Petitioners in the caption of the petition who were

public officers who held permanent pensionable posts in the

Public Service and retired during the period between 1st January

2016 to 31st December 2019.

4) The Petitioners have contended, as Public Servants they are

entitled for a pension upon fulfilling the relevant criteria

stipulated in the minutes on pensions and the relevant Circulars

issued from time to time by the Secretary to the Ministry of Public

Administration and Director General of the Department of

Pensions.

5) The Petitioners have emphasized that the Public Administration

Circular No. 3/2016 (hereinafter referred to as PAC 3/2016) dated

25th February 2016 which is marked and produced as P2 replaced

the salary scale introduced by the Public Administration Circular

No.6/2006 dated 25th April 2006.

6) Schedule II of the PAC 3/2016 had demonstrated the new salary

scales introduced that were to be implemented in 5 phases from

1st January 2016 to 1st January 2020.

7) As per clause 5 of the PAC 3/2016, pension of the officers who

retire shall be revised accordingly and instruction with regard to

the revision shall be issued in due course by the relevant

authority. This fact is emphasized in the relevant Circular.

C.A. WRIT 148 -2020

25

However, no revision shall be made in the pension during the

period from 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2019.

8) The contention of the Petitioners is, as they have retired during

the period of 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2019, the

applicable Circular is PAC 3/2016.

9) Therefore, as per the said Circular their pension should be

increased accordingly.

10) The issue pertinent to this application had arisen after the 1st

Respondent issued the Public Administration Circular No.

35/2019 (hereinafter referred to as PAC 35/2019) dated 10th

November 2019 which is marked and produced as P4.

11) As per the P4 document (PAC 35/2019) Cabinet Ministers had

decided on 11th November 2019 to consider the pension of the

officers who retired during the period between 1st January 2016

and 31st December 2019 shall be revised based on the salary as at

1st January 2020.

12) On that the revised pension shall be paid with effect from 1st

January 2020.

13) Subsequently, the 1st Respondent issued Public Administration

Circular No. 35/2019(i) (hereinafter referred to as PAC 35/2019(i))

which is marked and produced as P5 dated 20th February 2020

stating Cabinet Ministers had decided in a meeting held on 2nd

January 2020 to suspend the operation of the PAC 35/2019 dated

10.12 2019 until the anomalies pertinent to all pensioners are

resolved according to the policies of the new government.

14) In respect of the said P5 Circular, the 95th Petitioner on behalf of

the 1st to 94th Petitioners had sent letters to the President and

Prime Minister to withdraw the said PAC 35/2019(i) stating the

hardship they faced due to the suspension.

C.A. WRIT 148 -2020

26

15) Further the said Petitioner had demanded from the 1st

Respondent to revise the pension scheme in terms of PAC 3/2016

and PAC 35/2019.

16) As the Petitioners had not received any positive reply, the

contention of the Petitioners is the decision contained in PAC

35/2019(i) is ultra vires, arbitrary and unreasonable.

17) On the said grounds, the Petitioners have sought reliefs from this

court to invoke the Writ Jurisdiction.

Facts pertinent to the objections of the 1st to 20th Respondents

18) The Respondents had taken the following three preliminary

objections against the application made by the Petitioners;

1. The Petitioners application is futile

2. The Petitioners are guilty of laches

3. The Petitioners petition is misconceived and/or wrongful in

Law

19) The Respondents have contended as per clause 5.1 of the PAC

3/2016 stipulates that the pension of Public Officers who retire

after 1st January 2016 would be calculated based on the last salary

point received as at the time of retirement.

20) However, clause 5.2 of the PAC 3/2016 had specified salary scales

stipulated will be fully implemented (i.e. - after 01.01.2020).

Further it had stated the said revision will take place only on

further instructions received in respect of the same.

21) However, in the said Circulars R4 and R5, had indicated that the

pension payable, pursuant to the possible revision as reflected in

item XIII of the award of pension was included for ease of

administration.

C.A. WRIT 148 -2020

27

22) The PAC 35/2019 had been issued in order to give effect to the

aforesaid Cabinet decision. Subsequently the Cabinet had decided

to suspend the operation of P4 Circular.

23) On the said grounds, the Respondents have pleaded PAC

35/2019(i) gives effect to a public policy decision that was taken by

the Cabinet of Ministers and the said Cabinet decision is marked

as R7. The R7 decision is not amenable to the Writ Jurisdiction.

24) Thus, the Respondents had moved to dismiss the application made

by the Petitioners.

Disputed facts

25) This matter was taken up for argument on 3rd April 2024.

Counsels representing the Petitioners and the Respondents

concluded their argument.

26) Considering the facts, documents and the arguments put forward

by the Counsels, I will draw my attention to the following points to

arrive at my conclusion

I. Has the 1st Respondent issued Circulars P2 and P4?

II. Are the Petitioners entitled to receive their pension as per P2

and P4?

III. Has the 1st Respondent issued a Public Administration

Circular 35/2019(i) marked as P5?

IV. If so, are the Petitioners entitled to receive their pension in

accordance to the P2 and P4 Circular or should it be

suspended by P5 Circular?

C.A. WRIT 148 -2020

28

I. Has the 1st Respondent issued Circulars P2 and P4?

27) The main contention of the Petitioners is that the Secretary to the

Ministry of Public Administration and Management had issued

PAC 3/2016. By the said Circular it has specified revision of the

salaries in the Public Service. The annexure to the said salary

Circular, the salary structure for the Pubic Service had categorized

that the Public Servants are entitled for the said salary structure.

28) Subsequently, the secretary to the Ministry of Public

Administration had issued PAC 35/2019. In the said Circular it is

stated the Public servants who are retiring after 1st January 2016

and before 1st January 2020 and/or who are entitled to retire

during that period, are entitled to get their retirement pension on

the revised base as at 1st January 2020 contained in Schedule 1 of

the PAC 3/2016.

29) In P4 Circular it is specified that the said revised pension shall be

paid with effect from 1st January 2020. The said Circular P4 had

been issued after the Cabinet decision made on 11th November

2019.

30) Therefore, the said two Circulars have correctly demonstrated the

revised pension of the officers who retired during 1st January 2016

to 1st January 2020.

31) On the said circumstances, it is obvious that the 1st Respondent

had issued P2 and P4 Circulars.

C.A. WRIT 148 -2020

29

II. Are the Petitioners entitled to receive their pension as per

P2 and P4?

32) As I have discussed above the P2 revision of service in the Public

Service Circular had been issued on 25th February 2016.

33) Based on P2 Circular the Cabinet had decided on 11th November

2019 the Public Officers who retired from service during the period

between 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2019 are entitled for

their revised pension, based on the salaries as at 1st January 2020

contained in schedule 1 of P2 Circular. The said revised pension

should be paid with effect from 1st January 2020.

34) The P4 Circular was issued on 10th December 2019. On the face of

it as per the P4 Circular until the said Circular is valid the

Petitioners were entitled to receive retirement pension based on the

P4 Circular.

III. Has the 1st Respondent issued a Public Administration

Circular 35/2019(i) marked as P5?

35) The 1st Respondent had issued PAC 35/2019(i) on 20th January

2020. This Circular had been issued after issuing the P4 Circular

on 10th December 2019. It seems the said Circular had been

issued within a period of one month and ten days from the latter.

36) By the said Circular the cabinet had decided to suspend the PAC

35/2019 which is marked and produced as P4. The dispute in the

instant action had arisen after the issuance of the P5 Circular

suspending the P4 Circular.

37) The Counsel for the Petitioners argued that the said Circular is

irrational and unreasonable for suspending the revised Pension

C.A. WRIT 148 -2020

30

Scheme. And the said impugned decision is a policy decision, and

policy decisions are not immune from judicial review. However,

the Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the Respondents

argued that the policy decisions cannot be challenged in this court

and court should refrain from interfering with it by issuing the

reliefs sought by the Petitioners.

38) On the said grounds it is obvious that the P5 Circular had been

issued by the 1st Respondent after the cabinet had taken the

decision on 2nd January 2020.

IV. If so, are the Petitioners entitled to receive their pension

in accordance to the P2 and P4 Circular or should it be

suspended by P5 Circular?

39) On the face of P2 and P4, the Petitioners are entitled for a revised

pension. However, within a short period of time the P5 Circular

had been issued and suspended P4 Circular.

40) On perusal of R8 and R9 documents, the Cabinet had observed in

the event an increased revised pension is granted to a particular

category of government servants it may lead to an anomaly in the

pensions.

41) Further, the said decision had been taken in the cabinet

memorandum based on the impending changes of government

policy rectifying all anomalies of the pension scheme.

42) On the said grounds by R8 cabinet memorandum the P2 and P4

Circulars had been suspended. When observing R6, R7, R8, R9

documents, specifically the R8 document emphasized and justified

the decision taken by the cabinet. It is specified in the said

C.A. WRIT 148 -2020

31

document; in the event the pension is increased for one category it

may lead to an anomaly in the pensions.

43) In relation to that I draw my attention to the judgement in the case

of M.K.B. Herath v A. Jagath D. Dias1. In the said judgement

Justice Karalliyadde was of the view that the Petitioner does not

have a right to demand to adjust his pension. For the reasons

given in that case he had sighted Gunawardene v Attorney

General2;

Rule 1 expressly provides that public

servants have no absolute right to any

pension or allowance under these rules

44) In that case it is analyzed; the Public Servants are not entitled for

pension as an absolute right in terms of the regulations of the

minutes of pensions. I reproduce paragraph 01 of page 11 of

Justice Karalliyaddes judgement as follows;

It is evident from the above stated case

laws that, a Writ Mandamus to claim the

Petitioner must have a legal right and the

Respondents should have a

corresponding public duty to perform

towards the Petitioner. Since the

Petitioner in the instant application has no

legal right to get his pension adjusted in

terms of the P9 and the Respondents

have no public duty to adjust his pension

1 CA(Writ)Application 38/2020 2 47 NLR 359

C.A. WRIT 148 -2020

32

provided in P9 he is not entitled to Writ of

Mandamus.

45) On the said expression it is obvious, government servants do not

have an absolute right or entitlement for pension.

46) Beside these facts, I draw my attention to the two Indian

judgements referred to in the synopsis of the Respondents;

In Sidheswar Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd v Union of

India3;

It was held;

Normally the Court should not interfere in

policy matter which is within the purview

of the government unless it is shown to be

contrary to law or inconsistent with the

provisions of the Constitution

In Ugar Sugar Works Ltd v Delhi Administration and others4

the Indian Supreme Court observed;

It is well settled that the courts, in exercise

of the power of judicial review, do not

ordinarily interfere with the policy decisions

of the Executive unless the policy can be

faulted on grounds of mala fide,

unreasonableness, arbitrariness or

unfairness etc. indeed, arbitrariness,

irrationality, perversity and mala fide will

render the policy unconstitutional. However,

if the policy cannot be faulted on any of 3 (2005) 3 SCC 369 4 (2001) 3 SCC 635

C.A. WRIT 148 -2020

33

these grounds, the mere facts that it would

hurt business interests of a party, does not

justify invalidating the policy.

47) In the said judgements the Indian Supreme Court had observed

that Court should not interfere in policy matters unless it is shown

to be contrary.

48) As per the aforesaid judgements, court should not exercise their

power of judicial review and interfere with the policy decisions of

the executive. The said policy decisions can be faulted on the

grounds of mala fide, unreasonableness, arbitrariness or

unfairness.

49) In the instant application, R8 cabinet memorandum had been

issued to consider the anomalies and to correct it.

50) On the said grounds, if the P2 and P4 pension scheme is allowed to

operate there will be prejudice caused to the other categories of the

pensioners. I am of the view this court cannot allow such an event

to take place until the government takes a correct policy decision

to rectify the anomalies. His Lordship Justice J.A.N. De Silva, in

the case of Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v Messers

Jaffergee and Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd5 had taken the following

position;

There is rich and profuse case law on

mandamus, on the conditions to be

satisfied by the applicant. Some of the

conditions precedent to the issue of

mandamus appears to be;

5 2005(1) SLR Page 89

C.A. WRIT 148 -2020

34

a) The application must have a legal

right to the performance of a legal duty by

the parties against whom the mandamus

is soughtthe foundation of mandamus

is the existence of a legal right.

b) The right to be enforced must be a

public right and the duty sought to be

enforced must be of a public nature

It was further stated by His Lordship Justice J.A.N.

De Silva that;

Whether the facts show the existence of

any or all pre-requisites to the granting of

the Writ is a question of law in each case

to be decided, not in any rigid or technical

view of the question, but according to a

sound and reasonable interpretation. The

Court will not grant a Mandamus to

enforce a right not of a legal but purely

equitable nature however extreme the

inconvenience to which the applicant

might be put.

51) In the case of Kaluarachchi v Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

and others6 Fernando J stated;

The foundation of Mandamus is the

existence of a legal right. A court should

not grant a Writ of Mandamus to enforce

6 SC Appeal No. 43/2013; SC Minutes of 19th June 2019

C.A. WRIT 148 -2020

35

a right which is not legal and not based

upon a public duty.

52) In the aforesaid cases, it is decided Writ of Mandamus could be

issued when a legal right of the Petitioner is violated and the

Respondents should have a corresponding Public Duty to Perform

towards the Petitioner.

53) In the instant application of the Petitioners, as I have stated above

the Petitioners have failed to prove that a legal right which they are

entitled for by P2 and P4 is violated by the Respondents.

54) On the said grounds I do not see any reason to issue Writ of

Mandamus and /or Writ of Certiorari to quash the P5 document.

55) Beside these facts, I do not see any merit to consider the three

preliminary objections raised by the Respondents and based on the

facts above I have decided that the Petitioners cannot seek any

reliefs under the Writ Jurisdiction

CONCLUSION

56) In view of the aforesaid facts, documents and written submissions,

I dismiss the petition dated 1st July 2020.

57) No cost ordered.
