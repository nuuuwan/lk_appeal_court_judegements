This is an application by the plaintiff-petitioner-petitioner (hereinafter referred

to as the petitioner) seeking to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction granted to this

Court in terms of Article 138 of The Constitution.

This is a matter where the petitioner has instituted an action before the

Magistrates Court of Colombo by way of a private plaint filed in terms of section

136(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, naming the accused-respondent-

respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) as the accused of the

action.

The said action has been filed on the basis that the respondent committed an

offence punishable in terms of section 25(1)(b) of the Debt Recovery (Special

Provisions) Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act).

The complaint had been to the effect that the cheque issued by the company

where the respondent was a director was dishonoured by the relevant bank and

it amounts to an offence as stated above. The petitioner has filed an affidavit as

well as several documents, including the cheque clearing information issued by

the relevant bank, and a document to show that the respondent is a director of

the company, which issued the cheque to substantiate the private plaint filed by

him.

When this matter was supported for summons on the respondent, the learned

Magistrate of Colombo by the order dated 03-03-2021 has refused to issue

summons to the respondent.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner has filed an application in

revision in terms of Article 154P of The Constitution before the High Court of the

Western Province Holden in Colombo.

Page 5 of 12

After notice being issued in that regard to the respondent, the matter has been

set for argument. It had been later agreed to conclude the matter by way of

written submissions filed by the parties.

The learned High Court Judge of his order dated 11-07-2023 has dismissed the

revision application on the basis that he has no reason to interfere with the order

of the learned Magistrate of Colombo.

The petitioner being aggrieved of the said judgment preferred this application in

revision seeking redress. This Court after having considered the relevant facts

and the circumstances, decided to issue notice on the respondents mentioned,

and the parties were allowed to file their objections and counter objections in

that regard.

At the hearing of this application, this Court heard the submissions of the

learned Counsel for the petitioner as well as that of the learned Counsel for the

accused-respondent. Although this was a matter where the dispute had been

between two private parties, since the Hon. Attorney General has been named as

the respondent-respondent before this Court, the Hon. Attorney General was

also represented at the hearing of this matter.

It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the action

under the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act law was correctly filed before

the Magistrates Court of Colombo. It was his complaint that when this matter

was supported for notice, submissions were made justifying the issue of

summons. However, the learned Magistrate of Colombo by her impugned order

has refused to issue summons on a wrong premise by looking for evidence that

should have been considered at a properly conducted trial.

It was his position that the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court

of the Western Province Holden in Colombo too was erred when the learned High

Court Judge went on to consider the required standard of proof and the evidence

that should have been led in a properly conducted trial to determine that the

petitioner has failed to adduce sufficient evidence for the learned Magistrate to

Page 6 of 12

issue summons to the respondent. He moved for the setting aside of both the

impugned judgment and the order on the basis that they are contrary to law and

that there are exceptional circumstances before the Court to exercise the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Court.

The learned Counsel for the respondent raised a preliminary objection on the

basis that the petitioner has failed to provide sufficient exceptional grounds,

which necessitate the intervention of this Court by exercising the discretionary

power of revision, which is a special jurisdiction granted to this Court by The

Constitution.

He submitted that the learned Magistrate has correctly refused to issue

summons and the learned High Court Judge also has determined the matter

after considering the relevant law exhaustively. It was his view that there cannot

be any reason to interfere with the said orders.

He submitted that the petitioner is attempting to take out of context what the

learned Magistrate has stated in her order at page 3 (page 121 of the brief) where

it has been stated that the Court needs to be satisfied of not only the issuing of

the cheque, but also whether the cheque has been issued with the intention of

not honouring the same before issuing summons. He urged the Court to dismiss

the revision application on the basis that it has no merit.

It was the view of the learned Senior State Counsel who represented the Hon.

Attorney General that section 25(1) of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act

envisages three situations under which a person can be held criminally liable. It

was pointed out that since the plaint has been filed as a private plaint, the

learned Magistrate should have resorted to the provisions of section 139 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act, and if need arises, should take evidence under

oath before issuing summons. She invited the Court to pronounce a suitable

judgment in relation to the application before the Court.

It appears from the impugned order of the learned Additional Magistrate of

Colombo, pronounced on 03-03-2021, that the issuing of summons has been

Page 7 of 12

refused on the basis that there are insufficient grounds to come to a conclusion

that the accused mentioned in the draft plaint has committed an offence under

the Act.

It appears that the learned Magistrate has taken guidance from the judgment in

the case of Malinie Gunaratne, Additional District Judge Galle Vs.

Abeysinghe and Another (1994) 3 SLR 196, where it was held;

When a private plaint is filed, section 139(1) requires a Magistrate to from

an opinion as to whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding against

some person who is not in custody. The opinion to be formed should related

to the offence, the commission of which, is alleged in the complaint or plaint

filed under section 136(1). The words sufficient ground embraces both the

ingredients of the offence and the evidence of its commission. Since the

opinion relates to the existence of sufficient ground for proceeding against

the person accused, the material acted upon by the Magistrate should

withstand an objective assessment. The proper test is to ascertain whether

on the material before the Court, prima facie, there is sufficient ground on

which it may be reasonably inferred that the offence alleged in the complaint

or plaint has been committed by the person who is accused of it.

As correctly viewed by the learned Magistrate in her order, the procedure that

should be adopted in determining whether there is a sufficient ground has been

set out in section 139 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. It provides for a

Magistrate to call for evidence if it becomes necessary, before issuing summons

on an accused person.

In the instant matter, the learned Magistrate has relied on the plaint and the

supporting documents filed by the petitioner before the Court and also the

submissions made on behalf of the petitioner by his Counsel. In her

determination, it has been determined that to impose a criminal liability on the

accused in terms of section 25 of the Act, a criminal act and a criminal intention

should be established. Therefore, it is necessary for her to consider whether the

Page 8 of 12

cheque, which has been dishonoured, has been issued with the intention of not

honouring the same.

In determining so, the learned Magistrate has held that although the petitioner

has stated that the cheque for Rs. 500,000/- was issued for a business purpose,

the petitioner has failed to produce a valid contract or other document to

establish the matter, and it is difficult for the Court to believe that a businessman

would enter into a financial transaction of this nature without entering into a

written agreement. It has also been determined that the cheque relating to the

cheque clearance notice attached to the plaint is a cash cheque, and there is no

proof to show whether it was a cheque given to the petitioner. It has also been

determined that although the petitioner has filed a document to show that the

accused is a director of the company that issued the cheque, the petitioner has

failed to produce a document to show, in fact, whether the accused was a director

of the company at the time the cheque has been allegedly issued.

On the above-mentioned basis, the learned Magistrate has determined that since

framing a charge against an accused person is the prerogative of the Magistrate

in terms of section 182 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, she is not in a

position to determine that there are reasonable grounds to justify filing action

against the accused. It is on the above-mentioned basis; the learned Magistrate

has determined that there are insufficient grounds to issue summons.

With due respect to the manner in which the learned Magistrate has determined

not to issue summons, I have no basis to agree with the reasoning given in that

regard. There cannot be any argument that when a private plaint is filed, a

Magistrate needs to be satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to issue

summons to an accused person mentioned. However, it is my view that when

determining whether sufficient grounds exist, the Court must look into that in

relation to the charge preferred against the accused mentioned.

In the instant matter, the charge has been framed in terms of section 25 of the

Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 02 of 1990 as amended by Debt

Page 9 of 12

Recovery (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 09 of 1994, which reads as

follows.

25. (1) Any person who,

(a) knowingly draws a cheque which is dishonoured by a bank

for want of funds; or

(b) gives an order to a banker to pay a sum of money, which

payment is not made by reason of there being no obligation on

such banker to make payment or the order given being

subsequently countermanded with a dishonest intention,

or; and

(c) gives an authority to an institution to pay a sum of money

to itself, in payment of a debt or loan or any part thereof owed

to such institution, from, and out of an account maintained or

funds deposited, by such person with such institution and such

institution is unable to make such payment to itself by reason

of such person not placing adequate funds in such account or

by reason of the funds deposited having been withdrawn by

reason of such person countermanding the authority given or

by reason of any one or more of such reasons ; or

(d) having accepted an inland bill refuses payment dishonestly;

shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall on

conviction by a Magistrate alter summary trial be liable to

punishment with imprisonment of either description for a term

which may extend to one year or with fine of ten thousand

rupees or ten per centum of the full value of the cheque, order,

authority or inland bill in respect of which the offence is

committed, whichever is higher, or with both such fine and

imprisonment.

Page 10 of 12

It is clear that the necessary ingredients to prove a charge in terms of section

25(1)(b) of the Act would be to prove that the drawer of the cheque made an order

to the banker to pay a sum of money for which payment was not made by reason

of there being no obligation on the banker to make payment.

It is quite apparent from the copy of the Magistrates Court case record tendered

along with this application that the petitioner has tendered along with the plaint,

a draft charge sheet, an affidavit, list of witnesses and documents, and

documents marked X-1 to X-4 in order to support the application. The

supporting documents include a letter sent on behalf of the petitioner to the

accused company informing them that the petitioner would take steps to initiate

proceedings in terms of the Act, the cheque clearing information provided by the

bank where the bank has returned the cheque without honouring it for the

reason that the account relating to the cheque has been closed, and a document

issued by the Registrar of Companies to show that the accused is a director of

the relevant company.

The said documents clearly establish the fact that the company in which the

accused is a director has issued a cheque which has been dishonoured by the

relevant bank because the account has been closed, which clearly establishes a

prima facie ground to justify filing action in terms of section 25(1)(b) of the Act.

Although this section is not a section where strict liability can be imposed, and

a section which requires to prove the dishonest intention as well, it is a matter

that has to be proved by way of evidence placed before the Court. I am of the

view that the matters considered by the learned Magistrate in refusing to issue

summons are matters that should have been determined after a proper trial held

in that regard, and not matters that can be determined at the stage of considering

whether to issue summons or not. The question whether the accused was a

director or not at the time the cheque was issued and whether a liability can be

imposed upon him are matters that need to be considered if there is any objection

Page 11 of 12

in that regard, which can be raised only after the relevant accused is present

before the Court.

In the case of S.C. Appeal No. 182/2017 decided on 12-01-2023, Aluvihare,

P.C., J. expressed the following view.

At this juncture, it would be pertinent to consider the liability under the

penal provision referred to above. It is clear that the provision is not a strict

liability provision and a mental element is part of the offence.

In an instance where a cheque is dishonoured due to lack of sufficient funds,

the requisite mental element is knowledge on the part of the accused,

whereas when the reason for a cheque to be dishonoured is either the same

being countermanded or closure of the account after the cheque was issued,

when the mental element that has to be established is one of dishonesty.

It is my view, that in a prosecution under section 25 of the Act, the reason

or the reasons as to the issuance of the cheque is not relevant, as the nature

of the transaction is immaterial as far as the offence is concerned.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the learned Additional

Magistrate of Colombo was wrong when she refused to issue summons to the

accused mentioned in the draft charge.

When the said decision was challenged before the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province Holden in Colombo, I find that the learned High Court Judge

has also determined the matter by failing to look into the question at hand. It

appears that the learned High Court Judge has gone into the merits of the case

by considering the necessary ingredients that needs to be proved in a case of this

nature, which are matters that should be considered after a properly conducted

trial, and not at the stage of issuing summons where the requirement is to

consider whether there is a sufficient ground to issue summons.

I am unable to agree with the learned High Court Judges view that the petitioner

has failed to adduce sufficient exceptional grounds which needs the intervention

Page 12 of 12

of the Court, which in my view, was a determination made without properly

considering the legal principles that govern an application of this nature.

I am of the view that the petitioner has adduced sufficient exceptional grounds

for this Court to intervene and set aside the order dated 03-03-2021 pronounced

by the learned Additional Magistrate of Colombo and also the judgment dated

11-07-2023 pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High

Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo.

Accordingly, I set aside both the said order and the judgment as both cannot be

allowed to stand.

I direct the learned Additional Magistrate of Colombo to issue summons to the

accused mentioned in the plaint and the draft charge, and proceed therefrom to

conclude the matter as expeditiously as possible.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High

Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo for information and to the

Magistrates Court of Colombo for necessary compliance.
