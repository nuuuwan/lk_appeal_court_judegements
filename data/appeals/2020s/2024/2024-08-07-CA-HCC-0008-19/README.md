Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Anuradhapura for causing the death of one Sandunika

Upeksha Lakmali at a place called Sampathgama, Sudharshanagama within the

jurisdiction of the High Court of Anuradhapura on or about 21-06-2005, and

thereby committing the offence of murder, punishable in terms of section 296 of

the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura of his

judgment dated 06-02-2019, found the appellant guilty as charged, and

accordingly, sentenced him to death.

On the basis of being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the

appellant preferred this appeal.

Facts in Brief

The evidence led at the trial shows that the deceased had been a 3-year-old minor

girl child when she faced this unfortunate death. The evidence also reveals that

the deceased child had been handed over to the appellant and his wife to be

cared for by the grandmother of the child, who was the person who had the

custody of her before she was handed over to the appellant and his wife.

Page 3 of 11

The evidence given by several fellow villagers shows that the child had been ill-

treated and subjected to assault and various other forms of cruelty while being

under the care of the appellant and his wife. The evidence also reveals that the

appellant and his wife had been attempting to hand over the child to an

institution as they could not afford to care for the child. The evidence given by

the Grama Niladhari of the area and the Child Welfare Officer reveals that fact.

According to the evidence of PW-07 Sumanawathi, who was the sister of the

appellants wife, on the day of the incident, the appellant has come to her house

which was situated near the house of the appellant around 12.30 1.00 in the

afternoon, while carrying the deceased child. She has observed the childs neck

tilted to one side and the child was unconscious.

When questioned, the appellant has replied that while coming towards their

house both of them fell. Thereafter, on her advice, the appellant has taken the

child to be admitted to the hospital. She has come to know later that the child

has passed away.

According to the evidence of PW-10, while he was going to the boutique to

purchase some provisions, he has seen a person walking with a small child while

the child being repeatedly assaulted using a stick. The child has been crying

which has alerted the witness to observe what was happening. He has seen this

incident about 50 meters away from the place where he was, and has thought

that he would have been the father of the child. He has identified the appellant

at the trial as the person who was assaulting the child at that time.

According to the evidence of PW-11, the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who

conducted the post-mortem of the deceased child, marked as X-1 during the

trial, has observed 13 external injuries and 3 internal injuries on her body. The

main injury observed, namely the injury number 01, had been to the left side of

the forehead which was an oval shaped contusion. While giving evidence, the

JMO has explained in detail the injury number 01 and opined that it has been

caused by using force on the childs head and was of the opinion that it was the

Page 4 of 11

injury that had caused the death. The injury number 02 and 03 had also been

contusions near the right-side ear and the eye of the child. The 4th, 5th and 6th

injuries identified had been 27 finger nail abrasions on the cheeks and the chin

of the child. He has opined that such fingernail abrasions can occur when

someone attempts to cover the face of the child and when the child resists such

attempts. The injury number 07 was also a group of abrasions over the right side

of the chest just below the armpit. The injury number 08 had been a group of

similar injuries on the left side of the chest just below the left armpit. The JMO

has opined that such injuries can occur when someone holds a child of this

tender age from the two armpits and violently shakes or violently lifts such child.

The injury number 09, 10 and 11 has been scars of an injury that had occurred

previously, and the JMO has described them as burn injuries. The injury number

12 and 13 had been described as scars observed on the two knee joints, which

may be a result of a fall.

The internal injury number 14 has been identified as a tear of the upper lip of

the child. The JMO has opined that this kind of injury cannot occur as a result

of a fall without causing corresponding injuries to the face, and has opined that

this injury has been caused by an intentional assault. The injury number 15 was

a subdural haemorrhage to the head, which has caused internal bleeding. The

JMO has opined that such an injury can occur due to an assault or applying

force onto the head, and he has also opined that such an injury can happen as

a result of a motor traffic accident or even due to a fall or an accident.

The injury number 16 has also been an internal injury caused to the frontal lobe

of the brain. The JMO has opined that the said injury was an injury caused as a

result of the injury number 01 observed by him.

Giving evidence, the JMO has clearly opined that the injuries which caused the

death of the child cannot occur as a result of a fall, and has given a detailed

reasoning for his opinion.

After leading the evidence of police witnesses who had conduced investigations

into the matter, the prosecution has closed its case. Accordingly, the learned

High Court Judge has decided to call for a defence of the appellant.

The appellant has decided to make a dock statement. He has admitted that the

deceased child was given to him and his wife to be looked after, and has claimed

that since they could not afford to look after her, he took the child on the day of

the incident in order to hand over the child to her grandmother. Since he could

not handover as no one was at the house of the grandmother, he has claimed

that he returned to Nochchiyaagama along with the child, and while walking

towards his house, the child ran in front of him on the bank of the bridge they

were passing.

Although he shouted at her not to run and also assaulted her with a small stick,

she has continued to run and had fallen off the bank and rolled over. He has

claimed that when he ran towards her to check, but the child was unconscious,

and believing that she has suffered a blockage of phlegm, he held her cheeks

tight, opened her mouth and attempted to remove the phlegm, but failed.

Thereafter, he has claimed that he took the child to his house and after obtaining

some money, brought the child to the hospital. He has claimed innocence and

stated that he did not commit a crime.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, although the learned Counsel for the appellant has

formulated several other grounds of appeal in his written submissions, the

following grounds of appeal were urged before the Court.

1. There was no direct evidence against the appellant, but the conviction

was based on circumstantial evidence. The learned High Court Judge

failed to appreciate suspicious circumstances when analyzing the

evidence.

2. The learned High Court Judge has compartmentalized the evidence.

Page 6 of 11

3. The learned High Court Judge has wrongly applied the provisions of

section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance to the facts of this case.

4. The learned High Court Judge has relied entirely on the expert evidence

in order to convict the appellant.

Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal

As the grounds of appeal urged are interrelated, I will now proceed to consider

the said grounds of appeal together.

There had been no eyewitnesses to the incident where the deceased child had

suffered injuries that led to her death. Therefore, there cannot be any argument

that the prosecution has relied on circumstantial evidence to prove its case.

Before considering the evidence led before the trial Court to come to a conclusion

whether the prosecution has placed sufficient circumstantial evidence to prove

the charge beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant, I find it appropriate

to discuss the legal principles that has to be considered in a case where the

prosecution has relied on circumstantial evidence.

In the case of The King Vs. Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 it was held:

Per Soertsz, J.,

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the jury must be

satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused and

inconsistent with any reasonable hypotheses of his innocence.

In the case of Don Sunny Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 01, it was

held:

1) When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the

proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must

irresistibly point towards only inference that the accused committed the

offence. On consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can

be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

Page 7 of 11

2) If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence, if an

inference can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the

accused, then one cannot say that the charges have been proved beyond

reasonable doubt.

3) If upon consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence the

only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the

offence, then they can be found guilty. The prosecution must prove that

no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of committing the

offence. The accused can be found guilty only if the proved items of

circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent

with their innocence.

In the first ground of appeal, the learned Counsel submitted that the learned

High Court Judge, in the process of considering the circumstantial evidence

against the appellant, has failed to consider that those circumstantial evidence

only provides for suspicious circumstances against the appellant.

However, it is trite law that in a case where only circumstantial evidence is

available, one piece of evidence, although it may provide only suspicious

circumstances to connect an accused person to the crime, that in itself cannot

be viewed as a reason to dismiss such a piece of evidence.

In the case of King Vs. Gunaratne 47 NLR 145, it was held:

In a case of circumstantial evidence, the facts given in evidence may, taken

cumulatively, be sufficient to rebut the presumption of innocence, although

each fact, when taken separately, may be a circumstance only of suspicion.

The jury is entitled to draw inferences unfavourable to an accused where he

is not called to establish an innocent explanation of evidence given by the

prosecution, which, without such explanation, tells for his guilt.

Circumstantial evidence has to be viewed as that of a rope composed of several

chords. One strand of the rope might be insufficient to sustain the weight, but

several strands together may be quite sufficient in strength.

In the case of Regina Vs. Exall (176 English Reports, Nisi Prius at page 853),

Pollock, C.B. considering the aspect of circumstantial evidence remarked;

It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to be considered as a chain,

and each piece of evidence as a link in a chain, but that is not so, for then,

if any one link brock, the chain would fall. It is more like of a rope composed

of several cords. One strand of the rope might be insufficient to sustain the

weight, but three stranded together may be quite of sufficient strength.

It was observed in the case of Karunaratne Vs. Attorney-General (2005) 2 SLR

233,

Per Jagath Balapatabendi, J.,

The primary advantage of circumstantial evidence is that the risk of perjury

is minimized since it, unlike direct evidence, does not emanate from the

testimony of a single witness. It is therefore more difficult to fabricate

circumstantial evidence, than it is to resort to falsehood in the course of

giving direct evidence.

There is no principle of the law of evidence which precludes a conviction in

a criminal case based entirely on circumstantial evidence. There are no

uniform rules for the purpose of determining the probative value of

circumstantial evidence. This depends on the facts of each case.

Although the learned Counsel for the appellant argued that the learned High

Court Judge has failed to consider suspicious circumstances that favours the

appellant, I find no basis to come to such a conclusion. It is clear from the

judgment that the learned High Court Judge was well aware as to the manner in

which circumstantial evidence should be considered and has evaluated the

relevant pieces of evidence in its correct perspective.

Page 9 of 11

I am also unable to agree with the contention that the learned High Court Judge

has compartmentalized the evidence. On the contrary, it is quite apparent that

the learned High Court Judge has considered the totality of the evidence in

coming to his findings. The learned High Court Judge has considered the fact

that the deceased was under the care of the appellant, her living conditions while

being taken care, and the evidence of fellow villagers in that regard. He has well

considered the evidence of the prosecution as well as the position taken up by

the appellant in his defence to consider whether a reasonable doubt has been

created or a reasonable explanation has been provided against the evidence led

before the trial Court.

I do not find a basis to consider that the learned High Court Judge has heavily

relied on the expert evidence to convict the appellant.

No doubt that the learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence of the

JMO in detail, it is clear that the JMOs evidence has only been considered as a

part of the circumstantial evidence available before the Court.

In the dock statement, the position taken up by the appellant had been to the

effect that the child while running away from him, fell over a bank, and was

unconscious when he reached her. The JMO has found a contusion on the childs

forhead which has caused her death. It is clear from the version of events as

narrated by the appellant in his dock statement, he has made an attempt to

explain the injury and also the nail marks found on the childs face and also near

her armpits to show that he made an attempt to revive her. The learned High

Court Judge has considered the medical evidence in that context, and not only

relying on such evidence to convict the appellant.

It appears that since the explanation by the appellant was to suggest that the

death of the child was a result of an accident, the learned High Court Judge has

considered it as an attempt by the appellant to show that the incident comes

within the general exceptions as stated in the Penal Code. It has been determined

Page 10 of 11

that the burden of proving the existence of such exceptions should be on the

appellant.

I find that this was not a case where the appellant has claimed that his actions

fall within the general exceptions of the Penal Code. Besides that, for a person to

claim an accident as a reason for the death of the child, that claim has to be

within the permitted parameters as stipulated under the general exceptions of

the Penal Code. As I find that no such exception has really been taken up by the

appellant as his defence, considering the provisions of section 105 of Evidence

Ordinance would not have had any application to this case and the

determinations made by the learned High Court Judge on that basis are

misdirections as to the relevant law.

However, such a misdirection has to be a misdirection that has caused a

prejudice towards the appellant or occasioned a failure of justice so that a

conviction based on such a misdirection should have a vitiating effect.

The proviso of Article 138 of The Constitution which gives appellate jurisdiction

to the Court of Appeal reads as follows.

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any Court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

The circumstantial evidence led in this action clearly shows that the injuries

suffered by the deceased have been caused within few hours of her death.

Evidence of PW-10 establishes the fact that just before the child received the

fatal injuries, the appellant was with her and assaulting the child with a stick.

Although PW-10 has only identified the appellant while giving evidence before

the trial Court, the appellant in his dock statement has admitted that while

walking with her, and just before she fell as stated by him, he hit her with a

stick.

Page 11 of 11

The evidence of the JMO has established beyond reasonable doubt that the

injuries suffered by the child was not a result of a fall or the nail marks found in

her body was not a result of attempting to revive the child. The evidence of the

JMO also shows the previous evidence of torture that the child has suffered,

which clearly corroborates the evidence of fellow villagers as to the sufferings of

the child under the care of the appellant. The injuries on the body of the deceased

have clearly established the violence lashed out at the child just before she

suffered the fatal injuries, which evidently shows that the appellant has acted

intentionally towards the victim child.

The circumstantial evidence led at the trial has only pointed towards the

culpability of the appellant and no one else.

For the reasons considered as above, I find that the learned High Court Judge

has evaluated the evidence placed before the Court and has come to a correct

finding as to the guilt of the appellant to the charge preferred against him.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit. The conviction and the

sentence dated 06-02-2019 affirmed.
