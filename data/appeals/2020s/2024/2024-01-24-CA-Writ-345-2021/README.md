S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner to this Writ Application, Madulsima Plantations PLC (the Petitioner

Company) is a duly incorporated Company under the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007.

The 3rd Respondent was a permanent employee of the Petitioner Company. He joined

the predecessor entity of the Petitioner Company namely, Diyagama West Estate

Plantation on 01.10.1973 as a Clerk and later elevated to the Post of Financial

Controller of the Petitioner Company. Even though he had to retire in 2003 upon

reaching the age of 55 years, which is the optional retirement age, on the requests made

by the 3rd Respondent, the Petitioner Company extended his services (as per letters

marked as P2-I to P2-P) from time to time on periodic basis up to 17.09.2008, till

he reached the compulsory retirement age of 60 years. By the letter dated 18.08.2008

(marked as P4), the 3rd Respondent requested the Petitioner Company to arrange and

settle his terminal dues to the date of compulsory retirement, on 17.09.2008.

Accordingly, the Petitioner Company, by the letter dated 25.08.2008 (marked as P5)

informed the 3rd Respondent to relinquish his duties with effect from 18.09.2008 and

3

collect his terminal dues. In calculating the terminal dues, the Petitioner Company

considered the service period of the 3rd Respondent as from 1973 to 2008 and his

terminal salary is Rs. 67,165/-. The gratuity was calculated in terms of the Payment of

Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983 (as amended) (hereinafter referred to as the Act). That

calculation was certified as correct by the 3rd Respondent himself as the Financial

Controller of the Petitioner Company (P6 and P7). On 18.09.2008, the 3rd Respondent

was paid a sum of Rs. 1,112,571/36 (Rs. 1,074,640/- as the Retirement Gratuity plus

Rs. 37,931/36 as the salary for the number of days he worked in September 2008). It

was duly acknowledged and accepted by the 3rd Respondent admitting in writing by the

statement dated 18.09.2008 (marked as P8) that he has no other claims against the

Petitioner Company.

Thereafter, from 19.09.2008 to 17.09.2018 until he reached the age of 70, on his

requests service extensions were granted to the 3rd Respondent periodically based on

Fixed Term Contracts. The extensions that were given to the 3rd Respondents are as

follows.

By the letter dated 27.06.2014, the 3rd Respondent requested the Petitioner Company

for a further Fixed Term Contract of Employment, subject to a breaking of the service

as appropriate (marked as P12A). On the same day, by the letter marked as P12B, he

tendered the notice of retirement with effect from 01.07.2014. In response, the

Petitioner Company acknowledged the notice of retirement and by the letter marked as

P13 informed the 3rd Respondent to collect his terminal dues.

Further, by the letter dated 29.01.2018 (marked as P25), the 3rd Respondent informed

the Petitioner Company of his intention to terminate his contract of employment with

effect from 01.03.2018. In response, the Petitioner Company informed the 3rd

Respondent by letter dated 01.02.2018 (marked as P26) to collect his terminal dues if

any, upon the resignation.

On 11.10.2018, all the overdue payments including gratuity were paid to the 3rd

Respondent (as per the Employee Resignation/Exit marked as P28), which the 3rd

Respondent signed admitting that there is no claim overdue and accepted the gratuity

payment of Rs. 564,367/50. Further, the Petitioner Company paid Rs. 84,655/12 as

penalty charges on the gratuity on 07.11.2018 (marked as P29) which the 3rd

Respondent acknowledged by placing his signature.

The Assistant Commissioner of Labour (the 2nd Respondent), by the letters dated

28.01.2019 (marked as 1R1(A)) and 13.02.2019 (marked as 1R1(B)) informed the

Petitioner Company to be present for an inquiry scheduled to be held in respect of a

complaint made by the Petitioner regarding the non-payment of gratuity in terms of the

Act. On 20.02.2019, the 2nd Respondent decided that the Petitioner should pay the 3rd

Respondent a sum of Rs. 1,120,122/50 as gratuity and a sum of Rs. 2,80,030/62 as

surcharge on the gratuity in total of Rs. 1,4010,153/12 for the period of 44 years on the

basis that, in terms of Section 5 of the Act there is no breakage of services of the 3rd

Respondent from 01.10.1973 (from the date the 3rd Respondent joined the predecessor

of the Petitioner Company) up to 30.06.2018 (the date on which the last contract of

employment expired) (marked as 1R2).

By the letter dated 02.03.2019 (marked as P31) of the 2nd Respondent sent to the

Petitioner Company it was informed to deposit in the District Labour Office in Badulla

a sum of Rs. 1,120,122/50 as gratuity and Rs. 2,80,030/62 as surcharge payable to the

3rd Respondent on the basis that the gratuity has not been properly calculated by the

Petitioner Company. The Petitioner Company appealed against that decision to the

Commissioner General of Labour (the 1st Respondent) by the letter dated 25.03.2019

(marked as P32), but that appeal was rejected as alleged by the Petitioner Company

without the Petitioner Company being heard (P33). The Petitioner Company therefore

requested the 1st Respondent to conduct a fresh inquiry awarding an opportunity to

present facts on its behalf. Afterwards, the 2nd Respondent by the letter dated

11.10.2020 (marked as P35/1R3) informed the Petitioner Company to act according to

the letter marked as P31 and deposit the amount stated in that letter with the District

Labour Office on or before 02.11.2020. Nevertheless, the 1st Respondent by the letter

dated 19.01.2021 (marked as P38) requested the Petitioner Company to participate in a

6

discussion to be held on 23.02.2021. Following the discussion, by the letter dated

02.03.2021 (marked as P39), the 1st Respondent directed the 2nd Respondent to recover

the outstanding sum of gratuity from the Petitioner Company.

In the above outset, the Petitioner Company seeks, inter alia, the following reliefs.

1) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the Order of the 2nd

Respondent dated 7th March 2020 contained in P31.

2) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the Order of the 2nd

Respondent dated 11th October 2020 contained in P35.

3) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the Order of the 2nd

Respondent dated 2nd March 2021 contained in P39.

The 1st and 2nd Respondents are of the view that the 3rd Respondent had an uninterrupted

service from 1973 to 2018, with several extensions and repeated awards of Fixed Term

Contracts without a break of service. They admit that a pro forma retirement letter

had been submitted by the 3rd Respondent however, services have not been discontinued

and therefore, the Petitioner Company is liable to pay the statutory dues in terms of the

Act.

Section 5(1) of the Act provides that;

"Every employer who employs or has employed fifteen or more workmen on any

day during the period of twelve months immediately preceding the termination

of the services of a workman in any industry shall, on termination (whether by

the employer or workman, or on retirement or by the death of the workman, or

by operation of law, or otherwise) of the services at any time after the coming

into operation of this Act, of a workman who has a period of service of not less

than five completed years under that employer, pay to that workman in respect

7

of such services, and where the termination is by the death of that workman, to

his heirs, a gratuity computed in accordance with the provisions of this Part

within a period of thirty days of such termination." (emphasis added).

Also, as per Section 20 of the Act,

Completed service means uninterrupted service and includes service which

is interrupted by approved leave on any ground whatsoever, a strike or lockout

or cessation of work not due to any fault of the workman concerned, whether

such uninterrupted or interrupted service was rendered before or after the

coming into operation of this Act.

The 3rd Respondent has completed 32 years of service at the Petitioner Company until

he reached the age of compulsory retirement. However, the fixed-term contracts of

employment starting from P9 fail to meet this criterion of 5 years of completed service

to be eligible for the payment of gratuity for the disputed period.

The reasons given by the 1st Respondent as to why the Petitioner Company should pay

a sum of Rs. 1,400,153/12 as gratuity and a surcharge on such amount, as conveyed by

the three letters referred to above, namely P31, P35 and P39 can be summarised as

follows:

1) The 3rd Respondent's contract of employment has been proceeded without

interruption from 1973 to 2018.

2) The Petitioner Company miscalculated the payment of gratuity by not

considering the last paid salary of the 3rd Respondent, therefore is liable to pay

a surcharge.

8

Dissatisfied with the decision of the 1st and 2nd Respondents, the Petitioner Company

has filed this Application seeking, inter alia, a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision

contained in the letters marked as P31, P35 and P39.

The Petitioner Company is disputing its liability to pay gratuity for the periods covered

from P9 to P27 (i.e. from 19.09.2008 to 30.06.2018) on the basis, inter alia, that:

(a) The contract of employment evidenced by P3 came to an end on 18.09.2008.

(b) 3rd Respondent accepted that his contract of employment had been terminated

by accepting the payment of gratuity (P6, P7, P8, P13) and

(c) The contracts P9, P10A, P10C, P10E, P10G, P10I, P10K, P14, P17, P19, P21,

P23 and P27 are fresh contracts, which do not attract any liability on account of

gratuity, as the minimum period of employment required by Section 5 of the Act

has not been satisfied.

Under the above-stated circumstances, this Court has to determine whether the

decisions of the 1st and 2nd Respondents are irrational, arbitrary, illegal, against the rules

of natural justice and ultra vires and if so, whether the said decisions are liable to be

quashed by Writs of Certiorari. In determining that, this Court has to consider whether

the contract of employment of the 3rd Respondent, as demonstrated by P4, P6, P7, and

P8 came to an end on 19.09.2008, which the learned Counsel appearing for the

Petitioner argues it did, and the learned Counsel appearing for the Respondents argue

that there is continuity of service on the same contract of employment in terms of P9,

P10A, P10C, P10E, P10G, P10I, P10K, P14, P17, P19, P21, P23 and P27, and that the

contract of employment was terminated only on 30.06.2018. The learned Counsel

appearing for the 3rd Respondent further argues that the 3rd Respondent was keen on

9

continuing with the Petitioner and had sent to the Petitioner a letter dated 18.08.2008

(marked as P4), which reads as follows,

RETIREMENT

Further to my letter dated 17th March 2008, I write to bring to your kind notice

that I will be retiring from regular service with effect from 18th September 2008,

on reaching sixty years of age. Accordingly, I shall be thankful if you would

kindly arrange to settle my terminal dues as my regular contract of employment

terminates on 18th September 2008.

I shall be most grateful if you could consider a fixed term contract of

employment thereafter for a period of one year.

It is clear from P4 that the 3rd Respondent was keen on continuing his employment with

the Petitioner Company without a break but on the basis of an extension of the existing

contract of employment by way of a fixed-term contract of employment. The result of

this request was the appointment of the 3rd Respondent as the Financial Controller on

the contract dated 01.09.2008, marked as P9.

This Court therefore observes the following facts:

(a) The 3rd Respondent himself informed the Petitioner Company regarding his

retirement from the regular service and requested a fixed-term contract of

employment for one year by P4

(b) The Petitioner Company has made it clear to the 3rd Respondent by P9 that what

is being offered is not an extension of service but a fresh employment for the

period commencing from 19.09.2008 terminating on 31.12.2008

10

(c) The content of P9 demonstrates that the 3rd Respondent was very much aware

of the consequences of re-engaging on a contract basis for less than 5 years and

has consented to that arrangement.

(d) It is important to note that, as the Financial Controller of the Petitioner

Company, the 3rd Respondent had certified the payment of Gratuity to him,

which was paid upon his retirement and collected the terminal dues by him

accordingly (P6, P7 and P8).

(e) The 3rd Respondent knew that what he was agreeing to, was not an 'extension

of service'.

(f) For the periods covered by the fixed-term contracts of employment, the 3rd

Respondent is not entitled to gratuity.

It is in the above factual background that the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

Company submitted that the 3rd Respondent retired from the employment with effect

from 18.09.2008 and that the employment came to an end on 18.08.2008 as evidenced

by P5.

Therefore, it is evident that the Petitioner Company has complied with the provisions

of the Act and the 3rd Respondent, by accepting the payment of gratuity has

acknowledged the termination of his employment due to retirement.

In Bogawanthalawa Tea Estates PLC vs Commissioner General of Labour,1 it was held

that,

It is therefore clear to this Court that the Petitioner, having given a contractual

appointment to the 6th Respondent on 20th February 2012, had taken steps the

very next date to comply with the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act. As

1 CA (Writ) Application No: 282/2018, CA Minutes on 20.12.2019 on Page 15.

11

gratuity is payable in terms of Section 5(1) only at the cessation of employment,

and in the light of the factual circumstances of this case, it is the view of this

Court that the 6th Respondent, by accepting the said payment of gratuity, has

acknowledged that his contract of employment evidenced by '6R1' came to an

end on 31st January 2012.

Further, the 3rd Respondent in the instant Application was fully aware of the

consequences of entering into a fixed-term contract of employment upon his request

and that he is not entitled to the payment of gratuity for any future periods. In

Bogawanthalawa Tea Estates PLC vs Commissioner General of Labour (supra), in

which the facts were similar to the facts of this Application, the Court observed that,

The very next day after 'P2' was issued, the Petitioner proceeded to process the

gratuity claim of the 6th Respondent and made the payment. It was certainly a

win-win for both parties, with the Petitioner enforcing its policy on retirement,

but yet being able to have the services of the staff that it wanted even beyond

the age of retirement, and the 6th Respondent continuing to enjoy the same rights

and privileges that he enjoyed as General Manager, subject of course to a re-

calibration of the gratuity clock.

What is significant is that even the 6th Respondent does not call this

arrangement a 'sham', which was executed to benefit both the Petitioner and the

6th Respondent. This Court is making this observation as it is conscious that an

employer can take advantage of the bargaining power that it has over its

employees and for instance, force an employee who is a long way from his

retirement age to resign, on the understanding that he would be re-employed on

contract basis simply to avoid paying gratuity for a longer period on a higher

12

salary. This kind of arrangement can be categorized as being a 'sham'

transaction, but that is certainly not what happened in this instance (at

Page17).

The learned DSG appearing for the 1st and 2nd Respondents in the instant Application

drew the attention of Court to the judgement in The Finance Company Limited vs

Kodippilli2. Even though the facts of this Application and the facts of Kodippillis case

seem identical, two features could be distinguished the present Application and the said

case.

(a) In Kodippilli's case, the employee requested from the employer before he

reached the retirement date, by letter dated 17th May 1999, to extend his services

for one year with effect from 22nd May 1999, and he continued to work on the

understanding that he had been given an extension. However, in the present

Application, the 3rd Respondent's request specifically was for an extension by

way of a fixed-term contract.

(b) In Kodippilli's case, after the service of the employee was extended, by letter

dated 4th June 1999 he specifically requested from the employer to differ the

payment of gratuity in view of the extension granted. However, in the present

Application, the 3rd Respondent being the Financial Controller of the Petitioner

Company was aware that he would not be entitled to gratuity after retirement

and therefore he accepted the gratuity that was paid to him.

In appeal, in the case of Brown and Company Limited vs The Commissioner of Labour

and others,3 the Supreme Court held that,

2 (2005) 3 Sri LR 281; Sriskandarajah, J (as he then was). 3 SC Appeal No. 84/2011; SC Minutes of 03.08.2016.

13

(We) find that the Court of Appeal has gone wrong in its judgment by having

decided that the service was not interrupted just because the Complainant

Respondent had physically come to work on the very next day after the date of

retirement at 55 years. The Court of Appeal had ignored the fact that he was

retired and then he accepted the fixed term contract and commenced services

a new according to the contract and come on the next day as a worker on

contract basis (emphasis added).

When considering the above-stated facts of the instant Application and the Court

decisions, this Court is of the view that the decision of the 1st and 2nd Respondents that

P9 is a continuation of the contract of employment that existed as of 18.09.2008, is

illegal, irrational, arbitrary and ultra vires on the following grounds.

(a) The 3rd Respondent gave prior notice to the Petitioner Company that his

contract of employment would be terminated upon his retirement on

18.08.2008 (vide P4 and P5).

(b) The 3rd Respondent sought an extension of service by way of a fixed-

term contract of employment at the end of the period specified in P4;

(c) The Petitioner Company did not forcibly pay gratuity to the 3rd

Respondent, and the gratuity payment was approved and accepted by the

3rd Respondent, knowing well the consequences of accepting the said

payment.

(d) The arrangement reflected in P9 was a result of a negotiation between

the Petitioner Company and the 3rd Respondent and was not an

arrangement that was thrust on the 3rd Respondent.

14

In Brown and Company Limited vs The Commissioner of Labour and others (supra), it

was held that,

I am of the opinion that having accepted the legally due gratuity at the age of

55 years the Respondent cannot make a claim to be paid gratuity for a period

of time for which he was paid once. The moment gratuity is accepted for the

first segment of 24 years, he accepts and concludes that he has got gratuity for

that period. He is estopped in law from making any claim for that past period

for which he accepted gratuity once.

The 1st and 2nd Respondents in the Application at hand have not considered the above-

stated material that the parties placed before them which is paramount in deciding the

issue before them. The consequence of the failure to consider relevant material has been

set out in De Smith's Judicial Review4 as follows:

"When exercising a discretionary power, a decision-maker may take into

account a range of lawful considerations. Some of these are specified in the

statute as matters to which regard may be had. Others are specified as matters

to which regard may not be had. There are other considerations which are not

specified but which the decision-maker may or may not lawfully take into

account. If the exercise of discretionary power has been influenced by

considerations that cannot lawfully be taken into account, or by the disregard

of relevant considerations required to be taken into account (expressly or

impliedly), a court will normally hold that the power has not been validly

exercised.

4 Harry Woolf, Jeffry Jowell and Andrew Le Sueur, 6th Edition at page 280.

15

This Court is of the view that the decision taken by the 1st and 2nd Respondents without

considering the material that was presented to them by the Petitioner Company makes

the said decision illegal, irrational, arbitrary, unreasonable and ultra vires, and is a

decision therefore, as stated in Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil

Service5, " is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that

no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have

arrived at it." Thereby, the Petitioner Company is entitled to the reliefs sought in this

Writ Application.

Under the above-stated circumstances, this Court is of the view that the decisions

reflected in P31, P35 and P39 are unreasonable, irrational, arbitrary, illegal and ultra

vires and are liable to be quashed by Writs of Certiorari. This Court accordingly grant

reliefs sought in the prayer (b), (c) and (f) to (h) to the Petition. No costs ordered.

Application allowed.
