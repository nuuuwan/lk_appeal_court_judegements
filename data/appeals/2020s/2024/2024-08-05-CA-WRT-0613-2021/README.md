MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. The Factual Matrix

The Petitioner was recruited to the post of Junior Manager Grade II of Sri

Lanka Tea Board by the appointment letter dated 01.03.2013. Pursuant to a

letter dated 17.01.2014 marked as P4, the Petitioner was designated as

Procurement Officer Grade II in his official activities with effect from his date

of appointment by the Director General (Acting).

The Petitioner states that there was a preliminary inquiry held against him

based on a report dated 13.11.2018 issued by the Senior Internal Auditor of

the Tea Board as a result of a special investigation conducted by the said

Auditor upon the direction of the Director-General of the Tea Board alleging

that the Petitioner has been involved with misconducts while he was serving

as the Procurement Officer in the Procurement Section attached to the Tea

Board, and as a result of that financial loss has occurred to Sri Lanka Tea

Board.

Accordingly, statements were recorded from the Petitioner and several other

employees at the said inquiry. The Petitioner states that a charge sheet dated

02.05.2019 marked P6 was issued by the Inquiring Officer along with his

report informing the Petitioner to show cause in writing within 14 days of

receiving the charge.

The aforesaid charge sheet contained ten charges of misconduct allegedly

committed by the Petitioner during the procurement process for purchasing

paper bags for the Sri Lanka Tea Board.

The Petitioner states that by letter dated 08.05.2019 marked P7, he

requested the 2nd Respondent to provide him the certified copies of all the

Page 6 of 9

documents that were used at the preliminary inquiry stating his urgency to

reply to the alleged charges in the charge sheet.

The Petitioner further states that even though he requested the copies of the

aforesaid documents in advance, said copies were not provided to him by the

Respondents when they were needed and the Petitioner received the

response from the 2nd Respondent by letter marked P8, and informed the

availability of certain documents to obtain copies and the availability of the

remains for the Petitioner's perusal.

The Petitioner states that in the above circumstance, he did not have an

opportunity to peruse the aforesaid documents and other statements. The

Petitioner further states that therefore he was deprived of tendering a

substantial explanation and he had to submit a written explanation dated

16.05.2019 denying charges against him to the 2nd Respondent through the

15th Respondent.

Thereafter, the Petitioner was informed by the 2nd Respondent Chairman in

a letter dated 18.06.2019 marked P10 that the explanation given by the

Petitioner was rejected and the authorities of the Tea Board have decided to

hold a formal disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner in respect of the

alleged charges.

The 16th Respondent had been appointed by the 2nd Respondent to conduct

the formal disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner on 02.10.2019 based

on the charges listed in the charge sheet marked P6.

The tribunal on 20.01.2021 by an order marked P16 found the Petitioner

guilty of the 3rd to 10th charges while he was acquitted from 1st and 2nd

charges.

The Petitioner in the instant Writ Application seeks inter alia;

Page 7 of 9

1) A Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the Disciplinary Inquiry

dated 20.01.2021 marked as P16 and the Order of the 1st Respondent,

the Sri Lanka Tea Board dated 06.08.2021 marked as P17.

2) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to reinstate the

Petitioner to the Post of Procurement Officer (Grade II) in the Sri Lanka

Tea Board.

Preliminary Objection.

When this matter was taken up for support on 01.03.2024, a preliminary

objection was raised by the Respondents on the maintainability of this

Application. The said preliminary objection is on the footing that the

Petitioner has not exhausted alternative remedies available to him prior to

invoking the Writ jurisdiction of this Court and thus, in order to maintain his

application before this Court, has intentionally misled the Court.

It is settled law that, if the preliminary objection is sustained, the Application

can be dismissed without any need to venture into the facts of the case or its

merits.

In Pinnaduwage Baby Mallika Chandraseana vs C.W Abeysuriya1 this

Court held,

Prerogative Writs are discretionary remedies, and therefore, the

Petitioner is not entitled to invoke the Writ jurisdiction of this Court

when there is an alternative remedy available to him..

Hence, prior to invoking the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court, the Petitioner

must have exhausted alternative remedies available to him in the first

instance.

1 CA/WRIT/457/2019

Page 8 of 9

As per the Petitioners Letter of Appointment marked P2 the appointing

authority for the Petitioner is the Board of Directors of the Sri Lanka Tea

Board thus, the disciplinary authority is also the same.

The Petitioner in order to substantiate the requirement of having exhausted

alternative remedies available to him, tendered two letters marked X1

dated 16.02.2021 and X2 dated 02.03.2021(the reply by the Sri Lanka Tea

Board) which the Petitioner claimed to be his Appeal and subsequent reply

by the disciplinary authority against disciplinary order marked P17 dated

06.08.2021. Upon examination, it is apparent to this Court that, the said X1

and X2 wherein the Petitioner alleges to have appealed the disciplinary

order against him, are both issued antecedent to the date on which the

disciplinary order was given.

According to the language in provisions of the Establishment Code Volume

II, it is manifestly clear that any person aggrieved by a disciplinary order may

file an Appeal only after the delivery of such order, and thus it is not possible

to file an Appeal before a disciplinary order is issued. Accordingly, this Court

finds that the Petitioner in this case has not exhausted the alternative

remedies available to him, to the disciplinary authority prior to invoking the

Writ jurisdiction of this Court.

Furthermore, the Petitioner having made representations before this Court

stating that he has exhausted alternative remedies before invoking the

jurisdiction of this court, there is sufficient material to state that the

Petitioner has intentionally mislead Court thus has not disclosed all material

facts and has violated his duty of Uberrima fides by failing to make a full and

frank disclosure of all material facts relevant to this Application.

Page 9 of 9

In Fonseka vs. Lt. General Jagath Jayasuriya and Five Others2 wherein a

divisional bench of this Court held that,

a Petitioner who seeks relief by writ which is an extra-ordinary remedy

must in fairness to Court, bare every material fact so that the discretion

of Court is not wrongly invoked or exercised..

Also, in Dahanayake and Others v. Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd.

and Others3 wherein this Court held that,

if there is no full and truthful disclosure of all material facts, the Court

would not go into the merits of the Application but will dismiss it without

further examination..

Thus, the Petitioner having suppressed the fact that he has not exhausted

alternative remedies prior to invoking the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court and

attempting to pollute the stream of justice in this case by attempting to

mislead the Court by way of X1 and X2. Accordingly, I uphold the

Preliminary Objection raised by the Respondents and dismiss the

Application in limine.

Application Dismissed, No Costs.
