The Petitioner contends that the same letter dated 03.07.2018 mentioned that the Divisional Secretary had already informed her of the award under Section 17 of the Act through a letter dated 04.07.2018. However, it is averred by the Petitioner that she never received the purported letter dated 04.07.2018 or the Section 17 award as indicated in the said communication. On or around 10.07.2018, the Petitioner actively participated in a Land Acquisition and Relocation Committee (LARC) inquiry aimed at determining the compensation rightfully owed to her. During the inquiry, the Petitioner was informed that her 781.69 perches of land had been assessed at a total value of Rs.82,106,600/-. This valuation was computed at a rate of Rs.105,000/- per perch. Additionally, an additional sum of Rs.300,000/- was allocated to the Petitioner, covering aspects such as vacating possession on the specified date, obtaining necessary documents, addressing crop loss, and a further sum of Rs.100,000/- was designated for a well.",
