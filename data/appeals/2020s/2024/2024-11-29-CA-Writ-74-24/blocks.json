In coming to the said conclusion, the Court has considered the judgments of Wimalasiri Perera and others v.

In reply to this objection, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner further submitted that they have subsequent to filing the Writ Application have deposited the said sum and have tendered the certificate to the Court by way of a motion. As correctly argued by the learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent the said motion has been field without the permission of the Court and had not been supported. Even if this Court is to consider this certificate it will not absolve the Petitioner form not complying with Section 31 DDDDD. The Petitioner as per the documents submitted by way of a motion have complied with the requirement of furnishing the deposit equivalent to the amount of the award only on 27.03.2024 and the certificate is dated with a date subsequent to that. However, the Writ Application has been filed on 30.01.2024. Accordingly, we find that the security deposit and the certificate have been filed several months after the filing of the Petition. Which in our view, is a substantial noncompliance with the mandatory Section 31 DDDDD of the IDA. The said failure of the Petitioner to comply with the mandatory Section of the IDA is fatal to the Writ Application. Accordingly, we hold that the Respondents objection has to succeed. We come to this conclusion after careful consideration of the relevant Section of the Amendment to the Act namely, No. 22 of 2022. As stated above, even the Sinhala version of the Amendment clearly states that the said deposit and the certificate that follows has to be submitted for the Court of Appeal to entertain. Hence, we determine, for the Court of Appeal to exercise the Writ jurisdiction in this Writ Application the compliance of Section 31 DDDDD is mandatory.",
