However, when this matter was taken up for argument on 13th September

2023 the Counsel appearing for the Petitioner had agreed to confine his

3) The prayer k, l and m are as follows;

k) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus

directing the 1St Respondent the Hon' Minister of Sports and/or 2nd

and/or 6th Respondents to give directions to such interim committee to

and the law;

C.A. WRIT 00440-19

8

l) Grant punitive damage against the Respondents commensurate with

their respective wrong doing or misdeeds;

m) Award costs; and

Facts of the Petitioners case

4) The Petitioner as I have stated above had confined his reliefs to prayer

k, l and m of the petition dated 1st November 2019. Therefore, the

facts pertinent to the other reliefs are not necessary to be considered in

the instant application.

5) The said k, l and m reliefs are pleaded to obtain Writ of Certiorari

quashing the documents P7 (b), P8 (a), P8 (b), P12 (a), P12 (d), P14 and

P19.

6) The application of the Petitioner is to quash the decision of the election

committee to accept the nominations of the 10th to 14th and 15th

Respondents and to challenge the Elections held on 28th August 2019 to

elect the office bearers of the Netball Federation of Sri Lanka, which will

be called hereinafter NFSL.

7) On the said basis the Petitioner had sought to quash the electoral list,

nominations and the purported decisions of the election committee.

The 1st, 2nd and 6th Respondents Objections

8) The 1st, 2nd and 6th Respondents had objected for the application made by

the Petitioner on the basis that the Petitioners application is futile, the

Petitioner has not come with clean hands, and is misconceived and not

entitled to seek any equitable and/or discretionary relief.

9) Further, the said Respondents have stated that they have dealt with the

Petitioner, acted in good faith and the 10th Respondent did not function as

the Vice President of the NFSL at the time of the suspension of the NFSL.

C.A. WRIT 00440-19

9

10) Furthermore, the Respondent have contended, that the Mercantile Netball

Association failed to submit objections in respect of the voters list within

the stipulated period.

11) Further, the Office Bearers appointed at the impugned election in 2019

have already completed their term and 3 successive elections have been

held in the years 2020, 2021 and 2022.

12) On the said grounds the reliefs sought by the Petitioner to quash the

electoral list, notices and nomination list in respect of the election held in

2019 is futile. On that, the said Respondents have moved to dismiss the

petition.

Objections of the 10th to 15thRespondents

13) The 10thto the 15th Respondents had filed their objections and contended

that the Petitioners have misinformed the facts in the petition dated 1st

November 2019.

14) The Petitioners have contradicted themselves in paragraph 16 of the

petition by stating all those associations whose names appear on

Annexure No. 2 marked as P7 (b) were not entitled to vote. However, the

said Annexure marked P7 (b) to the petition includes the name of Badulla

District Netball Association, an association which the Petitioners also

claimed to be illegal.

15) There the Petitioners themselves have contradicted their own position

stating only 3 member organizations were purportedly illegal and

producing documents contradicting the said position.

16) The Petitioners have failed to produce the letter of resignation of the 10th

Respondent which is marked and produced as R1 and R1 (a).

17) The 1st Petitioner was the General Secretary of the executive of the NFSL

that was suspended and dissolved on 25th April 2019. Other than the said

C.A. WRIT 00440-19

10

facts these Respondents have also stated the same facts in their objections

as per the 1st, 2nd and 6th Respondents.

Disputed facts

18) When this matter was taken up for argument all the parties agreed to

conclude the matter without an argument and agreed to accept the

judgement on the written submissions already tendered after confining

this case to the Petitioners prayers k, l and m.

19) On the said grounds I have to consider the following points to arrive at

my conclusion that the reliefs sought by the Petitioners can be granted

or whether the Petitioners can maintain this action.

I. Can the Petitioners challenge the electoral list, nomination and or the

purported decision of the election committee contained on document

marked P19?

II. Had the purported election been held in 2019?

III. If so, at this stage can the Petitioner seek reliefs to quash the electoral

list, nomination and or the purported decision of the election

committee?

I. Can the Petitioners challenge the electoral list, nomination and

or the purported decision of the election committee contained on

document marked P19?

20) The Petitioners have restricted their claim to prayers k, l and m of

the petition. In considering the prayer k the Petitioners have sought a

Writ of Certiorari quashing P7 (b), P8 (a), P8 (b), P12 (a) read with P12 (b).

21) I reproduce the aforesaid documents. The said P7 (b) is the electoral list

which contains the affiliated sports Associations of Netball.

22) Document P8(a) is a letter issued by the President of the Election

committee to verify the qualification of the affiliated Netball Association.

The said P8(a) document was issued on 24th June 2019.

23) P8(b) is also the list referred to in P7(b) which is the affiliated Netball

Associations. P12(a) is a document issued by the President of the election

committee referring that there is no objection for the P12 (d) affiliated

Associations to participate in the election conducted for the years 2017

and2019. This letter was issued on 9th July 2019. P19 is a letter issued

by the President of the election committee accepting the nominations and

had decided to hold the election to select the members of the NFSL

Executive committee. This letter had been issued on 5th August 2019.

This action had been instituted on 20th October 2019. Although the

Petitioner had sought interim relief as per the minutes dated 21st October

2019 to the date which the Petitioner had supported this application on

15th June 2020, no interim relief had been sought or granted.

Subsequently only objections had been filed and the matter had been fixed

for argument.

24) It is obvious the Petitioner had not sought any interim relief or any interim

orders issued to restrain the steps taken by the election committee of the

NFSL by P7(b), P8(a), P8(b) P12(b) and P12(d).

25) Therefore, it is a futile effort of the Petitioners to seek permission from this

court to quash the said orders and the documents which had been already

affected by the President of the election committee of the NFSL in the year

2019.

26) Thus, I do not see any reasons to interfere with the P19 decision taken by

the President of the election committee in the year 2019.

C.A. WRIT 00440-19

19

II. Had the purported election been held in the 2019?

27) There is no dispute between the parties that the purported election of the

NFSL was held in 2019 as scheduled by the President of the election

committee. Thereafter in the years 2020, 2021 and 2022 elections had

been held and the executive committee had been successfully appointed.

28) The Petitioner had never raised any objection for any of the said elections

from 2019 onwards. There is no interim order issued by this court when

this case commenced and or the Petitioners had never supported an

interim order to stop the aforesaid election.

29) In the said circumstances, the election committee appointed in 2019 had

successfully held the elections to appoint the executive committee of the

NFSL.

III. If so, at this stage can the Petitioners seek reliefs to quash the

electoral list, nomination and or the purported decision of the

election committee?

30) As per my analysis in the aforesaid paragraphs the Petitioners had not

taken this matter seriously in the year 2019. Although they had pleaded,

they had not supported any interim reliefs pleaded in this prayer against

conducting the 2019 NFSL elections to appoint the executive committee

members.

31) The election committee had been led by a retired High Court Judge and

two other members who have a wealth of experience in the sports sector.

32) On perusal of the documents submitted by the Petitioners and the

Respondents the Chairman of the election committee had by P7(a) held a

meeting and decided the P7(b) societies are eligible to vote and the said

matters are Gazette by P7(d) and P7(e) documents.

C.A. WRIT 00440-19

20

33) Subsequently, by P19 document the Chairman of the election committee

had specified there were no objections raised with regard to the electoral

list and had decided that the P7(b) electoral list members are eligible to

vote for the aforesaid election and decided to hold the election on 28th

August 2019.

34) This application had been filed on 23rd October 2019 and the Petitioner

due to various reasons had taken dates to support this application. The

matter had been supported on 15th June 2020 and no interim relief had

been sought by the Petitioner.

35) Therefore, on the face of it the Petitioners had not acted due diligently to

proceed with this action.

36) The election pertinent to this action had already been concluded in the

year 2019 and the said members period had also ended and the letters

issued by the chairman and the members of the election committee had

never been challenged.

37) In the said circumstances, it is a futile application to grant the reliefs

prayed for in the prayer k, l and m at this stage.

38) In the case of Warnakulasuriya Joseph Nishantha Peries V

Commissioner General of Excise and 9 others1 the Court held that;

"This brings me to the aforementioned relief that has been sought by the Petitioner. The learned State Counsel submitted that this application is futile as the period for which the license has been sought has expired. He submitted further that as the Writ of Mandamus is a discretionary remedy, this Court would not exercise its discretion where it would be futile to do so or where it would be an exercise in vain.

39) In the said case Justice Sisra Abrew had held issuing a writ in the said

case is futile as the purpose of the Petitioner will not be served. Therefore,

in the instant action, a Certiorari Writ at this stage cannot be issued for

1CA(Writ) 34/2020 (C.A Minutes dated 15.2.2021)

C.A. WRIT 00440-19

21

unchallenged documents by the Petitioners and the particular subject and

the purpose had been fulfilled already without any legal objections.

40) Further in the case of Anuja Yoganathan V University Grants

Commission2 it was held;

"Certiorari will not be issued to quash a particular exercise of powers if it be futile to do so because it is not more operational or it has had its effect. Justice Anil Gunaratne in C.A.67/2008. A writ will not issue where it would be vexatious or futile (1958) 61 NLR 491.496. The Court will have regard to the special circumstances of the case before it, issue a writ of certiorari. The writ of certiorari clearly will not issue where the end result will be futility, frustration, injustice and illegality. Marsoof J. in Ratnasiri Vs. Ellawala(2004) 2 SLR 189. Marsoof J followed Soza J's word cited page 90 citing H. Wade administrative Law 5th Ed.Pg.546-591 Even Mandamus had been refused by courts on many occasions based on futility."

41) In the aforesaid case Justice Anil Gunaratne had decided a Writ of

Certiorari will not be issued if the end result will be futile. Further, there

is no document to prove that the order made by the election select

committee is illegal. In the aforesaid circumstances I do not see any

ground that the Petitioners have satisfied the Court to issue Writ of

Certiorari under prayers k, l and m of the petition dated 1st

November 2019.

2 CA (Writ) 664/2011 (C.A Minutes dated 13.9.2016)

CONCLUSION

42) In view of the aforesaid facts, document and in considering the written

submission, I dismiss the petition dated 1st November 2019 subject to

payment of tax cost to the Respondents.
