*******************

JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General at the High

Court of Colombo for committing two counts of Grave Sexual Abuse

punishable under Section 365B (b) 2 (b) and one count of Sexual Harassment

punishable under Section 345 of the Penal Code as amended on Kevin

Heman Brito between 01/11/2012 and 30/11/2012.

At the trial the prosecution had called 06 witnesses and marked production

P1-P5 and closed the case. When the defence was called, the Appellant gave

evidence from the witness box and called two witnesses on his behalf and

closed his case.

After the trial, the Appellant was convicted as charged and was sentenced as

follows:

1st Count- 07 years rigorous imprisonment with a compensation

500,000/-. In default 06 months simple imprisonment.

2nd Count- 07 years rigorous imprisonment with a compensation

500,000/-. In default 06 months simple imprisonment.

1st Count- 02 years rigorous imprisonment with a compensation

200,000/-. In default 03 months simple imprisonment.

CA/HCC/134/22

3 | P a g e

The Learned High Court further ordered that the sentences imposed on all

three counts to run consequently.

In this case as the victim was 04 years old at the time of the incident. The

Child Protection Authority had video recorded the statement of the victim

under Section 163(c) of the Evidence Ordinance (Special Provisions) Act No.

32 of 1999 and marked as P2 and the translated script was marked as P1 in

the trial.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

had given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. During the argument, he was connected via Zoom from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the fact that the child

victim was tutored by PW1, the mother of the child during the video

recording.

2. The Appellant was denied a fair trial by presenting incorrect transcript

of the interview conducted by the Child Protection Authority.

3. The Appellant was denied a fair trial by convicting him by using and

perusing the Police Information Book by the Learned High Court

Judge, as it had not been produced as evidence in the trial.

4. The Appellant has been denied a fair trial by shifting the burden on

the Appellant to rebut the evidence of the prosecution.

5. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the failure

to produce the CDs which were taken into custody by the National

Child Protection Authority warrants the Application of Section 114(f)

of the Evidence Ordinance.

CA/HCC/134/22

4 | P a g e

6. The trial Judge has not considered that PW1 had strong motive to

implicate the Appellant through the child who was 04 years of age at

the time of the incident.

7. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that PW1, who

was the wife of the Appellant is not competent witness to give evidence

as far as the charges are concern.

The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows.

In this case, the prosecution had led the video evidence of a preliminary

interview of the victim conducted and recorded by the Child Protection

Authority at the time of the investigation and it was played before the

Learned Trial Judge in terms of Section 163 (A) of the Evidence (Special

Provisions) Act No 32 of 1999. The prosecution had led evidence of official

witnesses who had taken part in the process of recording of video evidence

to establish that the recording had been done after following due process.

The procedure regarding recording and presentation of Video Evidence laid

down in the Section 163A of the Evidence Ordinance (Special Provisions) Act

No. 32 of 1999 is set out below for clarity.

Section 163A states:

(1) In any proceedings for an offence relating to child

abuse a video recording of a preliminary interview

which-

(a) is conducted between an adult and a child

who is not the accused in such proceeding

(hereinafter referred to in this section as "a

child witness"); and

CA/HCC/134/22

5 | P a g e

(b) relates to any matter in issue in those

proceedings, may notwithstanding the

provisions of any other law with the leave of

the court, be given in evidence in so far as it is

not excluded by court under subsection (2).

(2) Where a video recording is tendered in evidence in

any proceedings referred to in subsection (1) the court

shall give leave under that subsection unless-

(a) it appears to court, that the child witness

will not be available for cross examination in

such proceedings; or

(b) any rules of court requiring the disclosure

of the circumstances in which the video

recording was made have not been complied

with to the satisfaction of the court.

(3) Where a video recording is given in evidence under

this section-

(a) the child witness shall be called by the

party who tendered the video recording in

evidence;

CA/HCC/134/22

6 | P a g e

(b) such child witness shall not be examined in

chief on any matter which in the opinion of the

court, has been dealt with in his recorded

testimony.

(4) Where a video recording is given in evidence under

this section, any statement made by the child witness

which is disclosed by the video recording shall be

treated as if given by that child witness in direct oral

testimony and accordingly, any such statement shall

be admissible evidence of any fact of which direct oral

testimony from him would be admissible.

(5) Where the child witness, in the course of his direct

oral testimony before court, contradicts, either

expressly or by necessary implication, any statement

previously made by him and disclosed by the video

recording, it shall be lawful for the presiding judge, if

he considers it safe and just in all the circumstances

of the case, to act upon such previous statement as

disclosed by the video recording, if such previous

statement is corroborated in material particulars by

evidence from an independent source, for the purpose

of this section-

(a) "an offence relating to child abuse" means

offence under section 286A, 308A, 360A,

360B,360C, 363, 364A, 365, 365A, or 365B of

CA/HCC/134/22

7 | P a g e

the penal code when committed in relation to

a child;

(b) "child" means a person under eighteen

years of age, at the time when the preliminary

interview is video recorded;

(c) "video recording" means any recording in

any medium from which a moving image may

by any means be produced and include the

accompanying sound track.

After the initial submission by the prosecution and the defence, the Learned

High Court Judge had granted permission to place the video recording of

PW7, the victim in this case on 07.08.2018. After playing the same, the

prosecution had marked the video recording as P2 and the transcript of the

same as P1.

Before going into the video recording of the victim, which has been produced

as victims examination-in-chief, I think it is appropriate and necessary to

satisfy whether the video recording of the victim can be accepted as good

evidence against the Appellant. It is the duty of the trial judge to satisfy

whether recording was in its original state sans any editing. Therefore, the

trial judge should pay due attention to the video recording and its transcript

and ensure whether the transcript carries the verbatim of the video

recording.

As the 1st, 2nd and 6th grounds of appeal are interconnected, all three

grounds will be considered together hereinafter.

CA/HCC/134/22

8 | P a g e

In his first ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Learned Trial

Judge has failed to consider the fact that the child victim was tutored by

PW1, the mother of the child during the video recording and in the second

ground the contention of the Appellant is that he was denied a fair trial by

presenting incorrect transcript of the interview conducted by the Child

Protection Authority.

In this case, the evidence surfaced during the trial was that the matrimonial

relationship had been strained between PW1 (wife) and the Appellant

(husband). The victim was in the exclusive care of PW1 when his video

evidence was recorded. Therefore, risk of undue influence which could badly

reflect on the Appellant should be excluded before accepting video evidence.

In a case of this nature, it is the profound duty of the prosecution to present

the original recorded conversation along with an accurate transcript. The use

of a transcript raises critical issues of authentication, admissibility, and

presentation during the trial. The transcript must faithfully reflect the

recording and should not be a blend of the recording and hearsay testimony

from those present during the conversation. If inaccuracies in the transcript

are compounded by potential bias in the transcription process, the transcript

may be excluded from evidence. The crucial standard is the transcript's

accuracy, as it is essential for assisting all parties involved in the trial in

comprehending the content of the recording.

When this case came up for argument before this Court, the Learned Counsel

for the Appellant informed this Court that he had the opportunity of

observing the video recording of the evidence of the child which was relied

on by the prosecution as the evidence in chief and the transcript of the

evidence produced before the Court was very much different to the video

recorded evidence of the child and the Learned Counsel requested the Court

to play the video when this matter was taken up for argument.

CA/HCC/134/22

9 | P a g e

As it is a material point, the Learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared

for the Hon. Attorney General undertook to go through the video recording

and reply appropriately with regard to this allegation as this is a material

point in deciding this appeal. Accordingly, the case was fixed for mention

enabling the parties to study the video recording.

Accordingly, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant by way of a motion, filed

a transcript marked as Z highlighting the inaccuracies in the transcript

which had been marked as P1 in the trial. The relevant portions of the

transcript of the video recording which had been marked as P1 and the

original video recording with omitted parts from the transcript are re-

produced below:

In the absence of well-defined guidelines for recording video evidence in Sri

Lanka, it is prudent to examine the methods or rules established in other

jurisdictions for recording such evidence.

The American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children, in its Practice

Guidelines under subheading Parents states:

In general, parents (or other relatives and caregivers) should not be

present during the interview. If a child refuses to separate, it may be

appropriate to allow the caregiver to be present during the initial stages

of the interview. The caregiver should be instructed not to influence the

child in any way. If possible, he or she should leave the room prior to

issues of abuse being raised.

In Panchhi and Others v State of Uttar Pradesh (1998) 7 SCC 177 the

Court held that:

The law is that the evidence of a child witness must be evaluated more

carefully and with greater circumspection because a child is susceptible to

be swayed by what others tell him and thus a child witness is an easy

prey to tutoring.

In Liyana Arachchige Lesli Wijesekera v The Attorney General

CA/HCC/0046/22 decided on 13.09.2023, Sampath B. Abayakoon.J, held

that:

It is clear from the recording that the no stage of the interview, the officer

who was instrumental in questioning the child or PW7, the female police

officer who took the child to the National Child Protection Authority and

participated at the interview as the 2nd person, has attempted to unduly

interfere with the childs statement, other than attempting to obtain the

childs statement as to what happened to her. It is clear that only with that

above objective in mind, the interviewer has posed questions to the child

not to fix anybody to the offence.

CA/HCC/134/22

17 | P a g e

In this case, as per the transcript submitted by the Appellant marked as Z,

it is manifestly clear that PW1 who was present with the child victim had

intervened and induced the victim to say against the Appellant. This clearly

reflects the mala fide intention to fix the Appellant to the crime. As his

Lordship Abayakoon. J, in the above cited judgment stated the video

recording evidence can be safely accepted if the interviewer did not intend to

fix anybody.

Also, above mentioned APSAC Practice Guidelines lays down that the

caregiver should be instructed not to influence the child in any way during

the interview.

In this case, the original video recording transcript submitted by the Counsel

for the Appellant with the leave of the Court is quite different from the

transcript relied upon the prosecution as the evidence in chief of the victim.

The transcript submitted by the Appellant clearly shows instances where

PW1, mother of the Appellant prompts the child victim to say certain things

against the Appellant, whereas, the child victim himself does not mention

anything about the Appellants involvement in such acts.

PW1, the mother of the victim child admitted in her evidence that several

complaints had been lodged against the Appellant regarding domestic

violence existed between them. A restraining order against the Appellant had

been issued by the Learned Magistrate of Mahara. Therefore, it appears that

PW1 had a strong motive to fabricate a case against the Appellant through

the victim. Hence, I conclude that accepting and considering the video

recording evidence of PW7 against the Appellant had caused great prejudice

which certainly vitiates the outcome of the case.

As the 3rd and 4th grounds are also connected to each other, the said grounds

will be considered together hereinafter.

In the 3rd ground of appeal, the Appellant contended that he was denied a

fair trial by convicting him by using and perusing the Police Information

CA/HCC/134/22

18 | P a g e

Book by the Learned High Court Judge, as it had not been produced as

evidence in the trial. Further, he articulates that he has been denied a fair

trial by shifting the burden on the Appellant to rebut the evidence of the

prosecution.

The right to a fair trial ensures that court proceedings are conducted justly

and impartially. These right mandates that the court strictly adheres to all

legal procedures and treats all parties involved with equal consideration,

ensuring that the trial process itself remains equitable and effective,

regardless of the final decision or outcome. Furthermore, the right to a fair

trial includes specific provisions regarding the composition and structure of

the court, as well as procedural safeguards designed to protect the rights of

all participants throughout the legal process. These safeguards are essential

for maintaining the integrity of the judicial system and upholding the

principles of justice and fairness.

This Court, in several of its judgments repeatedly held that the IB Extracts,

police statements of witnesses, non-summary proceedings and inquest

proceedings which are not properly admitted in evidence cannot be perused

or utilized in the judgment by the trial judge.

In Punchimahattaya v The State 76 NLR 564 the Court held that:

Court of Criminal Appeal (or Supreme Court in appeal) has not authority

to peruse statements of witnesses recorded by the police in the course

in their investigation, (i.e., statement in the Information Book) other than

those properly admitted in evidence by way of contradiction or

otherwise.

This Court in Priyal Indrajith and two others v The Attorney General

CA/HCC/ 300-302/2018 decided on 16.01.2023 held that:

It is trite law that a judge has no power to utilize the statements made by

witnesses to the police, inquest evidence and non-summary evidence when

they were not properly admitted in evidence. In this case as the Learned

High Court Judge had adopted an incorrect approach by referring and

CA/HCC/134/22

19 | P a g e

comparing police statement and non-summary evidence of PW2 when she

evaluated the evidence given by PW2 in the High Court trial. This is a

fundamental error on the part of the Learned High Court Judge which

certainly prejudicial to the substantial rights of the Appellant.

In the case, the Learned High Court Judge had examined the Information

Book of the police and utilized in her judgment to reach the conclusion that

the Appellant is guilty of the charges brought against him.

In a criminal trial, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the Appellant to prove his

innocence. This is the Golden Thread as discussed in Woolmington v. DPP

[1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held that:

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner..the prosecution has not made out the case

and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

The Learned High Court Judge in her judgment at pages 442, 443 and 446

had stated as follows:

The above cited portions of the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge

are testaments that the Appellant had been denied a fair trial by shifting the

burden of proof on to the Appellant which is a clear misdirection of law.

In the fifth ground of appeal the Appellant contends that the Learned High

Court Judge has failed to consider the failure to produce the CDs which

were taken in to custody by the National Child Protection Authority warrants

the Application of Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance.

Production of obscene Compact Disks (CD) is important to secure conviction

in count number three in the indictment. It should be one of the allegations

was that the Appellant had showed obscene video to the victim child who

was 4 years and four months old at the time of the offence.

PW10, the investigating officer had taken into custody the Compact Disks

which contained obscene videos. But the prosecution had not produced

those CDs in the trial. As correctly noted by the Counsel for the Appellant,

although PW1 testified that the victim had requested the police officers to

play the obscene video when they played cartoon CDs, the failure to produce

the obscene CDs undermines the credibility of the prosecution's case.

Although the Learned High Court Judge after perusing the IB Extracts

confirmed that the police had taken the CDs into their custody, the benefit

CA/HCC/134/22

22 | P a g e

of non-production the same was not awarded to the Appellant. Ignorance of

the legal maxim that justice to one party should not result into injustice to

other party had caused great prejudice to the Appellant and denied a fair

trial which is guaranteed in the Supreme Law of the country.

Finally, under the sixth ground of ground appeal, the Appellant extended a

legal argument that the Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider

that PW1, who was the wife of the Appellant is not competent witness to give

evidence as far as the charges are concern.

When PW1, the wife of the Appellant gave evidence, their marriage had not

been dissolved by a competent court. As such, she is the legal wife of the

Appellant.

As per Section 120(2) of the Evidence Ordinance, PW1 is not a competent

witness to give evidence against the Appellant.

But Section 81 of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance as amended

states:

Notwithstanding anything in the Evidence Ordinance contained, the wife

or husband of a person charged with an offence specified in the first

schedule shall be a competent witness for the prosecution.

FIRST SCHEDULE

OFFENCES AGAINST CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS IN RESPECT OF

WHICH SPECIAL PROVISIONS OF THE ORDINANCE APPLY.

(1) Any offence under Section 308 or 360 of the Penal Code.

(2) Any offence against child or young person under any of the following

section of the Penal Code.

Sections: 296,297,343,345,360A,365,365A

(3) Any offence against any of the following sections of this Ordinance;

Sections: 72,74,73 and 74

CA/HCC/134/22

23 | P a g e

Any other offence involving bodily injury to a child or young person.

In this case, the Appellant was indicted with two counts of Grave Sexual

Abuse punishable under Section 365 (b) 2 (b) of the Penal Code as amended

by Act No.22 of 1995. The third count was indicted under Section 345 of the

Penal Code as amended by Act No.22 of 1995.

As submitted by Learned Counsel for the Appellant, Sections 365 (b) 2 (b)

and 345 were introduced by the Penal Code amendment Act No.22 of 1995.

Therefore, in order to make wife or husband a competent witness under the

Children and Young Persons Ordinance, the 1st schedule should have been

amended by adding Sections 365 (b) 2 (b) and 345 of the Penal Code to the

1st schedule. But the Legislature has not yet brought such an amendment to

make the wife or husband a competent witness when the husband or wife is

charged under Sections 365(b) 2 (b) and 345 of the Penal Code. Hence, by

allowing PW1 as a competent witness against the Appellant, the Learned

High Court Judge had misdirected herself and illegally used the said

evidence against the Appellant and thereby denied a fair trial to the

Appellant.

In Hattuwan Pedige Sugath Karunaratne v. The Attorney General SC

Appeal 32 of 2020 Aluwihare PC J., held that:

No doubt the duty of a State Counsel is to present the Prosecution in an

effective manner to the best of their ability in furtherance of securing a

conviction, if the evidence can support the charge. The Prosecutor,

however, is an officer of the court and their role is to assist the court to

dispense justice. Thus, it is not for a Prosecutor to ensure a conviction at

any cost, but to see that the truth is elicited, and justice is meted out. A

Prosecutor is not expected to keep out relevant facts either from the court

or from the accused. It the investigation has revealed matters which are

favourable to the Accused and the accused is unaware of the existence

CA/HCC/134/22

24 | P a g e

of such facts, it is the bounden duty of the Prosecutor to make those

facts available to the court and to the defence.

In this case the grounds of appeal considered above have merits which

certainly disturbs the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge.

The prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The

Learned High Court Judge misdirecting herself had failed to consider the

improbability of the story of the prosecution. She had misdirected in law and

had failed to follow accepted legal concepts that should have been followed

in this case.

Considering all the circumstances discussed above, this court could only

come to the conclusion that the prosecution has not proven the case beyond

reasonable doubt. Therefore, the Appellant is acquitted from the charges.

The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside.

The Registrar of this court is directed to send this judgment along with the

original case record to the High Court of Colombo.
