Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the appellant) on the basis of being aggrieved of his conviction and sentence by

the learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Ratnapura for committing

grave sexual abuse on a male minor between the periods of 01-02-2012 and 14-

03-2012, at a place called Kiribathgala, Watapatha, within the jurisdiction of the

High Court of Ratnapura, and thereby committing an offence punishable in

terms of section 365B(2)(b) of the Penal Code as amended by the Penal Code

(Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1995, 29 of 1998 and 16 of 2006.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of his Judgement dated 30-07-2021

found the appellant guilty as charged, and after hearing the submissions on

behalf of the appellant in mitigation, sentenced the appellant for 12 years

rigorous imprisonment. He was also ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 20,000/- and to

serve a default sentence of 6 months simple imprisonment.

In addition to the above sentence and the fine, he was also ordered to pay Rs.

150,000/- to the victim child who has given evidence as PW-01 during the trial

as compensation, and in default, he was sentenced to 1-year simple

Page 3 of 10

imprisonment. It has been ordered that the default sentences should be served

consecutively.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this Appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following two grounds of appeal for the consideration of Court.

1. The date of the offence and the place of offence has not been proved by

the prosecution.

2. The prosecution has failed to adduce any evidence to establish that the

accused was present on the alleged date and place of the offence.

Facts in Brief

Since the grounds of appeal are in relation to the date and the place of offence, I

will now summarize the evidence led before the Court in that regard.

PW-01, who was the victim child, had been a 12-year-old at the time relevant to

this incident. The evidence led before the Court clearly establishes the fact that

although he was 18 years of age at the time he gave evidence, he was a person

who has studied only up to grade 3 and a person who is unable to read and

write. It appears that the learned High Court Judge has taken note of this fact,

and before allowing the prosecution to lead evidence of PW-01 had satisfied

himself by posing several questions to PW-01 as to whether he is a person who

can give evidence before the Court, could understand the proceedings and

whether the Court can rely on his evidence, despite him being almost an illiterate

person.

Having satisfied on the above facts, the learned High Court Judge has allowed

the prosecution to lead his evidence. It is clear from his evidence that he was

unable to remember the date upon which he faced the grave sexual abuse

incident.

Page 4 of 10

However, he has been very clear that it was the appellant whom the witness has

referred to as Beeri Kalu Ayya ( ) who committed this grave sexual

abuse on him. The evidence shows that this was not the only incident of sexual

abuse faced by him. This sexual abuse incident has come to light after another

person has abused the child in the similar manner and when that complaint was

lodged at the police station.

Under cross-examination, it has been revealed that when the Judicial Medical

Officer (JMO) examined the child after the 2nd incident, he has informed the

doctor that the incident involving the appellant occurred one month before.

However, it has also been revealed that the child in his statement to the police

has stated that the 1st incident was the incident involving the other person who

is said to have abused the child. His evidence also shows that this incident has

occurred in a rubber estate called Ayagama Estate, which is an estate situated

near the village.

The defence taken up by the appellant had been a mere denial. The evidence of

PW-01 had been the only evidence in relation to the incident as the complaint

had been made some time after the incident when another incident of similar

nature had come to light.

The evidence of the JMO does not reveal any visible signs of sexual abuse,

obviously due to the reason that this was an incident that has happened some

time back to the date of examination of the victim. However, the JMOs evidence

reveals that in giving the history of the incident, the child has stated that about

one month prior to the examination, the person called Beera had anal

intercourse with him. The doctors evidence also confirms that the victim child

was a child with low IQ, and an incident of this nature can occur even without

visible injuries to an anus.

The evidence given by the police officers who conducted investigations into this

matter reveals that the child has made a statement after what was revealed by

Page 5 of 10

him to the JMO about this incident of grave sexual abuse when he was produced

before the JMO for examination in relation to another incident of similar nature.

At the conclusion of the trial, when the learned High Court Judge decided to call

for a defence from the appellant, he has made a dock statement and had only

stated that he has done nothing wrong to PW-01 and because of that to discharge

him from the case.

It appears from the line of cross-examination of the witnesses including the

victim that the stand taken by the appellant had been a mere denial. It has been

suggested to the victim that when the complaint was made in relation to the

other incident, PW-01 failed to mention anything about the incident relating to

the indictment because no such incident happened. However, the victim had

denied that position and stated that such an incident occurred as stated by him

in his evidence.

Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal

It is trite law that no witness can be expected to have a photographic memory of

what happened in an incident of this nature, especially when it comes to a child

of 12 years old and a person of low IQ. No Court can expect such a child to be

100 percent perfect in his evidence.

However, this Court is very much mindful of the fact that the duty of proving the

charge is always on the prosecution and the standard of proof is beyond

reasonable doubt. Just because the witness is a child and a person of low IQ,

that does not mean the standard of proof become lower than in normal

circumstances, but it remains the same. Any evidence led in relation to an

incident of this nature has to be viewed keeping the above principles in mind.

As the two grounds of appeal contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant

are interrelated and relates to the place of the incident and the date of incident,

I will now proceed to consider the said grounds of appeal together.

Page 6 of 10

The evidence of the child clearly establishes the fact that this incident happened

in the village where he was living. In his evidence, he has given his place of

residence as Kiribathgala, Watapatha which is the place of the incident

mentioned in the charge sheet. Therefore, there was no basis for the appellant

to be misled as to the place of the incident mentioned in the indictment, since,

this is the place where the victim child and the appellant himself live.

The evidence shows that at the time of the incident, the victim child had been

riding his foot cycle near his home and the incident has happened in a rubber

estate nearby. It also reveals that the appellant is a well-known person to the

victim child and he has not revealed this incident to anyone, may be due to the

fact of his inability to understand the gravity of what he has faced.

It has been revealed in his evidence that even the 2nd incident of grave sexual

abuse faced by him had not been revealed by him to his elders, and it had only

come to light because another villager has seen the 2nd incident, which has led

to a complaint being made to the police.

As considered above, I find that there was clear evidence placed before the trial

Court as to the place of the incident, and the learned High Court Judge has well

considered that fact and had come to a firm finding that the incident had

occurred at Kiribathgala, Watapatha as mentioned in the indictment. I find no

reason to disagree with the said finding of the learned High Court Judge. I am of

the view that it was the only finding that an be reached when considering the

evidence as a whole.

When it comes to the date of the incident, it is correct to say that the victim child

has failed to give the date of the incident. It appears that based on what the child

has said to the JMO when he was examined as to the date of the incident, the

prosecution has given a time period between 01-02-2012 to 14-03-2012 as the

period upon the incident occurred.

Page 7 of 10

Section 165 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act which refers to the

particulars as to time, place and the person that should be stated in a charge

reads as follows.

165. (1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and

place of the alleged offence and as to the person (if any) against whom

and as to the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed as

are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with

which he is charged and to show that the offence is not prescribed.

The section itself is clear that the purpose of giving the date and place of the

incident is to give sufficient notice of the charge against him to the accused.

Therefore, only if it can be shown that the appellant has been misled or could

not put forward his defence as a result of the witness who speaks about the

incident being unable to give a specific date of the incident, it becomes relevant

to say that the prosecution has failed to establish the charge against him.

This aspect was sufficiently discussed in the case of Rex Vs. Dossi 13 Cr. App.

R. 158, where it was held that a date specified in an indictment is not material

unless it is an essential part of the alleged offence; the defendant may be

convicted although the jury finds that the offence was committed on a date other

than that specified in the indictment, amendment of the indictment is

unnecessary although it will be a good practice to do so (provided that there is

no prejudice to the accused), where it is clear on the evidence that the offence

was committed and it was committed on the day other than that specified.

In the case of D. R. M. Pandithakoralage (Excise Inspector) Vs. V. K.

Selvanayagam 56 NLR 143, it was held that a mistaken date in an indictment

is not a material error unless the date is of the essence of the offence or the

accused is prejudiced.

As considered before, the accused had not taken up any particular line of defence

other than a mere denial. He has not disputed that both himself and the victim

child knew each other well and lived in the same area mentioned in the

Page 8 of 10

indictment. Therefore, I am of the view that the appellant had not been

prejudiced under any circumstances by PW-01s failure to give a specific date of

the incident, as the prosecution has mentioned a period of time as the period of

the incident based on the facts available to the prosecution.

Although there are few omissions and discrepancies in the evidence of the victim

child, as I have stated before, they become material only if they create a

reasonable doubt with regard to the truthfulness of the evidence of PW-01.

In the case of Mahathun and Others Vs. Attorney General (2015) 1 SLR 74,

it was held,

1. When faced with contradictions in a witness testimonial, the Court must

bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions, viewed in

light of the whole of the evidence given by the witness.

2. Too great a significance cannot be attached to minor discrepancies, or

contradictions.

3. What is important is whether the witness is telling the truth on the

material matters concerned with the event.

4. Where evidence is greatly reliable, much importance should not be

attached to the minor discrepancies and technical errors.

5. A Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial Judge with

regard to the acceptance or rejection of testimony of a witness unless it is

manifestly wrong.

Another matter, which needs attention in a case of this nature, is the fact that it

was only the PW-01, namely the victim child who has given evidence in relation

to the incident faced by him.

It is settled law that corroboration is unnecessary in a case of this nature if the

evidence of a victim is cogent and reliable, since the evidence should be weighed,

not counted.

Page 9 of 10

Having considered the evidence in its totality, I find that the evidence of the

victim child was highly reliable and cogent. The evidence of the JMO establishes

that the child had been consistent in his story at all relevant points. The stand

taken up by the appellant had not created any doubt as to the truthfulness of

the evidence by the victim and the other witnesses who gave evidence before the

trial Court.

Another matter that needs to be mentioned is that it was the same learned High

Court Judge who has heard the evidence from the very commencement to the

end. Therefore, he had the priceless advantage of observing the witnesses

throughout the trial. It is with that advantage the learned High Court Judge has

proceeded to consider the evidence in order to come to his finding of guilt of the

appellant.

In the case of Alwis Vs. Piyasena Fernando (1993) 1 SLR 119, G.P.S. de Silva,

C.J. stated that

The Court of Appeal would not lightly disturb the findings of primary facts

made by a trial Judge unless it is manifestly wrong as they have the

priceless advantage of observing the demeanour of witnesses which the

Judge of the Court of Appeal does not have.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the evidence placed

before the Court with a thorough understating of the legal principles that he has

to bear in mind when considering the evidence in a case of this nature. The

learned High Court Judge has considered the probability factor of the evidence

by the victim child and has considered as a whole the credibility and truthfulness

of the evidence. He has also considered the discrepancies and omissions in its

correct perspective and the defence put forward by the accused with the weight

that needs to be given to a dock statement made by an accused.

After having considered the evidence, the learned High Court Judge has come to

his finding of the guilt of the accused, which I find no reasons to disagree with,

as it was sound in law as well as the facts placed before the High Court.

Page 10 of 10

Accordingly, I find no merit in the considered grounds of Appeal. The appeal is

dismissed, and the conviction and sentence affirmed.

However, having considered the fact that the appellant had been in incarceration

from his date of conviction on 30-07-2021, it is ordered that the sentence shall

deem to have been commenced from the date of the sentence, namely 30-07-

2021.
