MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.Thisisanapplicationfiled by the Applicant-Respondent-Petitioner(hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) seeking leave to appeal from theOrderoftheBoardofQuazisdated20-05-2023incaseNo. 70/22/R/CMB. The leave to appeal was granted on 13-07-2023.

ThePetitionermarriedtheRespondent-Petitioner-Respondent(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) on 23-04-2005 under and interms of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, No. 13 of 1951 (asamended). There are three children born out of this marriage, namely,Mohamed Ameen Alfa (17 years), Mohamed Ameen Amhar (13 years) andMohamed Ameen Aaliya (4 years). During the pendency of this marriage,the Respondent (husband) contracted another marriage and neglected tomaintain the Petitioner and the said three children. Therefore, thePetitioner made an application on 17-06-2020 before the learned Quaziof Negombo claiming maintenance for herself and the children. Upon theapplication made by the Respondent, the Judicial Service Commissiontransferred the said application to the learned Quazi of Colombo East.

After inquiry, the learned Quazi of Colombo East, on 11-06-2022 orderedthe Respondent to pay a sum of Rs. 15,000/- to the Petitioner and a totalsum of Rs. 45,000/- (20,000+15,000+10,000) per month for the childrenas maintenance, from the date of application.

Since the Respondent failed to comply with the said Order, the learnedQuaziissuedanenforcementcertificatedated19-10-2022totheMagistrates Court of Negombo to recover a sum of Rs. 1,740,000/-beingthe accrued arrears of maintenance for the period between 19-06-2020 to15-10-2022.

Thereupon, the Respondent on 26-10-2022 invoked the revisionaryjurisdiction of the Board of Quazis seeking to set aside the said Order ofthe learned Quazi. Subsequently, the Respondent filed an amendedPetition and moved for an interim order to stay all the proceedings bothin the Quazi Court of Colombo East and the Magistrates Court ofNegombo. The Board of Quazi, on 20-05-2023, issued an interim Orderstaying all proceedings in the Quazi Court of Colombo East and Orderedthe said Quazi to recall the said certificate of enforcement filed in the

Magistrate's Court of Negombo in case bearing No. 126/22. It is againstthat Order, the instant appeal was preferred by the Petitioner.

This Court is mindful of the fact that the Respondent has not paidmaintenance to the Petitioner and his children from 19-06-2020 up todate. It appears to this Court that the Board of Quazis has not stated thereasons for the said interim Order. It is settled law that satisfactoryreasons should be given for the judicial and quasi-judicial decisions. Adecision not supported by adequate reasons is liable to be quashed.Giving reasons for a judicial decision is an important feature in todayscontext, which cannot be lightly disregarded. Moreover, in a situation,where giving reasons have been ignored, such a Court would run the riskof having acted arbitrarily in coming to its conclusion.

TheRespondentwasinarrearsofmaintenanceinasumofRs. 2,160,000/- at the time of issuing the impugned stay order. In sucha situation, there is a duty cast upon the Board of Quazis to give strongand cogent reasons to recall the said enforcement certificate, whereas theBoard of Quazi has totally failed to do so. In those circumstances, it isthe considered view of this Court that the impugned stay order is liableto be quashed on that ground alone. The Board of Quazis has failed toconsider the fact that it is the fundamental duty of the Respondent tomaintain his spouse and children, he has ignored that duty andcontracted another marriage. It is to be noted that the Board of Quazishas made the impugned Order ex-parte without hearing the Petitionerand thereby failed to adhere to the principle of audi alteram partem.

It is borne out from the proceedings before the learned Quazi, that theinquiry was held inter-parte and the Respondent was heard beforemaking his Order. The Respondent has placed his signature on allproceedings. The Respondent was present in Court on the day themaintenance Order was made. Moreover, before issuing the enforcementcertificate, the learned Quazi had issued a show cause notice to theRespondent,returnableon15-10-2022.On15-10-2022, since theRespondent failed to comply with the Order of the learned Quazi, theenforcementcertificatewasissued.Inthosecircumstances,itisabundantly clear that the averment contained in paragraph 11 of theamended Petition filed before the Board of Quazis stating that the

Page 4 of 5

learned Quazi has made the Order without the knowledge of theRespondent is erroneous. The Respondent has suppressed the materialfacts to the Board of Quazis and obtained the impugned stay Order.Furthermore, as the Respondent had not paid the maintenance to thePetitioner and his children right throughout, it is the view of this Courtthat the Respondent did not come before the Board of Quazis with cleanhands, and therefore, he is not entitled to invoke the revisionaryjurisdiction of the Board of Quazis.
