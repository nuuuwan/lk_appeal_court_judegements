Introduction

This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of

Rathnapura, affirming the eviction order issued by the learned Magistrate of

Balangoda against the Respondent-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred

to as the Appellant) under the provisions of the State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 07 of 1999, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the Act).

Factual background

The Chairman of the Land Reform Commission (hereinafter referred to as the

LRC), the Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent), acting as the competent authority, submitted an application to the

Magistrates Court of Balangoda under Section 5 of the Act, seeking eviction of

the Appellant from the land described in the schedule attached to the application.

Along with the application, a supporting affidavit sworn by the Chairman of the

LRC and a copy of the quit notice were filed, in accordance with Section 5(3) of

the Act.

Upon receiving the application, the learned Magistrate issued summons to the

Appellant, requiring him to appear and show cause. In response, the Appellant

filed objections, seeking the dismissal of the application on the following

grounds.

i. The Respondent is not a natural person who could form an opinion in

terms of the Act and therefore, the application is bad in law.

ii. The application does not contain the date on which it was made and

therefore, not in conformity with the Act.

4

CA/PHC/0046/2019

iii. A Partition action is pending in the District Court of Balangoda and

therefore, the application cannot be maintained.

In his order, the learned Magistrate dismissed the Appellant's contentions and

issued the order for the Appellant's ejectment1.

The aggrieved Appellant sought revision of the Magistrate's Order by filing an

application in the High Court of Rathnapura, raising the same grounds as

presented before the Magistrate2

The learned High Court Judge, by an Order delivered on 14th March 2019,

dismissed the Appellant's application. The Appellant has now appealed to this

Court, raising identical grounds of appeal3.

Analysis

I will now analyze the grounds for appeal raised by the Appellant.

The Petitioner is not a natural person.

The Appellant contended that in terms of Section 3(1) of the Act before issuing

a quit notice, the initial step for ejectment, the competent authority must form

the opinion that the land is a state land and that the person is in unauthorized

possession or occupation of such land. Consequently, it was contended that the

competent authority must be a natural person capable of forming such an

opinion.

The term competent authority is defined in Section 18, the interpretation

Section of the Act. Section 18(h) of the Act reads as follows;

Section 18(h) The head of any other Government Department or Institution

being a department or institution created by law, where such land is under the

control of such department or institution.

Accordingly, along with the Heads of Department and the officials specified as

competent authority under Section 18 of the Act, the Heads of Department or

1 Order dated 2nd June 2017, at page 144 of the appeal brief. 2 Paragraph 5 of the Petition filed at the High Court, at page 6 of the appeal brief. 3 Vide paragraph 01.05 of the Petition of Appeal, at page 1 of the appeal brief.

5

CA/PHC/0046/2019

Institution created by law where such land is under the control are also

considered competent authorities. The LRC, being an entity established under

the Land Reform Law No. 1 of 1972, as amended, has its chairman as the head

of the Commission.

Therefore, I am of the view that the Chairman of the LRC is a competent

authority in accordance with the provisions of the Act cited above. The person

holding the position of Chairman is a natural person who could form an opinion.

Furthermore, Section 18(l) provides that; an officer generally or specially

authorized by a corporate body is also a competent authority.

However, the present application was not made by an officer of the LRC

appointed under Section 51 of the LRC Act. Therefore, the issue of obtaining

authorization from the Commission does not arise.

Even it is assumed that this application falls under Section 18(l) of the LRC Act,

which requires the Chairman to obtain authorization from the Commission of

which he is the Chairman, Section 114(d) of the Evidence Ordinance presumes

that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed.

Subection 14(1) of the Act states that in the exercise, performance, and discharge

of his powers, duties, and functions under the Act, a competent authority is

subject to the direction and control of the Minister in charge of the subject of

State land .Furthermore, Subsection 14(2) stipulates that a competent authority

may not exercise any power under Section 3 of the Act concerning any land

vested in, owned by, or under the control of the Sri Lanka Army, Navy, or Air

Force; the Urban Development Authority; or the Sri Lanka Ports Authority

without prior approval from the Minister in charge of the relevant subject. Aside

from the general provision that the competent authority is under the direction

and control of the Minister in charge of State land, there is no specific

requirement preventing the LRC from exercising powers under Section 3 without

the Minister's prior approval. Therefore, in my view the Chairman of the LRC,

as the head of the institution, is entitled to exercise such powers.

6

CA/PHC/0046/2019

The Appellant cited the judgment of Wedamulla v. Abeysingha4 in support of

their contention that competent authority should be an officer generally or

specially authorized by a corporate body5. However, this was a case where the

Additional Director General of the Urban Development Authority acted as the

competent authority. As I have already stated, the Act itself provides that for an

officer to act, prior approval of the Minister in charge is required. Although it is

not required under the Act, the Minister's authority was nonetheless submitted to

the Court in the above case. Thus, the facts of that case are significantly different

from case at hand and do not serve as judicial precedent for the current matter.

Nonetheless, the Supreme Court in that case applied the maxim Ominia

praesumuntur rite et solemniter esse acta, which is defined in L.B. Curzon's A

Dictionary of Law6 as All things are presumed to be done correctly and solemnly

until the contrary is proven. Therefore, as I have stated above, even if it is

assumed that the Chairman of the LRC requires authority to act under Section 3

of the Act, it can be presumed that such authority was duly obtained.

The learned Magistrate observed that the Chairman of the LRC, acting as the

competent authority, issued the quit notice pursuant to Section 3 of the Act and

subsequently filed an application with the Magistrates Court seeking recovery

of possession of the state land. He observed that in terms of Section 9 of the Act,

other than establishing that the Appellant is in possession of the land upon a valid

permit or other written authority issued by the state, granted in accordance with

any written law, the Appellant is not entitled to contest any matters stated in the

application under Section 5. Consequently, the learned Magistrate issued the

order for ejectment.

The learned High Court Judge affirmed the decision of the learned Magistrate

and cited the case of W.H.M. Gunarathne and four others v. Land Reform

4 [1999] 3 Sri. L.R. 26. 5 Paragraph 22 (1) of the Respondents written submission. 6 Second edition.

CA/PHC/0046/2019

Commission and another7 in support of the contention that the LRC is a

competent authority under the Act. In the above case this Court observed that in

all the above facts and circumstances it is clear that the Land Reform

Commission had power and authority to invoke the provisions of the State Land

Recovery of Possession Act, to achieve the objectives of the Land Reform Law,

and recover possession of land vested by operation of law in the Land Reform

Commission. However, the issue raised by the Appellant in this case is not about

the LRC's authority to operate under the Act, but rather whether the Chairman

of the LRC has the authority to serve as the competent authority. Therefore, the

judgment does not serve as a judicial precedent for the matter at hand.

Based on the analysis above, I conclude that the Chairman of the LRC qualifies

as a competent authority under the Act.

Application does not contain a date and is therefore not in the prescribed

format

Admittedly, the application for ejectment in Form B, made under Section 5 of

the Act does not specify the date8. However, the accompanying affidavit does

include the date on which it was attested9. According to the journal entry of

Balangoda Magistrates Court Case No. 32360 the application had been

presented to court on the 10th March 2017. The learned Magistrate correctly

observed the above fact in his Order.

As correctly pointed out by the Appellant, there was a considerable delay in

presenting the application to the Magistrates Court after the quit notice was

issued, with the delay being nearly a year. However, the Act does not specify a

time limit for submitting an application to the Court following the issuance of a

quit notice. Form 'B' is the prescribed format for the application submitted to the

Court for ejectment, and the date on the application is relevant solely for

establishing when it was filed. In contrast, the date on the quit notice in Form 'A'

CA/PHC/0046/2019

is significant because the occupier must be granted a minimum of thirty days

from the date of issuance or exhibiting the quit notice.

N.S. Bindra in his treatise Interpretation of Statutes10 state as follows regarding

the Forms in schedules. Forms appended to a schedule to a statute may be

referred to for the purpose of throwing light on the construction of the statute. If

such forms are merely given as models, and by way of example, or for

departmental purposes, their bearing on the construction of enacting sections is

less than if they form an essential element in the operation of a statute. If a Form

included in a schedule to a statute is made imperative by the statute, or is in

terms which indicate that it is intended to be imperative, it must be strictly

followed

The legislature in Section 3(4) of the Act has unequivocally enacted that the quit

notice shall be in Form A set out in the schedule to the Act which reads thus;

Every quit notice shall be in Form A set out in the Schedule to this Act.

However, there is no such language used in respect of the application to Court

and the supporting affidavit. In Section 5(1) it is enacted that Competent

authority () may make an application in writing in the Form B set out in the

schedule to this Act (). Further, in Section 5(2) it is enacted that ()

application under sub section (1) shall be supported by an affidavit in the Form

C set out in the schedule to this Act ().

In the two instances mentioned above, while the legislature made it mandatory

to use Form A, it did not impose the same requirement for Forms B and C.

The law simply states that a competent authority may submit an application in

writing using Form B. In my opinion, the word may pertain to the first part

of the sentence concerning the authority's discretion to make the application, and

it is not relevant to the second part regarding Form B specified in the Schedule.

Likewise, in Section 5(2), the word shall apply to the first part of the sentence,

which requires that the application under subsection (1) be supported by an

10 N.S. Bindra, Interpretation of Statutes, Twelfth Edition, at page 312.

9

CA/PHC/0046/2019

affidavit, but it does not extend to the second part concerning Form C set out

in the Schedule.

Thus, it is evident that the legislature, having made Form A mandatory in clear

terms, intentionally chose not to impose the same requirement for Forms B and

C.

Furthermore, Section 3 of the Act does not specify the details that must be

included in a quit notice. The matters that must be included in a quit notice are

specified only in Form A. Section 3 merely outlines the issues on which the

competent authority must form an opinion and the subsequent steps to be taken.

In contrast, Section 5(1) (a) of the Act specifies the matters that must be included

in the application to the Court. Even concerning the affidavit, Section 5(2) only

requires that the application be supported by an affidavit verifying the matters

stated in the application. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the details in the

affidavit should correspond with those in the application.

As previously stated, the legislature, in its wisdom, has made the use of Form

A mandatory, but not Forms B and C. This further supports this Courts

observation that adherence to Form A is compulsory, whereas Forms B and

C are provided merely as models.

However, it is always prudent to follow model Forms B and C to ensure

accuracy, although it is not mandatory.

In the case of Kandiah v. Abeykoon11, cited by the Appellant, this Court noted

that the Magistrate must ensure that the documents constituting the application

for ejectment, as referenced in Section 5(3) of the Act, are in the statutorily

prescribed Form.

However, based on the analysis of the relevant provisions of the Act, it is my

considered view that only the quit notice must be in the statutorily prescribed

11 Sriskanthas Law Reports, Vol. IV, Part 10, p. 96.

10

CA/PHC/0046/2019

Form A, whereas the application to the Court (Form B) and the supporting

affidavit (Form C) do not need to adhere to the same level of formality.

The Appellants sole argument is that the application to the Court lacks a date,

and thus it is not in the prescribed Form. As I have stated above, it is not

mandatory for the application to adhere strictly to the prescribed form, and the

absence of the date does not constitute a valid reason for rejecting the

application.

Effect of the partition action pending in the District Court of Ratnapura.

The Appellant argued that the LRC intervened in the partition action numbered

4686/P, in which the Appellant is also a Defendant, claiming title to the subject

land. Consequently, the Appellant contended that the title to the land is in dispute

and has yet to be resolved by the District Court, which is the competent Court to

determine the title. He asserted that after intervening into the partition action, the

LRC subsequently filed the application under the Act to bypass the results of that

partition action.

Section 12 of the Act provides that nothing in this Act contained shall preclude

any person who has been ejected from a land under the provisions of the Act or

any person claiming to be the owner thereof from instituting an action against

the State for the vindication of his title thereto within six months from the date of

the order of ejectment. Hence, it is clear that even if an ejectment order is issued

under the Act, the Appellant is still entitled to vindicate his title in the partition

action. As it was held by this Court in plethora of cases the mechanism under the

Act is provided for the State to recover possession of State land unlawfully

occupied by any person expeditiously.

Additionally, Section 13 of the Act states that any person who has been ejected

under its provisions and later has the title vindicated in his favor is entitled to

recover compensation for the damages incurred due to being compelled to

deliver up possession of his land

11

CA/PHC/0046/2019

Hence, it is my considered view that the pending partition action is not an

impediment to maintain the application for ejectment under the Act.

Therefore, I am of the view that the pending partition action does not an

impediment to maintain the application for ejectment under the Act.

The Appellant presented an additional argument that there is insufficient proof

of serving the quit notice.

The quit notice had been sent on the 6th April 201612. The Respondent produced

the registered postal article in proof of the fact that the quit notice was dispatched

to the Appellant by registered post13.

The Appellant contended that in the registered postal article the date and the

name and title of the sender are unclear. While it is true that these details are not

clearly stated in the registered postal article which was voluntarily produced by

the Appellant, even though there was no statutory requirement to do so, it is

important to note that the Appellant has not explicitly denied receiving the notice

in the affidavit, filed in the Magistrates Court along with his objections.

Furthermore, in the application for ejectment and in the affidavit the Respondent

states that the quit notice was exhibited in the land as well. As per Section 9(2)

of the Act it is not competent for the Magistrate to call for any evidence from the

competent authority in support of the application. Moreover, as I have already

stated, the Appellant is not entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the

application other than that he is in possession on a valid permit or other written

authority.

Conclusion

In light of the above analysis, I am of the view that the learned Magistrate

correctly dismissed the objections raised by the Appellant and proceeded to issue

the order for ejectment.

CA/PHC/0046/2019

The learned High Court Judge effectively analysed the relevant law, upheld the

decision of the learned Magistrate, and dismissed the application for revision on

the grounds that the Appellant failed to establish any illegality that would shock

the conscience of the Court. It was, therefore, concluded that there were no

exceptional circumstances warranting interference with the impugned order of

the learned Magistrate.

In light of the foregoing analysis, I dismiss this appeal, with costs of Rs. 50,000/-
