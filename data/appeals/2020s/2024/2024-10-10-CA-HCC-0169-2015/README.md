ARGUED ON : 30.09.2024

DECIDED ON : 10.10.2024

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J. When this matter was taken up for argument on 30.09.2024, the

Attorney-at-Law for the appellant, Mr. J.P. Gamage informed court that

he would limit this appeal to the sentence and will not persue with the

appeal against conviction. Accordingly, the appeal against the

conviction was abandoned. The appeal against the sentence will be

considered.

Another accused person and the Appellant were indicted with four

counts as follows;

1. Under Section 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Act for trafficking of 634kg of Cannabis Sativa L.

2. Under Section 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Act for possessing the said 634kg of Cannabis Sativa L.

3. Under the Section 22(3) read with Section 22(1) of the Firearms

Ordinance No. 33 of 1916 for being in possession of a locally

made firearm.

4. Under Section 27 read with Section 09(2) of the Explosives Act

No. 21 of 1956 for being in possession of a live cartridge.

At the commencement of the trial, the 1st accused had pleaded guilty

on 18.07.2011 and was sentenced as follows;

One years RI and a fine of Rs.50,000/- was imposed for counts one and

two separately. Then, rigorous imprisonment of one year with a fine of

Rs. 5,000/- was imposed for counts three and four respectively. Upon

imposing the said sentences, the same were ordered to run

concurrently.

As the Accused-Appellant (hereinafter also referred to as the Appellant)

pleaded not guilty the matter proceeded to trial. At the end of which the

Trial Judge found the 2nd accused guilty and convicted him in respect

of all four counts and sentenced him to: two years RI for counts one

and two respectively and rigorous imprisonment of one year with a fine

of Rs. 10,000/- for counts No. 03 and rigorous imprisonment for one

year with a fine of Rs. 25,000/- for count No. 04 and a default of six

months imprisonment. Thereafter, the sentences-imposed for counts

three and four were ordered to run concurrently along with the

sentences imposed for counts one and two. The end result is that the

appellant was required to serve a sentence of four years RI being a two-

year term each for counts one and two to be served consecutively.

It is against this sentence that the accused had preferred this appeal

and learned Counsel submitted that a variation on the sentence be

made in favour of the appellant for following reasons;

1. The current medical condition of the Appellant.

2. The disparity in the sentence between the 1st accused and the

appellant.

In opposition, the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG), Ms. Disna

Warnakula argued that the sentence should not be reduced and

considering the facts and circumstances the sentence ought to be

enhanced. In support of the argument, she relied on the following;

Page 4 of 9

1. That the facts and circumstances are serious as the 2nd accused

was a reserve Police Constable in active service at the time he

committed the offence and he was in uniform.

2. The appellant absconded for over a month.

3. The quantity is 634kg which is a substantial amount.

4. In respect of counts one and two, the law has specified a

minimum mandatory sentence of two years imprisonment.

Now, I will briefly narrate the facts albeit the brief that led to this

indictment.

According to the prosecution evidence on 06.09.2004, a team of officers

travelling along the Thanamalwila Embilipitiya road has observed a

vehicle approaching with its lights on. As it appeared to be suspicious,

the officers have ordered the said vehicle to stop. Notwithstanding the

said order the vehicle has continued without stopping. The said team

of officers had given chase and stopped the said vehicle and when

approaching and observed the 2nd accused-appellant taking to his heels

and escaping from the scene. He had been in his police uniform and the

officers have clearly identified him to be the Appellant, a fellow Reserve

Police Constable. On searching the vehicle, the 1st accused had been

arrested and 30 bags of Cannabis along with a locally made firearm and

a live cartridge were recovered.

Since this day, the Appellant had not reported for duty and was

absconding. A month thereafter, he had been apprehended whilst being

admitted to a local hospital. These are the salient facts.

The Accused-Appellant is now contesting only the sentence. According

to the written submissions as well as submissions made during the

argument, the learned Counsel moves for a reduction of the sentence.

The main ground urged is the current medical condition of the

appellant. This court on the request of the Accused-Appellant has

Page 5 of 9

directed and obtained a Medico Legal Report to ascertain the current

state of health of the Appellant. According to which the appellant had

been examined on 13.08.2024 by the JMO of the Hambantota District

Hospital. He had been specifically examined to ascertain his ability to

serve the sentence. According to the history, the appellant has

undergone a right temparo parietal craniotomy on 24.08.2019.

Upon the examination, Dr. Dilhani Amarasinghe has noted some

weaknesses in the left upper and lower limbs. However, has not

observed any deformity or a difficulty to walk without a support.

Accordingly, she had opined that the patient did not reveal any

permanent disability that could affect his capability to serve his

sentence.

That being the medical opinion the learned Counsel for the appellant

submitted that the appellant has a difficulty of movement and he relies

on crutches to facilitate his free movements. In counter the learned DSG

submitted that the medical evidence does not reveal any disability or

inability to serve the sentence.

Let me evaluate the current medical condition as revealed by the Medico

Legal Report which both parties relied on. No doubt the appellant has

in fact undergone some form of a surgical intervention involving his

right tempero region. It appears to have caused some form of weakness

to his upper and lower limbs. However, Dr. Amarasinghe has clearly

observed and opined that he can walk without a support and is capable

of serving the sentence. In these circumstances, medically the appellant

is able to serve the sentence and there is no medical evidence of any

deformity or infirmity that prevents or impedes the Appellant from

serving his sentence.

The Appellant there raises an issue of parity of sentences between the

1st Accused and the Appellant. As stated above, there is certainly

Page 6 of 9

difference between the sentences imposed on the 1st Accused and the

Appellant. All four sentences of one year each is ordered to run

concurrently as regards the 1st accused and the aggregate sentence

rounds up to one year. As opposed to that the Appellant is required to

serve sentences of two years each for the 1st and 2nd counts

consecutively with one-year terms for 3rd and 4th counts concurrently.

The aggregate sentence will thus be four years rigorous imprisonment.

On the face of it, there is a disparity or difference of three years between

the effective periods of sentences to be served between the 1st Accused

and the Appellant.

Is there a rational basis for this disparity and differentiation between

the two accused persons is the issue that requires to be considered.

The 1st accused had pleaded guilty at the outset at the earliest

opportunity before the commencement of the trial. As opposed to this,

the Appellant had pleaded not guilty but was convicted after a long-

drawn-out trial. This is the main difference between the two accused

that appears to have been considered by the Trial Judge. An accused

has a right to plead not guilty and proceed with the trial. This per se

should not be a basis to enhance a sentence or to that matter should

not be a relevant consideration in determining the sentence. The Trial

Judge has not in any way considered the fact of the Appellant

proceeding to trial as an aggravating circumstance in determining the

Appellants sentence.

As opposed to this, the fact of 1st accused pleading guilty had been

considered in his favour by the Trial Judge. An accused pleading guilty

to the charge is a lawfully recognized consideration that a sentencing

Judge is required to take cognizance of by virtue of Section 197(2) of

the CPC. The said Section provide that;

The Judge shall in sentencing the accused have regard to the fact that

he so pleaded.

Page 7 of 9

Then Section 303(1)(k) provides that pleading guilty is a circumstance

that may be considered to suspend a sentence.

Accordingly, the sentencing Judge is statutorily required to have regard

to the fact of an accused pleading guilty in determining the sentence.

The 1st Accused has had the benefit of his early guilty plea in sentencing

which the Appellant was not entitled to.

Similarly, when the Appellant was sentenced the Trial Judge has

considered the fact that the Appellant was a Reserve Police Constable.

This has been considered as an aggravating factor which is unique to

the Appellant.

Thus, there is an appreciable and relevant difference in their culpability

and circumstances that justifies the differentiation and the disparity of

the sentences imposed on the 1st Accused and the Appellant.

Then, the learned DSG submitted that a minimum mandatory sentence

of two years is prescribed under the schedule to the Poisons, Opium

and Dangerous Drugs Act under which counts one and two are

formulated. It was submitted that the Trial Judge has imposed the

minimum mandatory sentence and, in the circumstances of this

offending, there is no lawful basis or justification to go below the said

minimum as far as the Appellant is concerned.

No doubt, the Supreme Court has clearly held in a series of cases

starting with SC No. 03/2008 as follows..

Page 8 of 9

Justice Amaratunga in the case of A.G. Vs. Rohana

affirming and following this principle held as follows;

.

It is clear that the principle so determined by the said decisions is not

offence specific. but of general application. Thus, it will apply to all

offences prescribe a minimum mandatory sentence including the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act.

Be that as it may, in view of Article 13(6) of the Constitution, the

legislature is empowered to prescribe a minimum mandatory sentence.

Therefore, many a statute and certain offences under the Penal Code

provide for such minimum mandatory sentences. However, as the law

stands interpreted the sentencing Judges are not inhibited or prevented

from exercising a discretion to determine an appropriate sentence.

However, prescribing the range of the sentence is a matter of policy

which is the purview of the legislature. Thus, when a minimum

mandatory sentence is prescribed, sentencing Judge cannot just ignore

such prescribed minimum mandatory sentence. No doubt, the

sentencing Judge has a discretion to decide on the appropriate sentence

even below the said prescribed minimum as held in SC No. 03/2008.

However, it is necessary to have and advert to some reason to impose a

sentence below the minimum mandatory. Therefore, as held in

Hirimuthugoda. By Justice Anil Gunaratne, it would be

incumbent upon a Judge to set out with clarity, all the reasons which

are relevant and salient for not imposing the mandatory statutory

minimum sentence as prescribed by the relevant Penal Provision.

In the instant Appeal, the Appellant whilst being a Reserve Police

Constable had made use of and abused his office to commit the offences

of trafficking and possession of a commercial quantity of Cannabis

Sativa L. As considered and held by the learned Trial Judge, there is no

basis to consider the offending leniently. I am in total agreement with

Page 9 of 9

this view on the perusal of the submissions made on sentencing at the

original Court as well as the submissions made in this Court. There is

no rational reason that justifies a sentence below the minimum two

years prescribed for the first and second counts.

However, on a consideration of a totality of circumstances, I observe

that the offence was committed in 2006, almost 18 years ago and that

all the sentences of the 1st Accused were ordered to run concurrently.

Hence, justice demands that the Appellant also be given the same

benefit. Accordingly, the sentences imposed in respect of counts 1 to 4

are hereby ordered to run concurrently and the aggregate sentence will

thus be rigorous imprisonment for two years.

Subject to this variation, the conviction and the sentence are affirmed

and the Appeal is partially allowed to that extent.

Appeal is partially allowed.
