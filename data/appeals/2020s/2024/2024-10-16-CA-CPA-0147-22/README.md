The facts of the case

3. There is no dispute that the Petitioner and the Respondent are

husband and wife and are living apart. The two children for whom

the maintenance is being ordered are children of their marriage.

4. The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent, (hereinafter referred to as

the Respondent), had made an application to the Magistrates

Court of Kandy seeking an Order for the maintenance of her two

children.

5. Upon hearing the said application, the Learned Magistrate had

ordered a payment of a monthly allowance of Rs. 40,000 for each

child.

6. Against the said Order, the Petitioner had filed a revision

application before the Provincial High Court of Kandy. The

Provincial High Court Judge, without considering the facts, had

refused the revision application filed by the Petitioner.

7. Aggrieved by the said Order, the Petitioner had submitted this

revision application seeking the reliefs prayed for in the prayer of

the petition dated 21st November 2022.

Disputed facts

8. When this matter was taken up for argument, both parties had

agreed to conclude the argument by way of written submissions.

9. Upon perusal of the documents and the Orders issued by the

Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge, the

Learned Magistrate had ordered an interim payment of Rs. 80,000

for the childrens maintenance on the 20th of September 2022.

10. In the said Order, it is specified that each child is entitled to Rs.

40,000.

11. In view of the facts and the documents submitted to address the

issues between the parties, the following disputed facts should

be considered,

I. Has the Learned Magistrate made a permanent Order for

the maintenance of the children of the Petitioner and the

Respondent?

II. If not, has the inquiry pertinent to the maintenance been

concluded before the Magistrate?

III. If not, can the Petitioner sustain this application?

I. Has the Learned Magistrate made a permanent Order

for the maintenance of the children of the Petitioner

and the Respondent?

12. Upon perusal of the documents as well as the Orders of the

Learned Magistrate and the High Court Judge, there is no doubt

that the Petitioner and the Respondent are husband and wife.

13. The two children namely, Sadupa Bhashwara Amarasinghe and

Thisadu Dinara Amarasinghe are the children of the Petitioner

and Respondent.

14. Both parties have admitted that they are living separately in the

same house, with one residing upstairs and the other downstairs,

while the children are living with the Respondent.

15. The Respondent had made a maintenance application to the

Magistrates Court of Kandy. The said maintenance inquiry had

not yet commenced. However, the Learned Magistrate had issued

an Interim Order for the Petitioner to pay Rs. 80,000 as

maintenance for both children.

CA (CPA) 0147-2022

16. The said Order had been issued after the counsel for the

Respondent had stated that the Respondent is spending a sum of

Rs. 80,000 to maintain the children.

17. Considering the said position, the Learned Magistrate had

ordered the interim payment, and the case had been fixed for

inquiry on the 6th December 2022.

18. In the said circumstances, it is evident that the Order made by

the Learned Magistrate, as per document marked X3 is not a

permanent Order; rather, it is an interim payment allowance that

was decided.

II. If not, has the inquiry pertinent to the maintenance

been concluded before the Magistrate?

19. Following the Interim Order made on 20th September 2022, the

Learned Magistrate had fixed this case for inquiry on the 6th

December 2022.

20. As the Petitioner had preferred these revision applications, the

maintenance inquiry had been unnecessarily delayed in deciding

on the permanent maintenance of the children.

21. Thus, the inquiry pertinent to the maintenance application had

not yet been concluded.

III. If not, can the Petitioner sustain this application?

22. The Petitioner, in his petition dated 21st November 2022, had

reiterated that he does not neglect or refuse to maintain the

children.

23. Further, the Learned Magistrate had failed to consider that the

Respondent and children had been living in the same house

CA (CPA) 0147-2022

while ordering the Petitioner to pay Rs. 80,000 as maintenance

for the children.

24. The Petitioner had stated that the Learned Magistrate had not

considered any facts when deciding on the interim payment of

Rs. 80,000 maintenance.

25. It is evident in document X3 that the counsel for the Respondent

had admitted that the Respondent is spending Rs. 80,000 for the

children.

26. I would like to state that, the Petitioner had verbally asserted that

he was spending Rs. 80,000 for the children and their mother,

who are living in the upstairs of the house separately from the

Petitioner.

27. Therefore, until the permanent Order is made in this matter,

there should be a legally valid Order for the Petitioner to make

the payment to the children.

28. If not, in the event the Petitioner fails to spend the amount

referred to in X3, grave harm would be caused to the children.

29. Further, the Order made by the Learned Magistrate is not a

permanent Order and it is an Interim Order which can be

challenged in the maintenance inquiry.

30. Therefore, I do not see any grounds to interfere with the Learned

High Court Judges Order dated 31st October 2022.

31. The Learned High Court Judge had specified that the application

made to the High Court by the Petitioner dated 5th October 2022

does not reveal any grounds for a revision application. Further

the impugned Order must not only be illegal but should also

shock the conscience of the court as decided in the case of

Secretary Kalutara v Kalupahana Mestrige Jayatissa1;

1 SC Appeals 246,247,249,250/14

CA (CPA) 0147-2022

It must be noted that the Respondents had invoked revisionary jurisdiction of this court, which is discretionary remedy. Thus, if relief to be granted, the party seeking the relief has to establish that, not only the impugned Order is illegal, but also the nature of the illegality is such, that it shocks the conscience of the court

32. Besides these facts I draw my attention to the following decisions;

As per Soertsz. S.P.J. In the case of Sivasamy v. Rasiah 2 stated

as follows;

" These words, correctly interpreted, can only mean that while the right of children to maintenance depends on both their inability to maintain themselves and on the possession of sufficient means by the father, the right of the wife to maintenance is conditioned only on the possession of sufficient means by the husband and is not affected by the fact that she has sufficient means of her own. That conclusion emerges all the clearer when we read further down in the section the words of contrast providing for an Order of maintenance for ' his wife ' and for such child ' : The word ' such ' is used as an adjunct to the word ' child ', and not to the word ' wife ' in Order to emphasize the fact that in the case of the child, inability to maintain itself is one of the conditions upon which the father's liability rests. " And in H. Ediriweera v K.A.D. Dharmapala 3 Alles, J articulated as follows;

.the mother was possessed of means to maintain the child is a totally irrelevant consideration in so far as the legal liability of the father is concerned to maintain his child.

2 [1943] 44 N. L. R. 241 3 [1965] 69 NLR 45

CA (CPA) 0147-2022

33. Therefore, it is abundantly clear in the abovementioned case laws

that the mothers possession of means to maintain the child is

irrelevant.

34. Therefore, the position taken by the Petitioner that the

Respondent is a lawyer is irrelevant at this stage to consider the

maintenance.

35. On the said grounds, I do not see any merit to interfere with the

Order made by the Learned High Court Judge as there are no

exceptional grounds to consider under revisionary jurisdiction.

36. Further, it is noted that the Petitioner (after issuance of the Order

marked X3) had filed the revision application in both the High

Court and the Appellate Court to delay the payment, despite

having the opportunity to conclude the maintenance matter

during the period in which this case has been delayed.

CONCLUSION

37. In view of the facts submitted, I dismiss the petition dated 21st

November 2022 subject to Rs. 125,000 cost payable to the

Respondent.
