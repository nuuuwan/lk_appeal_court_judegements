Counsel: K. G. Jinasena instructed by D. K. V. Jayanath for the Petitioner.

Ms. N. Kahawita, SSC for the Respondents

Argued: By way of Written Submissions.

Written submissions tendered on:

02.10.2023 by the Petitioner.

Decided on: 08.05.2024.

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner is employed as a Management Assistant (Grade I) at the University of

Visual and Performing Arts of Sri Lanka. She preferred an application on 02.11.2017

marked as P4 for a post of Assistant Secretary/Assistant Registrar consequent to an

internal notice dated 13.10.2017 marked as P3, calling for applications from the

qualified internal applicants to fill the vacancies of Assistant Secretary/Assistant

Registrar of the 1st Respondent, the University Grant Commission (the UGC). The

Petitioner was called for a written examination and scored 161 marks. By the letter

dated 13.06.2018 marked as P6, the Secretary of the UGC (the 9th Respondent)

informed the Petitioner that she has been successful in the written examination and

requested her to submit the duly filled information sheet marked as P7 sent along with

P6. She submitted the duly filled information sheet. Thereafter, by the letter dated

06.07.2018 issued by the 9th Respondent marked as P9, the Petitioner was called for an

Interview. With that letter, the marking scheme which the Interview panel will use at

5

the Structured Interview marked as P10 was attached. According to the said marking

scheme, a minimum of 40% should be obtained to get through the Interview. After the

interview was held, by the letter dated 26.10.2018 marked as P12, the Petitioner was

informed that she had been unsuccessful at the Interview. Since the 16th to 40th

Respondents had obtained the required marks in both the written exam and in the

structured interview a decision was taken to appoint them to the posts of Assistant

Secretaries/Assistant Registrars. According to the mark sheet marked as P18, the

Petitioner had obtained 36.25% marks at the interview. The Petitioner preferred an

appeal (marked as P20) against the decision of the 1st Respondent to the University

Services Appeal Board (the USAB), praying reliefs, inter alia to set aside the 1st

Respondents decision to appoint 16th to 40th Respondents and to appoint the Petitioner

as an Assistant Secretary/Assistant Registrar. By the letter dated 27.05.2020 issued by

the Secretary of the USAB marked as P24, the Petitioner was informed that her appeal

was dismissed by the Order of the USAB dated 19.05.2020. Being aggrieved by the

said Order of the USAB, the Petitioner preferred the instant Application to this Court

seeking substantive reliefs, inter alia,

b) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision made by the

1st Respondent UGC to appoint the 16th to 40th Respondents as Assistant

Registrars/Secretaries of the 1st Respondent UGC

v) Issue a mandate in the nature of the Writ of Certiorari to quash the Order made in

P24 by the 42nd to 44th Respondents of the 41st Respondent University Services

Appeals Board.

c) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent

UGC to conduct fresh interviews in terms of the procedure laid down in P3 and P14.

6

e) A mandate in the nature of Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st Respondent UGC

from calling applications to fill the existing vacancies for the post of Assistant

Registrars/Secretaries until the final determination of this Application.

The Petitioner has pleaded in the Petition to this Application that as per the

Establishment Circular Letter No. 5/2018 marked as P19 issued by the Chairman of the

1st Respondent (the 2nd Respondent), all the Higher Educational Institutions/Institutes

should use marking sheets based on the Marking Schemes approved by the Governing

Authorities in allocating marks when appointing to all the posts in the university

system. However, the position of Petitioner is that the marking scheme used by the

Selection Committee in selecting the candidates relevant to this Application has not

been approved by the Governing Authority and even though the marking scheme

marked as P10 mentions five specific areas the Selection Committee should consider

when allocating marks at the interview, the manner which the marks should be given

under those specific areas is not elaborated in the marking scheme. The Petitioner

argues that as per the Commission decision taken at its 974th meeting held on

27.10.2017, marks should be allocated equally i.e. 20 marks each under the specific

areas mentioned in P10. The Petitioner further, alleges that no proper Selection

Committee has been appointed by the 1st Respondent in terms of the procedure laid

down in the UGC Circular No. 166 dated 06.04.1982 (marked as R10). Under the

above-stated circumstances, the Petitioner argues that the decision of the 1st Respondent

to appoint 16th to 40th Respondents to the posts of Assistant Secretary/Assistant

Registrar is unreasonable, illegal, arbitrary, capricious and contrary to the provisions of

Circular No. 166 dated 06.04.1982.

I will first address my mind to the Petitioners argument that an approved marking

scheme was not used by the Selection Committee in terms of P19 at the structured

7

interview. The position of the learned SSC appearing for the Respondents is that all the

candidates who were eligible to be called for the structured interview including the

Petitioner were called for the structured interview by the letter marked as P9 and the

marking scheme of the structured interview marked as Annex 1 has also been sent

along with the P9. The position of the learned SSC is that all the candidates who were

called for the structured interview were assessed as per the marking scheme marked as

R4 which was duly approved by the UGC in the year 2016 by its decision No. 948.11.2

and the appointments impugn in this Writ Application by the Petitioner were duly made

in terms of the Scheme of Recruitment (SoR) in the order of merit. This Court can

accept that at the interview the candidates were accessed as per an approved marking

scheme marked as R4 and the Court cannot agree with the Petitioners argument that

no approved marking scheme was used at the interview.

Secondly, the Petitioner argues that the marking scheme marked as P10 received by her

before the interview differs from the marking scheme produced by the Respondents

marked as R4. The Court indeed could observe that while P10 only contains the

headings of five specific areas, R4 is a detailed marking scheme which indicates how

the marks should be given under those specific areas. However, it must be noted that in

the instant Application, the Petitioner has failed to satisfy the Court that the failure to

indicate marks separately which were to be allocated under every area mentioned in

P10 has badly affected the performance of the Petitioner at the structured interview.

Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest that the Petitioner would have performed any

better had this information been disclosed and all candidates were equally

disadvantaged in this respect. In the case of Abeysinghe and Three Others Vs. Central

Engineering Consultancy Bureau and Six Others1 Fernando, J. dealt with a situation

1 (1996) 2 SLR 36.

8

where the marking scheme was not given to the candidates, taken up the view that, since

the Petitioners have not shown that this affected their performance at the interview; and

there is nothing to suggest that the Petitioners would have performed any better had this

information been disclosed and all candidates were equally disadvantaged in this

respect. Held that, failure to make available the marking scheme used at the Interview

is not fatal.

The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner further argues that at the interview the

Petitioner should have awarded more than 40 marks under the first three headings

mentioned in the P10, namely, Educational and Professional Qualifications (over and

above the minimum requirement), relevant experience and training (short term) and

Special Report (including service record and three increments). Further, the position of

the Petitioner is that no questions have been asked from her at the interview regarding

the extracurricular activities to which the marks were allocated under heading 5 of the

P10. Under the above-stated circumstances, the Petitioner argues that the marks

allocated at the interview to her were unrealistic and cannot be accepted as reasonable.

The learned SSC appearing for the Respondents has taken up the position that the

Selection Committee has evaluated every candidate in terms of R4. Moreover, the

Petitioner claims that as per the decision taken by the 1st Respondent at its 974th meeting

held on 27.10.2017, marks should be allocated equally i.e. 20 marks under each

category mentioned in P10. However, it should be noted that no document has been

produced by the Petitioner for the satisfaction of the Court about such a decision. When

considering the marking scheme marked as R4 and the mark sheet marked as P18, this

Court can be satisfied that the Selection Committee has allocated the marks to which

the Petitioner is entitled to her BSc. Business Administrative Degree (general) under

the heading of Educational and Professional Qualifications over and above the

9

minimum requirement. As per the Respondents no marks have been given to any of

the candidates under the category of relevant experience and Training (short term) as

none of the candidates possessed previous experience. The Petitioner claims that she

possesses relevant experience but the Selection Committee has not allocated marks for

her. USAB has observed in its Order sent to the Petitioner along with the letter marked

as P24 that the Petitioner is only a member of the clerical staff and therefore she is not

entitled to marks for her experience. It is the Selection Committee that has the expertise

to decide whether the experience of the Petitioner as a member of the clerical staff could

be considered as relevant experience required for the post of Assistant

Secretary/Assistant Registrar of the 1st Respondent and not the Court. This Court can

also be satisfied that the Petitioner has been given marks that she is entitled to under

Training (short term) and furthermore the Selection Committee has given 8.4 marks

out of 10 under the category of Special Report (including service record and three

increments). Therefore, this Court sees no merit in the Petitioner's argument that she

should have allocated 40 marks for the first three categories in the marking scheme

marked as P10. In Abeysundara Mudiyanselage Sarath Weera Bandara Vs. The

University of Colombo and others2, this Court held that,

"The consistent judicial opinion, therefore, is that in matters which lie within the

jurisdiction of the educational institutions and their authorities, the Court has to

be slow and circumspect before interfering with any decision taken by them in

connection therewith. Unless a decision is demonstrably illegal, arbitrary and

unconscionable, their province and authority should not be encroached upon.

This is mainly because of the want of judicially manageable standards and the

2 CA (Writ) Application No. 844/2010; CA Minutes of 8th June 2018.

10

necessary expertise to assess, scrutinise and judge the merits and/or demerits of

such decisions. Dealing with the scope of interference in matters relating to

orders passed by the authorities of educational institutions, the Courts should

normally be very slow to pass orders in regard thereto and such matters should

normally be left to the decision of the educational authorities."

Citing the above-mentioned case, Arjuna Obeyesekere, J. in the case of Dr. C.J.A.

Jayawardena Vs. University of Colombo and 28 Others3, held thus,

"This Court is therefore of the view that while due recognition will be given to

the view of the decision maker, whether the decision relates to academic matters

or otherwise, this Court can, and will, in the exercise of the jurisdiction vested in

it by Article 140 of the Constitution, examine whether the impugned decision of

the 1st Respondent is tainted with illegality, irrationality or procedural

impropriety. This Court would however exercise extreme caution if asked to

consider, for example as in this case whether a decision of a selection board or

panel to award less marks than what a petitioner claims is rightfully due, is

irrational or unreasonable."

Considering the above-mentioned authorities and the facts of the case at hand I hold

that this Court has no expertise to scrutinize and interfere with the marks allocated to

the Petitioner by the Selection Committee.

The Petitioner further argues that in terms of the SoR published in the UGC Circular

No. 15/2017 dated 28.06.2017 marked as P14, 75% and 25% of the marks should be

given to the written examination and the interview respectively and therefore that the

Selection Committee had failed to follow the procedure laid down in P14. The

3 CA (Writ) Application No. 137/2018; CA Minutes of 22.06.2020.

11

recruitment procedure is laid down in the notice published by the 1st Respondent for the

recruitment of Assistant Secretary/Assistant Registrar marked as P3/R1. In terms of P14

and P3 the candidates who score 40% or above for the written examination are supposed

to be summoned for a structured interview. The applicants who score 40% marks or

above at the structured interview are eligible to be considered to be appointed and the

selection should be made according to the merit based on the aggregate marks of the

written examination (75%) and the structured interview (25%). In terms of the letter

marked as P9, a minimum of 40% marks should be obtained to be considered for

appointment. Even though the Petitioner argues that she should have awarded more

marks than the marks given her at the interview, as stated above this Court has no

expertise to interfere with that matter. As the Petitioner has scored less than 40% at the

structured interview, in terms of the SoR and the recruitment procedure she has failed

to be eligible to be selected for a post of Assistant Secretary/Assistant Registrar.

Therefore, I am of the view that there is no merit in the argument of the Petitioner that

the Selection Committee has failed to follow the SoR and the procedure of recruitment

and the decision of the Respondents not to appoint the Petitioner is illegal, irrational or

unreasonable.

Now I will address the Petitioners argument that no proper Selection Committee had

been appointed by the 1st Respondent. According to the Petitioner, under the UGC

Circular No. 166 dated 06.04.1982 (marked as R10) for the appointment to the

administrative posts, the Selection Committee should comprise the Chairman of the

Commission, one other member appointed by the Commission among its members, the

Secretary of the Commission and two members not been members of the Commission

appointed by the Commission. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner

submitted that only the 9th, 11th to 15th Respondents and four others were in the

12

Selection Committee when the Petitioner was interviewed and therefore the

composition of the Selection Committee was not according to the provisions laid down

in the said Circular No. 166 marked as R10. The learned SSC appearing for the

Respondents argues that the Selection Committee was duly appointed in terms of the

Commission Circular No. 160 dated 26.02.1982 marked as R9 which was amended by

the Commission Circular No. 166 dated 06.04.1982 marked as R10 and in terms of the

decision taken by the 1st Respondent at its 320th meeting held on 01.04.1991 marked as

R8. Further, the learned SSC submitted that the Selection Committee had recommended

25 candidates out of 39 who scored 40% or above (P17) in the order of merit and the

1st Respondent had considered the said recommendation before granting the approval

for the appointments.

It is evident from the Commission Circular No. 160 marked as R9, that a decision has

been taken by the 1st Respondent to review its powers vested with the 1st Respondent

under Section 71(2)(ii) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 to make appointments

to the staff of Higher Educational Institutions and a decision has taken to continue to

attend with the matters pertaining to appointments mentioned therein along with the

post of Assistant Registrar/ Assistant Secretary. All the previous Circulars issued on the

procedure for appointments have been amended by P10 and in terms of paragraph 13

of R10, the appointments made under Section 71(2)(ii) of the Universities Act should

thereafter be made by the 1st Respondent upon the recommendation of the Selection

Committee. Accordingly, the Selection Committee should consist of, the Chairman, two

members appointed by the Chairman, the Secretary of the Commission and one senior

officer nominated by the Chairman. As per the decision taken by the 1st Respondent at

its 320th meeting marked as R8, the Selection Committee to make appointments for the

post of Assistant Registrar should consist of one Vice-Chancellor and a Registrar of a

13

University also. The Petitioner has admitted in the Petition that, the 9th Respondent who

is the Secretary to the 1st Respondent and 11th to 15th Respondents, who are the

Chairman, Vice Chairman and a member of the 1st Respondent, a Vice Chancellor and

a Registrar respectively were members of the Selection Committee at the time the

Petitioner faced for the interview. When considering the recommendation of the

Selection Committee marked as P17 this Court can be satisfied that in the instant matter,

the Selection Committee has been duly constituted in terms of the Circular marked as

R10 and the 1st Respondents decision marked as R8. Therefore, this Court cannot agree

with the Petitioner's argument that the Selection Committee was not duly constituted.

At this outset, this Court is of the view that the decision of the 1st Respondent to appoint

the 16th to 40th Respondents to the posts of Assistant Secretary/Assistant Registrar is

not unreasonable, illegal, arbitrary or capricious. Under the said circumstances the

Petitioner is not entitled to the relief prayed for in prayer (b) to the Petition for a Writ

of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent to appoint the 16th to 40th

Respondents to the Posts.

Moreover, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argues that the Petitioner

has completed more than 12 years of service period to the date of the interview and she

has better qualifications than the other applicants and therefore she has a legitimate

expectation that she will be selected for the post of Assistant Registrar. The position of

the Respondents with that regard is that the candidates were selected not only based on

the results of the written examination but also on their performance at the interview.

According to P9, a minimum of 40% marks should be obtained to be considered for

appointment and in terms of P6 and P9, no candidate could claim that he/she is qualified

to be appointed merely upon passing the written examination or for the reason that they

have been called for the interview. Therefore, the Petitioner cannot have any legitimate

14

expectation to be appointed to a post of Assistant Secretary/Assistant Registrar as the

Respondents have not made any promise to the Petitioner in terms of the law that she

would be appointed. It is a well-established fact that to create a legitimate expectation,

a public body or authority must have said or done things that create an expectation that

such body or authority would act in accordance with past practices, policies, promises

or representations. In Union of India Vs. Hindustan Development Corporation,4 the

Supreme Court of India discussing the doctrine of legitimate expectation held that,

However earnest and sincere a wish, a desire or a hope may be and however

confidently one may look to them to be fulfilled, they by themselves cannot amount

to an assertable expectation and a mere disappointment does not attract legal

consequences. A pious hope even leading to a moral obligation cannot amount to

a legitimate expectation. The legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if

it is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an established procedure followed

in regular and natural sequence Every such legitimate expectation does not by

itself fructify into a right and, therefore, it does not amount to a right in a

conventional sense.

In the case of Nimalsiri vs. Fernando5 Priyantha Jayawardena, PC. J. held that,

In order to seek redress under the doctrine of legitimate expectation a person

should prove he had a legitimate expectation which was based on a promise or an

established practice. Thus, the applicability of the doctrine is based on the facts

and circumstances of each case.

15

In the instant Application, this Court observes that the appointments made to the post

of Assistant Secretary/Assistant Registrar are not promotions but fresh appointments.

As very correctly pointed out by the learned SSC appearing for the Respondents, as

stipulated in the documents marked as P6 and P9, no candidate can claim that they are

qualified to be appointed merely because they have passed the written examination or

called for the interview. In the letter marked as P6 state that,

Further please note that this letter is issued only for the purpose of obtaining

information to verify your qualifications as per the scheme of recruitment hence

no candidate can claim this as being qualified to be appointed to the respective

post.

In the letter marked as P9, it states thus,

The structured interview would be held for the purpose of screening the

candidate's suitability for the above post as required by the scheme of recruitment.

Hence no candidate can claim this as being qualified to be appointed to the

respective post.

Therefore, it is evident from the said documents that no promise has been made by the

Respondents that the Petitioner would be appointed to the said post merely because she

has got through the written examination or has been called for the interview. Hence,

this Court is of the view that the Petitioner does not have a legitimate expectation that

she would be appointed as an Assistant Secretary/Assistant Registrar merely because

she has completed 12 years of service and possesses better qualifications.

The Petitioner has drawn the attention of the Court to the fact that the Order of the

USAB sent along with the letter marked as P24 states that the USAB is not empowered

by Section 86 of the Universities Act to set aside an appointment made and to make an

16

order substituting it with fresh appointments and if illegality is observed all that the

USAB could do is to express their findings. Further, in the said Order it has been stated

that the evaluation process and the marks given to the Petitioner are beyond the

expertise of the USAB. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argues that

under Section 86 of the Universities Act, the USAB has the power to investigate with

respect to all appointments and promotions. Therefore, the Petitioner argues that the

position taken by the USAB to dismiss her application is illegal and irrational and that

the said Order has been made in contravention of the provisions of the Universities Act

and its subsequent amendments.

The position of the learned SSC appearing for the Respondents is that in terms of

Section 86(a), USAB is empowered only to investigate appointments and promotions

alleged to have been made in contravention of the SoR and to communicate its decision

and findings to the Chairman of the 1st Respondent. Moreover, USAB is not empowered

by the legislature to set aside the decisions of the 1st Respondent to make appointments

or promotions. Therefore, the position of the learned SSC is that the USAB had

correctly dismissed the application of the Petitioner as the recruitments have been made

in terms of the law and the Petitioner is not entitled to the reliefs prayed for in the

Petition to this Application. Section 86(a) of the Act is as follows;

to conduct investigations into appointments and promotions alleged to have

been made to the staff of the Commission and to Higher Educational Institutions

in contravention of the schemes of recruitment and the procedures for

appointment in force at the time such appointments or promotions were made or

alleged to have been made and into allegations that appointments or promotions

have not been made to posts when vacancies have arisen in such posts. (emphasis

added)

17

It is apparent from Section 86(a) of the Act, that the USAB is only empowered to

investigate into the appointments or promotions that have been made in contravention

of the SoR and the procedure for appointment. Therefore, it is clear that the USAB does

not possess any power to decide matters regarding allocating marks or to set aside

promotions or appointments made by the 1st Respondent. Therefore, this Court is of the

view that USAB has correctly held that it is not empowered to do so as stated in its

Order. Therefore, the Petitioner is not entitled to a Writ of Certiorari to quash the Order

of the USAB.

Considering all the facts and circumstances stated above, this Court is of the view that

the Petitioner is not entitled to the reliefs prayed for in the Petition to this Application.

Therefore, the Application is dismissed. The Petitioner should pay Rs. 50,000/- to the

1st Respondent as the cost of this Application.

Application dismissed.
