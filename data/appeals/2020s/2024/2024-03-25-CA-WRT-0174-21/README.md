The Petitioner states that the Petitioner is a Politician by profession. He is the Leader of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (People's Liberation Front) commonly known as the JVP. He states that having obtained his preliminary education in Thambuththegama Junior School; the Petitioner received his Higher education from the Thambuththegama Madya Maha Vidyalaya. The Petitioner states that he was graduated from the University of Kelaniya in Science stream and holds a degree in Physical Science (BSc.Phy). He entered politics as a student when Indo - Sri Lanka Peace Accord was signed in 1987.

The Petitioner states that he participated in the activities of the Socialist Students Union and was appointed as the National Organizer of the Socialist Students Union in 1997, while he was reading for his Degree at the University of Kelaniya. Thereafter, the Petitioner was elected to the Central Committee of the JVP in 1997 and was appointed to the Polit Bureau of the JVP in 1998. The Petitioner states that subsequently, in 1998, the Petitioner was nominated as the chief ministerial candidate for the Central Provincial Council.

The Petitioner entered the Parliament in 2000 and was elected to the Parliament in the years 2001, 2004, 2010 and 2015. the Petitioner further states that during his political career, he had contributed in creating the 'Probationary Government'. He was elected to the Parliament in the year 2004 and he held the Ministerial Portfolio of Agriculture, Lands, Irrigation and Livestock of in the said People's Alliance Government. He further states that he was elected for the post of Chief Opposition Whip of the Eighth Parliament of Sri Lanka on the 3rd of September 2015. The 1st Respondent is the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry, which was appointed by his Excellency the President of Sri Lanka, under and in terms of his proclamation as reflected in Gazette Extraordinary Bearing No. 2157/44 dated 09.01.2020, by virtue of the powers vested in him by the Commissions of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948 (as amended) for the purpose of inquiring into and obtaining information pertaining to the alleged incidents of Political Victimization of Public Officers, Employees of State Corporations, Members of Armed Forces and the Police Service, between the period of 08th of January 2015 to 16th November 2019. The 2nd and 3rd Respondents are the members of the aforesaid Commission of Inquiry. The 4th Respondent is the Secretary to the said Commission of Inquiry.

The 5th Respondent is the Hon. Attorney General. The Petitioner states that the Hon. Attorney General is named a party to this application as he has already taken measures to inform the 1st to 3rd Respondents, that the Commission is in lack of Jurisdiction to inquire in to a matter of a complaint made by private individuals.

Page 8 of 38

The 7th Respondent is the Director General of the Commission to investigate Allegations of Bribery or corruption appointed under and in terms of the Act No. 19 of 1994 as amended. The Petitioner says that in terms of the warrant issued upon the 1st to 3rd Respondents by his Excellency the President (P2 and P3) the Petitioner had no reason to believe or apprehend that the Petitioner's conduct would be the subject of inquiry or that the Petitioner would be in anyway implicated or concerned in the matters at inquiry. The Petitioner was summoned to appear before the said Commission of Inquiry and the Petitioner appeared before the PCIPV on the 28th September 2020 and the 13th October 2020 and his evidence was taken.

No statement was recorded from the Petitioner at any time by the Investigation Unit of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry. The learned Presidents counsel submits on behalf of the Petitioner that, at no point whatsoever were any charges read or explained to the Petitioner

or any matters pertaining to the inquiry disclosed. The Petitioner is unaware as to whether any purported complaints made to the PCIPV were directly leveled at the Petitioner. Being unaware of such had no opportunity to appropriately represent himself at any such instance where evidence against the Petitioner may have been given.

During his sessions of attendance before the PCIPV, the line and of questioning put to the Petitioner was substantially on the following matters;

(a) As to the Petitioner's involvement in a body referred to as 'National Executive Council'; (b) The Petitioner's involvement in a body referred to as the 'Anticorruption Unit' operating under the purview of the Prime-Minister; (c) The Petitioner's involvement in a unit known as the 'Emergency Response Unit'; The Upali Abeyratne Commission has had findings against the Petitioner in the Complaint included in Section/chapter 8 (starting from page 17) of the Commission Report and Complaint Nos;

i. 205/2020, ix. 50/2020, ii. 289/2020, x. 1807/20, iii. 290/2020, xi. 1080/20, iv. 316/2020, xii. 1842/2020, v. 88/2020, xiii. 1941/2020, vi. 816/2020, xiv. 414/2020, vii. 432/2020, xv. 416/2020, viii. 433/2020, xvi. 352/2020.

On the said findings which are impugned, the following recommendations have been made.

a. Recommending the Hon. Attorney General the 9th Respondent to consider appropriate action against the Petitioner;

Page 9 of 38

b. Recommending Action be taken against the Petitioner under and in terms of the Bribery Act;

c. Recommended steps to be taken against persons including the Petitioner by a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry for the purposes of considering imposition of Civic disability;

The learned Presidents Counsel argued on behalf of the Petitioner that though certain official Respondents state that no further steps will be taken, the findings still remain as part of a public record and if it is not quashed it will affect the Petitioner. There is no certainty or assurance of the undertaking given that no steps will be taken on the said findings. Therefore, it is of grave importance to the Petitioner that the said findings be quashed and any further proceedings be prohibited. If the official Respondents who are represented are bonafide in their assurance to this Court, then they would not have stop short of consenting to the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner.

The learned Presidents Counsel request on behalf of the Petitioner that as there is no consent to the reliefs prayed for, it is necessary that this Court consider the matter for granting the relief prayed for.

The Commission is also empowered only to investigate into the matter set out in paragraphs [a] to [d] of the Extraordinary Gazette.

It is important to note that P6, which is the summons served on the Petitioner. The heading gives the jurisdiction of the tribunal in Sinhala, Tamil and English.

The English text reads as follows;

'The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to inquire into and obtain information in

relation to alleged political victimization of public officers employees of state corporation, members of the armed forces and the public service who held posts during the period commencing 8th January 2013 and ending on 16th of November 2019.'

It is common ground that most of the Complaints who made their complaints to Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Political Victimization (PCIPV) including Mr. Nissanka Senadhipathi, Mr. Palitha Piyasiri Fernando, and Mr. Piyadasa Kudabalage do not fall into the said category in that they were not public officers and /or an employee of a state corporation and/or a member of the armed forces and/or the police service.

The learned President's Counsel argued on behalf of the Petitioner that in these circumstances clearly, the tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear and inquire into those complaints made in relation to their purported victimization.

The Extraordinary Gazette (P2) wherein it is stated in the first preamble as follows;

'Where as it has been reported that public officers, employees of public corporations, members of the armed forces and the police service who held such

Page 10 of 38

office prior to the Presidential Elections and/or General Elections held respectively in January and August 2015 being persons who have either resigned from or otherwise ceased to hold public office with the change of the government or continued to hold such office after such change, have made allegations that they have been subject to political victimization during the period commencing 8th

January 2015 and ending 16th November 2019.'

Attention is also drawn to the main clause which says inter alia;

'Now therefore I Gotabaya Rajapakse, president of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka reposing great trust and confidence in your prudence, ability and fidelity do in pursuance of the provisions of the Commissions of Inquiries Act [Chapter 393] as amended by these presents appoint you the said;

1. Hon. Upali Abeyrathne Esquire Retired Judge of the Supreme Court

2. Hon. Daya Chandrasiri Jayathilake Esquire

Retired Judge of the Court of Appeal

3. Chandra Fernando Esquire Retired Inspector General of Police

to be my commissioners to inquire into and obtain information in respect of the alleged political victimization during the period commencing 8th January 2015 and ending 16th November 2019.'

In the circumstances it is clear that the Commission can only inquire into allegations made by public officers, employees of public corporations and members of the armed forces and police service who alleged that they have been politically victimized during the period commencing 8th January 2015 and ending 16th November 2019. In those circumstances Complainants including Mr. Nissanka Senadhipathi (Complaint No. 50/2020 marked as P7(i), Mr. Palitha Piyasiri Fernando (Complaint No. 1807/2020 marked as P7(j), and Mr. Piyadasa Kudabalage (Complaint No. 414/2020 marked as P7(n) were not public officers and/ or employees of public corporations and/or members of the armed forces and/or police service.

It is crystal clear that the Commission had no jurisdiction to inquire into those Complaints. Therefore, on that ground alone a writ of certiorari can be granted in respect of the said findings.

Attention of court is drawn to page 3A of the Gazette which defines the matters in which the Commission can inquire into.

These are the following;

a) Whether there has been any malpractice or irregularity, or noncompliance with or disregard of the proper prudence, norms, guidelines, procedures and best practices applicable in relation to the administration of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Financial

Page 11 of 38

Investigations Divisions (FCID) of the Sri Lanka Police or the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka Police; b) Whether any investigations by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Financial Investigations Divisions (FCID) of the Sri Lanka Police or the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka Police had been influenced or obstructed or prevented in any manner, resulting in loss, damage, injury or detriment, either direct or imputed to any person or persons;

c) Whether any officer entrusted with conduct of investigations by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Financial Investigations Divisions (FCID) of the Sri Lanka Police or the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka Police have acted under undue influence by third parties, including by the said Anti-Corruption unit;

d) Whether any person had committed any act of political victimization, misuse or abuse of power, corruption or any fraudulent act in relation to the functions of the said Anti-Corruption unit, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) of the Sri Lanka Police or the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka Police, or in relation to the administration of any law or the administration of justice;

The Petitioner does not fall into any of these categories [a], [b] [c] or [d] and further there is no material whatsoever to substantiate same ex facie the record. Thus, on this ground also the Commission has no jurisdiction to inquire into the said matters.

On the aforesaid two grounds namely;

i. Most of the complainants did not fall into the category public officers etc.

ii. That the petitioner does not fall into any of the categories set out in [a] to [d], the Commission had no jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter.

In these circumstances it is my considered view that the Commission lacks jurisdiction and thus the writs prayed for have to be granted.

The writs will also issue on the ground that the Commission has failed to follow the rules of natural justice. The Petitioner received the summons which is marked as P4. This Court is concerned not only with the vires of the decision but also the procedural impropriety of the decision-making process.

The learned President's Counsel on behalf of the Petitioner submits that though it is not in relation to the Petitioner it may be pertinent to refer this Court finding with regard to issue of natural justice in the judgement of CA(Writ) 173/21 at pages 16,17 and 18.

"The Petitioner appeared before the Commission together with his lawyers on 23.06.2020. The Additional Solicitor General Mr. Vikum de Abrew, PC was directed to

Page 12 of 38

appear on behalf of the Petitioner. It is seen from page 43 to page 47 onwards of volume 1, that Mr. Vikum de Abrew was not permitted to speak.

. . . . . . . . . . , . . . . . . . . It is important to note that Mr. Rohantha Abeysuriya PC, ASG was present in a different

capacity, namely to consult the Commission. He was not appearing on behalf of the Petitioner during those proceedings. Mr. Rohantha Abeysuriya and Mr. Vikum de Abrew have informed the Commission about their duties. However, the Commission did not permit Mr. Vikum de Abrew to make submissions and even threatened him with contempt proceedings in the Court of Appeal. These circumstances, it shows clearly that there has been a breach of the rules of natural justice.

It is my view that if the 1st to 4th Respondents or anyone of them has acted in that manner with regard to an officer of the Attorney General Department, it is not hard to imagine what treatment or fairness or natural justice would have been afforded to a person such as the Petitioner. In these circumstances, it is clear that there has been a breach of the rules of natural justice. Thus, on this ground alone, the writs asked by the Petitioner should be issued.

It is clear that His Excellency the President had, at the time of the promulgation of the aforesaid Gazette not yet decided whether there was any justification for the implementation and enforcement of the recommendations of the 1st to 3rd Respondents. In the said Gazette Number 2221/54 dated 01 April 2021 the Terms of Reference of the Special Presidential Commission was expanded by paragraph 02 of the said Gazette and the Special Presidential Commission was mandated to also inquire into and report whether all or any of the findings, decisions and recommendations contained in the aforesaid Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, made in respect of all the persons identified therein and whether any or all of the same should be implemented or cause to be implemented.

Page 15 of 38

The expansion of the mandate of the Special Presidential Commission made it clear as a matter of law that in the view of the appointing authority H.E the President, the recommendations of the 1st to 3rd Respondents were unfit for implementation pending a decision of the Special Presidential Commission as to whether any of such recommendations should be implemented or not. The Special Presidential Commission could not finalize this report and was given an extension of time until 28.04.2022 by Gazette Notification 2251/37 dated 28.10.2021. However, the Special Presidential Commission could not carry out their mandate and finalize any report and did not submit any recommendation before the expiry of the mandate of the commission on 28.04.2021. The mandate of this Special Presidential Commission was not extended by His Excellency the President. When this Special Presidential Commission appointed for that very purpose became functus without submitting any recommendations, what remains is the last Presidential directive not to implement the Report of the 1st to 3rd

Respondents without fully looking into and reviewing the recommendations to ascertain whether such recommendations were justified.

The fact that the term of the Special Commission expired without extension and without resulting in a final report does not in any way, take away the fact that the first impugned Report was viewed by His Excellency the President and the Cabinet of Ministers as lacking and requiring further investigation and inquiry. The appointment of another Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry by His Excellency the President, the recommendation of the Commission comprising 1st to 3rd Respondents has become redundant. By the said appointment of the Special Presidential Commission, the recommendations of 1st

to 3rd Respondents have become inoperative and it is evident that His Excellency the President does not wish to proceed with the said recommendations. Even though the position of the Hon. Attorney General was that, the recommendations of the Special Presidential Commission has now become redundant, the question that has to be considered is whether, the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry are legally binding.

In the case of Silva and Others v. Sadique and Other; (1978) 1 SLR 166, it was examined whether the commissions formed under Commission of Inquiry Act 1948 able to review by of Writ of Certiorari under Article 140 of the 1978 Constitution and held that recommendation made by a Commission of Inquiry are not subject to review as the decisions are not bidding in nature and lacks legal authority.

In the case of Kehar Singh v Delhi Administration, AIR [1988] SC 1883: [1988] 3 SCC 609, it was held that,

Page 16 of 38

"The report of a Commission is a recommendation of the Commission for the consideration of the Government. It is the opinion of the Commission based on the statements of witnesses and other material. It has no evidentiary value in the trial of a criminal case... " In the case of Kabugo v The Comission of Inquiry (effectiveness of law, policies and processes of land acquisition, land administration, land management and land registration in Uganda) & Anor, (Miscellaneous Cause 108 of 2019) [2020] UGHCCD 62 [23 April 2020] it was held that;

"Basically, an inquiry under the Commissions of Inquiry Act is usually mounted by the government for the information of its own mind.... "

"The Commissions of Inquiry Act makes no provision for giving effect to the commission's findings. The commission is merely a fact-finding body having no power to pronounce a binding or definitive judgment or orders. It collects facts through the evidence laid before it, and after considering the same, it submits its report which the appointing authority may or may not accept"

"The Commission is required to collect fact fairly to all concerned and in the best manner possible and advise the government with its findings. It will be ultimately for the appointing authority (President or government) to accept the commission's findings and take appropriate measures as advised or even otherwise."

In the abovementioned case of, Silva and Others v. Sadique and Other, [1978] 1 SLR 166 the court held that;

"It appears to be clear that certiorari will also lie where there is some decision, as opposed to a recommendation, which is a prescribed step in a statutory process and leads to an ultimate decision affecting rights even though that decision itself does not immediately affect rights. From the citations which I have set out, it would appear that a Writ of Certiorari would lie in respect of an order or decision where such order or decision is binding on a person and it either imposes an obligation or involves civil consequences to him or in some way alters his legal position to his disadvantage or where such order or decision is a step in a statutory process which would have such effect."

Further in the case of Silva and Others vs Director of Health Services and Others [2010] 1 SLR 285 it has been held that;

"The recommendation of the Human Rights Commission contained in PI la and P12 does not take effect proprio vigore. There is no provision in the said Act to enforce the recommendation of the said Commission. If the Commission 's recommendations are not complied with, the Commission can only report to the President and in turn it can be placed in Parliament. In view of this the recommendation of the Human Rights Commission cannot be quashed by a writ of Certiorari."

Page 17 of 38

In the case of S.S.A.U.S.A Udayar and another vs M.S.M.K. Marikkar and Others C. A. (Writ) 106/2012, (C.A Minutes; 22.06.2020) it was held that;

"There is a long line of judicial authority which unequivocally states that a writ of certiorari will issue only where the decision-maker has determined questions affecting the rights of the subject and will not issue against recommendations that do not have any force praprio vigore. "

[De Mel v. De Silva (51 N.L.R. 105), Dias v. Abeywardena (68 N.L.R. 409), Fernando v. Jayaratne (78 N.L.R. 123)11, G.P.A. Silva and Others v. Sadique and Others [(1978-79) I Sri.L.R. 166]. In the case of, Ratnasiri and others v. Ellawala and others, (2004) SLR 180 12, it was held that;

"This court is mindful of the fact that the prerogative remedies it is empowered to grant in these proceedings are not available as of right. Court has a discretion in regard to the grant of relief in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction. It has been held time and time again by our Courts that "A writ... will not issue where it would be vexatious or futile. "

See, P.S. Bus Co. Ltd. v Members and Secretary of the Ceylon Transport Board In Siddeek v Jacolyn Seneviratne and Others 1984 (1) SLR 83 Soza, J. delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court observed that;

"The Court will have regard to the special circumstances of the case before issuing a writ of certiorari. The writ of certiorari clearly will not issue where the end result will be futility, frustration, injustice and illegality."

The learned Additional Solicitor General who appeared on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General submitted that the recommendations sought to be quashed by the Petitioner has not been acted upon by His Excellency the President and there are no legally binding and operative recommendations to be quashed. Therefore, the issuance of Writ of Certiorari as prayed for by the Petitioner in this application is futile. The learned Additional Solicitor General suggests to terminate the proceedings with liberty for the Petitioner to re agitate this matter if the need arises.

It is my view that the impugned recommendations and decisions of the 1st to 3rd Respondents are not final and conclusive. Therefore, this matter is now futile and academic in view of the fact that the decisions of the 1st to 3rd Respondents are not final and conclusive.

Page 18 of 38

When this matter was taken up on 14.03.2022, it was submitted on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General that the Secretary to His Excellency the President Gotabhaya Rajapaksha, has instructed the Hon. Attorney General that he does not intends to refer the report of the 1st to 3rd Respondents to Bribery Commission or Public Service Commission but to await the full recommendation of the Special Presidential Commission that His Excellency the President Gotabhaya Rajapaksha has appointed, in terms of the SPCOI Act No 7 of 1978. Thereafter this matter was supported for Notice and Interim Relief. This Court issued the order Notice on the Respondents but not interim relief, holding that the opportunity to make decisions which were prejudicial to the Petitioner no longer existed (Order dated 9.5.2022). As borne out by the proceedings dated 08.02.2023, the position with regard to the Report of the 1st to 3rd Respondents was submitted by the Hon. Attorney General, Sanjaya Rajaratnam, PC to this Court as follows; I quote;

"All these applications invoke the jurisdiction of Your Lordships' Court to quash the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry. If I may briefly call that Upali Abeyrathne commission Report, now My Lord they all came before Your Lordships Court and there were proceedings which were held before Your Lordships' Court on 30th of March 2021. I would like to advert to the proceedings of 30th March 2021." "May I read page 02 of the proceedings, the learned President's Counsel appearing for the 6th Respondent somewhere in the middle of that proceedings in CA Writ 174/21 states as follows;" "I have specific instructions from the President that His Excellency whilst being acutely conscious of there being very serious grievances of those who made genuine complaints of discrimination and victimization to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry that nevertheless in accordance with the rule of law that His Excellency is of the considered view, that prior to causing any of the recommendations or decisions contained in the report of the Justice Abeyrathne Commission, that His Excellency wishes to in the first instant, bring an objective mind to bear on the contents of the said report and the recommendations as well as, the final report of the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry consisting of 02 sitting Judges of the Supreme Court and a Judge of the Court of Appeal, that has now been constituted by His Excellency the President Gotabhaya Rajapaksha for the purpose of furnishing final recommendations to His Excellency." "The Attorney General has received oral instructions from the Secretary to His Excellency the President Gotabhaya Rajapaksha. He has not acted in the findings of the 1st to the 3rd Respondents that are the Abeyrathne Commission report and has appointed another Special Presidential Commission in terms of Government Gazette.

Page 19 of 38

My submission here is the authority when he got the recommendations and findings of the Commission of Inquiry of Abeyrathne Commission for good reason he didnt act on it and instead forwarded those recommendations to be considered by a Special Presidential Commission consisting of two Judges of the Supreme Court and 01 Judge of Court of Appeal."

"Now Your Lordship may ask me what happened to the Special Presidential Commission of inquiry. Up to now from April last year, it came to a premature closure. It did not make any recommendation; it did not make any finding. It was an abrupt end to the Special Presidential Commission and His Excellency in his wisdom thought it fit that not to grant any further extension to the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry. While that process came to an end, in that case this Court delivered a judgment in CA-WRT-0173-22 in September 2022, popularly known as Janaka Bandara's Case. After Your Lordship delivered the judgment, it was brought to my attention as the Attorney General I wrote to the Cabinet of Ministers and wanted a policy decision taken across the board in respect for all these recommendations given by Upali Abeyrathne Commission and also made my suggestion that this matter should come to an end. The Cabinet of Ministers wanted to clarify before they took a final decision in four matters,

1. Whether the police; 2. The Commission to investigate Bribery and Corruption; 3. Whether the Attorney General; 4. Whether the Public Service Commission;

had taken any step with regard to the finding or recommendation made by Upali Abeyrathna Commission. The reports were forwarded to the Cabinet and all institutions took up uniform position that no action was taken to implement any of the recommendations of the Upali Abeyrathna Commission. Having been briefed with that My Lord, the Cabinet has taken a decision which was taken about a week ago with regard to that matter with the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry coming to a standstill, premature closure there is no validity in going any further ahead with the Upali Abeyrathna Commission report. They stopped short of making any pronouncement on the Upali Abeyrathna Commission report but of course said that they will not interfere in the Court proceedings before Your Lordships' Court. Those are the very words which they said. It will not interfere in the proceedings initiated before Your Lordships Court. " "Now having briefed Your lordships Court based on what I just mentioned, my submission before Your lordships Court is that the Upali Abeyrathna Commission Report, the appointing Authority in its wisdom thought it fit, it should not be acted on its own. It should go passed the shifting process of a Special Presidential Commission

Page 20 of 38

of inquiry. That Commission of inquiry it should be recorded that nothing flows from the Upali Abeyrathna Commission report. And it is a matter of futility with all due respect whether these cases should proceed I am not for a moment trying to debunk the position taken up by the Petitioner, but I am saying that nothing flows from it because it had a two-tier stage, one tier which had made the recommendation, the 2nd tier came to an abrupt end. So, what is left now, nothing flows from it. "

"In view of my submission which could be recorded, that is proceedings would be terminated and deserving the rights for the Petitioner to file a motion and reagitate those matters whenever they are advised to do so, otherwise with all due respect there is no live issue to be canvassed, except the recommendations of the Upali Abeyrathna Commission. If the Government says they dont want to implement with the presidential Commission inquiry, didnt even make any order on that therefore, what is left. I would suggest may be to look after their interest for the future before they may be worried that there might be peril in the future if somebody wants to take it up. So, terminate the proceedings but reserving their rights for the parties to reagitate this matter whenever they are advised to do so. These are my submissions and I thought it is fit that I should come and make these submissions before your lordships court so that appropriate order and also considered wisdom will be taken by my learned friend who is appearing for the Petitioner. "

Hon. Attorney General himself makes submissions and informs this Court that Cabinet has decided not to take any action regarding the Upali Abeyrathna Presidential Commission Report. Therefore, he is requesting this Court to terminate the proceeding.

The learned Presidents Counsel argued on behalf of the Petitioner that is it clear that the 1st

to the 3rd Respondents have lent themselves party to a political witch-hunt, and there is no legal basis whatsoever for the findings and the report. An examination of the mandate of the 1st to the 3rd Respondents, it is crystal clear that there is no mandate for the recommendations made and the findings arrived at.

The said findings and recommendations and material collected is ex- facie and otherwise ultra-vires the powers of the Commission and the power given to it in terms of the mandate marked P2a, P2b, P3a and P3b. The Gazette marked P2(a), which set out the original mandate of the 1st to the 3rd Respondents, as amended by P2(b). The findings far exceed the mandate set out in P2(a) as amended by P2(b). In the circumstances, ex-facie, the findings are ultra-vires the mandate of the 1st to the 3rd Respondents.

It was the contention of the learned Presidents counsel for the Petitioner that in any event the findings and recommendations and material collected are grossly unreasonable. The findings and recommendations and material collected are nowhere in the vicinity of such that could be arrived at by a reasonably prudent person. On behalf of the Petitioner, he further

Page 21 of 38

submits that to put it in the famous words of Lord Diplock, the findings and recommendations so outrageous in its defiance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.

The evidence of this Petitioner, before the Commission has been clear in that, inter alia;

a. The Anti-Corruption Committee and the Secretariat were established

consequent to approval by the Cabinet of Ministers;

b. The Cabinet of Ministers at the time, having deliberated decided to establish

the committee;

c. Prosecutions and actions have been initiated by the relevant law enforcement

authorities, including, the Attorney General, the Police and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery; and

d. Thereafter, respective Courts have taken cognizance of the matters and

proceedings have been initiated in terms of the law.

The unequivocal position of the Petitioner is as follows;

1. at all material times it was the relevant authorities, including the Police, the

Attorney General's Department and the Judiciary that investigated the complaints, took decisions to prosecute and carry out prosecutions in all cases; and, 2. at no point did the Petitioner interfere with such investigations and with such

authorities.

It is crystal clear that there appears to be no finding that the Petitioner interfered and meddled with any proceedings and that the Petitioner manipulated and engineered any proceedings in a particular desired fashion. However, the recommendations, that have been arrived at, are gross unreasonable and far exceeds what a reasonably prudent person would arrive at, given the positions and the evidence before them. In the circumstances, the findings are unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense and ought to be quashed, on this ground alone. According to the learned Additional Solicitor General, the Hon. Attorney General's position appears to be as follows;

a. the findings and recommendations and material collected in the report are not

final and conclusive; b. that the findings and recommendations and material collected have been the

subject matter of further Presidential Commission of inquiry; c. the term of the said presidential commission of inquiry has expired without

extension and no outcome has been achieved;

Page 22 of 38

d. the Cabinet of Ministers and the relevant authorities including the Attorney

General, the Bribery Commission and the Police have indicated that no actions have been and will be taken in terms of the findings and recommendations and material collected; and e. in the circumstances, this application would be futile. On this position alone it is clear that the findings and recommendations and material collected are;

i. baseless; and ii. in any event, completely ultra vires.

As set out earlier, in view of that, particularly the reputation of this Petitioner, these baseless findings cannot be allowed to stand. In view of the position of the Hon. Attorney General alone, there could not be any questions for this Petitioner's relief being granted. In these circumstances, there is no objection from the Respondents to the reliefs being granted.

In the case of Shell Gas Lanka Ltd. v. Consumer Affairs Authority and others [2008] 1 Sri LR 128 which was a matter regarding an inquiry under Section 13 of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, it was held by Justice Sriskandarajah that;

"The duty of the court is to see that power shall not be exercised in unlawful and arbitrary manner, when exercise of such powers affects the basic rights of individuals. The courts should be alert to see that such powers conferred by the statute are not exceeded or abused. "

Dealing with an inquiry held under Section 18(3) of the Consumer Affairs Authority act, Justice Sripavan (as he then was) held in the case of Nestle Lanka Ltd. v. Consumer Affairs Authority and another [2005] 2 Sri LR 138, 141 that;

"Though the aforesaid section gives certain amount of discretion to the Authority

in order to decide on the increase of a reasonable price, the exercise of such discretion necessarily implies good faith in discharging public duty. The abuse of power or discretion constitutes a ground of invalidity independent of excess of power. It is to be borne in mind that when a power granted for one purpose is exercised for a different purpose or a collateral object or in bad faith, the court will necessarily intervene and declare such act as illegal or invalid. Statutory powers conferred for public purposes are conferred upon trust and not absolutely. That is to say, that they can be validly used only in the right and proper manner."

"The lawful exercise of a statutory power presupposes not only compliance with

the substantive and procedural conditions laid down for its performance but also with the implied requirements governing the exercise of the discretion. Thus, all statutory powers must be exercised fairly and reasonably, in good faith, for the

Page 23 of 38

purposes for which they are given with due regard to relevant considerations without being influenced by irrelevant considerations."

In the case of G.P.A De Silva and others v Sadique and Others (1978-79-80) SLR 166, 171, a divisional bench of 5 judges of the Supreme Court held that;

"The classic statement in regard to when a Writ of Certiorari will issue is however

found in the judgment of Lord Atkin in R v Electricity Commissioners, in which he held that writs of certiorari and prohibition may "wherever anybody of persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially act in excess of their legal authority"

In the case of Gregory Fernando and Others v. Stanley Perera, Acting Principal, Christ the King National School and Other [2004] 1 SLR 346, 349 Justice Sripavan (as he then was) stated that;

"it is of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done. The law is concerned with public confidence in the administration of justice; hence it is of paramount importance to ensure that individuals fee that they have been given a fair hearing before a decision is taken. "

In the case of Mahindapala and Others v. Minister of Lands and Land Development and Others [2009] 2 SLR 324, 327-328 it was held by Justice Lecamwasam that;

"...Had they followed the proper procedure petitioners would have got an

opportunity to air their grievances. Failure on the part of the authorities to follow the procedure deprived the petitioners of that opportunity. One pillar of the doctrine of Natural Justice is the right to a fair hearing before an administrative authority acts or makes decisions affecting the rights of subjects..

Addressing the general procedure required for a fair hearing, Wade (8th Edition) at pages 511-512 states as follows;

"A 'hearing' will normally be an oral hearing. But in some cases, it may suffice to

give an opportunity to make representations in writing, provided that any adverse material is disclosed and provided, as always, that the demands of fairness as substantially met Where an oral hearing is given, it has been laid down that a tribunal must;

(a) consider all relevant evidence which a party wishes to submit;

Page 24 of 38

(b) inform every party of all the evidence to be taken into account, whether derived from another party or independently (c) allow witnesses to be questioned; (d) allow comment on the evidence and argument on the whole case." In Gunadasa v. Attorney-General and Others [1989] 2 SLR 130, 133-134 it was held by Justice Gunawardana that;

"...It has been said by Lord Denning in the case of Kanda vs. Government of Malaya that, "If the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything, it must carry with it a right in the accused man to know the case which is made against him. He must know what evidence has been given and what statements have been made affecting him and then he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or contradict them."

"Hence the failure to give to the petitioner a fair opportunity to "correct or contradict" the said witnesses when they gave evidence, in my view has occasioned a violation of the principle of natural justice, that a man's defence must always be fairly heard. The non observation of the said principle of natural justice would consequently amount to an error on the face of the record, which would attract the remedy of Writ of Certiorari"

Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law (11th Edition; page 428) quote Lord Denning to state;

"if the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything, it must carry with it a right in the accused man to know the case which is made against him. He must know what evidence has been given and what statements have been made affecting him: and then he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or contradict them"

"The fundamental rule is that, if a person may be subject to pains or penalties, or be exposed to prosecution or proceedings, or be deprived of remedies or redress, or is in some such way adversely affected by the investigations and report, then he should be told the matter against him and afforded a fair opportunity of answering it." R vs. Race Relations Board, ex parte, Selvarajan, cited with approval in G.P.A De Silva and others v Sadique and Others (1978-79-80 1SLR 166, 171)

"if the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything, it must carry with it a right in the accused man to know the case which is made against him. He must know what evidence has been given and what statements have

Page 25 of 38

been made affecting him and then he must be given a fair opportunity to correct or contradict them " The unreasonableness should be considered as an important element when it comes to issuing of writs. The classic test of "unreasonableness" was set out in the landmark case of the Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223, where it was held that the if a decision is "so outrageous in its defiance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it", same is liable to be quashed by way of a writ of certiorari.

In Dona Marian Sandya Kumari Kodduruarachchi vs Additional Secretary, Education quality Development [CA WRIT 343/2009] Decided 30.05.2013 Anil Gooneratne J observed that:

The hallmark of the Wednesbury connotation of unreasonableness is that the repository of discretion, although acting within the four corners of the legislative grant of discretion, has arrived at a decision which is repugnant to all reason. -Recent Developments in Administrative Law- G.L. Pieris pg. 189.

In those circumstances, it is clear that in the event the court finds a decision to be unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense, the Courts have had no hesitation in quashing such a decision, on such ground alone.

Wade and Forsyth Administrative Law 10th Edition deals with the power of issuing Writs of Certiorari and Prohibition when the lower Tribunal has acted in excess of Jurisdiction on pages 214 and 215, where there is a breach of natural justice on pages 372 to 379, where there is a lack of fair hearing at pages 405 to 408 and bias at pages 389 to 392. Wade and Forsyth Administrative Law in 12th Edition at page 398 under the sub heading Acting Fairly, refers to the case of Furnell vs. Whangarei High School Board [1973] A. C. 660 at 679 where Lord Morris said, that,

Natural justice is but fairness writ large and judicially.

At the same page the learned writers have also referred to the dicta of Lord Diplock in Regina vs. Commission for Racial Equality ex parte Hillingdon LBC [1982] A. C. 779 where Lord Diplock said,

Where an Act of Parliament confers upon an administrative body functions which involve its making decisions which affect to their detriment the rights of other persons or curtail their liberty to do as they please, there is a presumption that Parliament intended that the administrative body should act fairly towards those persons who will be affected by their decision.

Page 26 of 38

Hence it appears to this Court, that, as the obligation to exercise powers and discretion fairly extends to administrative bodies too, there is no question about its application to judicial and quasi-judicial bodies. It is also submitted, that, it was said in Roberts vs. Hopewood, 1925, Appeal Cases 578, that;

I rest my opinion on higher grounds. A person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded to do so he must in the exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he must, by use of his reason, ascertain and follow the course which reason directs. He must act reasonably. (Lord Wrenbury, page 613). It is important to note that there are a few cases in which the matters of Writs concerning the Presidential Commission of Inquiry were decided.

(a) Dharmaratne vs. Samaraweera and Others (2004) 1 SLR 57 (b) Mendis. Fowzie and others vs. Goonewardena (1979) 2 SLR 322 (c) Seneviratne vs. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and Another (1999) 2 SLR 341 (d) B. Sirisena Cooray vs. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and two Others (1999) 1 SLR 1

Article 140 of the Constitution prescribes the Law under which this Court can issue Writs in the nature of Certiorari, Mandamus and Prohibition.

The Petitioner states that the Mandate of this Presidential Commission as set out in the Notification published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09th of January 2020, inter alia states as follows;

i. That, it has been reported that public officers, employees of public corporations,

and members of the armed forces and police service who held such office prior to the Presidential Elections and/or General elections held respectively in January and August 2015, being persons who had either resigned from or otherwise ceased to hold public office with the change of Government or continued to hold such office after such change, during the period commencing 08th January 2015 and ending 16th November 2016 were subjected to political victimization;

ii. That, such process of Political victimization has been instigated through a Special

Unit dealing with Anti- Corruption, Commission to investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Financial Investigations Divisions (FCID) of the Sri Lanka Police, and/or/ Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka.

Page 27 of 38

The Petitioner further states that by the Gazette Extraordinary bearing No. 2159/16 dated 22nd January 2020, inter alia states that in addition to the above institutions, even the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), must be included as an agency that has by its process subjected persons referred to in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09th of January 2020 to political victimization. Having given such mandate, the scope of inquiry conducted by the Commission is limited and must be within the limitations and the purview of such mandate. The Petitioner accordingly, states that a complaint from a private individual, cannot be entertained and/or be inquired into by the Respondents as the mandate has been given solely to inquire in to.

The mandate of the Commission as set out in the notification published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09th of January 2020, excludes any private individual from filing a complaint before the Commission since such person has no locus standi to appear before the Commission and be heard by the Commission, and thus, any act and or decision made by the commission purporting to accept any complaint made by such persons who does not fit in to the scope of the mandate, may deemed to be an act and/or decision that is ultra vires and without jurisdiction, in a manner outside the scope of its mandate and authority conferred, and the entirety of the proceedings before the said Commission in respect of such inquiry is void ab initio, is a nullity and has no force or avail or consequence in Law.

However, Nissanka Senadhipathi, who is the Chairman of the Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd. (8th Respondent) had made a complaint bearing No. PCI/PV/01 Com./50/2020 dated 31.01.2020 to the Commission stating that he was subjected Political Victimization during the period commencing 08th January 2015 and ending 16th November 2019.

The Petitioner states that he received summons and notice dated 16/06/2020 regarding Complaint bearing No: PCI/PV/01/Com./50/2020 from the 4th Respondent under the order of the 1st to 3rd Respondents of the Commission informing that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry is to inquire into and obtain information in relation to alleged Political Victimization of Public Officers, Employees of State Corporations, members of Armed Forces and the Police Service who held posts during the period commencing 08th January 2015 and ending 16th

November 2019, and hence stating inter alia as follows;

" 16 . . "

The Petitioner further states that consequently, the Petitioner presented before the said Commission on the 23.06.2020 and made an application before the Commission primarily stating that the Petitioner objects to the jurisdiction of the Commission to inquire in to the

Page 28 of 38

Complaint made by Nissanka Senadhipathi. The Petitioner states that the Petitioner made a further application subject to the objection, that the Petitioner has not received any document in relation to the Inquiry, and that even though the Petitioner was made a Respondent, he has not been provided with the Complaint that is made the subject matter to the impugned inquiry. The Petitioner states that therefore, the Petitioner made an application to the commission requesting the copy of the complaint made and the proceedings pertaining to the inquiry.

Thereafter, the Petitioner presented himself before the said Commission on the 30.06.2020 together with the Counsels appearing for the Petitioner. The Petitioner states that the Counsel appearing for the Petitioner raised a preliminary objection before the Commission as to the Jurisdiction of the said Commission to conduct the impugned inquiry. The Petitioner states that it was contended by the Counsel appearing for the Petitioner and the other Respondents summoned by the Commission, that the impugned inquiry could not be sustained before the Commission and that in such circumstances, the Commission could not issue summons on the Petitioner and the other Respondents named thereto, and that such action is Ultra Vires and illegal. Despite the preliminary objections raised by the Counsels for the Petitioner, and also by the other Respondents summoned by the Commission, the 1st -3rd

Respondents overruled the objection and refused to make any order regarding the same and stated inter alia that, the Commission has come to a conclusion regarding jurisdiction at the time of accepting the complaint filed by Mr. Nissanka Senadhipathi, and thus, there is no necessity to make order in such regard and merely and simply continued with the inquiry.

Thereafter, the Counsel appearing for the Petitioner made an application to the Commission that, the Petitioner would appear before the Commission, however, subject to the objection taken as to the jurisdiction of the Commission. The aforesaid Summons and Notice refer to a "complaint of political victimization made by Nissanka Senadhipathi, the Chairman of the Avant Garde Maritime Services (Pvt.) Ltd." (here in after referred to as the Complainant). The Petitioner states that however, neither the complaint nor the allegation against the Petitioner has been served or disclosed at the time summons were served on the Petitioner.

When perusing the complaint made by the said Complainant, Mr. Nissanka Senadhipathi, it was immediately apparent that such complaint has arisen from his involvement as an Accused in Case No. TAB/751/2019 in the High Court of Colombo, Case No. HCB/25/2017 in the High Court of Colombo and Case No. MC 59287/01/16 in the Magistrate's Court of Colombo. To the best of the Petitioner's knowledge, the subject matter of this inquiry was initially considered by the Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption, and Abuse of Power (PRECIFAC). The said Commission was commissioned in March 2015 to probe large scale corruption and fraud involving public funds and instances of abuse of power as it concerned the role of Avant Garde Maritime Services Private Limited (of

Page 29 of 38

which the Complainant is the Chairman) in connection with a Floating Armory off the Port of Galle and the possession of large quantities of firearms contrary to law.

The aforesaid Commission (PRECIFAC) had found that the Avant Garde Maritime Services Private Limited including members of the Senior Management of the said entity should be held responsible for Criminal Misappropriation of Public funds and Corruption and that following the recommendation of the Hon. Attorney General, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) initiated an investigation with regard to MV/Avant Garde, a ship which had entered Sri Lankan waters from the Red Sea. Thereafter, the Hon. Attorney General indicted that the Complainant, Mr. Nissanka Senadhipathi, had committed offences under the Firearms Ordinance and the Explosives Act and based on an application by the Hon. Attorney General considering the gravity of the offences disclosed in the Indictment, a Trial-at-Bar was duly constituted by His Lordship the Chief Justice.

A Bribery case bearing No. HCB/25/2017 in the High Court of Colombo, where the Complainant and the former Chairman of Rakna Lanka Private Limited, Major General Palitha Fernando have been named as accused for offering and accepting a bribe of a sum of Rs.35.5 million and this Prosecution is at the tail end. The Petitioner states that the prosecuting officer in the said case is a Senior State Counsel Mr. Janaka Bandara and that he is also named as a Respondent in the matter taken up for inquiry at the said Commission Chaired by the 1st to 3rd Respondents. The 1st to 3rd Respondents who constitute this Commission, cannot take steps which would directly or indirectly call into question any of the ongoing judicial proceedings, including those connected with the Complainant in the aforesaid Complaint No. PCI/PV/01/Com./50/2020 as the matter inquired into by this commission is under judicial consideration and is thus sub judice. It is the role of the courts to deal with legal issues that are before it. The courts' role should not be usurped by the Respondents making statements/ findings or recommendations concerning how these issues should be dealt with. The notification published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09th of January 2020 which sets out the parameters of the Mandate of the Respondents, specifically states in the eighth recital thereof that "the scope of the inquiry into the said matter under this warrant would not in any way impose a fetter upon the relevant authorities exercising their statutory and legal responsibilities" and that "the relevant authorities are empowered in terms of the applicable written laws to consider and, where, possible, pursue available action, in terms of the applicable written laws, notwithstanding the inquiry conducted in terms of this warrant". The Petitioner states that this Commission of Inquiry is not a judicial tribunal as it does not fall within any of the institutions contemplated under Article 4 (c) read with Article 105 of the Constitution. the Petitioner states that it is a fact-finding body functioning under the authority of the Executive.

Page 30 of 38

The Petitioner therefore states that, any attempt by the Respondents to directly or indirectly inquire into or investigate matters which are pending before the relevant judicial fora would tantamount to an interference with the judiciary and would be a gross encroachment and violation of the principle of the separation of powers. In such situation, the aforesaid summons sought to be issued by the Respondents to the Petitioner to appear reflects a serious destruction into the judicial powers of the people vested in the judiciary in terms of the provisions of Article 111 C (1) and 111 C (2) of the Constitution. The Petitioner further states that, the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry being a fact-finding body cannot be used to impede the functions of the judiciary, neither directly nor indirectly. The Petitioner states that the conduct of the 1st to the 3rd Respondents in the aforesaid proceedings with gross ignorance of procedure and Rule of Law have been totally appalling and unintelligible. In order to further facilitate and assist this Court in the adjudication of this matter Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara is also named as a Respondent with no relief claimed against him.

The Petitioner states that the Petitioner has preferred this Application, invoking the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court on the grounds that;

The act and/or decision of the 1st to 4th Respondents or any one or more of

them, to accept the complaint made by Nissanka Senadhipathi and the act and/or decision of the 1st to 4th Respondents or any one or more of them commence a purported inquiry, naming the Petitioner as "Respondent" and the act and/or decision of the 1st to 4th Respondents or any one or more of them, to issue summons on the Petitioner,

The decisions and/or acts of the 1st to 4th Respondents or any one or more of

them are contrary to the mandate conferred on Respondents in terms of the Commissions of Inquiry Act (Chapter 393), No. 17 of 1948 (as amended), and/ or by Gazette Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09th of January 2020 and Notification published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2159/16 dated 22nd of January 2020 to carry out the purported inquiry against the Petitioner, The decisions and/or acts of the 1st to 4th Respondents or any one or more of

them to issue summons on the Petitioner is contrary to the mandate conferred on Respondents in terms of the Commissions of Inquiry Act (Chapter 393), No. 17 of 1948 (as amended), and/ or by Gazette Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09th of January 2020 and Notification published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2159/16 dated 22nd of January 2020 to carry out the purported inquiry against the Petitioner, are grossly indefensible, unreasonable, arbitrary, mala fide and unfair, and are thus, deemed to be Ultra Vires, illegal and bad in law.

Page 31 of 38

The acceptance of the complaint made by Nissanka Senadhipathi and the proceeding to inquire into the said complaint and issuing summons on the Petitioner constitutes an administrative and/or executive action within the meaning of the Constitution and that such action and/or decisions taken by the 1st to 4th Respondents or any one or more of them is without any justifiable reason, arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair, unjust, capricious and irrational; is based on irrelevant considerations and has been carried out for collateral purposes, motivated by extraneous considerations; is without any legal basis whatsoever is against the legitimate expectations of the Petitioner; is tainted with mala fides; is ultra vires; is illegal and contrary to law; has been carried out contrary to the principles of natural justice.

The Petitioner state that in the aforesaid state of affairs and/or decisions of the 1st to 4th

Respondents or any one or more of them; to accept the complaint made by Nissanka Senadhipathi, to commence an inquiry, to name the Petitioner as a "Respondent" and to issue summons on the Petitioner are grossly indefensible, unreasonable, arbitrary, mala fide and unfair, and are thus, deemed to be Ultra Vires, Illegal and bad in law and made disregarding the mandate conferred on the 1st to 4th Respondents by the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09th of January 2020 and Notification published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2159/16 dated 22nd of January 2020, has consequently, qualified the Petitioners in the aforesaid circumstances, to seek a mandates in the nature of a writ of Certiorari and a writ of Prohibition. The Petitioner further states that in the totality of the aforesaid circumstances, the Petitioner seek to staying the inquiry which emanates from the complaint preferred by the 7th

Respondent dated 31.01.2020 marked as X until the final determination of this case. The Petitioner does not seek any relief against the 5th and 6th Respondents.

The contention of the learned President's Counsel who appeared on behalf of the Petitioner was that there has been no compliance with the rules of natural justice, in so far this Petitioner is concerned, the findings are ex-facie ultra vires and have no basis. It was further argued that the findings are unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense. In the circumstances, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner says that the findings and the report is ex-facie, ultra vires, void and has no force or effect in law. It is important to note that, an examination of the position of the 5A Respondent, supports the position of the Petitioner, and fortifies the view that the findings and the report ought to be quashed. This Court heard the Petitioner in support, and was inclined to issue notices on or about 9th

May 2022. Notices were issued and served on the Respondents, who chose not to file any objections, having received the complaint of the Petitioner. However, no objections had been filed thus far by any of the Respondents for over a year, and on this ground alone it must deem that the Respondents have no objection to the grant of the reliefs. It was argued that on this ground alone, the reliefs sought, ought to be granted. In any event, the learned

Page 32 of 38

President's counsel submits that the findings and the Report is contrary to all principles of natural justice known to law.

In these circumstances, the Petitioner argued that he was led to believe and had a legitimate expectation that no findings and recommendations would be made against the Petitioner and there would be no material collected against the Petitioner to the detriment of the Petitioner. The petitioner finds that the report contains, damaging findings against the Petitioner, are grave and very serious. In these circumstances, he argued that there is a grave violation of the rules of natural justice, and on this ground alone, the report and the findings should be quashed.

In my considered view that the former President Gotabhaya Rajapaksha had appointed a Special Presidential Commission by Gazette Notification 2212/53 dated 29.01.2021 appointing a Special Commission of Inquiry to look into whether the observations and recommendations contained in the final report of the 1st to 3rd Respondents were legally binding and had merit. The words used in the mandate at paragraph 1, inter alia, are as follows;

"... to further investigate and report whether the above malpractices have done and what extent are the respondents so responsible, and to recommend whether a person should be subjected to a community disability according to the provisions of Article 81 of the Constitution and Section 9 of the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry Act (Special Provisions) Act No 4 of 1978." Therefore, it is clear that the recommendations of the 1st to 3rd Respondents could not be given effect to until the Special Presidential Commission appointed by the President had gone into the contents of the said report and made their own recommendations as to the validity and legality of giving effect to the Report of the 1st to 3rd Respondents and after further investigation making their independent recommendation of the course of action that needs to be adopted in this regard.

Whether or not the rights of the Petitioner may or may not be affected would therefore, depend on the recommendations of the Special Presidential Commission. The mandate of the said Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry was further amended by Gazette Number 2221/54 dated 01st April 2021. By the said Gazette, His Excellency the President has stated inter alia as follows;

"And whereas, now, I am of the considered view that in consideration of the specific, findings, decisions and recommendations made against and/or against the specific persons identified in the said report submitted to me by the Presidential Commission of inquiry constituted by me, by the warrant issued on 09th January 2020, "

Page 33 of 38

"that such specific, findings, decisions and recommendations contained in the said Report in respect of all such identified persons should inter alia in the public interest, and for purposes of greater scrutiny be further inquired into by you, and to report to me on the suitability and justification if any for the implementation and enforcement of the said findings, decisions and recommendations contained in the sad Report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry as well as for the adoption of any action in respect thereof." It is important to note that Mr. Uditha Egalahewa, PC appearing for the members of the Commission gave an undertaking that no further steps would be taken against the present Petitioner till the Court of Appeal makes a further order in CA Writ 166/20.

However, the proceedings on 27th July 2020 [P 11] is at page 97 of the Brief and the relevant undertaking is couched in the following way.

"In deference to this court and taking into consideration that the proceedings are still

continuing voluntarily as the counsel for the 1st to the 4th Respondents would like to give an undertaking that the Commission would be advised not to summon the 5th

Respondent especially in view of the letter written by the Hon. Attorney General taking into consideration that the 5th Respondent is the prosecuting counsel in the pending cases in the High court. Further i wish to give an undertaking that both the Petitioners in CA (Writ) Application No, 166/2020 and 167/2020 respectively will be dispenses with their presence until the Court decides on the question of notice an interim order and their absence will not be held against them. "

The Commission came to the conclusion that Charges be framed against the petitioner in respect of the aforesaid complaints and inquiry held. The violation of an honorable undertaking given by a Counsel to Court is of great value and strength and accepted by those who honor traditions of legal profession. The 1st to 3rd Respondents have no good reason to have violated this undertaking to this Court and neither have they presented any reason to justify their conduct.

Thus, the steps of summoning the Petitioner and carrying on inquiry which resulted in the impugned findings are ab intio violation of the undertaking given to this Court and thus amounts to conduct that is unlawful, illegal, irrational and unreasonable. This Court will also note that to have done so suggests clearly the lack of natural justice and clear malafide and collateral purposes in the conduct of 1st to 3rd Respondents against the Petitioner. Whilst the 1st to 3rd Respondents ordinary should have acted with the mindset of a judge/umpire it is clear that they have had improper motive so as to violate an undertaking given to the Court of Appeal so as to deliver findings and recommendations against the Petitioner. In the said circumstances also the reliefs to the prayer to the Petition can be granted.

The Petitioner states that ex facie the Report there is no finding that:

Page 34 of 38

a. that the Petitioner participated in any meetings of the Anti-Corruption Committee, which decided to refer any matters for investigation against any person;

b. that the Petitioner was a part of the Anticorruption Committee which allegedly decided that any person be charged of any offence or even an investigation commenced thereto.

c. that the Petitioner participated in any decision making that led to any person being investigated or charged or indicted;

d. That the Petitioner was part of the decision-making process in any manner whatsoever.

The recommendations and decisions made in several instances against the Petitioner is only and purely on the basis/pretext that he was a member of the National Executive Council and Anticorruption unit. The learned President's Counsel argued that the Petitioner at no time whatever consented to being a member of the Anticorruption Unit. In any event the Petitioner is not guilty of any wrongdoing as alleged by the said Commission of Inquiry. The said conduct is further proof of the 1st to 3rd acting ultra vires and with collateral objectives.

On a reading of the Report there are no findings stated by the PCIPV to come to such a conclusion whatsoever against the Petitioner. There is no evidence to come to such a finding that such a finding in law is also perverse.

As per the contents of the said Report it appears as follows:

a. The PCIPV has purportedly inquired into several complaints made to it;

b. In some of the Complaints the Petitioner has been cited as a Respondent/Accused among other persons;

c. There are no specific findings against the Petitioner that he committed any wrongdoing;

d. There are however the purported findings of wrongdoing pertaining to the 'National Executive Council' and the 'Anti-Corruption Committee' of which the Commission has come to a finding that the Petitioner was a part of.

Being a member of any committee or anybody by itself cannot amount to a finding of wrongdoing. A member will not know the origins of the committee or the body or source of funding and therefore, it is inconceivable how a member can be said to be guilty of a wrongdoing purely by virtue of membership alone.

Complaints where the Petitioner is a Respondent but no evidence whatsoever;

i. 432/2020, ii. 433/2020, iii. 1842/2020,

Page 35 of 38

iv. 1941/2020, v. 352/2020

Complaints where there is evidence but of no relevance;

i. 205/2020, ii. 289/2020, iii. 290/2020, iv. 316/2020, iv. 88/2020, v. 816/2020, vi. 50/2020, vii. 1807/20, ix. 1080/20, x. 414/2020, xi. 416/2020.

On an overall basis the Petitioner among other persons has been found guilty of the following purported wrongdoing:

a. The Petitioner is said to have committed the Offence of Corruption in terms of Section 70 of the Bribery Act;

b. The Petitioner is said to have committed offences against Public Property;

c. The Petitioner by implication is said to have wielded influence of the Director in charge of the Anti-Corruption Committee Mr. Ananda Wijepala;

d. The Petitioner is alleged to have manufactured or given false evidence against some of the Complainants to the Commission of Inquiry;

It is my considered view that there is no sufficient evidence to recommend a charge of corruption against the Petitioner under Section 70 of the Bribery Act. There is no sufficient evidence to recommend charges against the Petitioner on the offences against public property. No evidence whatsoever to conclude that the Petitioner exerted any influence through the Director in charge of the Anti-Corruption Committee Mr. Ananda Wijepala. At the same time there was no evidence whatsoever to conclude that the Petitioner has manufactured or given false evidence against some of the Complainants.

The learned President's Counsel argued on behalf of the Petitioner that there is no evidence whatever to warrant any recommendation against the Petitioner. The Petitioner was not issued any Letter of Appointment as a member of the National Executive Council or Anti-corruption Unit and no such evidence was put to the Petitioner at the inquiry. There was no evidence to say that the Petitioner has received any money or monetary consideration for any purpose whatsoever through the alleged National Executive Council or Anticorruption

Page 36 of 38

Unit. In the circumstances the recommendation made it totally unreasonable and or irrational.

The attention of this Court is drawn to the recommendations made against the Petitioner in complaints which the Petitioner was named as a Respondent. It was recommended that the Petitioner has committed the Offences under Section 189, 191 and 100 of the Penal Code.

Section 189 of the Penal Code is the Offence of Fabricating False Evidence and is as follows:

Section 189;

'Whoever causes any circumstance to exist, or makes any false entry in any book or record, or makes any document containing a false statement, intending that such circumstance, false entry, or false statement may appear in evidence in a judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by law before a public servant as such, or before an arbitrator, and that such circumstance, false entry, or false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause any person, who in such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous opinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding, is said " to fabricate false evidence.'

Section 191;

'Whoever gives or fabricates false evidence, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, any person to be convicted of an offence which is punishable with death by this code or any other enactment for the time being in force, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.'

There is no evidence that the Petitioner has fabricated any evidence. The learned President's Counsel argued on behalf of the Petitioner that in any event the Petitioner as a member of the Parliament does not have any function pertaining to gathering evidence. The Commission has also recommended that the Petitioner has committed the wrong of Corruption under the Bribery Act. Again, there is not an iota of evidence supporting such a finding and it is completely unreasonable. The Recommendation made was not justified by the contents of the report.

The recommendations are ultra vires considering the powers of the Commission of Inquiry. This Court will note that the 1st to 3rd Respondents have made recommendations against the Petitioner even in inquiries where there is no evidence whatsoever against the Petitioner. This is cogent evidence of the fact that the 1st to 3rd Respondents have acted in the manner as the Petitioner has alleged. Even where there is some insubstantial evidence no reasonable person would have come to such a finding.

This Court is of the view that the recommendations made against the Petitioner are;

a. Unreasonable

Page 37 of 38

b. Arbitrary and/or capricious c. In breach of his legitimate expectations It is obvious that the recommendation against him has been made mala fides in law and those would affect his political career. It is my considered view that for the reasons above, as per relief (b) the findings, decisions and the recommendations against the Petitioner in the Report 'P 7' should be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari. It is crystal clear that the said decisions are unreasonable, irrational, capricious, teeming with bias, contrary to natural justice. In respect of relief (d) to the prayer a Writ of Prohibition is sought preventing any steps being taken by any of the Respondents based on the abovesaid findings against the Petitioner in 'P 7'. As the findings in 'P 7' are liable to be quashed any Respondent should not take any steps against the Petitioner as recommended and must be prohibited from doing so. In respect of relief (c) a Writ of Certiorari is sought in respect of the decision of the Cabinet marked 'P 12' in so far as it affects the Petitioner in Complaints bearing No. 205/2020, 289/2020, 290/2020, 316/2020, 88/2020, 816/2020, 432/2020, 433/20, 50/2020, 1807/20, 1080/20, 1842/2020, 1941/2020, 414/2020, 416/2020, 352/2020 and any other complaint in the report marked "P7" to the Petition in respect of the Petitioner. The entire Cabinet Decision 'P 12' is based wholly on the findings and recommendations liable to be quashed contained in document 'P7'. Thus, the decision of the Cabinet is irrational, unreasonable and capricious. The Cabinet of Ministers have not exercised its own mind and wholly accepted the recommendations made by the Abeyratne Commission.

The Cabinet of Ministers cannot really be faulted because they have acted on the basis of a report submitted by a Commission headed by a former Judge of the Supreme Court. However, it is the duty of the Cabinet to have given its own mind. It was the same Cabinet that thought it fit to subject the findings of Hon. Abeyratne Commission to a Special Presidential Commission. This infers that even the Cabinet of Ministers at a later point realized the deficiencies of the Hon. Abeyratne Commission.

In the circumstances, as the findings of the Abeyratne Commission are liable to be quashed and the decision of the Cabinet in 'P7' cannot be permitted to remain and is liable to be quashed.

In prayer (d), a Writ of Prohibition is sought in respect of the Respondent acting in terms of the Cabinet Decision 'P7' which is liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari. Any steps taken in terms of the Cabinet Decision 'P7' against the Petitioner is therefore tainted with the same errors of the record and thus any conduct based on the same is liable to be prohibited.

Thus, we make the following orders;

Page 38 of 38

This Court issues a Writ of Certiorari quashing the findings, decisions, material and

recommendations of the 1st to 3rd Respondents in the final report, in respect of the Petitioner, regarding the complaint bearing No. PCI/PV/01/Com./50/2020 made by the 7th Respondent dated 31/01/2020 marked as (X) in CA-WRT-0166-2020.

recommendations in respect of the Petitioner in the Report marked "P7" to the Petition with reference to Complaint included in Section/chapter 8 (starting from page 17) of the said Commission Report and Complaint Nos. 205/2020, 289/2020, 290/2020, 316/2020, 88/2020, 816/2020, 432/2020, 433/2020 50/2020, 1807/20, 1080/20, 1842/2020, 1941/2020, 414/2020, 416/2020, 352/2020 and any other complaint in the report marked "P7" to the Petition in respect of the Petitioner.

This Court issues a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Cabinet Decision dated 18th

January 2021 marked "P12" to the Petition in respect of the Petitioner in the Report marked "P7" to the Petition with reference to Complaint included in Section/chapter 8 (starting from page 17) of the said Commission Report and Complaint Nos 205/2020, 289/2020, 290/2020, 316/2020, 88/2020, 816/2020, 432/2020, 433/20, 50/2020, 1807/20, 1080/20, 1842/2020, 1941/2020, 414/2020, 416/2020, 352/2020 and any other complaint in the report marked "P7" to the Petition in respect of the Petitioner.

This Court issues a Writ of prohibition restraining the Respondents or any or more

of them from taking any steps in respect of the Petitioner based on the Report marked "P7" and/or the Cabinet Decision marked 'P12' to the Petition. Considering the circumstances, we make no order for cost.
