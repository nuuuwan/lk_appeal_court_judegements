JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (d) and 54(A) (b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for

Possession and Trafficking of 5.03 grams of Heroin (diacetylmorphine) on

12th December 2017.

After trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed life imprisonment on the both

counts on 09/03/2022.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid

19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

CA/HCC/84/22

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. Learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider that the

prosecutions version did not pass the test of probability.

2. That the prosecution failed to prove the inward journey.

3. Learned High Court Judge based his conclusion on speculations and

surmises.

4. Learned High Court Judge erred in law when concluding that the

prosecution proved the case beyond reasonable doubt rejecting the

defence case.

In this case, the raid was conducted in absence of any specific information

received. The raid was headed by PW1 with two police officers from the

Grandpass Police Station. All have been named as witnesses in the

indictment including the Government Analyst. The prosecution had called

PW1, PW2, PW4, and PW5 closed their case. The Government Analyst report

was admitted under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.

15 of 1979. The prosecution marked production P1-P10.

When the defence was called, the Appellant had given evidence from the

witness box and had called two witnesses and closed the defence case.

The prosecution had called a witness in rebuttal.

Background of the case

On 12/12/2017 SI/Niroshan attached to the Grandpass Police Station had

gone for a routine mobile patrolling with two police officers in a three-wheeler

belonging to a private person. The team had left the police station at about

11.00am. The witness and PW2 were in civil outfits while PW3 was clad in

No.02 police uniform. Along with the other items, they had taken sealing

instrument instruments with them. First, they had gone to Stacepura,

Nawagampura and Sadam Watta but the raid was not successful. The team

decided to go on foot patrol along Awwal Saviya Road at about 3.40pm after

parking the three-wheeler near Stacepura bridge. At the entrance of Awwal

CA/HCC/84/22

4 | P a g e

Saviya Road, the witness had spotted the Appellant who was coming from

the Awwal Saviya Road. According to PW1, as the Appellant crossed the other

side of the road after seeing the police officers, suspicious arose on the

Appellants behaviour. Hence, the Appellant was stopped for questioning and

search. At that time, the police PW1 had observed a pink coloured cellophane

bag with something in it in the right-side trouser pocket. PW1 took the parcel

into his custody and inspected the same. The parcel contained some brown

coloured substance. As it reacted for Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) the

Appellant was arrested immediately. He was arrested at 3.50 pm. The

Appellant was taken to the Letchumi Jewellers situated in Kosgas Junction

to weigh the substance by all three officers. The parcel contained 30400

milligrams of substances. After entering notes, the Appellant and the

productions were handed over to the Grandpass Police Station under PR

No.5040/2017.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden never

shifts. Hence an accused person has no burden to prove his case unless he

pleads a general or a special exception in the Penal Code.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

CA/HCC/84/22

In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states thus: [1987} 1 SLR 155

"The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence.

His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his

guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as it is required

in a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree

is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree

of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof

beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the

community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of

justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a

remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the

sentence, of course it is possible, but not in the least probable, the case

is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will

suffice.

As the appeal grounds raised by the Appellant are inter-related, the grounds

will be considered together in this case.

The test of probability holds a very important role when it comes to

convincing the judge on specific points as more the probability of the

assumption more will be chances for the judge to get convinced. Probability

is of utmost importance during criminal investigation and is used to assess

the significance of various types of evidence. To accuse someone beyond

reasonable doubt it becomes quintessential to have strong evidence and for

the sake of that one has to make few assumptions to reach certain

conclusions. The possibility of these assumptions to be true is specifically

know as principle of probability in legal terms.

In this case, only three police officers had conducted the raid. They had set

off from the police station without any specific information. After the arrest,

the Appellant was taken to a jewellery shop called Letchumi Jewellery and

weighed the substances which took exactly about one hour. The relevant

portion is re-produced below:

The gross quantity said to have recovered from the Appellant is 30400

milligrams. To weigh this meagre amount the time taken by the police officers

was one hour, which is highly improbable considering the circumstances of

the case.

CA/HCC/84/22

7 | P a g e

Further, the defence witness Veerasamy Prabash, who has been working in

the Letchumi Jewellers for about 23 years had failed to identify the

Appellant. This witness admitted that he comes to for work every day, but

couldnt identify the Appellant. The evidence given by this witness is very

vital as the police officers had taken one hour to weigh the substances at the

Letchumi which certainly is an unusual time duration.

The Learned High Court Judge in considering the probability test, convinced

that recovering heroin from the Appellant raised a doubt to some extent

Although he had come to this conclusion, he had failed to award the benefit

to the Appellant. The relevant portion of the Judgement is re-produced

below:

The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed by the

prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim

the benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side,

and a Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an

umpire to see that the rules of the game are applied by both sides.

A Judge is an administrator of justice, not merely a figure-head,

he has not only to direct and control the proceedings according to

recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done.

CA/HCC/84/22

8 | P a g e

In this case, even though the Learned High Court Judge doubted the

probability factors of the case, he had failed to award the benefit to the

Appellant.

The burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute.

It is often associated with the Latin maxim semper necessitas probandi

incumbit ei qui agit, a translation of which is: "the necessity of proof always

lies with the person who lays charges."

It is commonly acknowledged that shifting a legal onus onto the accused

with respect to an element of an offence that is essential to culpability is an

encroachment on the presumption of innocence, and more difficult to

justify. Shifting the burden of proof on such an issue involves the possibility

of unfair conviction.

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has argued before the

Supreme Court that a law that reverses the burden of proof on to an accused

person, thereby putting a legal burden on them to disprove an element of an

offence, interferes with their right to a fair trial as protected by the

Constitution.

Sinad Gibney, Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality

Commission stated:

Given its importance to the integrity of the justice system, a reversal of

the burden of proof, particularly in a criminal case where the accused

persons right to liberty is at stake, must always be subject to the

highest tests and exist within the parameters set by the Constitution.

Article 13(3) of our Constitution enshrines the concept of fair trial. The Article

states:

Any person charged with an offence shall be entitled to be heard, in

person or by an Attorney-at-Law, at a fair trial by a competent court.

CA/HCC/84/22

9 | P a g e

To determine whether you are innocent or guilty, the concept of fair trial

plays a vital role. The fair trial is an internationally recognised human right.

Fair trials help establish the truth and are vital for everyone involved in a

case. They are a cornerstone of democracy, helping to ensure fair and just

societies.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at page 23 ( page

285 of the brief) stated as follows:

This portion of the judgment clearly demonstrates that the Appellant had not

afforded a fair trial.

In Dyers v The Queen [2002] 210 CLR 285, the Court held that:

No comment should be made as to the failure of the defense to call a

witness who might have been able to assist the defense.If any

comment is to be given it is that the jury should not speculate about

what a witness not called might have said.

In this case, the raid was conducted without any specific information.

Further, recovery and weighing the production has failed to pass the

probability test in this case. Had the Learned Trial Judge looked in to the

CA/HCC/84/22

10 | P a g e

evidence presented in its correct perspective, he should have accepted the

evidence given by the Appellant.

Further, the Appellant had not been afforded a fair trial as guaranteed in the

Constitution.

Guided by the above cited judicial decisions, I conclude that the appeal

grounds advanced by the Appellant have very serious impact on the

prosecutions case.

As the prosecution had failed its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable

doubt, I set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo dated 09/03/2022 on the Appellant.

Therefore, he is acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
