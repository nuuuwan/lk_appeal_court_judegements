The Creditor- Respondent- Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) instituted

this action to obtain a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Debt Conciliation

Board (hereinafter referred to as the Board) dated 28.02.2023.

The facts relevant to this case are as follows,

According to the Petitioner he has bought the land in question by Deed of Transfer No.

2658 dated 08.08.2012 for a consideration of Rs 1,000,000/- from the Debtor- Respondent

Applicant (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent).

Thereafter, he transferred the property to one P. Siriyalatha by Deed of Transfer No. 492

dated 01.04.2013 for Rs 1,500,000/-.

According to the Petitioner, the Respondent made an application on 21.03.2013 to the

Board in terms of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance No. 39 of 1941 as amended (

hereinafter referred to as Ordinance) on the basis that, due to the financial difficulties

she has obtained a loan for a sum of Rs 1,000,000/- keeping the land in dispute as a

security. She has further stated that she has not transferred the beneficial interest of the

property in dispute to the Petitioner.

Although the present owner P. Siriyalatha was made a party to this action, she did not

participate during the Trial. After the evidence was led by both parties, the Board came

to a conclusion on 28.02.2023 that the particular deed was executed for the purpose of

obtaining a loan. The main ground urged by the Petitioner was that the said decision of

the Board is contrary to facts and law and the Board has not properly analyzed the

evidence placed before them.

According to section 21A of the said Ordinance, provides how the Board has to act with

regard to an application relating to a transfer or conditional transfer of an immovable

property.

For easy reference, I reproduce the section 21A of the said Act,

Section 21A- Matters to be considered in deciding whether or not a conditional transfer of

immovable property is in reality a mortgage.

Page 4 of 8

(1) In any Proceedings under the Ordinance in regard to an application relating to a

transfer or conditional transfer of immovable property, the Bond shall,

notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance, or sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Ordinance and for the purpose

of deciding whether or not such transfer or conditional transfer is in reality a

mortgage, take into consideration all the circumstances of the case and in

particular the following matters

(a) The language of the notarial instrument of transfer and where provision in

regard to the right of the transferor or any other person to redeem or purchase

the property transferred is contained in any other notarial instrument.

(b) Any difference between the sum received by the transferor from the transferee

and the value of the property transferred;

(c) The continuance of the transferors possession of the property transferred and

(d) The existence of any agreement in whatever form between the transferor and

the transferee interest, or any sum which may reasonably be considered to be

interest, on the sum received by the transferor from the transferee

(e) The burden of adducing evidence to show that a transfer of immovable property

is in reality a mortgage shall be on the transferor.

The Board has to consider the above matters when they arrive at the decision.

Now we have to consider whether the Respondent has led evidence to satisfy that this is

a conditional transfer. According to the Respondent she has established the fact that she

needed the money to pay back the loan which was owed to some persons named Sarath

and Siriwardhena.

After the said transaction she had advertised in the paper to sell the land on 26.09.2012.

Further, she has registered a caveat at the land registry. During the trial, she established

the fact that, through the valuer, the amount of the money paid to the creditor

(Rs. 1, 000,000) was less than 1/3rd of the value of the property. Accordingly, the Board

Page 5 of 8

has satisfied and made a decision and gave reasons for that, I will reproduce the exact

words used by the Board as follows,

We hold that, the Board has acted within the scope of Section 21(a) of the said Ordinance.

Furthermore, they have analyzed the evidence correctly. In addition to that, our courts

have accepted the same principle when they consider section 83 of the Trust Ordinance.

Constructive Trust

Section 83. Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and it cannot

reasonably be inferred consistently with the attendant circumstances that he intended to

dispose of the beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee must hold such

property for the benefit of the owner or his legal representative.

In a case under Section 83 of the trust Ordinance in order to prove that he did not intend

to dispose of the beneficial interest in the property, our Courts expect evidence that

relating to attendant circumstances, the Vendor did not intend to transfer the beneficial

interest. That is to say, parole evidence to prove a constructive trust and that the

transferor did not intend to pass the beneficial interest in the property.

In Dayawathi and Others vs. Gunaskera and Another [1991] 1 SLR 115, Justice

Dheeraratne held that,

(2) The original plaintiff ( transferor) continuing to remain in possession and enjoying

the property.

(4) The gross disparity between the consideration on the face of the deed ( Rs. 17,000) and

the market value of the property ( Rs 70,000- 80,000)

In Panambarage Jude Fernando v. Hetti Thanthrige Anesta Malani and Another, SC

Appeal No. 175/2010, Decided on 17.01.2017, Sisira J. De Abrew, J held that;

2) The 1st defendant continued to occupy the property in suit after the execution of Deed

No. 626 dated 10010.1995.

..

5) The plaintiff-appellant admitted in evidence that the value of the property in suit in

January 1995 was Rs. 340,000/-. Valuation report submitted by Joseph indicates that the

value of the property in March 1996 was Rs. 750,000/- (vide Josephs evidence at pages

191-197). The consideration of the Deed No. 626 dated 10.10.1995 was only Rs. 50,000/-.

.

Further held that,

When I Consider the entire evidence led at the trial and submissions of both parties, I am

of the opinion that the 1st defendant by Deed No. 18580 and/or Deed No. 626 have not

transferred the beneficial interest of the property in suit to the plaintiff-appellant and

that the plaintiff-appellant is holding the property in suit on a constructive trust on behalf

of the 1st defendant.

We are mindful that the Petitioner himself admitted the fact that, until he sold the

property to P. Siriyalatha, the possession was with the Respondent. Further, he admitted

the fact that he sold the property for Rs 1,500.000/-, where he bought it for Rs 1,000,000/-

.On the other hand, Respondent has established through the valuation report that, the

value of the property was Rs 3,000,000/- at the time of the transaction.

In view of the above evidence, We hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish that the

Board has failed to act judicially or that the order made by the Board to quash is ultra-

vires. Further, we hold that, when they decide that the particular deed is a conditional

Page 8 of 8

transfer they have analyzed all the evidence placed before them and have come to the

conclusion correctly.

For the aforesaid reasons, we dismiss the action with costs.
