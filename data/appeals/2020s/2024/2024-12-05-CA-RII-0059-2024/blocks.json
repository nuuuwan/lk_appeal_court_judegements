Thereafter, the respondent made an application before The Civil Appeal High Court of Kalutara. The Civil Appellate High Court held that the petitioner had no right of appeal against the decree absolute made by the District Court. Counsel for the respondent pointed out that the petition of appeal was filed long after the expiry of 60 days. Prima facie, there is nothing wrong with the order of the Civil Appeal High Court. The petitioner filed this application before this Court seeking to set aside the order of the District Court dated 07-03-2023 and the order of the Civil Appellate High Court dated 10-10-2023. He further sought an extension of six months time so that he could settle the amount due as per the settlement. However, the repayment time was extended until 11-01-2021 by the Debt Conciliation Board. This application was made to this Court by the petitioner after more than 3 years on 06-05-2024. The petitioner has not explained this delay in his petition. We have considered the documents filed by the petitioner and the submissions made by counsel for the petitioner. The petitioner has failed to demonstrate that his substantial rights were prejudiced or occasioned a failure of justice by the impugned orders. In the circumstances, we refuse to issue notice on the respondents. The application is dismissed.",
