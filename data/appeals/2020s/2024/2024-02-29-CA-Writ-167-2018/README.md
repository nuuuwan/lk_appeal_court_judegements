1. It is respectfully submitted that the Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of

Your Lordships' Court under Article 140 of the Constitution seeking,

a. a writ of mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent -Divisional Secretary,

of Weligapola Divisional Secretariat to act in terms of Land Ministry

Circular No. 10 of 15.06.1995 (marked P2) and to grant a permit and

legalize the Petitioner's ad hoc and or unauthorized occupation and

possession of State land depicted as lot Nos. 180 and 181 in Cadastral

Map No. 620237 (marked P6):

and

b. a writ of Certiorari quashing any permit or other written authority given

to the 2nd Respondent or to any other person in respect of the said State

lands depicted as lot Nos. 180 and or 181 in Cadastral Map No. 620237

(P6).

The petitioner also submits that

Whereas, the 2nd Respondent named in the Petition as K.D. Kusumawathi

filed proxy by the name Kadawathage Kusumawathi and was represented

in Court on 31.10.2018 (vide proxy dated 31.10.2018). Thereafter her

proxy had been revoked. Thereafter with permission of Court by motion

dated 23.01.2020 the caption was amended to read as Kadawathage

Kusumawathi and Notice was re-issued repeatedly on the 2nd Respondent

and finally in or about June 2020 Notice was served on the 2nd Respondent

through the Fiscal of the Embilipitiya District Court (vide Fiscals Report),

nevertheless the 2nd Respondent was absent and unrepresented, as such

Court proceeded to fix the case for Argument, apparently ex parte against

the 2nd Respondent.

The position of the petitioner is that

4 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

i. Since about 1980 the Petitioner was in ad hoc or unauthorized

occupation and possession of approximately 95 perches of State land

identified as an undivided portion of a larger land marked 'Block A' in lot

No. 123 in Final Village Plan (FVP) No. 679 of the land called "Ranwala

Henyaya Karandolahena" - [vide Plan P3 FVP 679 for lot 123 and vide

Advance Tracing 1R9 demarcating "lot A" within "lot 123"];

ii. the Petitioner had cultivated a tea plantation with some coconut trees

on the said land [vide schedule in FVP 679 lot 123 is "Chena" cultivation]

iii. the Petitioner married Ganithage Premadasa in 1984 and the Petitioner

and her said husband continued to possess and cultivate on the said land;

iv. between May and August 2010 the entire "Ranwala Henyaya

Karandolahena" including lot 123 in FVP No. 679 was surveyed by the

Surveyor General, and the Petitioner and her husband pointed out the

boundaries of the land occupied by them as done by the rest of the villagers

accordingly boundary stones were placed demarcating Block A the part

of land actually possessed by the petitioner.

V. Villagers who were in similar possession of State land had been granted

Permits and or Grants and their ad hoc possession was legalized in terms

of Land Ministry Circular No. 10 of 15.06.1995 (P2);

vi. as such the Petitioner too was legitimately entitled for a Permit or any

other State Document to regularize and legalize the land possessed and

cultivated by her;

vii. although the Petitioner was summoned from time to time for land

kacheri meetings she was never granted a Permit;

5 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

viii. at one such land kacheri held in 2017 it had transpired that the

Petitioner's land marked 'Block A' had been divided in to two lots during

the said Survey that was carried out in 2010;

ix. after much endeavor the Petitioner obtained a certified copy of Surveyor

General's Cadastral Map No.620237 and only then the Petitioner became

aware that the single plot of land that was possessed and cultivated by the

Petitioner namely 'Block A' in FVP NO.679 had been divided in to two lots

bearing lot Nos.180 and 181;

x. since the 1st Respondent Divisional Secretary failed to consider the

Petitioner's requests and appeals, the Petitioner preferred an appeal to the

Prime Minister [the present Executive President] on 30.07.2017 when he

visited the Godakawela Divisional Secretariat;

xi. in response thereto the Divisional Secretary replied that a permit

cannot be granted for lot No. 180 and closed the appeal file- vide P7d, but

had tacitly admitted therein that the Petitioner is in possession of lot 181;

xii. the Divisional Secretary had denied and ignored the Petitioner's

request for a permit with malicious intent furthering to hand over

possession thereof to some prominent private individuals in the area who

had never possessed or cultivated the land;

xiii. attempts were made by such third parties and by the Divisional

Secretary to eject the Petitioner and her husband by way of a section 66

application, but the Embilipitiya Magistrate's Court handed over

possession to the Petitioner and two other application made under the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act were also dismissed - vide P8a,

P9a, P9c, P10a, CA4b;

xiv. a Magisterial action of Criminal Trespass against the Petitioner's

husband was also dismissed;

xv. whereupon the Petitioner continued to peacefully possess the land;

6 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

xvi. in 2009 private individuals interested in the land sought to forcibly

eject the Petitioner and her husband, resulting in the Magistrate's court

handed over possession to the Petitioner's husband- vide P10a;

xvii. soon after the learned Magistrate's Order on 29-09-2009, the

Divisional Secretary acting in collusion issued a Quit Notice dated 24-12-

2009 and went before the Magistrates Court which application too was

dismissed vide., P.11a and CA4b

xviii. thereafter the Petitioner and her husband continued to peacefully

possess the land until in August 2017 the 2nd Respondent (a private

person) forcibly entered the land, bulldozed and cleared part of the tea

plantation within hours, at the police inquiry the 2nd Respondent was

unable to produce any written authority as such the 2nd Respondent was

warned by the police not to disturb the peaceful possession of the

petitioner - vide P13a;

xix. thereafter in November 2017 once again the 2nd Respondent forcibly

entered the cleared portion of land and commenced construction, at the

police inquiry very much surprisingly this time the 2nd Respondent was in

possession of a letter issued by the 1st Respondent Divisional Secretary

granting lot 180 to the 2nd Respondent- vide letter 1 R3 dated 08.11.2017;

xx. as such the police directed the Petitioner to resolve the issue with the

Divisional Secretary;

xxi. the Divisional Secretary's action to issue a letter to the 2nd Respondent

to possess a portion of the land is collusive, illegal and ultra vires;

xxii. the Petitioner had been deprived of her legitimate expectation of a

permit or a Grant as it is promised in terms of Land Ministry Circular

No.10 of 1995.

7 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

xxiii. As such the Petitioner preferred this application by petition dated

25.04.2018 and Your Lordships' Court was inclined to issue Notice on the

Respondent.

The position of the 01st respondent, the Divisional Secretary represented by

learned Senior State Counsel is that the petitioner was never in possession of

the land in question and if at all the petitioners husband was in unauthorized

occupation.

Then several decided cases have been cited on alleged delay.

In the earlier written submissions tendered for the 01st respondent dated

21.10.2020, the position of the 01st respondent was stated as follows,

1st Respondent has taken up the position consistently, throughout the

history that the in issue are State Lands and one Ganithage Premadasa

(the husband of the Petitioner) was in unlawful occupation in the said

lands. Therefore, steps have been taken by the Respondent to evict him

under State Land (Recovery of possession) Act No 07 of 1979 in No 867,

7839 and 3333/10 in which the applications were dismissed due to

technical errors in the application and the quit notice[ p9(b) and p9(c), CA

4(b)]. However, it is pertinent to note that the issue of prescription will not

apply for applications under State Land Recovery of possession act as long

as the unlawful occupants are continuing in unlawful occupation. The

Petitioner nor her husband cannot claim any entitlement to State Land

over prescription as per the law.

It is pertinent to know that issuance of a permit to a state land is done

after a selection procedure in a 'land Kachcheri' as per Section 20 of the

Land Development Ordinance. The procedural requirement of holding a

'land Kachcheri is set out from Section 21 ,24 of the Land Development

Ordinance and regulation 83 to 108 of the land Regulations in the Land

Manual. It is imperative to posses a permit, Grant or a written authority

8 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

issued by the competent Authority to lawfully possess a State Land in

terms of the developments under State Lands Recovery of Possession Act.

However, there has been a regularization procedure initiated by the State

as a part of State policy in order to achieve certain objectives like

development purposes, giving land rights to landless citizens etc., This

procedure of regularization of unlawful occupants are set out by Circulars

issued by the Commissioner General of Lands and the Ministry of Lands.

The procedure in existence now is set out in Circular No 2008/4 (annexure

l1). Accordingly, only ELIGIBLE Persons under the Procedure governing

the Circular could be regularized. It is noteworthy to mention that only

persons who do not have any land to reside is among one requirement to

be satisfied in order to gain eligibility under this scheme. The Petitioner

has been given a land grant in the same village under Section 19(4) of the

Land Development Ordinance|IR2(a) and 1R 2(b)11, The Petitioners'

husband has been [given] a separate grant lRI(A) and 1R(b). The Petitioner

has totally suppresses the said facts from Your Lordships Court and

therefore is not eligible to invoke a discretionary remedy from this court.

In the recent written submissions dated 22.02.2024 the petitioner submits that

It is respectfully submitted that although in the statement of objections

the Divisional Secretary claims that the Petitioner had already been

granted permit marked 1R2A for another block of land as such is not

entitled for a second Grant, the said contention was not taken up for

consideration by the counsel for the 1st Respondent at the argument.

It is respectfully submitted that the land identified in 1R2A is not

possessed by the Petitioner in fact it is a land possessed by another

villager, this fact has been pleaded in paragraph 25 of the Petition, that a

mere paper grant has been purportedly made to the Petitioner in order to

circumvent and deprive the Petitioner of her lawful entitlement for permit

to the land she actually possessed.

9 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

It is respectfully submitted that in any event the purported permit 1R2A

bears Permit No. 16282 whereas it differs in the corresponding Land

Ledger marked 1R2B wherein the Permit Number is stated as No.393, as

such it is respectfully submitted that Your Lordships' Court cannot place

any credibility and evidential value in the purported Permit marked 1R2A.

It is respectfully submitted that it is pertinent to note that in none

of the previous letters or correspondence has the Divisional Secretary

ever taken up the position that the Petitioner was previously granted

a permit and therefore not entitled to a second permit, specifically in

P7d dated 28.06.2017. [Emphasis added in this judgment]

It is respectfully submitted that notwithstanding that the Petitioner had

specifically pleaded in her petition that she is not possessing the land

described in the purported permit 1R2A the Divisional Secretary has failed

to submit any investigation report from the relevant Grama Niladhari as

to the correctness of the possession and cultivation of the land described

in 1R2A.

It is further submitted that there is no proof to show that the Petitioner

had formally signed and accepted permit 1R2A.

As such it is respectfully submitted that the contention of the Divisional

Secretary that a plot of land has already been granted to the Petitioner by

1R2A is unfounded and such contention warrants to be rejected.

It is respectfully submitted that it is not open for the Divisional Secretary

to allege one reason in the correspondence with the Petitioner and rely on

another reason in Court, this ratio decidendai or principle of law was up

held by the Supreme Court in Kamalawathie and Others vs. The Provincial

Public Service commission (2001) 1 SLR 2 . [corrected up to here]

However in the Synopsis of oral submissions filed for the 01st respondent dated

05.04.2024 the position that 1R2A and 1R2B have been issued to petitioners

10 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

husband and hence the petitioner is not entitled to any more state land has been

raised.

Why the 01st respondents position cannot be accepted:

There are three reasons as to why the position of the 01st respondent, that, the

petitioner and or her husband has been given the above grants cannot be

accepted. They are,

(i) The petitioner submits that the land identified in 1R2A is not possessed

by the Petitioner in fact it is a land possessed by another villager and that

this fact has been pleaded in paragraph 25 of the Petition and that a mere

paper grant has been purportedly made to the Petitioner in order to

circumvent and deprive the Petitioner of her lawful entitlement for a

permit to the land she actually possesses.

The petitioner has stated in her petition dated 26.04.2018 that

25. The Petitioner states that in order to circumvent and deprive her of

a permit in respect of the land actually possessed by her the Divisional

Secretary has issued a permit to the petitioner in respect of an allotment

of land that she never possessed, which is in fact possessed and cultivated

by one K.K.Gayan Weerasinghe.

Annexed hereto marked P16 is an Affidavit of the said K.K. Gayan

Weerasinghe and is pleaded as part and parcel hereof.

The response of the 01st respondent in the statement of objections dated

07.01.2019 is as follows,

2 Answering the averments contained in paragraph 25 of the said

petition, the respondent only admits that a Grant had been issued in the

name of the Petitioner (1R2-A) as already averred hereinbefore but denies

any knowledge of the document marked as P-16, which in event, is not a

valid document in law.

11 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

(ii) The petitioner has stated that,

It is respectfully submitted that it is pertinent to note that in none of the

previous letters or correspondence has the Divisional Secretary ever

taken up the position that the Petitioner was previously granted a permit

and therefore not entitled to a second permit, specifically in P7d dated

28.06.2017.

1R2A is dated 28.09.1996. The copy submitted for the 01st respondent itself is a

photocopy which has a seal and signature, but the contents especially as to the

description of the land is almost illegible. Actually cannot be read.

Now P.07D which the petitioner mentions is dated 28.06.2017. It is a letter

addressed on behalf of the 01st respondent to the petitioner. It says lot 180

cannot be given to her. It is 22.4 perches. The reason is that she has attempted

from time to time to clear the adjoining land. It says as per circular dated

15.06.1995 state land cannot be encroached upon. It says in one court case she

was asked not to enter into that land.

But it does not mention that the land cannot be given to her due to 1R2A or any

such state land already granted to her or her husband.

The first thing, in 2017, that must show the 01st respondent, when he starts

writing P.07D is that a state grant has been given in 1996.

01st respondents position is that as 1R2A and 1R2B have been issued to

petitioners husband the petitioner is not entitled to any more state land. This is

not stated in P.07D or in any other correspondence between the petitioner and

the 01st respondent.

This, coupled with what the petitioner stated in paragraph 25 of the petition in

April 2018 shows that the position of the 01st respondent in regard to the state

grant cannot be accepted.

12 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

(iii) As per Kamalawathie and Others vs. The Provincial Public Service

commission (2001) 1 SLR 2, the Supreme Court said,

.It is not open to the respondents to allege one reason in the transfer

letters and to rely upon another when they come to court. Apart from

anything else that would be stultifying the appeal procedure.

Although appeal procedure was referred to, that was a fundamental rights

application. The same principle will apply to a writ application as in this case.

With respect, the above principle is not limited to appeal procedure. In Chapter

XIX of the Civil Procedure Code of 1889 (the rules embodied in which are having

an even older origin) it is said in explanation 02 in section 150, that,

The case enunciated must reasonably accord with the party's pleading,

i.e., plaint or answer, as the case may be. And no party can be allowed to

make at the trial a case materially different from that which he has placed

on record, and which his opponent is prepared to meet. And the facts

proposed to be established must in the whole amount to so much of the

material part of his case as is not admitted in his opponent's pleadings.

In addition to (i) (ii) and (iii) the petitioner says, that, the purported grant 1R2A

bears permit No. 16282 which differs with that in the corresponding land ledger

marked 1R2B, which says, permit number is 393.

The petitioner raises two more valid points. They are,

(i) P.07D in 2017 expressly admits, that, the petitioner is in possession of

the adjoining land to lot 180; what adjoins 180 is 181

(ii) The 01st respondent admits in paragraph 5(iv) of the statement of

objections, that, circular No. 10 of 1995 applies to unauthorized

occupation prior to 1995; the schedule to the cadastral map P.06 dated

13 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

August 2010 shows in lots 180 and 181 a 15-20 year old tea cultivation

and petitioners husband has been identified as unauthorized cultivator

Paragraph 5(iv) of 01st respondents statement of objections say

The 1st respondent states further that Ministry of Lands circular 10

dated 15.06.1995 was applicable to state lands where unauthorized

occupation was prior to the year 1995.

It is a truth, that, ownership is a fiction and possession is real. Ownership means

a pact with every other person in society and state that they will agree not to

claim ownership to that property subject to a decision of a Superior Court.

In reality, land belongs to the community. The Genevan philosopher Jean-

Jacques Rousseau said,

The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself

of saying This is mine, and found people simple enough to believe him,

was the real founder of civil society. From how many crimes, wars and

murders, from how many horrors and misfortunes might not any one

have saved mankind, by pulling up the stakes, or filling up the ditch,

and crying to his fellows, "Beware of listening to this impostor; you

are undone if you once forget that the fruits of the earth belong to us

all, and the earth itself to nobody1.

Actually, the present anthropologists, biologists and historians have found2,

that, it is the commonly shared beliefs, such as religion, that made large

numbers of people get together to corporate to build monuments, which required

mass scale food production and hence the concept of ownership of land, this is

mine, arose. What Rousseau said in the second sentence takes place, without

abeyance, even now.

According to Claude-Frdric Bastiat (30 June 1801 24 December 1850), the

French economist, writer and a prominent member of the French Liberal School,

who published his work The Law3 in 1850, there are only two ways of creating

wealth, one is to work, especially the work of the agriculturalist and the other is

to plunder4.

It is said in an article published on Lankaweb on 18th April 2016, that,

British injustice in the enactment of waste land laws

Kandyan peasants were made landless. They were reduced to a landless

state by the take over of their lands for the plantation industry (initially

coffee, then tea) by the British colonial government under a series of waste

land laws commencing with the Crown Lands (Encroachments) Ordinance,

No. 12 of 1840 which stipulated that all forest, waste, unoccupied or

uncultivated land was to be presumed to be the property of the Crown

until the contrary is proved. By this one stroke of legislation, bread was

taken out of the poor cultivators mouth and enormous hardship imposed

on the Kandyan peasantry.

Lack of educational facilities in the Kandyan areas also contributed to the

creation of a large functionally illiterate adult population. The Report of

the Kandyan Peasantry Commission (1951) highlighted a peasants

response to this issue as follows No land, no money; no money, no

education; no education, no jobs; no jobs, no money for education or

for the purchase of cultivable land5.

3 The Law (Dean Russell Translation, The Foundation for Economic Education, Tnc., 1950). The original book was published in 1850. 4 Bastiat believes that there are only two ways of acquiring wealth, either by production or by plunder. The history of the world is a history of how one group of people have plundered others, often in a systematic way, by means of war, slavery, theocracy, monopoly, economic privileges, and control of the government to distribute favors. 5 British Crimes in the enactment and implementation of waste lands laws during colonial rule in Sri Lanka (1796 1948) Posted on April 18th, 2016 by Senaka Weeraratna Attorney at Law https://www.lankaweb.com/news/items/2016/04/18/british-crimes-in-the-enactment-and-implementation-of-waste-lands-laws-during-colonial-rule-in-sri-lanka-1796-1948/

15 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

But, if not for coffee, tea or any other cultivation, the land in the ownership of

the state does not produce wealth. It lies barren. The subsequent legislation such

as Land Development Ordinance of 1935 having recognized this truth introduced

provisions to grant temporary permits to unauthorized users. Under the

Ordinance there is an excellent scheme to encourage such users to cultivate and

to make land productive of wealth which culminates in the Crown grant.

P.02, the circular dated 15.06.1995 regularizes unauthorized occupation prior

to 15.06.1995, which is an arbitrarily set and hence unreasonably decided date.

But that is not the question in this case. The petitioner has established that she

has been cultivating since 1980s. If she is not granted the permit under the law,

then, that inaction could be remedied by mandamus issued by this Court.

Wade & Forsyth, 12th Edition says at page 498,

DUTY TO EXERCISE JURISDICTION

A court or tribunal has a public duty to hear and decide any case within

its jurisdiction which is properly brought before it. A mandatory order is

frequently granted to enforce this duty on the part of inferior courts and

statutory tribunals which are ordered to hear and determine according to

law. Thus magistrates, licensing justices, county courts, statutory

tribunals, ministers, officials, university visitors, and other jurisdictions

subject to the High Court can be prevented from refusing jurisdiction

wrongfully. In R v. Briant, a county court judge, who mistakenly declined

to hear an action for possession by mortgagees on the ground that the

county court had no jurisdiction, was ordered to hear and determine the

case on a mandatory order from (what was then) the Queen's Bench

Division." The same happened when a county court judge refused to

investigate the correctness of jurisdictional facts upon which the validity

of a rent tribunal's decision depended and which were properly disputed

before him. Finally, a mandatory order was issued when a minister

declined to decide an appeal about public rights of way. Refusal to receive

16 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

evidence on some relevant point may also amount to refusal of jurisdiction.

In these cases, a mandatory order can be issued to compel a magistrate to

receive it. This situation, however, has to be distinguished from a decision

by the magistrate, within the scope of their discretion, that the evidence is

irrelevant.

Furthermore, refusal to consider a party's case has to be distinguished

from refusal to accept the party's argument. As Lord Goddard CJ said:

to allow an order of mandamus to go there must be a refusal to

exercise the jurisdiction. The line may be a very fine one between

a wrong decision and a declining to exercise jurisdiction; that

is to say, between finding that a litigant has not made out a

case, and refusing to consider whether there is a case.

If the inferior court or tribunal merely makes a wrong decision within its

jurisdiction, as opposed to refusing to exercise it, a mandatory order

cannot be employed to make it change its conclusion. This is merely the

familiar rule that the court cannot interfere with action which is intra

vires. An instance where a mandatory order was issued to a statutory

tribunal was when a housing appeal tribunal dismissed an appeal by a

company wishing to build a picture house without giving them a hearing

as required by law. This was a breach of an implied statutory duty.

Therefore, the decision was quashed by a quashing order and a mandatory

order issued to require the tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction properly.

The same remedies were also granted in a case where an immigration

tribunal wrongly refused leave to appeal.

The basis of all such cases is that the court or tribunal has a legal duty to

hear and determine the case which is correlative to a statutory right of

some person to apply or appeal to it. However, nowadays that the courts

grant a quashing order to quash decisions of non-statutory bodies (which

can have no statutory duties), it seems that they would also grant a

17 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

mandatory order to require the body to hear and determine--though it may

be difficult to add the usual words 'according to law. Since this anomalous

jurisdiction has already been established, it is only logical to extend it to

a mandatory order, completing thus the system of judicial review.

A mandatory order has also been granted anomalously to enforce what the

court called 'a rule of practice'. In R v. Derby Justices, magistrates had

refused to authorize legal aid by counsel to a man charged with murder.

Although the statute gave them discretion as to the type of aid to be

granted, it was held that there was a practice of allowing counsel in trials

for murder and that that practice was obligatory. The court

thus treated the magistrates' refusal as unreasonable. Effectively, it viewed

that there is an implied duty in the statute, which meant that quashing

and mandatory orders could be used as remedies.

The instance where there is a duty to hear and determine, but discretion

as to the correct determination, must be distinguished from the instance

where there is a discretion not to act in the matter at all. The Parliamentary

Commissioner for Administration, who 'may investigate' complaints of

maladministration and has discretion on whether to initiate an

investigation, cannot, therefore, be ordered by a mandatory order to

entertain a complaint since this is a matter of discretion and not of duty.

In reading the above passages from Wade & Forsyth, one has to appreciate, that,

the failure to exercise jurisdiction could either manifest as an express refusal or

it will materialize as inaction.

The present case is one of the latter kinds. And hence mandamus must issue.

Furthermore, today the situation is different to than when it was decided in Rex

vs. London Justices [1895] 1 Q. B. 616 where it was said that

18 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

If the inferior court or tribunal merely makes a wrong decision within its

jurisdiction as opposed to refusing to exercise it, a mandatory order cannot

be employed to make it changes its conclusion.

The ground of proportionality is acting as a fine tuning of ultra vires.

Lord Steyn in Regina (Daly) vs. Secretary for State for Home Department [2001]

2 A. C. 532 said,

Clearly, these criteria [which were formulated by Lord Clyde in the Privy

Council in de Freitas vs. Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture,

Fisheries, Lands and Housing, [1999] 1 A. C. 69 and referred to above] are

more precise and more sophisticated than the traditional grounds of

review. What is the difference for the disposal of concrete cases? Academic

public lawyers have in remarkably similar terms elucidated the difference

between the traditional grounds of review and the proportionality

approach: see Professor Jeffrey Jowell Q.C., Beyond the Rule of Law:

Towards Constitutional Judicial Review [2000] Pl 671; Professor Paul

Craig, Administrative Law, 4th edition (1999) pages 561 563; Professor

David Feldman, Proportionality and the Human Rights Act 1998, essay

in The Principle of Proportionality in the Laws of Europe edited by Evelyn

Ellis (1999) pages 117, 127 et seq. The starting point is that there is an

overlap between the traditional grounds of review and the approach of

proportionality. Most cases would be decided in the same way whichever

approach is adopted. But the intensity of review is somewhat greater under

the proportionality approach. Making due allowance for important

structural differences between various convention rights, which I do not

propose to discuss, a few generalisations are perhaps permissible. I would

mention three concrete differences without suggesting that my statement

is exhaustive. First, the doctrine of proportionality may require the

reviewing court to assess the balance which the decision maker has

struck, not merely whether it is within the range of rational or reasonable

19 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

decisions. Secondly, the proportionality test may go further than the

traditional grounds of review inasmuch as it may require attention to be

directed to the relative weight accorded to interests and considerations.

Thirdly, even the heightened scrutiny test developed in R v Ministry of

Defence, Ex p Smith [1996] QB 517, 554 is not necessarily appropriate to

the protection of human rights.

In as much as, there is no unfettered discretion to act, there is no

unfettered discretion not to act, when the law requires meaningful action

to be taken.

An English case, which set a milestone in respect of what was referred to as

unfettered discretion is Padfield and others vs. The Minister of Agriculture,

Fisheries and Food, [1968] A. C. 997. In short, the dispute was in respect of the

request of South Eastern dairy farmers that the existing differential was too

low. That was an additional payment made to balance the cost incurred by dairy

farmers in two different areas, especially in transport. They complained to the

Milk Marketing Board and as they could not persuade that, to the minister. The

latter refused to refer the complaint to the committee. This was the grievance of

the dairy farmers when they came to the Divisional Court of the Queens Bench

Division, which held with them. The minister appealed. In the Court of Appeal,

the dairy farmers lost. They had only the support of Lord Denning M. R. in a

minority. The dairy farmers appealed. They won in the House of Lords.

Lord Upjohn referred to the letter in which the Minister used the word

unfettered [to deny which Padfields case is often cited] and said,

I will turn to his second letter, that of 03rd May 1965, which so far as

relevant was in these terms:

You will appreciate that under the Agricultural Marketing Act,

1958, the Minister has unfettered discretion to decide whether or

20 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

not to refer a particular complaint to the committee of

investigation (page 1060)

Lord Upjohn added,

My Lords, I believe that the introduction of the adjective unfettered

and its reliance thereon as an answer to the appellants claim is one of the

fundamental matters confounding the Ministers attitude, bona fide

though it be. First, the adjective nowhere appears in section 19, it is an

unauthorized gloss by the Minister. Secondly, even if the section did

contain that adjective I doubt if it would make any difference in law to his

powers, save to emphasise what he has already, namely that acting

lawfully he has a power of decision which cannot be controlled by the

courts, it is unfettered. But the use of that adjective, even in an act of

Parliament, can do nothing to unfetter the control which the judiciary have

over the executive, namely that in exercising their powers the latter must

act lawfully and that is a matter to be determined by looking at the Act

and its scope and object in conferring a discretion upon the Minister rather

than by the use of adjectives. (page 1060)

About Padfields case, De Smiths Judicial Review, 07th Edition at page 249

250 says,

The decision in 1968 of the House of Lords in Padfield was an important

landmark. The minister had refused to appoint a committee, as he was

statutorily empowered to do at his discretion, to investigate complaints

made by members of the Milk Marketing Board that the majority of the

Board had fixed milk prices in a way that was unduly unfavourable to the

complainants. The House of Lords held that the minister's discretion was

not unfettered and that the reasons that he had given for his refusal

showed that he had acted ultra vires by taking into account factors that

were legally irrelevant and by using his power in a way calculated to

frustrate the policy of the Act. The view was also expressed by four of their

21 | C . A . W r i t 1 6 7 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Lordships that even had the minister given no reasons for his decision, the

court would not have been powerless to intervene: for once a prima facie

case of misuse of power had been established, it would have been open to

the court to infer that the minister had acted unlawfully if he had declined

to supply any justification at all for his decision. In the years that followed

the Court of Appeal [Congreve vs. Home Office [1976] Q. B. 629; Laker

Airways Ltd., vs. Department of Trade [1977] Q. B. 643 etc.,] and the

House of Lords [Daymond vs. Plymouth CC [1976] A. C. 609; Secretary of

State for Education and Science vs. Tameside MBC [1977] A. C. 1014] set

aside as ultra vires the exercise of discretion that included a substantial

subjective element. It is interesting to note that important as the decision

in Padfield has been in the evolution of judicial attitudes, the minister was

ultimately able to uphold the Boards decision without resorting to

legislation. Another feature of those decisions was the willingness of the

courts to assert their power to scrutinize the factual basis upon which

discretionary powers have been exercised. Nonetheless, at least in the

absence of special circumstances and subject to the general point in

Padfield, it is inappropriate for the court to treat a statutorily conferred

discretion with no express limitations or fetters, as being somehow

implicitly limited or fettered [Regina (on the application of Rudewicz) vs.

Secretary of State for Justice [2012] EWCA Civ. 499; [2012] 3 W. L. R. 901]

Hence the failure to exercise discretion in petitioners favour which amounts to

inaction is ultra vires as well as disproportionate.

In as much as, there is no unfettered discretion

(i) To act [Laker Airways Ltd., vs. Department of Trade [1977] Q. B. 643 etc.,]

(ii) To refuse to act [Padfield and others vs. The Minister of Agriculture,

Fisheries and Food, [1968] A. C. 997]

there is no unfettered authority

(iii) To remain in inaction when meaningful action is required [This case]

In Laker Airways Ltd., vs. Department of Trade [1977] Q. B. 643

the Minister exercised his statutory discretion to give directions with

regard to civil airways with the ulterior motive of making it impossible for

one of the airlines to pursue a course of which the Minister disapproved.

In these cases judicial review was granted because the Ministers acted

unfairly when they abused their powers by exercising or declining to

exercise those powers in order to achieve objectives which were not the

objectives for which the powers had been conferred

[Lord Templeman at page 850 851 in Regina vs. Inland Revenue

Commissioners, ex parte Preston [1985] A. C. 835]

Hence this Court issues

(i) A writ of mandamus as per paragraph (c)

(ii) A writ of certiorari as per paragraph (d)

(iii) A writ of mandamus as per paragraph (e)

of the prayer to petition.

The petitioner is entitled to the costs of this application.
