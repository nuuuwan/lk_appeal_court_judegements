P13(g) to the Petition;

The facts of this case are briefly as follows:

The Petitioner, a duly incorporated company under the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 is

engaged in the manufacture of various motor yachts for export and domestic use as the

Sri Lankan extension of the Norwegian Sport Boat manufacturer of Viksund Group and

has its factory in Negombo.

The Petitioner states that, in or about April 2019, the founding company in Norway sub-

contracted two urgent orders to the Petitioner for the manufacture of fishing boats by two

separate purchases. According to the Petitioner, for the same purpose, two Letters of

Credit marked as P4 (a) and P4 (b) were opened by the said purchasers for a period of 6

months through their respective issuing banks in Norway and the corresponding Sri

Lankan bank was Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC. The Petitioner states that, the

Petitioner spent about Norwegian Kroner 2,500,000/- in the construction of moulds to

facilitate the manufacture of the said orders. The Petitioner further states that, however,

the 1st Respondent Bank, incorporated under the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance No. 53 of 1938

(as amended) approached the Petitioner and convinced the Petitioner to transfer the said

Letters of Credit to the 1st Respondent Bank under the assurance that the Bank would

readily provide added credit facilities in the furtherance of the transaction between the

Page 4 of 10

Petitioner and the Norwegian customers. Subsequently, based on the reliance of the

assurance given by the 1st Respondent Bank, the Petitioner considered the 1st Respondent

as the corresponding Sri Lankan Bank for the said transactions.

The Petitioner further avers that, consequent to the discussions between the Chairman

of the Petitioner Company and the 1st Respondent Bank in May 2019, the 1st Respondent

agreed to grant the Petitioner with credit facilities and required the Petitioner to execute

a mortgage over its property in Negombo.

In this context, the Petitioner states that, regardless of the letters sent by the Petitioner

dated 14.10.2019 and 17.10.2019, the 1st Respondent had not acted to grant the credit

facilities to the Petitioner which caused an unreasonable delay. The Petitioner further

states that only 30 days prior to the maturity of the Letters of Credit, the 1st Respondent

Bank executed the Mortgage Bond bearing No. 05 dated 19.12.2019 as a security for a

Permanent Over Draft of Rs. 33,000,000 as credit facilities to the Petitioner. As stated by

the Petitioner, for the utter dismay, although the credit facility of the said sum was

approved, the 1st Respondent only provided the facility amounting to Rs. 12,000,000. The

Petitioner further states that, as a result of the 1st Respondents failure to release the due

of the credit facility amidst of Covid-19 Pandemic, the 1st Respondent mala fide caused

the maturity of the Letters of Credit, loss of the two purchase orders and loss of the

credibility of the Petitioner.

According to the Petitioner, though there were amicable discussions between the

Petitioner and the 1st Respondent Bank on the restructuring of the credit facilities, the

Petitioner received a letter dated 31.10.2023 marked as P12 (a) attached with the copies

of Notice under Section 21 of the said Ordinance indicating that, an outstanding amount

of Rs. 18,299,491.96 on account of the principal and interest upto 18.07.2023 together with

further interest on Rs. 12,000,000 at the rate of 29.25% per annum. Further, the

Petitioner was sent copies of the Notice under Section 22 of the said Ordinance by letter

dated 30.01.2024 marked as P13(a). The 1st Respondent had also affixed a banner stating

Notice of Sale at the premises on 14.02.2024 despite the fourteen days provided by

Section 22 of the Ordinance. The Petitioner moreover contends that despite the meeting

on 16.02.2024 and the letter dated 15.02.2024 marked as P15, the Petitioner was informed

that, the outstanding amount to be paid by the Petitioner was now worth of around Rs.

22,000,000 at the said meeting.

Page 5 of 10

The main contention of the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent had acted in mala fide in

these circumstances and the issuance of Notice of Sale and the Gazette Nos. 2368 and

2354 are unlawful and ultra vires.

In this context, the Petitioner has invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking inter

alia writs of Certiorari to quash the Notice of Sale in the Gazette No. 2368 dated

19.01.2024 and the Newspaper Notices dated 22.01.2024 marked as P13(b) to P13(g) and

the decision of the 1st Respondent in the Gazette No. 2354 marked as P12(b) to P12(g).

The main allegation made by the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent failed to provide

the Petitioner with credit facilities that were agreed upon in due time. On the other hand,

the 1st Res has stated that when the Res agreed to grant the facility of Rs. 33,000,000 by

executing the Mortgage Bond No. 05 which is the subject matter of this case. Initially, Rs.

12,000,000 was granted to the Petitioner by the 1st Respondent on 24.12.2019. To release

the further credit facility, the Petitioner was given an undertaking by letter dated

18.12.2019 that, the Petitioner needed to make certain changes in the Letter of Credit

marked P4 (b). However, the Petitioner has failed to comply with the said undertaking.

This was not revealed by the Petitioner in the Petition. Further, in the Counter Affidavit,

document marked 1R2 was not challenged by the Petitioner. According to 1R2, it is clear

that, the Petitioner has promised to amend the said Letter of Credit submitted to the 1st

Respondent before 07.01.2020.

The 1st Respondent alleges that the Respondent could not release any further funds as

the Petitioner has constantly failed to comply with the stipulations and requirements

initiated by the 1st Respondent to the Petitioner. Since the Petitioner has defaulted in

making payments, the Overdraft was rescheduled at the request of the Petitioner.

Since the Petitioner has failed to make any payments, the 1staRespondent has taken steps

under the said Ordinance. This Court is mindful that, in document marked P15, there is

no indication by the Petitioner that, he has paid any amount to settle the Overdraft.

Since the Petitioner has failed to settle the amount, the 1st Respondent had no other option

but to send a letter of demand. Therefore, the Respondent has taken steps to recover the

sum.

Page 6 of 10

On 18.07.2023, a Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent passed a Resolution to sell the

property in question by public auction to recover the monies due to the bank under Section

19 of the said Ordinance.

According to the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner is a habitual defaulter. As depicted in the

document marked P12(b), the amount due from the Petitioner as of 18.07.2023 is Rupees

Eighteen Million Two Hundred and Ninety-Nine Thousand Four Hundred and Ninety

One Rupees and Cents Ninety Six ( Rupees 18,299,491.96 ) on account of the principal

and interest together with further interest on Rs. 12,000,000 at the rate of 29.25% per

annum.

We are mindful that, the Petitioner has not taken any steps to settle the said due amount.

The main purpose of this action instituted by the Petitioner is to stay the auction.

Even after the Petitioner received the notice of the resolution, the Petitioner has not taken

steps to settle the due amount. According to Section 23 of the Bank of Ceylon Ordinance

(as amended), there is a provision available to stay the auction.

Section 23

Payment before sale.

(1) If the amount of the whole of the unpaid portion of the loan, overdraft, advance

or other accommodation (together with all interest due thereon according to

the terms of the mortgage), and of the moneys and costs, if any, recoverable by

the Board under section 26 is tendered to the Board at any time before the

date fixed for the sale, the property shall not be sold and no further steps shall

be taken in pursuance of the resolution under section 19 for the sale of that

property.

(2) If the amount of the installment or other payment in respect of which default

has been made, together with any interest due thereon according to the terms

of the mortgage, and of the moneys and costs, if any, recoverable by the Board

under section 26, is tendered to the Board at any time before the date fixed for

the sale, the Board may, in its discretion, direct that the property shall not be

sold, and that no further steps shall be taken in pursuance of the resolution

under section 19 for the sale of that property.

[S 23 subs by s 12 of Law 10 of 1974]

Page 7 of 10

But the Petitioner has failed to take any steps to prevent the sale. There is no material to

be found to establish that the Petitioner has paid at least the part of the due amount up

to the time this action was filed. This concept was referred to by His Lordship Chitrasiri

J where similar Section is available in the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special

Provisions) Act No.4 of 1990 in DFCC Bank (PLC) v. Fathima Ruzana Fakurdeen and

others., SC Appeal No. 133/2014, decided on 24.03.2016,

Sub section (1) above provides for the borrower to prevent the auction being held

provided he/she tenders to the Board unpaid portion of the loan together with

interest and the costs incurred thereto. Sub section (2) allows the borrower to pay

the installment in respect of which default has been made with the moneys and

costs recoverable by the Bank and then to request the Board to halt the auctioning

of the property mortgaged using its discretion referred to therein. Therefore, it is

clear that the borrower should have paid the unpaid installments if he/she has not

paid the entire unpaid amount, in order to move under Section 10 of the Act No.4

of 1990.

There is no evidence to show that, the Petitioner had attempted to settle the amount due.

We are mindful of the observation made by His Lordship SoZa, J in Siddeek v. Jacolyn

Seneviratne, (1984) 1 SLR 83 at page 90, that;

It is necessary at this, stage, to bear in mind that certiorari is a discretionary

remedy-see Wade, : "Administrative Law" 5th Ed. (1982) pp. 546, 591. As de Smith

says in his work "Judicial Review of Administrative, Action" 4th Ed. (1980) p. 404:

"Thus, certiorari is a discretionary remedy and may be withheld if the

conduct if the applicant, or, it Would seem, the nature of the error does not justify

judicial intervention".

The main ground urged by the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent acted in mala fide. It

is pertinent thus, to consider the concept of mala fide as discussed in scholarly views as

well as in judicial pronouncements.

In M.P. Jain ad S.N Jain, Principles of Administrative Law (2011) 7th Edition, page 1193;

Mala Fides

Page 8 of 10

The term mala fides is used, at times, in a broad sense, and, at other times, in a

narrow sense. In the broad sense, mala fides may denote an improper exercise of

power or abuse of discretion or any of the grounds mentioned below. In one case,

the Supreme Court observed;

.mala fide exercise of power does not necessarily imply any moral turpitude as

a matter of law. It only means that the statutory power is exercised for purposes

foreign to those for which it is in law intended.

In this quotation, mala fides is equated with an exercise of discretionary power for

an improper purpose, which is being discussed here as a ground separate from

mala fides. When a power is exercised for an authorised purpose, the same would

amount to malice in law.

Further at page 1195:

The use of the term mala fides in the broad sense is not proper as it is confusing.

The various grounds of abuse of power are being discussed here separately, and

for an analytical purpose, it is advisable to keep these grounds distinct from each

other as far as possible. Therefore, it is in the narrow sense, that the term mala

fides is being discussed here. In this sense, the term mala fides, or bad faith, means

dishonest intention or corrupt motive in the exercise of power, or a deliberately

malicious or fraudulent purpose, on the part of the decision-maker. Mala fides, in

this narrow sense, includes those cases where the motive force behind an action is

personal animosity, spite, vengeance, personal gratification or benefit to the

concerned authority or its friends or relatives. Mala fide exercise of power is an

abuse of power and hence invalid. Even though it may be difficult to determine

whether or not the authority has exceeded its powers in a particular case because

of the broad terms in which the statute may have conferred power on it, the

discretionary action may, nevertheless, be declared bad if the motivation behind it

is not honest.

In Gunasinghe v. Hon Gamini Dissanayake and Others, 1994 (2) SLR 132 at page 135,

His Lordship Ananda Grero, J. held that;

With regard to the question of mala fide, the petitioner in his petition states that

this acquisition was done as he is a supporter of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and

Page 9 of 10

also he found employment in the Department of Census and Statistics under the

government of the said party. The 1st respondent in his affidavit has specifically

stated that his decision to acquire this land was not motivated by political or any

other consideration. He had stated that the 3rd respondent did not influence him

to acquire this land. According to him acquisition was for an urgent public purpose.

Simply stating that the petitioner is a supporter of a political party which the

3rd respondent is opposed, and that the petitioner was given employment in a

government department by the SLFP Government would not make the

acquisition mala fide. De Smith's Judicial Review of Administrative Action at page

336 it is stated that, "a Court will not in general entertain allegations of bad faith

made against the repository of a power, unless bad faith has been expressly

pleaded and properly particularised (i.e. enumerated in detail)". This Court is of

the view that the petitioner has failed to enumerate in detail the part played by

the 3rd respondent to influence the 1st respondent to acquire this land due to

political reasons or rivalry. Further the petitioner has failed to satisfy this Court

that it was due to political reasons that the 1st respondent took steps to acquire

this land.

In Bandaranayake v. Judicial Service Commission, 2003 (3) SLR 101, at page 104, His

Lordship Sripavan, J (as he was then) held that:

"The plea of mala fides is raised often but it is only rarely it can be substantiated

to the satisfaction of Court. Merely raising doubt is not enough. There should be

something specific, direct and precise to sustain the plea of mala fides. The burden

of proving mala fides is on the individual making allegation as the order is regular

on its face and there is a presumption in favour of the administration that it

exercises its power in good faith and for the public benefit." [Vide Gunasinghe v

Hon Gamini Dissanayake (5) The petition however did not set out in detail the

allegations of mala fide against the first respondent Commission.

In the instant case, the Petitioner has failed to establish the mala fide of the 1st

Respondent. Further, we note that the Petitioners conduct that his failure to comply with

the undertaking resulted in the 1st Respondents delay in releasing the funds.

Page 10 of 10

Further, we note that the Petitioner has failed to make the Directors who passed the

Resolution a party to this application. The failure to make them a party itself is a ground

for dismissal of this application. We further note the particular land belongs to one

Chithra Fernando is also not a Petitioner in this action.

Considering all the facts set out above, we are of the view that this application be

dismissed with taxed costs.
