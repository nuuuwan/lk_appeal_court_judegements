ORDER REGARDING THE PRELIMINARY OBJECTION

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

This is an appeal filed under the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016.

The 1st and 2nd appellantrespondents had filed a request for information

in terms of the Right to Information Act (hereinafter referred to as RTI Act)

Page 5 of 8

requesting a copy of the Tripartite Agreement signed by the Ministry of

Megapolis and Western Development, the Urban Development Authority of

Sri Lanka and the appellant in connection with the development of the

Colombo Port City Development Project.

The said request had been rejected by the Information Officer of the

Ministry of Urban Development and Housing. The 1st and 2nd

appellantrespondents filed appeals against the rejection but the said

appeals too were rejected. Thereafter, the 1st and 2nd

appellantrespondents filed appeals to the Right to Information

Commission against the rejection. The Commission has pronounced its

decision on 06.04.2023 directing to release the said Tripartite Agreement.

The instant appeal has been filed by the petitionerappellant against the

decision of the Right to Information Commission pronounced in terms of

Section 32(3) of the Right to Information Act.

A preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the 1st and 2nd

appellantrespondents that the appellant is not entitled to invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court in terms of Section 34 of the RTI Act, as the

appellant does not fall under the ambit of the meaning of Citizen. All

parties were allowed to file written submissions on the preliminary

objection. The 1st appellantrespondent, the 2nd appellantrespondent, the

14th respondent and the appellant filed written submissions. This order

has to be delivered with regard to the preliminary objection.

The basis of the preliminary objection was that according to Section 34 of

the RTI Act, a Citizen or Public Authority who is aggrieved by the decision

of the Commission can appeal to the Court of Appeal and the appellant

does not fall under the ambit of the meaning of Citizen and thus the

appellant is not entitled to maintain this appeal. The learned Deputy

Solicitor General appearing for the 14th respondent submitted that the

Page 6 of 8

Court must consider whether the appellant is a public authority under

Section 34 read with Section 43 of the RTI Act in determining the

jurisdiction of this Court. The contention of the learned Counsel for the

appellant was that the appellant has no other forum to canvass its

grievances thus the appellant should be allowed to maintain this appeal.

The Preamble of RTI Act reads as follows:

Whereas the Constitution guarantees the right of access to information in

Article 14A thereof and there exists a need to foster a culture of

transparency and accountability in public authorities by giving effect to

the right of access to information and thereby promote a society in which

the people of Sri Lanka would be able to morefully participate in public life

through combating corruption and promoting accountability and good

governance.

It is clear that the intention of RTI Act is giving the citizens right of access

to information which is in the possession, custody, or control, of a public

authority. Section 3 of the RTI Act clearly demonstrate the aforesaid

intention as follows:

Section 3 (1) Subject to the provisions of Section 5 of this Act, every citizen

shall have a right of access to information which is in the possession,

custody or control of a public authority.

So, there are two parties; the citizens who request the information and the

respective public authority who is bound to provide information. According

to Section 24 of the Act, any citizen who is desirous of obtaining any

information under the Act shall make a request. According to Section

24(2), where a citizen (a) wishes to make a request to a public authority or

(b) has made a request to a public authority which does not comply with

Page 7 of 8

the requirements of this Act, the Information Officer concerned shall take

all necessary steps to assist the citizens, free of charge, to make the

request in a manner that complies with this Act. Hence, it is apparent that

any citizen who is desirous of obtaining any information should make a

request to a Public Authority. In other words, the party who is bound to

provide information under this Act is always a Public Authority.

According to Section 15(d) of the RTI Act, the Right to Information

Commission have the power to direct a public authority to provide

information in a particular form. The Act empowers the Commission to

make a direction only to a Public Authority to provide information. Using

the said power, the Commission, in the matter before us directed the

appellant to release the Tripartite agreement because the appellant is a

public authority.

Section 34(1) of the Act, where the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal

is provided, reads as follows:

A citizen or public authority who is aggrieved by the decision of the

Commission made under Section 32, may appeal against such decision to

the Court of Appeal within one month of the date on which such decision

was communicated to such citizen or public authority.

According to Section 34 of the Act, if the citizen who requested the

information is aggrieved by the decision of the Commission, the citizen can

prefer an appeal in the Court of Appeal and if the public authority who has

been directed to provide information is aggrieved by the decision of the

Commission, the said public authority can prefer an appeal to the Court

of Appeal. In this matter, the appellant who was directed by the

Commission to provide the 1st and 2nd appellantrespondents with the

Tripartite Agreement, preferred this appeal in terms of Section 34 of the

RTI Act as the appellant was aggrieved by the decision of the Commission.

Page 8 of 8

The preliminary objection raised on behalf of the 1st and 2nd

appellantrespondents was that the appellant does not fall under the

ambit of the meaning of Citizen. The Act states that a citizen can request

an information. The appellant is the public authority who has been

directed by the Commission to provide the required information. Under

Section 14 of the RTI Act, the power that the Commission has is to direct

a public authority to provide information. As the Commission made a

direction to provide information using the powers conferred in terms of

Section 15 of the Act, it is apparent that the appellant is a public authority.

Therefore, the appellant can prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal in

terms of Section 34 of the RTI Act.

Accordingly, the preliminary objection is overruled. I hold that the

appellant is entitled to maintain this appeal.

N. Bandula Karunarathna, J (P/CA)

I agree.
