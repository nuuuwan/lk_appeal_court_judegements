Argued on: 17.05.2024

Decided On: 29.08.2024

M.C.B.S. Morais J.

Mr. M.G.I. Mahawatta, the petitioner, commenced service in the Government Clerical

Service as a clerk grade II(B) at the Ministry of Health on 8th of June 1992. Subsequently, in

1996, he was promoted to grade II(A). During his tenure as a Management Assistant

stationed at the office of the Director General of Health Services, he was served with a charge

sheet on 6th of June 2006, comprising four charges by the Director General of Health

Services.

Charge I

While working in the Transport Division you paid driver P.H.S.P. Hewage Rs. 6000/- at the

rate of Rs. 2000/- per day without any proper checking, and carelessly on or about

10.02.2006, 21.02.2006 and 23.02.2006 on fraudulent claims made by Ministry driver P.H.S.

Hewage permitted fuel to be pumped to vehicle which was not allocated to him, and thereby

committed an act of misconduct.

Page 6 of 13

Charge II

By acting contrary to written instructions of the Transport Director of the Ministry of Health

whereby the daily fuel allowance for vehicles of the Ministry should not exceed Rs. 500/- for

Colombo travelling you issued a fuel allowance for vehicles of the Ministry in excess of Rs.

500/- for Colombo travelling i.e. a fuel allowance of Rs. 2000/- to driver P.H.S.P. Hewage,

and thereby having, acted in violation of the written instructions committed an act of

misconduct.

Charge III

You deliberately inattentively and through neglect failed to make entries in the Case Order

Book the fuel allowance of Rs. 2000/- to driver P.H.S.P. Hewage on 16.02.2006 and thereby

committed an act of misconduct.

Charge IV

As a management Assistant of Ministry of Health by committing one or several or all the

offences in Charge I, II and III you brought disrepute to the position you hold in the Ministry

Health and the Public Service in general.

The aforementioned charge sheet was subsequently amended on two occasions by the 12th

respondent, first on 19th of February 2008, and again on 7th of March 2008.

Following a formal disciplinary inquiry, M.G.I. Mahawatta was found guilty of all four

counts brought against him. Consequently, the following disciplinary actions were imposed:

1. Deferral of two salary increments.

2. Severe reprimand.

3. Recovery of Rs. 30,000 as administrative costs for the disciplinary inquiry.

Being aggrieved by the aforementioned disciplinary order, the petitioner filed an appeal with

the Public Service Commission (PSC) on 15th of December 2008. While this appeal was

pending, the PSC ceased functioning, and all PSC matters were handled by the Cabinet while

certain matters were delegated to the ministry secretaries. Consequently, the above appeal

was reviewed and adjudicated by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Page 7 of 13

On 15th of December 2010, the Cabinet of Ministers, upon reviewing the petitioner's appeal,

decided that the disciplinary order issued against the petitioner shall remain in force without

alteration. Furthermore, the Cabinet of Ministers determined that the recovery of the sum of

Rs.30,000 as administrative costs should be implemented on an installment basis, to be paid

by the petitioner over a period of two years.

Upon reconstitution of the PSC, petitioner filed a new appeal dated 28th of September 2011.

However, PSC rejected it on 01st of March 2012 since Cabinet of Ministers had already made

an order dated 30th of December 2010. Upon the reactivation of the Public Service

Commission, the decisions made by the Cabinet during its period of inactivity were given an

opportunity to re-canvass the decisions of Cabinet of Ministers. However, in this instance,

allegedly on the basis that the 1st respondent is not the disciplinary authority but only the

appellant authority and stating that the 1st respondent did not have the power and authority to

reconsider a decision made by the Cabinet of Ministers, the 1st respondent rejected and

dismissed the appeal.

In the interim, the petitioner got selected for a promotion to Sri Lanka Administrative Service

Class III on the basis of a competitive examination which was denied to the petitioner by the

Public Service Commission.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Public Service Commission dated 01st of March

2012 the petitioner appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) by Appeal dated

23rd of March 2012. By its order dated 16th of February 2016, AAT also dismissed the appeal

and affirmed the order of the PSC dated 01st of March 2012.

Now, the petitioner seeks the following substantive reliefs from us.

a) Issue notice on the Respondents above named

b) To quash and set aside the order of the Public Service Commission bearing No.

PC/93/2008 dated 01.03.2012 (p14)

r) For costs and

s) Further and other reliefs that your lordships court seem meet.

On thorough examination of the matter at hand, a pivotal issue emerges, whether this court

possesses the authority to issue the writs sought against the Public Service Commission,

given the constitutional ouster clause stipulated in Article 61A. This raises fundamental

questions about the jurisdiction and reach of judicial intervention in light of established

constitutional constraints.

Article 61A of the Constitution:

[Subject to the provisions of Article 59 and of Article 126], no court or tribunal shall have

power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call in question

any order or decision made by the Commission, a Committee, or any public officer, in

pursuance of any power or duty conferred or imposed on such Commission, or delegated to a

Committee or public officer, under this Chapter or under any other law.

In Katugampola v. Commissioner- General of Excise & Others [2003] 3 SLR 207,

her Ladyship Shiranee Tilakawardane, J. held,

The State Counsel appearing on behalf of the Attorney-General and the

other respondents raised a preliminary objection pertaining to jurisdiction, stating that

this Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain this application in view of Article 61 A,

which has been introduced by the 17th Amendment of the Constitution of the

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

Accordingly, this Court holds that the ouster clause contained in Article 61A of the

Constitution precludes the Jurisdiction of this Court.

In Ratnasiri & Others v. Ellawala [2004] 2 SLR 180 his Lordship Marsoof, PC, J. held,

"In view of the elaborate scheme put in place by the Seventeenth Amendment to the

Constitution to resolve all matters relating to the public service, this Court would

be extremely reluctant to exercise any supervisory jurisdiction in the sphere of the

Page 10 of 13

public service. I have no difficulty in agreeing with the submission made by the learned

State Counsel that this Court has to apply the preclusive clause contained in Article 61A of

the Constitution in such a manner as to ensure that the elaborate scheme formulated by

the Seventeenth Amendment is given effect to the fullest extent."

In Hewa Pedige Ranasinghe & Others v. Secretary, Ministry of Agricultural Development

and Agri Service & Others, SC Appeal 117/2013 decided on 18.07.2018, his Lordship Sisira

J de Abrew J. held,

When I consider Article 61A of the Constitution, I hold that the Court of Appeal has

no power to inquire into the above examination conducted by the Secretary to the Ministry of

Agricultural Development. Therefore, the Petitioner-Petitioners could not have invoked the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to quash the said examination

In light of the foregoing authorities, it is our considered opinion that this court lacks

jurisdiction to intervene by exercising its writ jurisdiction against the decisions rendered by

the Public Service Commission. Writ jurisdiction is limited to review the order of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal according to the law.

When a comprehensive assessment of the documents submitted us, this court made the

following observations.

It has not been stated in any evidence that the accused officer Mr. Indika Mahawatta

was aware that the driver mentioned in the first charge, Mr. Hewage, fraudulently and

falsely obtained the fuel money for the vehicle number 301-4395.

It has not been established that the accused had knowledge of the vehicle's

inoperability.

There are invoices corresponding to the received amount and they have been

documented for the relevant dates, and the driver's signature has been obtained by the

accused and it is indicating that the formal procedures regarding fuel expenditures

have been adhered to.

It has been identified that this vehicle is being utilized by the minister, and therefore,

there is evidence indicating that no daily driving records are maintained for this

vehicle.

Page 11 of 13

As a result, the driver is not questioned about the journey, and the officer responsible

for disbursing fuel funds is obligated to provide the amount requested by the driver

for fuel.

Therefore, the evidence does not establish that funds were disbursed negligently or

without proper oversight.

Since the vehicle is being utilized by the minister, it seems that the fuel restrictions

imposed on other vehicles do not apply to this vehicle.

The evidence establishes that the accused was on leave on February 16, 2006, in

relation to the third charge.

Accordingly, in regards to the count IV, it is apparent that it could not be maintained

as the rest of allegations against the accused have not been substantiated.

The inquiry officer has failed to appreciate and duly consider the evidence elicited in

favor of the appellant.

Therefore, on perusal of the certain material before us, it is apparent that the petitioner has

been unfairly victimized for reasons unknown to us.

It is also submitted that the Director General of Health Services, Mr. Kahandaliyanage, who

signed the petitioner's Charge Sheet as the Charging Officer, was appointed as Secretary to

the Ministry of Health, during the period when the Public Service Commission was not

operational, and the same Mr. Kahandaliyanage has referred the petitioner's appeal to the

Cabinet of Ministers on 15th of November 2010. The respondents have not expressly denied

such.

This action, taken in a context where the principles of natural justice (nemo debet esse judex

in propria causa) were compromised, raises serious concerns. The referral process to the

Cabinet of Ministers conducted during the inactivity of the Public Service Commission by the

charging officer himself signifies a clear deviation from procedural fairness and undermines

the integrity of the appeal process.

In R v. Sussex Justices - 1924 1KB 256 Lord Hewart C.J. states that,

it is not merely of importance, but of fundamental importance that justice should

not only be done, but must manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.

Page 12 of 13

In the case Geeganage V. Director General of Customs (2001) 3 SLR 179;

The principle that no man shall be judge in his own cause (nemo judex in causa sua

potest) is based on this rule against bias and is intended to ensure that decision - makers are

as independent as is practicable. The rule of bias, which is a variant if not the same thing as

the principle of "nemo juidex in causa sua" which means literally that no man shall be a

judge in own cause. But as a rule of natural justice that maxim has wider connotation and

prevents any person suspected of being biased from deciding a matter.

In this instant case, the petitioner has filed an appeal with the PSC on 15th of December 2008.

However, while pending the appeal the PSC has become defunct and as for the letter

No.09/1041/360/034 dated 25th of June 2009 marked and produced as R1, this appeal was

considered by the Cabinet of Ministers. However, once the Public Service Commission

resumed operations, it was granted the authority by R2 to review decisions arrived by the

Cabinet of Ministers in order to ensure administrative fairness.

According to the decision dated 01st of March 2012 marked and produced as P14 by the

petitioner, it is mentioned that the PSC, that it has no authority to change a decision that the

Cabinet of Ministers had made. Though they have decided so, they have not given any reason

to come to that conclusion as R2 the letter dated 18th November 2012 by the Office of the

Cabinet of Ministers directs and empowers them to act otherwise. Anyway as for Article

61A of the constitution, this court has no authority to question an order made by the Cabinet

of Ministers on behalf of the Public Service Commission or any decision made by the PSC,

hence we are confined solely to the consideration of the decision rendered by the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

It seems that the PSC has adopted an arbitrary self-imposed condition that limits its role to

not being the disciplinary authority but rather an appellate authority. This self-imposed

restriction prevents the PSC from effectively reviewing the Cabinet of Ministers decisions in

regard to the Public Servants, given during the period of inactivity of the PSC, thus rendering

its authority somewhat superficial deferring the purpose of R2.

Although the petitioner subsequently appealed to the AAT, it seems that the AAT has not

substantially considered the merits of the application in detail. The AAT has declined the

Page 13 of 13

appeal of the petitioner on the basis that he has not produced any material to set aside the

PSC order. However, it is apparent that all the materials before us have been there before the

AAT as well. Accordingly, we find that the order is unreasonable and should be quashed.

It is unnecessary to grant the reliefs prayed in prayers (b)-(h) and (j)-(q) of the petition, as the

AAT has the power and authority to do the needful once this matter is fully reviewed by

them.

In light of the above, as for prayer (i), the order of the AAT dated 16th of February 2016, is

hereby quashed and vacated, enabling the AAT to reconsider the matter carefully and provide

appropriate relief to the petitioner.

No cost.
