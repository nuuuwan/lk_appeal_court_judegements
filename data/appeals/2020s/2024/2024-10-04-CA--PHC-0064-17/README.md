Introduction

1) The Appellant had lodged this appeal against the Respondent to

seek the reliefs prayed for in the petition of appeal dated 25th May

2017.

2) The said reliefs sought in the Appellants petition of appeal are set

forth as follows;

Facts of this case

3) The Appellant had sought in the prayer of the petition of appeal to

set aside the Order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 17th

May 2017 and to declare that the Order delivered by the Learned

Magistrate dated 23rd May 2016 as invalid.

4) This is an action based on a recovery of possession of a state land

filed by the Competent Authority at the Magistrates Court.

5) The Magistrate had considered the facts and the documents and

allowed the Respondent Competent Authority of the Plantation

Management Monitoring Division to eject the Appellant from the

CA (PHC) 64-2017

4

land described in the plaint filed by the Respondent Competent

Authority.

6) Aggrieved by the said Order, the Appellant had filed a revision

application in the Provincial High Court of Monaragala. The

Learned High Court Judge after considering the facts pertinent to

this action had dismissed the Appellants revision application. On

that, the Appellant had filed this appeal against the said Order

made by the Learned High Court Judge.

7) Further, the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the deeds

executed in favour of the Appellant which were produced and

neglected to adhere to the provisions outlined in the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979.

8) Furthermore, the Appellant had contended that the schedule

produced by the Competent Authority to eject the Appellant was

vague.

9) The said grounds had not been considered by the Learned High

Court Judge during the revision application submitted by the

Appellant in the High Court of Monaragala.

10) Consequently, the Appellant had sought the reliefs prayed for in

the petition of appeal.

11) However, the Learned High Court Judge had dismissed the petition

and refused the Writ of Certiorari application made by the

Appellant.

Disputed facts

12) When this appeal was taken up for argument on 28th June 2024,

the parties agreed to conclude the case by way of filing written

submissions.

13) Upon considering the written submissions, documents and the

Orders made by the Learned High Court Judge and Magistrate, to

arrive at the conclusion, I am of the view the following disputed

points should be looked into.

i) Was the Learned Magistrates Order dated 23rd May 2016

evaluated by the Learned High Court Judge considering the

disputes raised by the Respondent-Petitioner Appellant at

the High Court?

ii) If so, can the application made by the Respondent-

Petitioner Appellant be maintained?

iii) If not, can the Appellant seek the relief prayed for in his

petition of appeal dated 25th May 2017?

I. Was the Learned Magistrates order dated 23rd May 2016

evaluated by the Learned High Court Judge considering the

disputes raised by the Respondent-Petitioner Appellant at

the High Court?

14) On perusal of the Learned High Court Judges Order dated 17th

May 2017, it is evident that the Learned High Court Judge had

meticulously considered the facts pertinent to the Magistrates

Order.

15) The Appellant had filed the revision application against the Order

of the Magistrate by way of a petition dated 21st June 2016. In the

said petition, the Appellant had pleaded to revise the Order

delivered by the Learned Magistrate on 23rd May 2016 requesting

that the Respondents be restrained from harvesting and that the

Appellant be permitted to enter the disputed land and harvest.

16) When referring to the petition filed by the Appellant in the High

Court, the primary contention was that the Petitioners long-term

CA (PHC) 64-2017

possession of the said land during which he cultivated a variety of

plants and erected a house.

17) Further he has challenged the Competent Authority who had

signed the eviction notice. When perusing the Learned Magistrates

Order, the Learned Magistrate had very well considered under

section 5 (a), (b) and (c) as prescribed and determined that the

eviction notice had been duly issued. Additionally, the Learned

High Court Judge in her Order reiterated that the Competent

Authoritys position is well established.

18) I draw my attention to the notice of quit filed at the Magistrates

Court Monaragala in the case No. 78060. I reproduce the said

notice hereafter;

CA (PHC) 64-2017

19) On perusal of the said notice and in considering the Magistrates

Order dated 23rd May 2016, it is evident that the Learned

Magistrate had explicitly stated that the said notice had been

tendered to court in the correct prescribed form in compliance with

the Provisions of Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act. Therefore, on the face of it the Learned Magistrate

and the High Court Judge had correctly decided that the Notice of

quit tendered by the Respondent is in the correct prescribed form.

CA (PHC) 64-2017

20) The object of the legislation under section 18 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act defines the term Competent

Authority. I hereby reproduce the relevent section as follows;

Sec 18; In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires

"competent authority" used in relation to any land means the Government Agent, an Additional Government Agent or an Assistant Government Agent of the district in which the land is situated and includes;

(a) the General Manager of Railways, where such land is under the control of the Railway Department; (b) the Commissioner for National Housing, where such land is under the control of the Department of National Housing ; (c) the Commissioner of Local Government, where such land is under the control of a local authority ; and;

(d) any other public officer authorized by the Government Agent in respect of any matter or provision of this Act;

22) The case of Wedamulla V Abeyasinghe 1 specifies the definition

of a Competent Authority;

"Competent Authority includes "an officer generally or specially authorized by a corporate body. Where such land is vested in or owned by or under the control of, such corporate body". 23) When considering the Learned High Court Judges Order I am of

the veiw that the Learned High Court Judge had considered that

the Respondent-Respondents Competent Authority was appointed

legally. Therefore, the Appellants position challenging that there is

no Competent Authority cannot be accepted in the instant action.

Thus I do not have to explain the said position in detail as the said

fact is correctly decided.

24) On the said grounds, it is my considered view that the Learned

High Court Judge had thoroughly considered the facts pertinent to

1 [1999] 3 SLR Pg 26

CA (PHC) 64-2017

9

the Order made by the Magistrates Court and decided that there

are no exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction to entertain the revision application filed by

the Appellant before the High Court.

II. If so, can the application made by the Respondent-Petitioner

Appellant be maintained?

25) In the instant action and/or in the revision application before the

High Court and/or before the Magistrates Court the Appellant had

never claimed the disputed land as his private property.

26) Therefore, the Appellant had by implication, ackowledged that he is

in the possession of a State Land.

27) In the said circumstances, I draw my attention to the following

decisions; Muhandiram V Chairman Janatha Estate Development

Board and Namunukula Plantation PLC V Nimal Punchihewa.

In the case of Muhandiram v Chairman, Janatha Estate

Development Board 2 it was stated;

In an inquiry under the state lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act, the onus is on the person summoned to

establish his possession or occupation that it is

possessed or occupied upon a valid permit or other

written authority of the state granted according to any

written law, if this burden is not discharged, the only

option open to the Magistrate is to order ejectment.

CA (PHC) 64-2017

And in the case of Namunukula Plantations PLC V Nimal Punchihewa Chairman, land Reform Commission3;

"One of the matters required to be stated in the application is that the land described in the schedule to the application is in the opinion of the competent authority State land. This fact cannot be contested by the person summoned and the submission of the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner that whether the two lots of land which forms the subject matter of the Magistrates Court action are situated within Akuresso Estate or outside is a matter to he decided by a District Court in a land action must fail. Hence, a dispute on the identity of the land cannot arise for the consideration of the learned Magistrate. The identity of the land can arise for consideration only to the extent of examining whether the valid permit or other written authority produced by the party summoned is in relation to the state land described in the application. Where it is not, the Magistrate must issue an order of eviction in terms of the Act."

28) In the aforesaid decisions, it is emphasized that there should be a

valid permit or any other written document establishing the right

of a party to possess the disputed land.

29) It is abundantly clear that the Appellant had failed to produce any

permit and/or document that support his occupation of the

subject matter in question.

30) Therefore, I find no merit in the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants

application, and it cannot be maintained.

III. If not, can the Appellant seek the relief prayed for in his

petition of appeal dated 25th May 2017?

31) Considering the aforesaid facts and documents, I do not see any

relevant facts raised by the Appellant to set aside the Order made

by the Learned High Court Judge as a revision application is a

discretionary remedy. And the Learned High Court Judge has

thoroughly considered the disputes raised by the Appellant before

the High Court.

32) Further I draw my attention to the decision of Divisional

Secretary Kalutara v Kalupahana Mestrige Jayatissa4;

It must be noted that the Respondents had invoked revisionary jurisdiction of this court, which is discretionary remedy. Thus, if relief to be granted, the party seeking the relief has to establish that, not only the impugned order is illegal, but also the nature of the illegality is such, that it shocks the conscience of the court 33) In the said decision, it had been decided that an impugned Order

made in a revision application must not only be illegal but should

also shock the conscience of the court.

34) In the instant appeal, I do not see whether the Appellant had

argued any point to the effect of the aforesaid grounds referred to

in the case of Divisional Secretary Kalutara v Kalupahana Mestrige

Jayatissa.

35) For the reasons spelt out, it is abundantly clear that the Appellant

had failed to produce any document or any fact indicating that the

disputed portion of the land is included in the Magistrates Court

Proceedings.

36) It is apparent, in a revisionary action this nature of facts cannot be

considered as the Learned High Court Judge has not violated any

legal provision.

37) Therefore, I do not consider that the Appellant can seek any reliefs

prayed for in the petition of appeal dated 25th May 2017.

CONCLUSION

38) For the reasons set out above, I dismiss the petition of appeal

dated 25th May 2017 subject to payment of Rs. 50 000/- cost to the

Respondent-Respondent.
