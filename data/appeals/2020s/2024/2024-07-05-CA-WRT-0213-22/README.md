The Petitioner, a public servant was served with a letter dated 10.10.2006 (P2) by the General

Manager of Railways suspending his services with immediate effect subject to the approval of

the Director General of Establishments. Despite this, the Petitioner was reinstated, pending a

formal disciplinary inquiry (Vide - 'P3'). In the meantime, the Petitioner reached retirement

age but was granted an extension of service until 31.12.2008.

As a consequence to the formal disciplinary inquiry, the Petitioner was found guilty for all

the charges of the relevant Charge Sheet and accordingly the Director General of

Establishments on 12.01.2010 ordered to pay the pension to the Petitioner subject to the

following conditions:

(i) Pay the pension after deducting 20% from the pension

Page 3 of 5

(ii) To deny the payment of arrears of salary for the period where the Petitioner was under

suspension

In terms of Clause 36:7 of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code, when the Disciplinary

Authority finds that an officer is guilty of one, some or all of the charges at a formal

disciplinary inquiry, he should, depending on the nature of the charge or charges of which the

officer is found guilty, send his observations and recommendations on whether the officer

should be deprived of his full pension, gratuity and other allowances payable to him or

whether a certain percentage thereof should be deducted, together with the charge sheet,

report of the inquiry and all other relevant documents to the Secretary in charge of the subject

of Public Administration.

The Public Service Commission (PSC), reviewing an appeal filed by the Petitioner against

the above-mentioned disciplinary orders, dismissed the appeal. The Administrative Appeals

Tribunal (AAT) on 17.07.2018 dismissed the Petitioners appeal filed against the order of

the PSC. The Petitioner has not taken steps to challenge the decisions of the PSC and the final

order of the AAT.

The Petitioner sought a clarification regarding his pension payments from the Divisional

Secretary of Kolonnawa. In response, the Accountant of the Divisional Secretariat issued a

letter dated 07.04.2021 marked P14, detailing several deductions from his pension. The

Petitioner challenges, in the instant Application, the decisions outlined in 'P14', arguing that

its contents violate the provisions of Circular 12/2003(dated 25.09.2003), Circular No. 5 of

2007 (dated 06.03.2007), and/or Clause 36:7 of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code.

The 1st to 4th Respondents argue that the initial award of pension dated 24.02.2010 (P7) and

the subsequent award of pension dated 31.03.2011 (R1) were both calculated with a 20%

penalty deduction, before and after pension commutation, in accordance with the disciplinary

orders marked 'P5' and 'P5a'. Noticing an error in the award of pension dated 28.05.2012

marked P8, the Divisional Secretary of Kolonnawa requested the Department of Pensions to

rectify such error.

Subsequently, the Department of Pensions issued two additional awards of pension dated

21.01.2020 marked P11 and 11.02.2020 marked P12. The 'P11' award recouped the excess

pension previously paid to the Petitioner, while the 'P12' award included an additional

increment for the Petitioner. The Petitioners pension was further adjusted in accordance with

the Pension Circular 14/2019, which applies to all retired public officers.

The Divisional Secretary of Kolonnawa, affirming an affidavit, states that an amount of Rs.

4864.02 representing 20% of the pension, was mistakenly not deducted during the previous

pension revision. It is observed that the Divisional Secretary is required to follow the

disciplinary orders marked 'P5' and 'P5a' when making the Petitioners monthly pension

payments. Consequently, Rs. 148,885.46 was erroneously credited to the Petitioners bank

account. The excess amount of Rs. 82,688.34 has since been recovered in accordance with

section 43(a) of the Minutes on Pensions, as amended by Gazette No. 1776/40 dated

21.09.2012.

The Respondents, in addition to submitting the award of pension marked R1, have presented

the Court with another award of pension dated 30.08.2011, marked Rx. They argue that the

Petitioner has not contested the said Rx award or any other awards of pension and as such

the Petitioner has acquiesced to the receipt of the pensions as calculated according to the

disciplinary orders marked P5 and P5a.

The Petitioner contends that there is no rational basis for calculating the subtraction of the

gratuity amounting to Rs. 295,273 reflected in the award of pension marked R1 from the

commuted gratuity amounting to Rs. 369,091 stipulated in the award of pension dated

30.08.2011, marked Rx, since the original gratuity payment was Rs. 287,152 in the pension

award dated 24.02.2010, marked P7. Therefore, the Petitioner argues that there is no rational

basis for paying him Rs. 73,818, which is the difference between Rs. 369,091 and Rs. 295,273.

However, the Statement of Objections of the 1st to 4th Respondents and the affidavit from the

Divisional Secretary of Kolonnawa outline the events that led the Department of Pensions to

amend the awards of pension, which the Petitioner has not contested. The Petitioner's

complaint is solely based on the contents of the said Accountants letter marked P14.

The learned State Counsel who appears for the 1st to 4th Respondents, referring to the award

of pension dated 30.08.2011 (Rx) submitted that all arrears have been duly paid to the

Petitioner and the current pension is being paid in accordance with the said award of pension

Rx. It is noted that the Petitioner is not challenging the contents of the said award of pension.

I take the view that the Petitioner has not demonstrated to Court that the said Accountant

failed to properly calculate the awards of pension issued by the Department of Pensions. The

Petitioner's main argument is that there is no rational basis for subtracting the gratuity amount

in the award of pension R1'. However, after thoroughly reviewing the documents marked

'Rx' and 'Rx2' (including the annexures to 'Rx2'), the Court is unable to find any errors in the

calculation in the impugned letter marked 'R14'.

I find no significant discrepancies in the data reflected in 'Rx2', which includes details from

2010 to 2023, when comparing the awards of pension with the averments of the Respondents'

Statement of Objections. Additionally, I take the view that sufficient evidence or material has

not been provided to Court to establish any alleged errors in the impugned letter 'P14',

contradicting the unchallenged awards of pension. Anyhow, I need to make an observation

that the Petitioner should be duly paid his pension in terms of the award of pension marked

Rx without him being subjected to any undue distress by the relevant authorities.

In light of the above, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs prayed for

in the prayer of the Petition. Thus, I proceed to dismiss the instant Application subjected to

the above observation.
