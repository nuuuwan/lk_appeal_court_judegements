Argued on: 14.02.2024 Written Submissions on: 29.05.2024 by the Petitioner 29.05.2024 by the 5th Respondent 29.04.2024 by the 6th Respondent Decided on: 29.08.2024

MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. The Petitioner in the instant application is seeking for Writs in the nature

of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st and 2nd Respondents

granting a 1st class title certificate, a Writ of Mandamus against the 1st and

Page 3 of 6

2nd Respondents to grant a fresh 1st class title certificate in the name of the

Petitioner after holding a fresh inquiry, a Writ of Mandamus against the 1st

and 2nd Respondents to hold a fresh inquiry to ascertain the owner of the

land parcel in dispute

As contended by the Petitioner, the subject property of the matter at hand

was bequeathed to the Petitioner via a deed of transfer bearing no.703,

dated 11th July 1967 attested by Benjamin Leon Abeyaratne Notary Public,

Marked P1. Furthermore, it is stated by the Petitioner that on 21st of

October 2016, the Petitioner transferred an undivided 1 Rood share of the

said property to the 4th Respondent by virtue of a deed of transfer bearing

number 161 attested by Janaka Ratnayaka Notary Public.

It is the Petitioners position that although the Petitioner was in possession

of the said land for nearly 50 years, the 1st class title certificate (marked

P6a) has been capriciously issued to a person namely Ananda Sarath

Abeywardhana pertaining to the land depicted as lot no 55 in the cadastral

map bearing number 620283 dated 31st October 2014 marked P 5(a). The

said Ananda Sarath Abeywardhana has passed away on 26th of April 2016

and his testamentary case bearing number 2292 is pending before the

District Court of Rathnapura and the 5th respondent is the Administrator

of the estate of the deceased. Furthermore, the land to which the Petitioner

lays claim upon has been named is part of the deceased estate. It is averred

by the Petitioner that even though he had expressed his objections (marked

P8 to P12) pertaining to the decision of the 1st and 2nd Respondents for the

issuance of the 1st class title certificate to a 3rd party, the 1st and 2nd

Respondents have failed to consider the said objections raised by the

petitioner.

It is the contention of the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent, Commissioner

General of Land Title Settlement and the 2nd Respondent, Registrar of Title,

Registrar General's Department has failed to perform a proper inquiry prior

Page 4 of 6

to the issuing of the 1st class title certificate to the 3rd party namely

Ananda Sarath Abeywardhana.

However, this Court is mindful to the fact that the due process in granting

a 1st class title certificate has been followed by the 1st and 2nd Respondents

where after the preparation of the cadastral map, the Commissioner

general has published a notice in the gazette in accordance to Section 12

of the Title Registration Act No. 21 of 1998 calling for claims to land

parcels.

Section 12 of the Title Registration Act reads as follows;

The Commissioner of Title Settlement shall, on receipt of such certified

copies of cadastral maps publish a Notice in the Gazette, calling for

any claimants to the land parcel specified in such Notice to submit

their claims to him within a prescribed period from the date of

publication of such Notice.

Accordingly, such notice has been published calling for claims from the

public to the land parcels depicted in cadastral map No 620283 in the

gazette extraordinary No 1892 /18 dated 09/12/2014 (vide Annexure 1 to

the written submissions of the 5th Respondent).

And as per the gazette notification copies of the cadastral map were

available at the Grama Niladhari office, Divisional secretariat, District

Survey office of the Commissioner of Title Settlement or the Surveyor

General's office. Furthermore, the notice directed the people to make

claims before the 8th January 2015 and in the event of failure to make a

claim before 8th January 2015, inquiry will be made exparte to determine

the title and the determination will be published in the government gazette

in terms of the Section 14 of the Act.

Thereafter, commissioner has carried out a title investigation and

published in the gazette dated 19th June 2015 names of the owners and

the said Ananada Sarath Abeywardena was given as the name of the owner

Page 5 of 6

of parcel no 55 in terms of the Section 14 of the title registration Act.

Therefore, it could be concluded that the Commissioner and his officers

have conducted the procedure of title settlement in accordance to the law.

Without prejudice to the above, this Court is mindful of the fact that this

application has been filed 6 years after the Commissioner of Title

Settlement published his determination in 2015. It is manifestly evident

that there is substantial delay in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court

and that the Petitioner has failed to duly explain the delay.

In this regard, I refer to the observation made In Bisomenike Vs. C. R. de

Alwis1, Sharvananda, J., (as he then was) observed that;

A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot

be held to be a Writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. The

exercise of this discretion by Court is governed by certain wellaccepted

principles. The Court is bound to issue it at the instance of a party

aggrieved by the order of an inferior tribunal except in cases where he

has disentitled himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his own

conduct, submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or waiver. The

proposition that the Application for Writ must be sought as soon as the

injury is caused is merely an Application of the equitable doctrine that

delay defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his

rights without any reasonable excuse the chance of his success in Writ

Application dwindles and the Court may reject a Writ Application on

the ground of unexplained delay. An Application for a Writ of Certiorari

should be filled within a reasonable time.

In Sarath Hulangamuwa Sriwardena Vs. The Principal Vishaka

Vidyalaya2, the Court of Appeal held that;

The Writs are extraordinary remedies granted to obtain speedy relief

under exceptional circumstances and time is of the essence of the

1 [1982] 1 SLR, 368. 2 [1986] 1 SLR, 275.

Application. The laches of the Petitioner must necessarily be a

determining factor in deciding the Application for Writ as the Court will

not lend itself to making a stultifying order which cannot be carried

out.

The foregoing line of authorities are united in deciding that the delay and

laches are the most significant aspects to be considered in Writ

Applications. If there is a delay and laches on the part of the Petitioner,

which has not been explained to the satisfaction of the Court, the Court

will refuse to issue prerogative Writs. For the above reasons the Application

is dismissed without costs.

Application dismissed. No costs.
