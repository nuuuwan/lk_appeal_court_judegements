Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by his conviction and the sentence by the learned

High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Kuliyapitiya for causing

the death of one Amarasinghage Pual Fonseka on 19-02-2012, at a place called

Puhulketiya, Weerapokuna, and thereby committing the offence of murder,

punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya found the appellant

guilty as charged, and accordingly, he was sentenced to death.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant urged the

following grounds of appeal for consideration of the Court.

(1) Whether the learned High Court Judge failed to consider the

provocation or cumulative provocation aspect in his judgment.

(2) Whether the learned High Court Judge has considered the defence

version of events that led to the death in its correct perspective.

Page 3 of 11

(3) Whether the learned High Court Judge has considered inadmissible

evidence in the judgment.

(4) Whether the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the fact

that, the appellant had no intention.

Facts in Brief

The facts that led to the death of the deceased as revealed in evidence led

before the High Court can be summarized as follows.

The deceased was the father of the appellant and was about 80 years of age at

the time of his death. The appellant, his family and the deceased lived in the

same house, and it was the appellant who provided for the deceased. The land

they were living was about one acre in extent. The deceased and the appellant

both used to habitually consume illicit liquor and there were frequent quarrels

between them.

PW-01 who was a young boy at the time relevant to this incident was watching

TV at his home situated on the land in front of the appellants house when he

heard the sound of a quarrel from the direction of the house of the appellant.

He has come out of the house to inquire, and has seen a verbal altercation

between the deceased and the appellant over a deed of a land. Thereafter, he

has seen the appellant assaulting the deceased using his hands as well as feet.

He has also seen the deceased being assaulted using something similar to a

wooden plank used in beds and has seen the deceased pleading for help.

He has then seen the deceased being dragged inside the house by the appellant

and putting him on a bed and being assaulted further. After the assault, the

appellant has left the house in his foot bicycle. At the time of the assault, only

the appellant and the deceased had been at their house, and the witness has

later come to know that the deceased had died.

Page 4 of 11

The evidence of PW-04 and PW-06 who are the other eyewitnesses to the

incident and neighbours of the appellant had been very much similar.

The common feature of the evidence of all the witnesses had been to the effect

that the fighting between the deceased and the appellant was a common

occurrence when both of them got drunk. The witnesses have stated that they

were in the habit of not interfering and settling their quarrels because when

they attempt to intervene, both the father and the son used to get together and

set upon them for intervening into their matters.

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted the post-mortem had

observed 13 injuries on the body of the deceased, and all of them had been

contusions at various levels. He had observed three fractured ribs in the 1st

injury, and the other contusions had been all over the body, which shows that

the deceased had been subjected to a severe beating. The doctor has opined

that the death had been due to the injuries sustained by the deceased.

When the appellant was called upon for his defence, he has given evidence

under oath. It has been his position that it is he who looked after the father,

and he and his father used to consume liquor on frequent basis. It has been

stated that although it was he who brought liquor for his father, after

consuming it, his father was in the habit of scolding him frequently using filthy

language.

It was also his evidence that the father was in the habit of pawning the land

they were living using the deed of the land, and on two previous occasions, it

was he who redeemed the land. The father has used the money obtained by

pawning the land to spend on liquor. According to him, on the day of the

incident too, after consuming liquor, the father wanted him to give the deed of

the land to him, which he resisted, and because he refused to adhere to the

Page 5 of 11

fathers request, the father started to scold him using foul language, which

resulted him losing his temper and assaulting the father.

It has been his claim that he has not assaulted his father previously, but on

the day of the incident, because of the language used by his father towards

him, the assaulting took place. He has stated that it was not his intention to

kill his father.

In the judgement, the learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence of

the eyewitnesses and that of the JMO, and has concluded that the evidence

had been cogent and trustworthy. It had been determined that it was the

appellant who assaulted the deceased, which resulted in his death. The learned

High Court Judge has also correctly determined that prior to the incident,

there had been a verbal altercation between the appellant and the deceased

over a deed.

Having considered the evidence of the appellant where he has admitted that

the incident took place, but claimed he had no intention to kill his father, and

his claim that the incident occurred as a result of provocation and a sudden

fight, it has been determined that the appellant has lied in his evidence and his

evidence cannot be relied upon. On the basis that the appellant had the

intention to kill the deceased, and his failure to provide medical attention to

him after the assault, it had been determined that the prosecution has proved

that the appellant has committed the offence of murder, and he has been

convicted as charged.

Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal

As the grounds of appeal are interrelated, I will now proceed to consider them

together.

Based on the admission of the appellant that it was he who attacked the

deceased, which resulted in his death, the learned Counsel for the appellant

submitted that this was a situation where the learned High Court Judge should

Page 6 of 11

have drawn his attention to exceptions to the offence of murder in terms of

section 294 of the Penal Code.

It was his view that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that

aspect, although the learned High Court Judge has stated that there was a

verbal altercation between the appellant and the deceased over a deed. The

learned Counsel argued that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected

when it was decided that the evidence of the appellant could not be relied

upon, and the basis upon which the appellant was convicted for the offence of

murder.

It was his position that the conviction should have been in terms of exception 4

of section 294 of the Penal Code on the basis of an act committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel.

It was the submission of the learned DSG that the test should have been

whether a reasonably prudent man could have committed this type of an act if

he had no intention or knowledge of the fact that his actions could lead to

death of a person.

However, the learned DSG agreed that the learned High Court Judge has failed

to draw his attention to the evidence available on continuous provocation

between the parties and the sudden fight that has occasioned as a result, on

the day of the incident. The learned DSG agreed that if the evidence was

considered in its correct perspective, the conviction should have been in terms

of section 297 of the Penal Code on the basis of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder.

Having considered the evidence in its totality, I find that this is a matter where

the deceased who was the father of the appellant had been in the habit of

getting into quarrels after both of them consumed liquor. According to the

evidence of the eyewitnesses, they have not even attempted to intervene to

prevent the incident that occurred, as it appeared that such incidents had been

Page 7 of 11

common occurrences. The evidence of PW-04 shows that on the day of the

incident, the reason for the verbal altercation had been about a deed.

The evidence of the appellant had been that his father wanted the deed to pawn

the land and obtain money, which he resisted. According to him, on two

previous occasions also the father had done the same, where he had to

intervene and get the land released by paying money and this was the reason

for the provocation occurred to him on that day.

The learned High Court Judge too has considered this aspect but it appears

that based on the discrepancies marked as X-1, X-2, and X-3 in the statement

made by the appellant to the police, it has been decided that his evidence

cannot be relied upon.

As agreed correctly by the learned DSG, and pointed out by the learned

Counsel for the appellant, two of the discrepancies marked had been

statements, which are confessionary in nature, that cannot be used at the trial

against the appellant. The 3rd one had been about the intention, where the

appellant has stated that he had no intention to kill his father, which the

learned High Court Judge has considered relevant in convicting the appellant.

It is trite law that evidence of a case has to be considered in its totality and a

trial Judge should come to his or her findings based on the totality of the

evidence after having analyzed and evaluated such evidence.

It is also trite law that a trial Judge has to consider whether there was evidence

placed before the Court, which falls within the ambit of section 297 of the

Penal Code where culpable homicide would not amount to murder, even if it

was not a defence taken by the accused person.

Page 8 of 11

In the case of Rathnayake Mudiyanselage Karunarathne Vs. The Attorney

General C.A. 181/2009 decided on 21-11-2011, it was held,

If a plea of sudden and grave provocation is available from the evidence

of the prosecution itself, Court has a duty to consider such a plea even if

the accused did not raise it.

In the case of Gamini vs. The Attorney General (2011) 1 SLR 236, it was

held,

1. Though the accused-appellant in his defence did not take up the

defence of grave and sudden provocation, the trial Judge must consider

such a plea in favour of the accused-appellant if it emanates from the

evidence of the prosecution.

2. Failure on the part of the petitioner or his Counsel to take up a certain

line of defence does not relive a Judge of the responsibility of putting to the

jury such defence if it arises on the evidence.

I find that this was not a case where the line of defence had been a denial that

this incident took place. It is clear that the line of defence had been cumulative

provocation, which led to a sudden fight on the day of the incident.

The appellant had taken up the stand that although he assaulted the father, he

had no intention of killing him. This line of defence clearly shows that the

contention of the appellant had been that this was not murder, but culpable

homicide.

As agreed correctly by the learned DSG, other than rejecting the appellants

evidence on a wrong premise, the learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider whether there was evidence to substantiate a conviction in terms of

section 297.

Page 9 of 11

The evidence clearly shows that there had been provocation as a result of the

previous actions of the deceased. Although the deceased has been cared for by

the appellant, he had been a person used to consume liquor habitually. Under

the circumstances, it is quite possible that being a person of no income due to

his old age, he has pawned the deed relating to the land he and his son was

living.

According to the appellants evidence, it is he who redeemed the land

previously. This may have resulted in a friction between them.

However, the evidence of the neighbours clearly shows that the quarrels

between the father and the son were clear results of both of them being drunk.

The witnesses have stated that when they tried to intervene, both of them used

to get together and blame the neighbours.

This establishes the fact that although there had been previous provocations,

the incident, which led to the death of the deceased, was a result of a sudden

fight between the appellant and the deceased. PW-04s evidence clearly

establishes the fact that the argument that took place between the appellant

and the deceased had been over a deed, which substantiates the evidence of

the appellant in that regard.

The evidence of the witnesses also establishes the fact that the deceased was a

person who was in the habit of using foul language, which may have been the

reason for the appellant to attack the deceased, although that cannot be

justified. The material used by the appellant in the assault appears to be what

he could get his hands on at the time of the incident, and not something that

he purposely went looking for to attack the deceased. This also clearly shows

that the attack had been a result of an action without premeditation and due

the heat of passion.

Page 10 of 11

The relevant section 294 exception 4 of the Penal Code reads as follows.

Exception 4. Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed

without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon

a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue

advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation- It is immaterial in such cases which party offers

the provocation or commits the first assault.

Having considered the facts and the circumstances of this matter and the

relevant law, I am of the view that this is a matter where the conviction should

have been for culpable homicide not amounting to murder in terms of section

297 of the Penal Code, on the basis of a sudden fight as stipulated in exception

4 of section 294 of the Penal Code.

Accordingly, I set aside the conviction and the sentence of the appellant for the

offence of murder, as it cannot be allowed to stand, and convict the appellant

in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code on the basis of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder.

It is clear from the evidence of the JMO that the deceased had 13 contusions

on his body. Some of them were serious in nature, which had led to serious

internal injuries to the deceased. The deceased being a man of old age, it

should be well within the knowledge of the appellant that causing such bodily

injury would likely cause the death.

Therefore, acting in terms of the punishment set out in the 1st paragraph of

section 297, the appellant is sentenced to a term of 12 years rigorous

imprisonment. He is also ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 25,000/=, and in default

he shall serve a default sentence of 1-year simple imprisonment.

Page 11 of 11

Having considered the fact that the appellant had been in incarceration from

his date of conviction on 19-11-2021, it is ordered that the 12-year rigorous

imprisonment period shall deem to have commenced from 19-11-2021.

The appeal is partially allowed to the above extent.
