B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

This is an appeal against a Determination of the Board of Review relating to the

provisions of the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002 (hereinafter referred to as VAT).

The appeal relates to three quarterly taxable periods ending 31.12.2002, 31.03.2003, and

30.06.2003.

The Appellant, Senvec Lanka (Pvt) Limited, is a private limited liability company

engaged, inter alia, in the business of supply and maintenance of colour sorting machines

in Sri Lanka from Japan, by agreement dated 26.06.1996, purported to act as the sole

agent of Hattori Sei Sakusho Co. Ltd of Japan.

The Appellant submitted VAT returns for the quarterly taxable periods ending

31.12.2002, 31.03.2003, and 30.06.2003 and claimed an exemption under Section 7 (1) (c)

of the VAT Act.

The Assessor rejected the returns, and the Appellant, being dissatisfied with this

rejection, appealed to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (hereinafter referred

to as the "CGIR").

The CGIR, in his determination dated 08.06.2006, determined that the appellant

is not entitled to the exemption on the basis that the service for which the Appellant

received the commission was consumed inside Sri Lanka and dismissed the appeal.

The Appellant, being aggrieved by this decision, appealed to the Board of Review.

The Board of Review, in its Determination, having considered the submissions of the

representatives appearing for the Appellant and officials representing the CGIR,

confirmed the assessments and dismissed the appeal for the reasons set out in its

Determination dated 12.01.2010, thereby confirming the decision of the CGIR.

Page 3 of 12

Dissatisfied with this Determination of the Board of Review, the Appellant,

through its communication dated 09.02.2010, requested the Board to have a Case Stated

for the Opinion of this Court. Initially, the case stated, remitted by the Appellant to this

Court, contained three questions of law. Subsequently, it was agreed between the parties

to amend these questions, resulting in the following 10 questions of law:

i. Has the Board of Review failed to consider the Sole Agency Agreement entered

between the Principal and the Appellant?

ii. Has the Board failed to consider the effect of more particularly clauses 2(b), 2(d),

2(f), 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) of the Agreement between the Appellant and Principal?

iii. Has the Board of Review failed to consider the primary objects of the Appellant in

part or in its totality?

iv. Has the Board of Review failed to ascertain the services consumed by the Principal

in Japan in order to consider whether such services can be zero rated under Section

7(1) (b) (vii) if the VAT Act?

v. Has the Board of Review misdirected itself and/ or erred in determining that the

quotations issued by the Appellant on behalf of the Principal are 'offer documents

as the importer?

vi. Has the Board of Review erred or misdirected itself in determining that the

aforementioned 'quotations' have created contractual obligations between the

Appellant and the prospective importers of Colour Sorting machines?

vii. Is the additional assessment for the quarter ending 31.03.2003 as confirmed by the

Board of Review invalid by reason that Section 2 read with Section 31 of the VAT

Act requires assessments to be made separately for each taxable period?

viii. Is the additional assessment for the quarter ending 31.03.2003 invalid by reason

of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CGIR) failing to consider the time

of supply of each supply as required by Section 4 of the VAT Act?

ix. Are the additional assessments for the quarters ending 31.12.2002 and 31.03.2003

invalid since the relevant services are zero rated under Section 7(1)(b)(vii) of the

VAT Act?

x. Has the Board of Review failed to consider and/or misdirected itself in determining

whether the services rendered by the Appellant to the Principal should be

considered as services consumed by the Principal outside Sri Lanka as determined

in the judicial precedents of WYven UK Marketing Ltd. V The Commissioners

(1975) VAT Tribunal Reports 52 and Kidd & Zigrino Ltd. V. The Commissioners

(1974) VAT Tribunal Reports 173 cited before the Board?

Page 4 of 12

At the outset, it should be noted that the questions of law refer to section 7(1) (b)

(vii) of the VAT Act. However, according to our understanding section 7(1)(b)(vii) of the

VAT Act is not relevant to this case.

For clarity I will reproduce section 7(1)(b)(vii) of the VAT Act here:the provision

of services to overseas buyers by a garment buying office registered with the Textile Quota

Board established under the Textile Quota Board Act, No.33 of 1996, where payment for

such service is received in foreign currency, through a Bank of Sri Lanka in so far as such

services are identified by the Commissioner-General as being services essential for

facilitating the export of garments to such overseas buyers

The relevant provision to this case, instead, is section 7(1)(c) of the VAT Act.

There are two issues before us to determine in this appeal:

(i) According to the case stated, whether the Appellant is a principle or an agent

(ii) Whether the services for which the Appellant received commission was consumed

or utilized outside Sri Lanka

(i) Whether the Appellant is an agent or a principal:

According to the determination made by the CGIR dated 08/06/2006, he has stated the

reasons for his decision:

Accordingly, the Appellants only function was to provide services to the principal

in Japan. (Hattori Seisolusho Co Ltd) The appellants function is not limited to supplying

advice to the principal. Supplying advice alone would not result in the payment of

commission According to the agreement commission would not be paid if machineries

and spare parts were not supplied in Sri Lanka and if Payments for such supplies were

not realized in Japan. It is the responsibility of the Appellant to install the machinery in

Sri Lanka. Otherwise, machinery would have been of no value to the customers. Such

services were not supplied for the use of person outside Sri Lanka and they are directly

connected with the goods supplied in Sri Lanka.

In addition, under the above conditions of the agreement the Appellant acted as

principal and not as an agent and carries out a taxable activity in Sri Lanka. The services

supplied by the Appellant were directly connected with the goods in Sri Lanka and

Page 5 of 12

therefore treated as consumed in Sri Lanka and should not be treated as consumed

outside Sri Lanka. Hence, those services should not be taxed at zero rate. Therefore, only

the commission on sale of machinery overseas and overseas installation charges are

treated at zero rate.

The Board of Review in their determination dated 12.01.2010 also stated the same:

We find from an examination of the document marked Aannexure-1 submitted

with the written submission by the Appellant dated 23.06.2009 discloses that the

appellant has acted independently by itself and not as the Agent in the sale of Senvec

Colour Sorting machines in Sri Lanka. The Appellant opens letters of credit in its name

and all shipping documents such as invoices, bills of lading etc are in the name of

Appellant. On arrival of goods in Sri Lanka, the Appellants submits Cus-Decs to the

Customs to clear the goods and delivers them to various destinations. Thus it is seen that

the services supplied by the Appellant are so directly connected with the goods as a direct

importer

Therefore, the Board of Review holds the view that the Appellant did not act as an

agent but instead functioned as a principal.

However, upon examining the Sole Agency Agreement between the Appellant and

the Principal, the following facts come to light:

Hattori Seisakusho Co. Ltd of Japan, the foreign Principal in this case, is an

established supplier of Colour Sorting Machines and similar machinery. These machines

are custom-made to meet their clients' specific requirements, particularly catering to the

ultimate user's expectations.

The Appellant Company is the sole indenting agent for the Principals Colour

Sorting Machines in Sri Lanka. In 1996, the Appellant entered into a Sole Agency

Agreement with the Principal, which appointed the Appellant as the sole agent of the

Principal for a period of 10 years. According to Clause 1 of the said agreement, which is

available in the brief, the Appellant functioned as an Agent for Sales, Service, and

Maintenance of the Principals Senvec Colour Sorting Machines.

Page 6 of 12

As stipulated in the Sole Agency Agreement between the Principal and the

Appellant, the Appellant received a commission from the Principal for indenting,

promotional services, and market information provided by the Appellant in relation to the

Colour Sorting Machines that were exported and supplied directly by the Principal to

customers in Sri Lanka.

For clarity, Clause 2(b) & (c) of the said Agreement are reproduced:

2(b) That during the currency of this Agreement, the Principal will not sell or

otherwise deal in its Colour Sorting Machines in the Agents Territory through any other

Agent/Dealer. (emphasis added)

2(c) That any orders or enquiries relating to the Agents Territory received by the

Principal during the currency of the Agreement, will be passed on to the Agent to be dealt

with.

This clearly shows that even when the Principal receives an order directly, they

will redirect the order to the Appellant to proceed.

As per Clause 2(f)(i) and (ii) of the said Agreement between the Appellant and the

Principal, the mutually agreed commission is paid by the Principal to the Appellant only

in respect of machines supplied directly by the Principal to the customers in Sri Lanka.

For clarity the relevant clause of the Sole Agency Agreement is reproduced as

follows:

2 (f) (i) That the Principal will remit to the Agent in Sri Lanka the mutually agreed

Commission on the realization of Payment in Japan in the respect of each machine and

for any Spare Parts supplied directly to the Customers within the said territory. The

minimum quantities if any for such spare part orders will be advised by the Principal on

receipt of each request.

(ii) No Commission shall be payable for Spares directly imported by the Agent and

sold or marketed within the said territory

A plain reading of this clause suggests that the contract or the sale of direct

supplies is made directly between the Principal and the customers. Furthermore, Clause

2(f) (i) of the Sole Agency Agreement states that the commission received by the Appellant

Company as an Agent will only be realized upon the payment in Japan for machines and

spare parts supplied directly by the Principal to the customer.

Page 7 of 12

The Appellant contends that the Proforma Invoice represents the first step in the

process of importing goods, signifying the contract between the buyer and the seller. The

fact that the Proforma Invoice is issued in the name of the local customer and the payment

via Letter of Credit is made directly to the Principal confirms that the material

supply/transaction concerning machines and spares supplied directly involves the

Principal and the customer.

The Sole Agency Agreement, upon a plain reading, suggests that supplies made

directly to the customer by the Principal, for which the Appellant received commission,

are distinct from transactions where the Appellant acts as an importer, as provided in

Clause 2(f) (ii) of the Agreement. It should be noted in this regard that this clause of the

Agreement clearly states that no commission shall be payable where the Appellant acts

as an importer, directly importing, selling, and marketing Spare parts in Sri Lanka.

The Appellant submits that, when acting as an importer of spare parts and

providing services such as maintenance, the Appellant invoices the local customer. In

these sales, the Appellant does not receive a commission, in accordance with the

Agreement.

It is the opinion of this Court that the Board of Review has misinterpreted the

Clauses of the Sole Agency Agreement in determining that the Appellant acted as a

principal and not as an agent.

According to Blacks Law Dictionary (B. A. Garner and H. C. Black, Black's Law

Dictionary, Ninth Edition, 2009, p.1177), an agent is defined as one who is authorized

to act for or in place of another; a representative.

As discussed earlier, Clause 1 of the Sole Agency Agreement clearly states that the

Appellant functioned as an Agent for Sales, Service, and Maintenance of the Principals

Senvec Colour Sorting Machines.

It should be noted that Nawas J, in the case of Senvec Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v. CGIR,

CA Case No. Tax 05/2010, a case concerning an application of turnover involving the same

Appellant company and the CGIR, discussed whether the Appellant was acting as an

agent. It was determined that the Appellant was indeed acting in the capacity of an agent.

Page 8 of 12

I would like to quote the very statement of Nawaz J at this point:

The Agency Agreement (P2) which is at page 68-76 of the appeal brief is

demonstrative of the functions carried on by the Appellant. It shows that the Appellant

functioned as an agent of Hattori Seisakusho Co. Ltd, Japan. The Appellant canvassed

orders on behalf of the Principal for which the principal agreed to remit to the Agent in

Sri Lanka the mutually agreed Commission on the realization of the payment in Japan

Nawas J Further held that:

In international trade a Pro-forma Invoice is a preliminary bill of sale sent to

buyers in advance of shipment of delivery of goods. Typically, it gives a description of the

purchased items and notes the cost along with other important information, such as

shipping weight and transport charges. This document gives an indication as to the status

of the Appellant. This document strengthens the position of the Appellant that he was not

acting in any character otherwise than as an agent.

His Lordship further held that,

From the foregoing analysis of the transactions and the applicable law it is quite

clear that there is no import on the part of the Appellant. The document p4 at page 61

shows that the Appellant charges a commission from the customer for facilitating the

opening of the Letter of Credit (items B and C in p4), Clearing Charges (vide D,F, G,

H, I and J in P4 at page 61 of the brief). The Appellant also charges the Customer for

transportation and installation (vide: items K and L in P4). Installation takes place at

a cost to the customer as under Clause 2(f) of the Agency Agreement the Appellant is

entitled to a commission.

In Amadeus Lanka (Private) Limited V. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,

CA No. CA/TAX/04/2019 decided on 30.07.2021, Sampath K. B. Wijeratne J held:

On a careful consideration of the aforementioned clauses, I am of the view that

ALANKA, with the authority granted by AIPL, provides its services directly to the

subscribers in Sri Lanka, and the services are utilised within Sri Lanka. On the above

analysis of facts, it is my considered view that the TAC has correctly held that ALANKA

is an agent of AIPL.

Therefore, it is clear that the Board of Review has misinterpreted the Sole Agency

Agreement in their determination that the Appellant was not an agent of the Principal,

Page 9 of 12

but rather a principal himself. Accordingly, in answering questions of law Nos. (i) and (ii),

we hold that the Board of Review has incorrectly interpreted the Appellant as the

Principal. The Appellant is solely the Agent to the Principal in Japan.

(ii) Whether the services for which the Appellant received commission were

consumed or utilized outside Sri Lanka

The question that needs to be answered in this matter is whether the supply of

service made by the Appellant is zero-rated in terms of Section 7 (1) (c) of the VAT Act, as

amended. According to Section 7 (1) (c) of the VAT Act, the Appellant has to establish that

the service provided by the Appellant was consumed or utilized outside Sri Lanka.

In the Appellants written submission dated 22/12/2023, specifically in paragraphs

31, 32, and 33, it is stated that the Appellant functioned as an agent for (i) sales, (ii)

servicing, and (iii) maintenance. The Appellant contends that he received commission

from the foreign principal for indenting, promotional services, and market information

provided by the Appellant in relation to the machines. Once the local customer makes a

payment, the principal proceeds with the order and directly sells the machinery to the

customer. The foreign principal decides to export to the local customer only on the

recommendation of the Appellant.

Clause 2(c) of the Agreement clearly states: That any orders or enquiries relating

to the Agents Territory received by the Principal during the currency of the Agreement,

will be passed on to the Agent to be dealt with.

As the Appellant has rightly submitted, according to the Sole Agency Agreement,

the direct supply of the machinery is done by the Principal in Japan based on the

information provided by the Appellant, and thereafter the Appellant receives the

mutually agreed commission if the sale is successful.

Clause 3(b) of the Agreement states that the service provided by the Appellant to

the Principal involves promoting the Principal, taking orders from local customers, and

communicating their specific customized needs to the Principal. For clarity, the same

clause is reproduced as follows:

Page 10 of 12

3(b) that they will use best efforts and endeavors at all times during the currency

of this Agreement to promote the sale of the products covered by this Agreement. The

Agent shall forward promptly to the Principal any and all orders obtained by the agent

with complete details (emphasis added).

According to our understanding, the term promote the sale of products refers to

providing information about the customers and their needs to the Principal.

It is acknowledged that Clause 1 of the Agreement appoints the Appellant as the

sole and exclusive Agent for the Sale, Servicing, and Maintenance of the Senvec Colour

Sorting Machines and Spares in Sri Lanka. Additionally, by Clause 2(h) of the same

Agreement, the Principal agrees that the Agent may, at his discretion, invoice the

customers for services such as Installation, Maintenance, and Breakdown services.

Therefore, it is evident that the service provided by the Appellant to the Principal, for

which the Appellant received commission under Clause 2(f) (i) of the Agreement, involves

securing orders for the Principal from customers in Sri Lanka and communicating all

orders received to the Principal with the specific customized needs.

It is crucial to note that even if the Appellant refers a customer to the Principal,

the Appellant will receive a commission only where the ordered machinery or spare parts

are directly supplied by the Principal to the customers.

Thus, the indenting, promotional services, and market information are provided

by the Appellant as the Agent of the Principal, and the recipient of such service is the

Principal itself. It is observed that the commission is paid to the Appellant under the Sole

Agency Agreement for providing information about the customers and communicating the

specific customized needs of the customers to the Principal.

From the detailed analysis of the Sole Agency Agreement between the Appellant

and the Principal, it is clear that the primary service for which the Appellant received

commission was to provide information to the Principal, secure orders for the Principal,

and relay the specific customized needs of the local customers. The primary commission

received from the Principal was for the service of providing information about customers

and their needs.

The CGIR, considering the judgment in the case of Wyvern UK Marketing Ltd V

The Commissioners (1975) VATTR 52, submitted by the Appellant, stated in their

determination that the facts in connection with the present case are not similar to those

in the case referred to by the Appellant.

In Wlyvern UK Marketing Ltd V The Commissioners (1975) VATTR 52, the

Wlyvern Ltd the court held:

If this appeal is to succeed the Appellant must satisfy the tribunal that the

relevant services supplied by it were not used by a person present in the United Kingdom

or the Isle of Man. It is common ground that the relevant services were supplied by the

Appellant to an overseas trader in each of the two instances before the tribunal. The issue

is therefore limited to considering whether the supply of the relevant services to AB

Skandia in the one case, and to Lindshammar Glasbruk in the other case, as evidenced

by Exhibits A2 and A6 respectively, were used by a person present in the United Kingdom

or the Isle of Man. It will be convenient to take each case separately.

The services supplied by the Applicant to AB Skandia Consisted of advice sent to

the Swedish client. This advice is in our decision used when consideration is given to its

adoption or rejection. This was effected in Sweden when the advice of the Appellant was

considered by the Board of Management of the Company, or the officer to whom the

Company had delegated authority. Mr. MA Cooper relied on the occasional presence in

the United Kingdom of Herr Metz to support his proposition that the relevant supplies

were used by a person present in the United Kingdom. The tribunal does not accept that

use pf supplies made to a company in Sweden was made by a person present in the United

Kingdom when Herr Metz paid these visits. The purpose of the visits was not for the use

of the advice, but so that Herr Metz could ascertain facts for himself and advice himself

and his company as a result of his visit. The tribunal is satisfied that the supply by the

Appellant to AB Skandia in Sweden of its services in the form of advice did not result in

the use of such supply be a person present in the United Kingdom and the Appellants

appeal with regard to Exhibit A2 succeeds.

We are of the view that the above-mentioned case is similar to the present one, as

it also deals with information provided by the Appellant outside the country. In the

present case, the Appellant has provided information about the customers and their needs

to the Principal, enabling them to manufacture the machines according to the customers

Page 12 of 12

specific requirements. We believe that the CGIR has incorrectly interpreted the said

judgment in relation to the present case.

Therefore, in answering questions of law (iv) to (x), we hold that the Board of

Review has misinterpreted the provisions and the case law. We conclude that the

commission received by the Appellant is for a service consumed outside Sri Lanka.

Finally, in light of the responses provided to the above questions of law in favor of

the Appellant, we allow the appeal by setting aside the determination of the CGIR dated

08/06/2006 and the determination of the Board of Review dated 12/01/2010. The Registrar

is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the secretary of the TAC.

Appeal Allowed.
