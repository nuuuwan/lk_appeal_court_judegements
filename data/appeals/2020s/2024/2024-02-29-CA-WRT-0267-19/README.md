Counsel: Shantha Jayawardena and S. De Zoyza, Ms. H. Damunupola for the

Petitioners.

V. De Abrew, PC, ASG with Ms. C. Sri Nammuni, DSG for the

Respondents.

Written submissions tendered on:

21.09.2023 by the Petitioners

Argued: by way of written submissions

Decided on: 29.02.2024

S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioners to this Writ Application are police officers in the rank of Constable and

Sergeant. Police officers are paid a special combined allowance which is commonly

referred to as the combined allowance for traveling outside of their service stations

to perform official duties. The Petitioners state that from 1985, the combined allowance

was calculated in terms of Clause 4:5 of Chapter XIV of the Establishment Code of

1985 and the rates of the combined allowance depended on the salary scale of the

particular officer. By Circular No. 06/2006 dated 25.04.2006 issued by the Ministry of

Public Administration (marked as P3), the combined allowance of the Public Officers

was revised and it was paid at the rate of Rs. 350/-, Rs. 400/- and Rs. 500/- for the

33

primary, secondary and staff grade officers respectively. Thereafter, by the Public

Administrative Circular No. 06/2006(II) dated 10.11.2006 (marked as P4) it was

revised to determine the combined allowance on the salary scale which was also

subsequently amended by several Public Administrative Circulars (marked as P5, P6

and P10). However, the rates of the combined allowance paid remained unchanged.

On several occasions, the number of days on which the combined allowance of the

police officers was calculated increased (P2(a) and P7) and at one stage it was increased

up to 24 days per month with effect from 01.01.2013 by the letter dated 28.12.2012

(marked as P8(a)) issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning and

accordingly, the Inspector General of Police, the 1st Respondent (the IGP) issued the

Circular No. 01/2013 dated 07.01.2013 (marked as P8(b)). Thereafter, by the Public

Administrative Circular No. 20/2018 dated 21.08.2018 marked as P11, the rates of

combined allowance which were Rs. 350/-, Rs. 400/- and Rs. 500/- was increased to

Rs. 700/-, Rs. 800/- and Rs. 1000/- respectively.

24 days after P11 was issued, by the letter dated 14.09.2018 (marked as P12), the

Director General of the Department of National Budget (the 31st Respondent) informed

the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration Management and Law and Order

(the 32nd Respondent) that there is no possibility of releasing additional funds to pay

the combined allowance in terms of P11 and to make a request to the Salaries and Cadre

Commission in that regard. By the letter dated 20.09.2018 marked as P13 the 32nd

34

Respondent requested the Secretary to the Treasury (the 33rd Respondent) to release

funds for the payment of the increased combined allowance. However, by the letter

dated 23.10.2018 marked as P14, the 31st Respondent informed the 32nd Respondent

that even though the Treasury has given approval to increase the combined allowance,

it was not sanctioned by the Cabinet of Ministers. By the Cabinet Memorandum dated

28.01.2019 (marked as P15), the Minister of Finance (the 6th Respondent) proposed to

the Cabinet to pay the combined allowance to the police officers in terms of the Circular

marked as P11 only for 14 days. That proposal was approved by the Cabinet as reflected

on the letter dated 14.02.2019 marked as P16 issued by the Secretary to the Cabinet of

Ministers (the 35th Respondent). Thereafter, the IGP issued the letter dated 02.05.2019

(marked as P17) stating that the combined allowance to the police officers would be

paid as per the Cabinet decision marked as P16 and the Circular dated 10.05.2019

(marked as P18) setting out the basis of calculating it for the police officers who serve

other than in the North and East areas.

The Petitioners state that the combined allowance was paid for 24 days per month for

officers who serve in non-operational areas and 30 days per month for officers who

serve in the North and East areas from the year 2014 up to December 2018 (P14(a)).

The argument of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners is that the decision

to reduce the combined allowance for 14 days as reflected in P16, P17 and P18 is ultra

vires, unreasonable, irrational, violation of their legitimate expectation and natural

justice and the number of days the combined allowance should be paid is not a question

35

of policy that falls within the purview of Cabinet of Ministers. In that scenario, the

Petitioners seek the following substantive reliefs, inter alia, in the prayer to the Petition.

(c) Grant and issue an order in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision

reflected in P16, P17 and P18 to reduce the Special Combined Allowance paid to

Police Officers to a maximum of 14 days;

(d) Grant and issue an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 49th

Respondents and/or anyone or more of them to calculate and pay and/or take

necessary steps to pay the Special Combined Allowance for 24 days, in accordance

with P8(a);

(e) Grant and issue an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 49th

Respondents and/or anyone or more of them to calculate and pay and/or take

necessary steps to pay the increased Special Combined Allowance as per the Public

Administration Circular No. 20/2018 for a maximum of 24 days per month;

(f) Grant and issue an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to

49th Respondents and/or anyone or more of them to calculate and pay and/or take

necessary steps to pay the increased Special Combined Allowance as per the

Public Administration Circular No. 20/2018 for a maximum of 24 days per month

with effect from 23.08.2018;

36

The position of the learned ASG appearing for the Respondents is that a special

combined allowance mentioned in P16 was paid to the police officers in addition to the

combined allowance paid to all the government employees under Chapter XIV of the

Establishment Code. Further, although several amendments were made to the Public

Administration Circulars from time to time until the year 2018, the rates applied to

calculate the combined allowance remained unchanged and only by the Circular dated

21.08.2018 marked as P11 the rates were increased. Moreover, even though the said

Circular marked as P11 refers to an officer who is spending more than 24 hours outside

his station of service, the combined allowance was paid to the police officers

irrespective of whether they travel outside of their service station or not. Further, the

Petitioners have not disclosed how the combined allowance was decreased since the

rates payable were increased despite the number of days being decreased. The learned

ASG appearing for the Respondents submitted that in pursuant to the Cabinet decision

dated 12.09.2022, by the Circular dated 13.12.2022 marked as 1R1 the number of days

to which the combined allowance had to pay was increased to 21 days with effect from

01.01.2023.

It is the contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners that, the

Combined allowance was paid for 24 days per month for officers who work in non-

operational areas and 30 days per month for officers who serve in North and East areas.

The Petitioners were paid the combined allowance for 24 days up to the year 2019 as

stipulated in the document marked as P14(a) which indicates the payment of the

37

combined allowance for the years 2018 and 2019 in which the 1st Petitioner had been

paid for 24 days at the rate of Rs. 400/-. However, abruptly in 2019, the said allowance

paid for 24 days was reduced to 14 days per month. The argument of the learned

Counsel appearing for the Petitioners is that the said reduction of the combined

allowance violates the legitimate expectation of the Petitioners who received the

increased combined allowance from the year 2013 to 2019 and the Petitioners have a

legitimate expectation that the Respondents would continue to pay the combined

allowance as per P8(a) and P8(b) and that the Respondents would not illegally reduce

the combined allowance without any decision of the National Salaries and Cadre

Commission.

Firstly, this Court must decide whether the Petitioners to this Writ Application have a

legitimate expectation. In Administrative Law by H. W. R. Wade and C. F. Forsyth

(11th edn.) defines the concept of legitimate expectation in the following manner;

Where some boon or benefit has been promised by an official (or has been

regularly granted by the official in similar circumstances), that boon or benefit

may be legitimately expected by those who have placed their trust in the promises

of the officials. It would be unfair to dash those expectations without at least

granting the person affected an opportunity to show the official why his discretion

should be exercised in a way that fulfil his expectations. Hence there has developed

a doctrine of the protection of legitimate expectation

38

It is not enough that an expectation should exists; it must in addition be

legitimate. A crucial requirement is that the assurance must itself be clear,

unequivocal and unambiguous. The test is how on a fair reading of the promise it

would have been reasonably understood by those to whom it was made.

First of all, for an expectation to be legitimate it must be founded upon a promise

or practice of a public authority that is said to be bound fulfil the expectation.

Second, clear statutory words, of course, override any expectation howsoever

founded. Third, the notification of a relevant change of policy destroys any

expectation founded upon the earlier policy, fourth, there is no artificial

restriction in the material on which a legitimate expectation rests may be based.

Fifth, the individual seeking protection of the expectation must themselves deal

fairly with the public authority, sixth, consideration of the expectation may be

beyond the jurisdiction of the court. (emphasis added)

In Schimdt Vs Secretary of Home Affairs1 it was held that official statements of policy

may cancel legitimate expectation; just as they may create it.

Ginigathgala Mohandiramlage Nimalsiri Vs Colonel P.P.J. Fernando and Others2,

Priyantha Jayawardena, PC. J. observed that,

1 [1969] 1 All ER 904.

2 SC FR No. 256/2010 SC. Minute of 17.09.2015

39

an expectation is considered to be legitimate where it is founded upon a

promise or practice by the authority that is said to be bound to fulfil the

expectation. Therefore, an expectation reasonably entertained by a person may

not be considered as legitimate because of some countervailing consideration of

policy or law. Further, clear statutory words override any expectation

howsoever founded. Where an expectation is founded on a policy and later a

relevant change of policy is notified, the expectation founded on the previous

policy cannot be considered as legitimate. (emphasis added)

Considering the facts and circumstances of the Writ Application at hand, in the light of

the above-mentioned text and the authorities, the Court can conclude that even though

the Petitioners had been paid the combined allowance for 24 days from 01.01.2013 up

to the year 2019 in terms of P8(a) and P8(b) as shown in the document marked as P14(a)

for 5 years, the change made by the Cabinet Decision marked as P16, override the

legitimate expectation of the Petitioners.

The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners argues that the reduction of the

Combined allowance as per P16, P17 and P18 is ultra vires for the reason that it exceeds

the powers of the Cabinet of Ministers and the number of days which the Combined

allowance should be paid is not a matter of policy within the ambit of powers of the

Cabinet of Ministers. Further, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners argues

that the decision to reduce 24 days to 14 days is unreasonable, irrational and violates

40

the principles of Natural Justice. The learned ASG appearing for the Respondents argue

that the Cabinet of Ministers has the power and authority to amend and vary any policy

matters pertaining to the maintenance of law and order and the Circulars relied on by

the Petitioners are based on the provisions of the Establishment Code which also has

been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. Moreover, the Cabinet of Ministers have

considered the observations of the Ministry of Finance (P15) and approved the

combined allowance for 14 days and the learned ASG has highlighted the fact that an

additional amount of about Rs. 10,000 Million per annum is required to pay the

combined allowance of the officers of the Police Department alone in a circumstance

where the salaries of the Police Officers have also been increased already.

This Court will now look into whether the decisions reflected in P16, P17 and P18 are

irrational and unreasonable as claimed by the Petitioners. Lord Diplock in Council of

Civil Service Unions Vs. Minister for the Civil Service3 defining grounds for judicial

review states that,

Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without reiterating

any analysis of the steps by which the development has come about, one can

conveniently classify under three heads the grounds upon which administrative

action is subject to control by judicial review. The first ground I would call

illegality, the second irrationality and the third procedural impropriety.

3 (1985) AC 374 (HL).

41

By 'irrationality' I mean what can by now be succinctly referred to as

'Wednesbury unreasonableness' (see Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd

v Wednesbury Corp [1948] 1 KB 223). It applies to a decision which is so

outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no

sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could

have arrived at it. Whether a decision falls within this category is a question that

judges by their training and experience should be well equipped to answer, or

else there would be something badly wrong with our judicial system....

In Secretary of State for Education and Science Vs. Tameside Metropolitan Borough

Council4, it was held that,

In public law, unreasonable as descriptive of the way in which a public

authority has purported to exercise a discretion vested in it by statute has become

a term of legal art. To fall within this expression, it must be conduct which no

sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities would have

decided to adopt.

Under the circumstances mentioned above the Court has to decide whether the decision

to reduce the number of days from 24 days to 14 days in paying the combined allowance

is one that no sensible person who applies his mind to the question could have arrived

at. It is evident from the Cabinet decision marked as P16 that it has relied on the

4 [1977] AC 1014 at page 1064.

42

observations of the Minister of Finance and Mass Media marked as P15 where it

recommends paying the combined allowance according to the new rates stipulated in

the Circular marked as P11 while reducing the number of days to 14. When taking into

consideration the document marked as P14(a), this Court can observe that even though

the number of days has been reduced to 14 days consequent to the Cabinet decision

marked as P16, the combined allowance that was paid to the Petitioners from January

2019 has been increased when compared with the combined allowance paid for 24 days

at the rates applied prior to the Circular marked P11 came in to force. This Court is of

the view that the Cabinet decision marked as P16 is not one that no sensible person who

applies his mind to the matter to be decided could have arrived at. Therefore, the said

Cabinet decision is neither irrational nor unreasonable and therefore the documents

marked as P17 and P18 which have been released upon the Cabinet decision marked as

P16 are neither irrational nor unreasonable.

The Petitioners are seeking reliefs relying on the letter issued by the Ministry of Finance

and Planning marked as P8(a) issued on 28.12.2012 and the IGP Circular marked as

P8(b) dated 07.01.2013 which increased the number of days applicable to calculate the

combined allowance to 24 days. However, it is the view of this Court that the letter

marked as P8(a) has become futile once the Cabinet decision marked as P16 came into

force on 14.02.2019. Therefore, it is the view of this Court that the Petitioners are not

entitled to seek reliefs relying upon P8(a). Dr. Sunil Coorey in Principles of

43

Administrative Law in Sri Lanka (4th Ed, Volume 2) at page 1172 explains futility as

follows,

Certiorari will not be issued to quash a particular exercise of power if it be

futile to do so because it is no more operational or it has had its effect.

Marsoof, PC. J (P/CA) (as he then was) in the case of Ratnasiri and others Vs Ellawala

and others5 held that;

"This court is mindful of the fact that the prerogative remedies it is empowered

to grant in these proceedings are not available as of right. Court has a

discretion in regard to the grant of relief in the exercise of its supervisory

jurisdiction. It has been held time and time again by our Courts that "A writ...

will not issue where it would be vexatious or futile."

In the case of Siddeek Vs Jacolyn Seneviratne6 Soza J. observed that,

The Court will have regard to the special circumstances of the case before It,

before issuing a writ of certiorari. The writ of certiorari clearly will not issue

where the end result will be futility, frustration, injustice and illegality.

The Respondents have produced the IGPs Circular dated 13.12.2022 marked as 1R1

which increased the number of days to 21 days the combined allowance was paid. The

contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners with that regard is that

increasing the number of days from 14 days to 21 days by the said Circular marked as

1R1 itself establishes that the Petitioners and, the police officers in general are entitled

to the increased combined allowance. In the Circular marked as 1R1, it has been stated

that the number of days has been increased to 21 days pursuant to a Cabinet decision

dated 12.09.2022. Likewise, the Cabinet decision marked as P16 makes the letter

marked as P8(a) futile and P16 also will be futile after the Circular marked as 1R1 came

into operation pursuant to the Cabinet decision dated 12.09.2022. As a result, P17 and

P18 also become futile for the reason that those two documents were based on the

Cabinet decision marked as P16. It is the view of this Court that even though the number

of days has been reduced to 14 days from 24 days by the Cabinet decision marked as

P16, there had been no reduction of the combined allowance paid to the Petitioners but

it has been increased. As discussed above, the Cabinet Decision marked as P16, the

documents marked as P17 and P18 are neither irrational nor unreasonable. Therefore,

the Petitioners are not entitled to the reliefs prayed for in the Petition to this Application.

Therefore, this Court dismisses this Application. No costs ordered.
