d) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing

Court in Kandy in order to recover a sum of Rs. 1,860,060.00/- being

the purported arrears and the surcharges levied on such arrears

payable as outstanding EPF contributions:

This application was supported for interim relief sought, on 09.06.2020 and

this Court was satisfied, inter alia, to issue notices and made an interim order

in terms of prayer (f) to the Petition against the 1st and 2nd Respondents from

taking any steps in pursuance of the documents marked P-7, P-8, P-12, and

P-16, until the final determination of this application. A stay order in terms

of prayer (g) to the Petition was also issued staying further proceedings which

are due in the case bearing No. LT/210/2019/EPF-N at the Labour Tribunal

of Kandy until the final determination of this application.

The Petitioner through his application dated 22.11.2019 has sought to

challenge the decisions contained in documents marked P8, P12 and Pl6

made to recover arears of contributions to the Employees' Provident Fund

(EPF) in relation to the 3rd Respondent who claims to have been employed

under the Petitioner. Further, the Petitioner alleges that the 1st and 2nd

Respondents decision that the Petitioner as an employer is liable to pay EPF

as per document marked P-7 to the Petition, is illegal and ultra vires of the

power of the said Respondents in terms of the Employees Provident Fund Act.

The Petitioner claims to be a non-profit charitable organization incorporated

on 31.12.2003, under and in terms of Section 21 of the Companies Act

No. 17 of 1982 and thereafter re-registered under the Companies Act No. 7 of

2007 as a Company Limited by Guarantee. The Petitioner was allowed to

dispense with the word 'Limited' since the Registrar of Companies was

Page 4 of 10

satisfied that the objectives of the Petitioner were in accordance with Section

34 of the said Act No.7 of 2007 (which provides that where a company limited

by guarantee is to be formed for promoting commerce, art, science, religion,

charity, sport, or any other useful object, and intends to apply its profits, if any,

or other income in promoting its objects, and to prohibit the payment of any

dividend to its members, it shall dispense with the use of the word Limited).

The Petitioner also registered as a Voluntary Service Organization on

26.05.2017 under and in terms of Voluntary Social Service Organizations

(Registration and Supervision) Act No 31 of 1980.

The Petitioner submits that it operates through volunteers, research

personnel and scientists who render their services on a voluntary basis. The

Petitioner Company does not have more than l0 employees. In this context,

The Petitioner had obtained the services of the 3rd Respondent on an ad hoc

basis wherein she had rendered her services for certain projects and her

commitment towards such projects ended with the closure of such projects.

The Principal Scientist of the Petitioner addressed a letter dated I1.05.2017

to the 3rd Respondent stating that the 3rd Respondent had vacated her post in

respect of the project that was assigned to her at that time purportedly due

to her failure to complete the project work and for being absent from office

during review meetings of the said project.

The 3rd Respondent subsequently had instituted action against the Petitioner

organization and two others at the Labour Tribunal No 3 of Kandy by her

application bearing no. LT/03/49/49/2017 dated 26.05.2017 claiming that

she was employed as a Document Assistant under the Petitioner since

01.02.2002 and that she was unjustly terminated from service. The Petitioner

filed its amended answer dated 05.01.2018 (marked P-4) stating, inter alia,

that there is no contract of employment between the 3rd Respondent and the

Petitioner. In terms of documents marked P-7, P-8, P-12 and P-16, it is

contended that the period that the Petitioner is liable to contribute to EPF is

with effect from 01.02.2002 whereas the Petitioner submits that it was

Page 5 of 10

incorporated only on 31.12.2003 and as such, the said notices are null and

void.

The Petitioner had informed the Additional Commissioner of Labour by letter

dated 06.09.2019 (marked 'P-6(i)), inter alia, that the 3rd Respondent had

been employed by Natural Resources Management Services (Pvt) Ltd from the

24.01.2002 and that the said Natural Resources Management Services

operates under the ownership of the Mahaweli Authority, and therefore is in

no way connected or affiliated with the Petitioner (documents marked 'P-6 (ii)''

to 'P-6 (v)). Further, the Petitioner alleges that certain documents produced

by the 3rd Respondent as contract of employment are forged/fraudulent

documents.

The Petitioners fundamental position is that it is a small, non-profit,

charitable organization with less than 10 employees and thus, the Petitioner

is not liable to contribute to the EPF in accordance with Section 10(3) of the

EPF Act and Gazette notification marked P-11 to the Petition. Further, it is

submitted that the Certificate marked P-16 to the Petition had been filed by

the 1st and 2nd Respondents without considering the provisions of Section 17

of the EPF Act. The Petitioner further alleges that there is no contract of

employment between the 3rd Respondent and the Petitioner, and that the 3rd

Respondent provided her services to the Petitioner on an ad hoc basis and her

claim that she has been in continuous employment under the Petitioner is

false. The Petitioner further contends that the 1st and 2nd Respondents issued

P-7 without affording the Petitioner to be heard which is contrary to the

Principles of Natural justice. And further arbitrarily registering the Petitioner

for the purpose of EPF when the same had a legitimate expectation that it

would be excluded from paying EPF due to it being a charitable organization.

The position of the 1st and 2nd Respondent is that the Petitioner has failed to

name the necessary parties as Respondents, the Petitioner is guilty of laches

and is not entitled to seek any discretionary remedy, the Petitioner has not

engaged in any welfare or public activities as a charitable organization and

Page 6 of 10

that the Petitioner is an organization which generates an income and is liable

to make payment of statutory dues to its employees. The 3rd Respondent also

claims that the Petitioner is not a non-profit charitable organization and is

therefore liable to pay EPF.

The crux of this application is to determine whether the Petitioner is liable to

be registered as an employer to pay EPF.

Section 8 of the EPF Act (as amended) provides as follows:

(1) Any employment, including any employment in the service of a

corporation whose capital or a part of whose capital is provided by the

Government, may by regulation be declared to be a covered employment.

(2) Regulations may be made

(b) to treat as not being a covered employment or to disregard

(i) employment under a person who employs less than a prescribed

minimum number of employees;

(ii) employment of a person in the service or for the purposes of the trade

or business, or as a partner, of that person's spouse.

Section 10 of the EPF Act (as amended) provides as follows:

(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section and of section

27, an employee to whom this Act applies shall, in respect of each month

during which he works in a covered employment, be liable to pay to the

Fund a contribution of an amount equal to eight per centum of his total

earnings from that employment during that month.

(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section and of section

27, the employer of every employee to whom this Act applies and who is

liable to pay contributions to the Fund shall, in respect of each month

during which such employee is in a covered employment under such

Page 7 of 10

employer, be liable to pay to the Fund on or before the last day of the

succeeding month, a contribution of an amount equal to twelve per

centum of such employee's total earnings from that employment during

that month.

(3) The liability of an employee in a covered employment and his employer

to pay contributions under this section shall commence on the day

immediately after the date fixed in relation to such employment by the

Minister by Order published in the Gazette. Different dates may be fixed

under this subsection for different classes of employees in the same

covered employment.

Attention of Court is drawn towards Gazette Notification bearing No. 653/16

dated 03.03.1991 containing an order by the Minister published under

Section 10 (3) of the Act which provides that any charitable organization for

religious observances or social services employing 10 or more employees, fall

under a covered employment.

In British Council v. Commissioner of Labour (2003 (3) SLR 184), Shiranee

Tilakawardena J refers to the Amending Act No. 44 of 1958 to Income Law

Ordinance which defines a Charitable institution as follows:

"..a corporation established for a charitable purpose only or engaged

solely in carrying out a charitable purpose. Charitable purpose is defined

as a purpose for the benefit of the public or any section of the public in or

outside Ceylon or any of the following categories:

1. The relief of poverty

2. The advancement of education or knowledge

3. The advancement of religion or maintenance of religious rites and

practices

4. Any other purpose beneficial or of interest to mankind not falling within

any of the preceding categories."

Page 8 of 10

In the said context, while the Petitioner does not directly engage in acts of

charity per se, this Court observes that the Petitioner is in compliance with

the 2nd and 4th limb referred to above. Furthermore, this Court is mindful of

the Objectives of the Petitioner Organization as provided for by its articles

which stipules that its primary aim is to provide technical guidance,

environmental monitoring, climate and environmental impact assessment,

and adaptation, with a focus on social, economic livelihood, and sustainability

aspects. The Petitioner is also a company limited by guarantee where no

profits are transferred to members as dividends or bonuses. It is also noted

that the Petitioner has been actively involved in various charitable and public

welfare activities. It has collaborated with government organizations,

contributed to poverty relief, promoted education, engaged in environmental

protection, and participated in societally relevant research. While the

Petitioner emphasizes its status as a non-profit organization, it has also been

registered as a Voluntary Service Organization under the Voluntary Social

Service Organizations (Registration) Act No. 31 of 1980.

Therefore, this Court is inclined to accept the Petitioners position that it is

not engaged in any covered employment as provided for by the EPF Act and

is not liable for payment of EPF.

The 2nd Respondent's office received a complaint dated 2017.04.24 (marked

'1R11') from the 3rd Respondent for non-payment of statutory dues by the

Petitioner (Statement of the Respondent dated 2017.06.22 marked '1R12',

Affidavit of the 3rd Respondent marked '1R13'). Upon such complaint being

received, an inquiry was held on 2017.07.13 with the participation of the

representatives of the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent. It is submitted by

the Respondents that based on the available material tendered by the 3rd

Respondent and with the findings of the inquiry, the inquiry officer

determined that there was no evidence to hold that the Petitioner was a

charitable organisation and that it is evident that an employer-employee

relationship exists. It concluded that the statutory dues payable to the 3rd

Page 9 of 10

Respondent has to be recovered (Inquiry report dated 2017.12.07 marked

'1R18').

Further to the above, while there had not been a contract of employment

between the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent, the EQD report tendered to

Court suggests that documents marked R3, R4 and R7 do not carry original

signatures.

However, as the Petitioner has satisfied that it is not an employer in covered

employment within the provisions of the EPF Act, the need to comply with

such provisions does not arise.

With regard to the position of the Respondents, the attention of this Court is

drawn to the Sisilamba case (CA Writ Application No. 71/2015- CA Minutes

09.05.2017) wherein Justice Padman Surasena has stated in his judgment

inter alia that:

This would be an appropriate juncture to turn to the legal submission made on behalf of the 1st and 2nd Respondents. The position taken up by the learned Deputy Solicitor General on behalf of them is that a writ cannot lie since the issue of whether this organization is a welfare organization or not is a disputed fact. It is the view of this Court, in the light of the above material, that the 1st and the 2nd Respondents do not appear to have or are in a position to controvert any of the above facts leading to the negation of the proposition that the 3rd Respondent is an employee of the 1st Petitioner. All that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have done is to have made a bare statement that a writ cannot lie since the issue whether the 1st Petitioner is a welfare organization or not is a disputed fact. It must be stressed by this Court that mere denial of a fact by a party or a mere statement that a fact is a disputed fact would not be sufficient to push such a fact under the umbrella of disputed facts. If this Court is to consider such mere denial to be sufficient, this Court would be compelled to refuse the issuance of writs whenever any such statement in the form of 'I deny,' 'I am unaware,' 'I place the burden on the other party to prove,'

Page 10 of 10

etc., has been averred by the opposite party, as has been the case more often than not. It is the view of this Court, in the light of the above material, that the 1st and the 2nd Respondents do not appear to have or are in a position to controvert any of the above facts leading to the negation of the proposition that the 3rd Respondent is an employee of the 1st Petitioner. All that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have done is to have made a bare statement that a writ cannot lie since the issue whether the 1st Petitioner is a welfare organization or not is a disputed fact. Another significant observation that this Court could make with regard to the liability of the 1st Petitioner to contribute to EPF is that the 1st and the 2nd Respondents at no time had even attempted to state that the Petitioner is a commercial organization. The material available in this case points strongly to the opposite of it. Thus, the irresistible conclusion that this Court could arrive at from the above material is that the Petitioners are not liable to contribute to EPF in respect of the services of the 3rd Respondent, as the 3rd Respondent has not been engaged in a covered employment within the meaning of the EPF Act.

For the above reasons, I allow the Application of the Petitioner and grant and

issue Writs of Certiorari quashing the decisions in documents marked P-7,

P-8, P-12 and P-16 as prayed for in prayers (b), (c), (d) and (e) of the petition.

Application allowed. No costs.
