Depanama, Pannipitiya. Plaintiff-Respondent Before: Hon. D.N. Samarakoon, J.

Counsel: Varuna Nanayakkara for the Defendant-Petitioner.

The Plaintiff-Respondent absent and unrepresented despite the Fiscals Report dated 25.04.2024 saying that notices were personally served on Maduri Priyanka Thushari Perera.

Argued on: The petitioner moved to dispose the case on written submissions

which was permitted.

Written submission tendered on: 29.04.2024 by the Defendant- Petitioner.

Decided on: 10.05.2024

D. N. Samarakoon J.,

The defendant Petitioners additional list was dated 19.10.2020.

The permission was sought to mark the documents on 30.04.2021, after 6

months.

Firstly the affidavit marked as X.4.

The plaintiff respondent objected.

It was under section 7 of Act No. 14 of 1995.

The basis was that computer evidence only with 45 days prior notice.

The defendant submitted to the District Court that the affidavit and photographs

referred to in it were sought to be marked giving 6 months prior notice.

The District Court allowed the marking of the affidavit as D.08.

Then it was sought to mark photographs attached to the affidavit.

The plaintiff objected.

The objection was upheld on the following grounds,

(I) the photographs not referred to in the original list

(II) the inclusion of those in the additional list means that they have not

been duly listed

(Iii) their relevance under section 175 of the Civil Procedure Code have not

been shown

(iv) they seem to be photographs taken from a mobile telephone

(V) the affidavit D.08 already admitted do not confirm these photographs

(Vi) since the original list does not refer to these photographs they cannot

be admitted

Prior to considering any section or a decided case which the petitioner now

relies before this Court, it appears, that, there is a fundamental error in the

4 | C . A . R I I 1 8 2 0 2 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

lopsided logic adopted by the learned District Judge of Nugegoda in her two

orders dated 30.04.2021.

The affidavit that was allowed to be marked in evidence is at page 18 of the brief.

It says as follows [English rendering]

The photographs X.1 to X.8 which the defendant in this case proposes to

mark in evidence were,

(a) Captured on 28.04.2013 by me

(b) By the mobile telephone Nokia (N.9) having telephone number

0786868640

(c) Converted to photographs through my computer

(d) In which process the telephone and the computer functioned properly

(e) After that the photographs were not altered or edited

I plead X.1 to X.8 may be accepted as part and parcel of this [affidavit].

As already said the learned District Judge admitted the affidavit as D. 08.

She does so at page 05 of proceedings dated 30.04.2021.

The fascination of it, so to say, is that, having done so, at page 5, before the dust

settles, she rejects the attached photographs, at page 7, to which the same

considerations must apply on the basis that,

(I) it is an unlisted document (despite having been listed and notified 6

months ago, just as the affidavit D. 08 she just admitted)

(II) the photographs are not taken responsibility of by the affidavit (refer

to the extract above from the affidavit) and

(III) their necessity not being explained under section 175 of the Civil

Procedure Code despite, as she says, although however the affidavit D.08

is now admitted, Kese wethath D.08 washayen idiripath kara ethi

diwrum prakashaya denata lakunu kara ethath.

It appears that the basis to distinguish the two conclusions cannot be within the

law.

D. 08 is an affidavit.

It was not listed in the original list.

It was listed in the subsequent list.

The latter was 6 months prior to trial date.

So, it was admitted.

Does a different regime apply to photographs attached to D.08?

D.08, among other things, says the following,

(i) the 08 photographs were taken by the defendant petitioner on

28.04.2013

(ii) They were taken by the mobile telephone Nokia N.9 having the number

0786868640

(iii) they were converted to images by the computer of the petitioner.

(iv) in doing so, that telephone and the computer functioned correctly

(v) after the computer converted them to images, they were not changed or

edited.

(vi) those photographs are pleaded as part and parcel of the affidavit which

was admitted in evidence as D.08

The above is computer evidence.

Section 05 of Evidence (Special Provisions) Act. No. 14 of 1995 applies.

It says

PART II

COMPUTER EVIDENCE

Computer Evidence

5.

(1) In any proceeding where direct oral evidence of fact would be

admissible, any information contained in any statement produced by a

computer and tending to establish that fact shall be admissible as evidence

of that fact, if it is shown that-

(a) subject to subsection (2), the statement in the form that it was

produced, or the form in which it is reproduced, is capable of being

perceived by the senses;

(b) at all material times the computer producing the statement was

operating properly or, if it was not, any respect in which it was not

operating properly or out of operation, was not of such a nature as to affect

the production of the statement or the accuracy of the information

contained therein;

(c) The information supplied to the computer was accurate and the

information contained in the statement reproduces or is derived from, the

Information so supplied to the computer:

Provided that where information contained in the statement is shown to

have been produced by the computer over a period during which the

computer was used regularly to store or process information for the

purpose of any activity carried on regularly over that period, it shall be

sufficient to show that-

(a) during the said period there was regularly supplied to the

computer, in the ordinary course of such activity, information of the

7 | C . A . R I I 1 8 2 0 2 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

kind contained in the statement or of the kind from which the

information as contained is derived; and

(b) the information contained in the statement reproduces, or is

derived from, information regularly supplied to the computer in the

ordinary course of such activity.

The above section, or any other section of that particular Act does not say, that,

either computer evidence, which term represents the above photographs as per

the contents of D.08; and or, the conventional photographs produced by an

optical camera that works with light rays and celluloid1 film, developed in a

dark room ordinarily called an studio, must be listed for the purpose of

notification to the opposing party 45 days, or any other number of days, prior to

the date the case is first fixed, either for trial, inquiry or pre trial.

That Act uses the word photo only once in the word duplicate under section

12, which is the interpretation section.

That Act does not use the word first.

There was a recent case decided by another bench of the Court of Appeal, which

purported to impose such a condition, that such evidence must be listed prior to

the prescribed number of days of the date first fixed for trial, etc., which was

distinguished and not followed by me in my order refusing to issue notice dated

10.11.2023 which was given with the concurrence of Iddawala J., in the following

case.

That is KAATSU HIGHLY ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY TRAINING

No: CPA/117/2023, P H C Colombo Case No. HCRA 74/2023 L T Colombo

Application No. 1/35/2021.

In that case, the item of special evidence had been listed 45 days prior to the

actual date on which the inquiry before the Labour Tribunal commenced, but

not before the first fixed date of inquiry.

The learned President of the Labour Tribunal and the learned High Court Judge

in appeal held against the party who relied on the purported proposition that

listing must be done 45 days prior to the date first fixed for inquiry.

The case Professor Sarath Wijesuriya and another vs. Dr. Anuruddha

Padeniya C.A./COC/5/2017 dated 23rd November 2021 decided in the Court

of Appeal which expounded such a proposition had not been followed.

In refusing to follow that case in C A PHC APN No: CPA/117/2023 I said,

In the abovementioned case of Professor Sarath Wijesuriya and

another vs. Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya C.A./COC/5/2017, the learned

Judges of the Court of Appeal has said,

I am in no position to agree with the contention of the Learned

Presidents Counsel that the date fixed for inquiry or trial as

mentioned in Section 07 of the Act means any date fixed for the trial

or further trial for that matter. It is clear that the trial in this action

has commended on 04-09-2019. Admittedly, by that time the

complainants have failed to give the required notice under Section

07 of the Act.

The relevant section says,

(1) The following provisions shall apply where any party to a

proceeding proposes to tender any evidence under section 4 or 5, in

such proceeding-

9 | C . A . R I I 1 8 2 0 2 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

(a) the party proposing to tender such evidence shall, not later than

forty-five days before the date fixed for inquiry or trial file, or

cause to be filed, in Court, after notice to the opposing party, a

list of such evidence as is proposed to be tendered by that party,

together with a copy of such evidence or such particulars thereof

as is sufficient to enable the party to understand the nature of

the evidence

It does not say, not later than fourty five days before the date first

fixed for inquiry or trial.

But the interpretation of that section by the Court of Appeal in the above

case C. A./COC/5/2017 dated 23rd November 2021 requires the word

first or any other word conveying that meaning to be inserted in the

section.

In Seaford Court Estates Ld. Vs. Asher [1949] K. B. 481, Denning L. J.,

has said that,

We do not sit here to pull the language of Parliament and

Ministers to pieces and make nonsense of it. That is an easy

thing to do and it is a thing to which lawyers are too often

prone. We sit here to find out the intention of Parliament and

of Ministers and carry it out and we do this better by filling in

the gaps and making sense of the enactment than by opening it

up to destructive analysis.

This was repeated in Magor and St. Mellons Rural District Council vs.

Newport Corporation, 1950 2 All E. R 1226. Denning L. J., was in a

minority in that case.

When the matter came to the House of Lords, in Magor and St. Mellons

Rural District Council vs. Newport Corporation, 1951 2 All E R 839 at

845, the majority of the House of Lords, except Lord Radcliff, confirmed

10 | C . A . R I I 1 8 2 0 2 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal. Lord Simmonds made a

speech only as a criticism of Denning L. J.s dissenting judgment in the

lower court.

Lord Simmonds said,

My Lords, I have had the advantage of reading the opinion which

my noble and learned friend, Lord Morton of Henryton, is about to

deliver and I fully concur in his reasons and conclusion, as I do in

those of Parker J. and the majority of the Court of Appeal. Nor

should I have thought it necessary to add any observations of my

own were it not that the dissenting opinion of Denning L. J., appears

to invite some comment.

My Lords, the criticism which I venture to make of the judgment of

the learned lord justice is not directed at the conclusion that he

reached. It is after all a trite saying that on questions of construction

different minds may come to different conclusions and I am content

to say that I agree with my noble and learned friend. But it is on the

approach of the lord justice to what is a question of construction

and nothing else that I think is desirable to make some comment,

for at a time when so large a proportion of the cases that are brought

before the courts depend on the construction of modern statutes it

would not be right for this House to pass unnoticed the propositions

which the learned lord justice lays down for the guidance of himself

and, presumably, of others

Furthermore, in instances where the legislature wanted to specify the date

first fixed for trial, etc., it was expressly done.

For example, section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, which was

amended by section 08 of Act No. 08 of 2017 says,

11 | C . A . R I I 1 8 2 0 2 4 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

On or after the day first fixed for the Pre trial of the action and

before the final judgment, no application for the amendment of any

pleadings shall be allowed

Therefore, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal and the learned

Judge of the High Court cannot be found fault with for deciding that the

45 day notice under the above section need not necessarily be before the

first date fixed for trial or inquiry.

In the circumstances this Court is of the view that the petitioner has not

established a prima facie case to issue notice and the application is

therefore dismissed without costs.

Hence the second order of the learned district judge dated 30.04.2021 refusing

to admit the photographs is wrong as wrong can be. The subsequent orders by

her successor based on her second order are also wrong.

Hence orders X.10, X. 11 and the order at page 7 of X.06 are set aside.

The photographs X.5(i) and X.5(viii) are admitted in evidence.

There is no order on costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
