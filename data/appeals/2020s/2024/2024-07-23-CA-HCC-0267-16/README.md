Respondent

BEFORE : MENAKA WIJESUNDERA, J

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J

COUNSEL : Yalith Wijesundera for the Accused Appellant.

Rohantha Abeysuriya, ASG for the Respondent.

ARGUED ON : 03.07.2024

DECIDED ON : 23.07.2024

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Chilaw in terms

of Section 296 of the Penal Code for causing the death of Warnakulasooriya

Julian Calistus and in terms of Section 300 of the Penal Code for

attempting to cause the death of Makalage Kanthimala Peiris.

After trial, the accused-appellant was convicted of both counts by the

Judgement dated 07.12.2016 and he was sentenced to death for the first

count of murder and sentenced him to 15 years of rigorous imprisonment

and a fine of Rs.7500/- with a default sentence of six months

imprisonment for the second count of attempt to murder.

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant raised

only one legal issue regarding the death sentence imposed by the learned

High Court Judge. The learned Counsel informed that he is not contesting

the convictions or the sentence imposed to the offence of attempt to

murder.

The learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the accused-

appellant was 17 years old at the time of committing the offence and

according to Section 53 of the Penal Code, a sentence of death cannot be

pronounced against the accused-appellant, as he was 17 years of age at

the time of committing the offence of murder. Therefore, the only legal

issue that has to be considered in this appeal is whether the accused-

appellant who was at the age of 17 years at the time of committing the

offence could be sentenced to death for the offence of murder.

The learned Additional Solicitor General (ASG) appearing for the

respondent contended that there was no proof that the accused-appellant

was 17 years at the time of committing the offence. It is correct that there

was no proof regarding the age of the accused-appellant at the time of

committing the offence. However, in his dock statement, the accused-

appellant has stated that his date of birth is 21st of June 1990 and he was

17 years old at the time of the incident. The accused-appellant was

convicted and he was sentenced to death on 07th of December 2016. On

his own admission, if the appellant was born in 1990, he was about 26

years at the time that the death sentence was pronounced against him in

2016. Prior to the No. 50 of 1980 amendment to the Penal Code, Section

53 was as follows:

Sentence of death shall not be pronounced on or recorded against any

person who, in the opinion of the court, is under the age of sixteen

years; but, in lieu of that punishment, the court shall sentence such

Page 4 of 9

person to be detained during the Presidents pleasure. (Emphasis

added)

However, as the accused-appellant was indicted for offences committed in

2007, Section 53 of the Penal Code as amended by the Act No.50 of 1980

is applicable.

Section 53 of the Penal Code as amended by the Act No.50 of 1980 reads

as follows:

Sentence of death shall not be pronounced on or recorded against any

person who, in the opinion of the court, is under the age of eighteen

years; but, in lieu of that punishment, the court shall sentence such

person to be detained during the President's pleasure. (Emphasis

added)

According to this amendment, sentence of death shall not be pronounced

on or recorded against any person who is under the age of 18 years. The

contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant was that this age limit

should be considered applicable to the time of committing the offence. He

contended that since the accused-appellant was 17 years at the time of

committing the offence, the death sentence cannot be imposed on him.

The learned ASG contended that the age limit should be considered

applicable to the time of sentencing and not the time of committing the

offence.

In substantiating his argument, the learned Counsel for the appellant

submitted the case of Ponnambalam Koneshwaran V. The Honourable

Attorney General- CA No. 85/2010 decided on 18th November 2016. The

learned ASG submitted the case of Kodituwakkulage Pradeep

Samantha alias Fredie V. The Hon. Attorney General - SC Appeal

No.139/2014 - Decided on: 21.11.2018 and contended that the Supreme

Page 5 of 9

Court has taken a contrary view and decided that the age limit of 18 years

has to be considered at the time of sentencing the accused-appellant.

In the aforesaid Court of Appeal Judgment cited by the learned Counsel

for the appellant, it had been held that according to Section 53 of the Penal

Code as amended by Act No. 50 of 1980, a person below the age of eighteen

cannot be sentenced to death. The said observation is perfectly correct.

However, in the said case, the sentence of death has been set aside

because the accused-appellant was 16 years of age at the time of

committing the offence. With all due respect I state that I am unable to

agree with that finding because it is clear from Section 53 of the Penal

Code that the age limit of 18 years should be considered at the time of

sentencing the accused-appellant and not the time of committing the

offence. This legal issue has been extensively dealt with in the aforesaid

case of Kodituwakkulage Pradeep Samantha alias Fredie V. The Hon.

Attorney General and it was decided that what is relevant is the age of

the offender at the point of imposition of the sentence and not at the point

of the commission of the offence.

In the case of Kodituwakkulage Pradeep Samantha alias Fredie V.

The Hon. Attorney General, the Supreme Court granted special leave to

appeal on two questions of law. The first question of law is as follows: Was

the death sentence imposed by the learned trial judge contrary to the

provisions of Section 281 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act as amended

by Act No.52 of 1980 read with Section 53 of the Penal Code.

In this case, the accused-appellant was 23 years at the time the sentence

was imposed, and he was 16 years and a few months when the offence

was committed. It was the contention of the learned counsel for the

accused -appellant that the reference made to the age of the person

convicted in Sections 281 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Section 53

Page 6 of 9

of the Penal Code, is the age of the accused at the time the offence was

committed.

The Supreme Court held as follows: Section 53 of the penal Code to my

mind is without any ambiguity as it clearly states that: sentence of death

shall not be pronounced on any person who is under 18 years of age, thus

what is relevant is the age of the offender at the point of imposition

of the sentence and not at the point of the commission of the offence.

As such, I see no impediment for the learned High Court Judge to have

imposed the death sentence and in that context the learned High Court

Judge cannot be said to have erred.

It was further held as follows: On the other hand, in the absence of any

ambiguity, this court cannot go beyond the literal construction of the

statutory provision, which is the primary rule of interpretation. If there is

nothing to modify, alter or qualify the language which the statute contains,

it must be construed in the ordinary and on natural meaning of the words

and sentences. (Per Lord Fitzgerald in the case of Bradlaugh v. Clerk 1883

8 App. cases 354.) The rule of construction is to intend, the legislature to

have meant what they have actually expressed. R v. Banbury (Inhabitants)

1834 1A and E 136 per Park J.

What Section 53 of the Penal Code prohibits is the pronouncement

of death on any person who is under 16 years. In the present case, as

referred to earlier, the appellant was 23 years at the time the death

sentence was pronounced on him and as such I see no illegality in the

order made by the learned High Court Judge in passing the death sentence.

On the other hand, recourse to Section 53 of the Penal Code must be had, in

terms of section 281 of the Criminal Procedure Code, when a person is

convicted with an offence punishable with death. Here again the

emphasis is, the point of conviction and not the point at which the

offence was committed.

Page 7 of 9

Considering the above, I see no merit in the argument of the learned counsel

for the Appellant as to the first question of law on which special leave was

granted. (Emphasis added)

As it was held in the aforementioned Supreme Court decision, in the case

at hand also, the age of the accused-appellant at the time of sentencing

must be considered. As stated previously, he was 26 years old at the time

of sentencing him for the offence of murder. The aforesaid Supreme Court

Judgement had been delivered prior to the Amendment brought to the

Penal Code by the Act No. 25 of 2021. By the said amended Act No. 25 of

2021, Section 53 of the Penal Code was repealed and the following section

was substituted therefor: -

53 (1) Sentence of death shall not be pronounced on or recorded

against any person who, is under the age of eighteen years, at

the time of the commission of an offence by such person.

(2) The court shall, in lieu of sentencing such person to death,

sentence him to be detained in an institution established under

any written law for the detention of persons under the age of

eighteen years, for a period specified in the sentence and

subject to the provisions of such written law.".

Hence, it is precisely clear from this amendment also that before the 2021

amendment was brought, it had to be considered whether the accused is

under the age of 18 years at the time of sentencing and not whether the

accused is under the age of 18 years at the time of committing the offence

as decided by the said Supreme Court case because the sole intention of

bringing this amendment was to apply the age limit of 18 years to the time

of commission of the offence.

Page 8 of 9

Therefore, when sentencing the accused-appellant in 2016, the learned

High Court Judge need not have followed Section 53 of the Penal Code as

the accused-appellant was 26 years old at that time. If Section 53

exception does not apply, the learned Judge had to comply with the Penal

Section 296 of the Penal Code when sentencing the accused for the offence

of murder. One cannot argue that the learned High Court Judge could

have considered the fact that the accused-appellant was below 18 years of

age at the time of committing the offence because before the said

amendment was brought to the Penal Code in 2021, the learned Judge

had no jurisdiction to do so. An accused who had been convicted for

murder before 2021 must be sentenced to death if he was not under 18

years of age at the date of sentencing him. The learned High Court Judge

had no discretion to impose a lesser sentence for murder and he was

bound to impose the death sentence on the accused-appellant who had

been convicted for murder.

In the aforesaid case of Kodituwakkulage Pradeep Samantha alias

Fredie V. The Hon. Attorney General, it was held that The offence of

murder is one such offence for which death is prescribed as the only

punishment under the law. Hence once an accused is found guilty of the

offence of murder, the court has no discretion other than imposing the death

penalty.

Therefore, the learned High Court Judge, in this case, has correctly

imposed the death sentence on the accused-appellant for the offence of

murder, according to law.

As no other ground of appeal has been raised by the learned Counsel for

the appellant, I find no reason to interfere with the Judgement or the

sentences imposed by the learned High Court Judge. The convictions and

the sentences imposed on the accused-appellant are affirmed.
