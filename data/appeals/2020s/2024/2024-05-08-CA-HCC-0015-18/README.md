The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Jaffna for

committing the offence of grave sexual abuse of a girl below the age of

16 years between the period from 01st of November 2009 and 26th of

December 2010 in Sinnamadu, Kayts an offence punishable under

Section 365B(2)(b) of the Penal Code as amended.

After trial, the accused-appellant was convicted by the Judgment dated

21.02.2018 and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment of 10 years and

imposed a fine of Rs.10,000/- which carries a default sentence of one-

month rigorous imprisonment. In addition, the accused-appellant was

ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.1,000,000/- which carries a

default sentence of 2 years rigorous imprisonment. This appeal is

preferred against the said conviction and sentence.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions were filed on behalf of both

parties. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Counsel for the

accused-appellant and the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for

the respondent made oral submissions.

In brief, the prosecution case is as follows:

At the time of the incident the victim (PW-1) was a 9 years old girl who

was studying at Sinnamadu Roman Catholic School. The accused-

appellant was the principal of the school. She had been asked by the

appellant to come and sweep the principals office around 7.00 -

7.30 a.m. in the morning. When PW-1 went to the office room, the

appellant had closed the door of the office and sexually abused her.

Among the other grounds of appeal, the learned Counsel for the

appellant raised a ground of appeal that the charge is defective and

thus the conviction cannot stand. The learned Counsel for the appellant

and the learned Senior DSG for the respondent agreed to determine the

said legal issue first.

The learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the time of the

offence has not been specified in the charge instead a period of time

more than one year has been mentioned in the charge, therefore, the

accused-appellant is unable to understand the charge against him and

the accused-appellant is unable to defend himself. The learned Counsel

also pointed out that according to the charge, the Penal Section stated

in the charge has been brought by the amendment No. 29 of 1998 but

no such Penal Section has been introduced by the said amendment.

The learned Senior DSG considered the fact that the time period

specified in the charge exceeds one year and it is wrong.

Section 165 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states that the

time and place of the alleged offence must be mentioned in a charge.

Sections 165 (1) and 165 (2) read as follows:

165(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and

place of the alleged offence and as to the person (if any)

against whom and as to the thing (if any) in respect of which

it was committed as are reasonably sufficient to give the

Page 4 of 6

accused notice of the matter with which he is charged and

to show that the offence is not prescribed.

(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of

trust or dishonest misappropriation of movable

property, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum

or, as the case may be, the gross quantity in respect of

which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and

the dates between which the offence is alleged to have

been committed without specifying particular items or

exact dates, and the charge so framed shall be deemed

to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of

section 174.

Provided that the time included between the first and

last of such dates shall not exceed one year.

Section 165 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states that the

time of the alleged offence must be specified in the charge.

Section 165 (2) permits to specify a period of time of the alleged offence

to be specified only with regard to the offences of criminal breach of

trust and dishonest misappropriation. However, it is specifically stated

in the said section that even for the aforesaid two offences, the first

and last dates of the time period shall not exceed one year. There is

no specific provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to specify

a period of time for other offences except criminal breach of trust and

misappropriation. When it is mentioned that even for the charges of

criminal breach of trust and misappropriation, the period of time

should not exceed one year, undoubtedly, a period exceeding one year

could not be specified in a charge pertaining to other offences.

It has been held in W. E. De Zylva, v. The Queen- 66 NLR 92 that

even in a charge of Criminal Breach of Trust, if the time period exceeds

one year, the charge is defective and illegal. In this case, the accused

was charged for committing criminal breach of trust between the 7th

day of January 1959 and the 8th day of January 1960. It was held that

the charge, by taking in a period in excess of one year, was defective

in that it contravened the provisions of section 168 (2) of the Criminal

Procedure Code. Such a charge is illegal and not merely irregular.

[Emphasis added]

In the case at hand, the period of time specified in the charge is from

1st of November 2009 to 26th of December 2010. Hence, it is obvious

that the charge in the instant case is defective and illegal. Conviction

based on an illegal charge cannot be allowed to stand. It is to be noted

that in the case of Zahir V. Cooray - 42 NLR 263, it was found that,

the manner of cheating set out in the charge did not in law constitute

the offence. Therefore, it was held that the charge would be insufficient

to sustain a conviction although a sufficient manner of cheating has

been proved.

Hence, it is evident that if the charge is illegal, the accused cannot be

convicted on such illegal charge even if there is sufficient evidence to

prove the charge that was intended to be brought against the accused

but was not properly set out. As the charge in the instant action is

illegal as described previously, there is no necessity to consider the

other matters relating to this appeal because conviction based on an

illegal charge cannot be allowed to stand.

Accordingly, the Judgment dated 21.02.2018, the conviction and the

sentence imposed on the accused-appellant are set aside. The

accused-appellant is acquitted.
