Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the appellant) on being aggrieved of his conviction and the sentence by the

learned High Court Judge of Matara.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Matara for committing the

offence of kidnapping of an underage boy from his legal guardian, on or about

05-03-2008 at a place called Dampahala, within the jurisdiction of the High

Court of Matara, and thereby committing an offence punishable in terms of

section 354 of the Penal Code.

He was also indicted for committing the offence of grave sexual abuse on the

same underage boy at the same time and at the same transaction, and thereby

committing an offence punishable in terms of section 365B(2)(b) of the Penal

Code as amended by Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1995, 29 of 1998

and 16 of 2006.

Page 3 of 16

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Matara found the appellant guilty as

charged of his judgment dated 02-03-2023.

Having considered the mitigatory as well as the aggravating circumstances, has

sentenced the appellant in the following manner.

On count 01 - 2 years rigorous imprisonment and in addition,

Rs.50,000/- fine. In default of paying the fine, 6-month imprisonment.

On count 02 - 10 years rigorous imprisonment and in addition,

Rs.100,000/- fine. In default of paying the fine, 6-month imprisonment.

In addition to the above, the appellant had been ordered to pay Rs.500,000/- as

compensation to the victim, namely PW-01, and in default, it has been ordered

that the said compensation should be recovered as a fine, and in default, he shall

serve a sentence of 1 year imprisonment.

After the filing of the indictment before the High Court of Matara on 03-04-2017,

and despite the notice being issued, the appellant has never appeared before the

High Court. The sureties who stood surety for him when he was released on bail

by the learned Magistrate of Matara has informed the Court that the appellant

has left the country and they are unable to produce him before the Court.

This has resulted the learned High Court Judge of Matara taking steps in terms

of section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Having satisfied that the

appellant is absconding the Court, and has left the island, and therefore not

possible to serve the indictment on him, the trial has commenced in his absence.

After the pronouncement of the judgment and the sentence at the conclusion of

the trial, the appellant has preferred this appeal within the stipulated time

provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act for an accused person to appeal,

if dissatisfied of his conviction and the sentence.

Page 4 of 16

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel who represented

the appellant formulated the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of

the Court.

The Grounds of Appeal

1. The evidence with regard to the identification of the accused had not

been properly evaluated by the learned High Court Judge.

2. The contradictions per se in the evidence of the victim child has not

been properly evaluated by the learned High Court Judge.

3. Inter se contradiction between the evidence of PW-01, namely, the

victim child and his mother (PW-02) has not been considered.

4. Inter se contradictions between PW-02 and the investigating officer

(PW-06) had not been considered.

5. The inadmissibility of the short history given to the doctor in the

absence of PW-01 confirming that he gave a short history of the incident

to the doctor had not been considered.

6. Failure to call the evidence of the father of PW-01 has not been

considered by the learned High Court Judge.

Before considering the grounds of appeal urged, I find it appropriate to place on

record the evidence led at the trial in brief.

The Evidence in Brief

The victim (PW-01), was an eight-year-old school-going child when he had to face

this incident of grave sexual abuse. He was an 18-year-old youth when he gave

evidence for the first time before the High Court of Matara, some 11 years after

the incident. By that time, he had been in employment at a manufacturing

factory located in Colombo.

When he gave evidence before the High Court on the 1st day of the trial, it appears

that he had been reluctant to come out as to what happened to him on the date

of the incident, other than saying that he gave a statement to Urubokka Police

Page 5 of 16

in relation to the thing that happened to him at the hands of the person living

near his house. He has also stated that he left his house to go to his

grandmothers house, situated about 300 meters away, to bring some rice as

directed by his mother. It had been his position that on his return, he had to

face this harassment, and had stated that he met the person called Damith. He

has also identified the appellant as Dhanasiri, who also lives near his house, and

has stated that although he faced an incident, he cannot remember much detail

about it.

This has resulted in the postponement of the case for another date. On the next

date, the witness has come out describing the incident faced by him in much

detail. He has stated that he and his mother went to the police on the day of the

incident itself, and if the police record says that his statements were to the effect

that the incident happened on 05-03-2008, he admits it.

He has stated that when he was returning home from his grandmothers house,

he met the person to whom he referred to as Damith on the road, and he escorted

him to an abandoned house nearby, where he saw Dhanasiri inside the house.

After he was taken inside the house, the person called Damith has laid him down

on a mat, which was on the ground, and had engaged in intercrural sex with

him.

After this act, the appellant had also engaged in intercrural sex in the similar

manner with the victim child. After they committed the act on him, they have let

him go, and the person called Damith had informed him not to mention this to

anyone. However, after reaching his home, he has informed the incident faced

by him to his mother, and the mother has taken immediate steps to take him to

the police station to lodge a complaint in this regard. He has stated that he did

not know the appellant or had no any special relationship with him until he met

him at the abandoned house, and therefore, had no animosity or ill will towards

him.

Page 6 of 16

Explaining the reasons as to why he did not or could not describe the incident

faced by him when he gave evidence on the previous day, he has stated the

following.

The cross-examination of the victim reveals the fact that when this incident

occurred, the victim was unaware of the name of the appellant as Dhanasiri, but

knew him as the person who was driving a van and lived in a neighbouring house

known as Kongala Gedara. It is clear that the victim has described the appellant

in that manner when informing the incident to his mother. It was his mother

who had informed him that the said persons name was Dhanasiri.

It needs to be mentioned that while under cross-examination, the victim had

fainted in the witness box, which has resulted in the adjournment of the trial for

several minutes.

It has been suggested to him that his evidence, where he says that he and his

mother went to the police station on the same day was false and the complaint

was in fact made on the following day morning, namely 06-03-2008. He has also

stated that he cannot remember whether he has stated in the police statement

Page 7 of 16

that the person mentioned Damith has done the same thing to him previously,

whereas his evidence to the Court had been to the effect that this was the first

incident faced by him.

According to the evidence of the mother (PW-06) of the victim child, her son has

gotten late to come home on 05-03-2008 after going to his grandmothers house

to get some rice as directed by her.

This has resulted her telling her daughter to go and look for the younger brother.

Her daughter has returned home saying that the younger brother has left the

grandmothers house and that he was not there. About 10 minutes thereafter,

the victim child has returned home, and when questioned, he has revealed to

her that two persons held him, identifying them as

and , which has resulted her

in identifying them as Dhanasiri meaning the appellant, and Damith

respectively. Both of them had been well known to her over a period of time. Her

evidence shows that she has not gone into probing the matter further, but has

taken the child to the police station to lodge a complaint. It appears that the

mother has realized what may have happened to her son when the incident was

mentioned to her by him.

When she went to lodge a complaint, it has been informed to her that the officers

attached to the Childrens and Womens Bureau are not at the station and to

come back on the next day, which explains the reason as to why the complaint

has been recorded in the following day morning. It has been her evidence that

she came to know of the details of what happened to her son only after listening

to what he told the police officers when the police recorded his statement in that

regard. She has given further evidence stating that although she came to know

about the incident, she cannot come out with intricate details of it due to her

shyness to explain it in open Court. She has stated further that when they went

to the police station on 5th March, it was around 6.30 in the evening.

Page 8 of 16

Although the witness has spoken about making the complaint to Morawaka

Police, in fact, it is clear that the complaint had been to the Urubokka Police.

At the trial, PW-04, the sister of the victim has given evidence confirming that

she went looking for her brother, as he was late to come home.

PW-05, the Medical Officer who examined the victim child after his admission to

the Urubokka Government Hospital has given evidence confirming that he

examined the child on 06-03-2008. He has recorded the history given by the

child as to the incident and has not found any visible injuries on the child.

However, he has expressed the opinion that an incident of sexual abuse as stated

by the victim may occur without any obvious marks of sexual abuse being

present.

The fact that PW-07 was the police officer who recorded the statements of PW-

01 and 02 and the contradictions and omissions contained therein has been an

admitted fact in terms of section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

The police officer who investigated the incident has stated in his evidence that

after receiving the complaint in this regard on 06-03-2008, he went and

inspected the place of the incident and found that it was an abandoned house.

He has found a mat inside a room. Later, he has taken steps to arrest the

appellant as well as the other person as suspects of the incident. He has also

taken steps to admit the child to the hospital and has also given instructions to

his subordinate officers to record the statement of the appellant.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge has

decided that there is prima facie evidence to call a defence from the appellant.

Since the appellant was absconding, the case has been closed without any

defence evidence being called.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel strenuously

contended that the evidence given by the victim child was to the effect that he

did not know the appellant and he was a stranger to him when this incident

occurred.

It was his position that the victim child has come to know about the names and

the identity of the appellant as well the other person because of his mother

revealing their names to him, and also after they were arrested on suspicion.

It was his position that such evidence does not establish the identity of the

appellant beyond reasonable doubt before the Court.

It was the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel that the evidence of PW-

01 was not credible and per se contradictory. It was pointed out that the evidence

of the victim child when he gave evidence before the trial Court had been to the

effect that he met the other person called Damith near the road, and the

appellant when he entered the abandoned house. However, his statement to the

police had been that he met both of them on the road.

It was his position that the victim child has given evidence as to the alleged

perpetrators only at the instigation or under the influence of his mother, and not

by clearly identifying who committed the crime on him. The learned Presidents

Counsel submitted that what he termed as an inter se contradiction between the

evidence of the mother of the victim and that of the police officer who conducted

investigations as to how the arrests were made are very much contradictory to

each other.

It was his position that the mother being an interested witness and her evidence

being not rational, such evidence should not have been relied on by the learned

trial Judge. It was contended further that relying on the history given by the

victim in the judgment was also wrong since it was not consistent with the

version of events as narrated by PW-01.

Page 10 of 16

It was the submission of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) that the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses when taken cumulatively, clearly

establishes the fact that although the victim may not have known the names of

the assailants, he knew them previously.

It was pointed out that it was the very reason why he has described the two

persons who caused grave sexual abuse on him in the manner described by the

mother of the victim in her evidence. It was the contention of the learned DSG

that the mother has not coached the PW-01 at any stage of the trial in a manner

which creates any doubt as to the genuineness of the PW-01s evidence. It was

submitted that due to his age and his eagerness to forget the incident, he might

have been a reluctant witness, but not a witness who was uttering an untruth.

It was also stated that the mothers version of events and that of the police as to

the manner in which the suspects were arrested, has not created any material

doubt.

The learned DSG urged the Court to dismiss the appeal on the basis that the

grounds of appeal urged lacks any merit. It was further submitted that the

learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence in the correct perspective

in reaching his judgment, which needs no interference from this Court.

Since all the grounds of appeal urged are interrelated, I will now proceed to

consider the said grounds of appeal together.

The main argument taken in this appeal was to the effect that the prosecution

has failed to establish the identity of the appellant.

It appears that this argument has been formulated based on what PW-01 said

in his evidence as to the manner he came to know the names of the appellant as

well as the other person who committed grave sexual abuse on him. In his

evidence in chief, he has stated that he met the person named Damith first, and

when he was escorted to the house where this incident took place, he met the

appellant Dhanasiri.

Page 11 of 16

However, it is clear from his evidence when taken as a whole, at the time of this

incident, he has not known the names of the appellant and the other person.

However, it is also clear that the victim knew the appellant and the other person

well since they were persons who lived in the neighbourhood.

The subsequent evidence of PW-01, where he says that he did not know the

appellant, has to be considered in that context and not in a manner to argue

that the evidence of PW-01 had been to the effect that the appellant and the other

person were strangers to him. His evidence and that of his mother clearly shows

that he has known the appellant as a person living in the neighbouring house

known as the Kongala Gedara and who is driving a van. When the victim has

described the person who committed the crime to him in such a manner, being

a person who lived in the village throughout her life, she has had no difficulty in

identifying the person as Dhanasiri, who is the appellant.

In the similar manner, when the victim child said to the mother that the other

person who took him away was the Ayya who lives in the house situated below

his grandfathers, the mother has identified the other person as Damith. It is

that knowledge gained by the victim through his mother, which has led him to

identify the appellant and other person by their names as the ones who

committed the crime on him.

I am of the view that this has not created any doubt as to the identity of the

appellant as portrayed by the learned Presidents Counsel in his submissions

before this Court.

I am in no position to agree that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider the question of identity in the correct perspective in his judgment.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has well analyzed the evidence with

regard to the fact whether the PW-01 knew the appellant before the incident and

whether he has told the truth about it to the Court. Only after coming to a firm

finding as to the identity of the appellant, the learned High Court Judge has

proceeded to consider the evidence as to the offence of grave sexual abuse, which

Page 12 of 16

I find to be the proper approach that should be adopted by a trial Judge when

the question of identity becomes relevant.

It is quite obvious that the victim, who was 8 years of age at the time of the

incident and had given evidence 11 years thereafter as an 18-year-old youth, has

forgotten most of the minor details of the incident. It is also clear that he has

been attempting to forget the unpleasant incident faced by him for obvious

reasons and was reluctant to come out with it in open Court, which amounts to

revisiting an incident of such a nature.

It was held in the Court of Appeal Case of D. Tikiribanda Vs. The Attorney

General decided on 06-10-2009 reported in Bar Association Law Reports

2010 (B.L.R.) 92 that;

Mostly the victims of sexual harassment prefer not to talk about the

harrowing experience and would like to forget about the incident as soon as

possible (withdrawal symptom). The offenders should not be allowed to

capitalize or take mean advantage of these natural inherent weaknesses of

small children.

At this stage, I find it appropriate to refer to the Indian case of Bhoginbhai

Hirjibhai Vs. State of Gujarat (AIR 1983 SC 753 at pp 756-758) very often

cited in our Courts. It was held:

1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape

is replayed on the mental screen.

2) Ordinarily, so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness

could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element

of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to be

attuned to absorb the details.

Page 13 of 16

3) Ordinarily, a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence

of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short time span. A

witness is liable to get confused or mixed up when interrogated later on.

4) A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the Court

atmosphere and the piercing cross-examination made by counsel and out

of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of events,

or fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment. The sub-

conscious mind of the witness sometime so operates on account of the

fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witnesses is giving

truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him perhaps

it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on the spur of

the moment.

I am of the view that whatever the contradictions or omissions inter se or per se

have to be considered in the above context, and the said contradictions or

omissions should go into the core of the matter where it creates a reasonable

doubt as to the trustworthiness of evidence.

When it comes to the alleged inter se contradictions of the evidence of PW-01 and

his statement to the police, the witness stating that he met Damith near the road

and the appellant was inside the house in giving evidence whereas he has told

the police that he met both of them near the abandoned house, are not things

that go into the root of the matter. Similarly, where the appellant was when the

other person committed the grave sexual act on the victim child is also not a

thing that dent the credibility of the victims evidence. In his police statement,

the victim child has told the police that on a previous occasion too, the person

called Damith committed the same sexual abuse on him, and in giving evidence,

he has stated that he cannot exactly remember that fact.

As I have considered before, it is abundantly clear that the victim child being a

youth of 18 years of age when he gave evidence has forgotten most of the minute

details of the incident as a result of him attempting to forget the bad experience

Page 14 of 16

he faced. That is the very reason why he has given answers stating that he cannot

remember certain things, and if he has stated things in the police statement,

what he said was correct. That does not mean that he was lying before the Court

or attempting to narrate a previously concocted story before the Court.

I do not find a basis to believe that it was the mother of PW-01 who instigated

this type of an allegation against the appellant and PW-01 has given evidence at

the insistence of his mother.

There is nothing in the evidence before the trial Court that PW-01s family or his

mother in particular had any animosity towards the appellant. They had been

neighbours in their village and had no reason to make a false allegation against

him. The mothers evidence clearly shows that when she was told that the

appellant and another person held her son and took him to an abandoned house,

the mother being an adult had the ability to suspect what may have happened.

Her evidence shows that she had been overwhelmed by emotions and had

promptly taken the child to the police station to lodge a complaint. Although the

complaint has been recorded on the following day, the evidence establishes that

they have gone to the police on the evening of 05-03-2008, soon after the mother

was informed of the incident, but it was the police who had failed to take steps

to record a statement promptly. This cannot be attributed as a delay in lodging

a complaint under any circumstance.

Although the mothers version as to the manner in which the appellant was

arrested and the police investigators evidence in that regard differs somewhat, I

find that it is not a matter that creates a doubt as to the incident per se, and a

matter which should not be held against the evidence of the victim child and his

mother in that regard.

I find no basis in the contention that the victim child not telling in his evidence

before the Court that he told the doctor who examined him the history regarding

the incident as a reason to disregard the evidence as to the history given by the

doctor who examined the child when he was admitted to the hospital.

Page 15 of 16

It is clear that a child of this age would not understand the procedures adopted

by a Judicial Medical Officer when examining a child. Even if asked whether he

gave the history of the incident to the doctor, he may not remember it some 11

years after the incident. In my view, what is relevant would be the evidence of

the doctor who examined the child. The doctor marking the Medico-Legal Report

(MLR) as X-01 has stated very clearly that he recorded the history as stated to

him by the victim child.

A history of an incident narrated to a doctor does not provide corroboration in

its strict sense as to the evidence of a victim, but it provides for the consistency

as to the evidence in relation to an incident.

In the case of Ariyadasa Vs. The Queen (1967) 70 NLR 03 at 04, it was

observed by T.S. Fernando, J.;

The corroboration that section 157 contemplates is not corroboration in the

conventional sense in which the term is used in Courts of law but in a sense

of consistency in conduct of a witness tending to render his testimony more

acceptable.

It is very much clear that the child has been examined by the doctor a day

following the incident without any delay. This shows that the incident was very

much fresh in the mind of the victim child. I am of the view that the consistency

in the statement to the doctor in relation to the evidence placed before the Court

is a matter that should be held in favors of the prosecution when determining a

case of this nature.

The learned Presidents Counsel formulated a ground of appeal on the basis that

the prosecution has failed to call the father of the victim child and it has created

a doubt in relation to the prosecution evidence. The evidence led before the trial

Court does not provide a basis to conclude that the father of the victim child as

a material witness for the prosecution.

Page 16 of 16

It is well settled law that what is material is not the number of the witnesses

called, but the quality of the witnesses, which proves a case beyond a reasonable

doubt.

Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance, which refers to number of witnesses,

reads as follows,

134. No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required

for the proof any fact.

For the above reasons as considered, I am of the view that the prosecution has

proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant. Hence, I find no

reason to interfere with the conviction and the sentence of the appellant by the

learned High Court Judge of Matara.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit. The conviction and the

sentence dated 02-03-2023 affirmed.
