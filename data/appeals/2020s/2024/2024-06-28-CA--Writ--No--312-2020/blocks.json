    "text": "A charge, usu. monetary, imposed by the government on persons, entities, transactions, or property to yield public revenue. Most broadly, the term embraces all governmental impositions on the person, property, privileges, occupations, and enjoyment of the people, and includes duties, imposts, and excises. Although a tax is often thought of as being pecuniary in nature, it is not necessarily payable in money. \"Taxes (including, in the term, assessments) are burdens or charges imposed by the legislature, or under its authority, upon persons or property, to raise money for public, as distinguished from private purposes, or to accomplish some end or object public in its nature.\" 2 John F. Dillon, Commentaries on the Law of Municipal Corporations 727-28 (3d ed. 1881). \"Taxes are the enforced proportional contributions from persons and property, levied by the state by virtue of its sovereignty for the support of government and for all public needs. This definition of taxes, often referred to as 'Cooley's definition,' has been quoted and indorsed, or approved, expressly or otherwise, by many different courts. While this definition of taxes characterizes them as 'contri-butions,' other definitions refer to them as 'imposts,' 'duty or impost,' \"charges,' 'burdens,' or 'exactions'; but these variations in phraseology are of no practical importance.\" 1 Thomas M. Cooley, The Law of Taxation 5 1, at 61-63 (Clark A. Nichols ed., , 4th ed. 1924).",

Therefore, it is of no relevance that the person sought to be benefited by the Act does not consider it to be so, In a taxing provision if there are two possible constructions of the words of the statute then effect is to be given to the one that favours the citizen and not the one that imposes a burden on him. If there is authority to impose taxes after doing a certain act, the State cannot impose the taxes unless that act is done and the authority must show, if challenged, that the act was done. Thus, in Commissioner Central Excise and Customs v Larsen and Toubro Ltd the Supreme Court was required to decide whether service tax could be levied upon indivisible work contracts before the Finance Act of 2007, which expressly made work contracts taxable. The Supreme Court answered the question against the revenue on the reasoning that composite work contracts combine sale of goods and services. Whilst the former was taxable by the States, the second could be taxed by the Centre. In the absence of an express legislative demarcation between the Centre and the States, such a tax could not be levied.",
