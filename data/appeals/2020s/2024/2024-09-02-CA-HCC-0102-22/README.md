Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Ampara for causing the death of one Samantha Jagath

Kumara on or about 01-12-2012, at a place called Rathmalakandiya within the

jurisdiction of the High Court of Ampara, and thereby committing the offence of

murder, punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code.

It needs to be noted that when the indictment was served upon the appellant, he

has given a notice of alibi in terms of section 126A of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Ampara found the

appellant guilty of his judgment dated 09-02-2022, and accordingly, the

appellant was sentenced to death.

The appellant filed this appeal on the basis of being aggrieved by the said

conviction and the sentence.

Facts in Brief

The deceased was married to PW-01 and had three children out of the marriage.

They were living in Rathmalakandiya area. On the day of the incident, namely,

on 02-12-2012, her husband has come home around 12.30 in the night, and

after having his dinner, had gone to sleep. Their house was a partly built one

and the husband has slept on the floor of the room, while PW-01 and her elder

daughter has slept on the bed. She also had her infant child with her.

There had been a bulb switched on in the living area of the house. While they

were sleeping, she has heard her daughter screaming and when she

awoke and sat on the bed, she has seen her husband on the floor. When she

wiped her eyes and looked around, she has seen a dark, tall person standing

near the entrance to the room. He was wearing dark clothes and the witness has

been specific that she did not see his face because she saw him by his side only.

When they started shouting, the person has run away. After the person went,

PW-01 and her daughter (PW-04) have seen the deceased with cut injuries.

When they alerted the neighbours, they have come and had taken steps to take

her injured husband to the hospital. She has later come to know that he has

passed away.

According to her evidence, she has attended an identification parade held to

identify the person whom she saw, and had identified the appellant at the

identification parade held.

The evidence of the daughter (PW-04) of the deceased has also been very much

similar to that of PW-01. She has stated in her evidence that when she was

awakened after hearing a sound, she saw a tall, dark person standing near the

door and when she shouted, he ran away after attacking her as well.

It becomes clear from the evidence of PW-01 and 04 that since they have

indicated that the person who came to the house was a stranger, an identification

parade has been held after the appellant was arrested. The identification parade

Page 4 of 18

notes reveal that both the PW-01 and 04 had identified the appellant without

any difficulty as the person who came and attacked the deceased.

However, their evidence reveals that the appellant was a person well known to

them. He had been living as their next-door neighbour until he and his family

left the area a couple of years before the incident. The PW-01 has stated that

although she did not know his name, she knew him as Chuti Ayya. The daughter

of the deceased has described him as her best friends father, who used to often

take her to school along with her friend.

The evidence of PW-01, the wife of the deceased, also reveals that the wife of the

appellant had a love affair with the deceased before she got married to the

appellant. She has known that even after their separate marriages, the affair has

continued between the deceased and the wife of the appellant. She has also come

to know that few days prior to the incident, the deceased and the wife of the

appellant had been seen together at the town having tea at a shop.

According to the evidence of PW-10, the main investigating officer of the incident,

he was the Officer-in-Charge of Aranaganwila police during the day relevant to

this incident. After receiving information about the incident, he has reached the

place of the incident around 5.20 in the morning, and has recorded his

observations. He has taken several items which contained blood and has

observed that the intruder has come inside the house after removing an iron grill

to commit the offence.

Upon further investigations, he has come to know that the deceased had an affair

with a married woman and this has led to the investigating officer finding a clue

about a suspect. By that time, based on the information provided by the wife and

the daughter of the deceased, he had known that the attacker was a lean, tall

person with short hair. As the witnesses have said that the person when leaving

the room had to bend his head when passing the door, he has had a general idea

of the height of the suspect as well. Based on the information and the suspicions

he had, the investigating officer has gone to Unagalawehera area where he came

Page 5 of 18

to know that the suspect was living, and had arrested the suspect on 03-12-

2012 at 00.30 hours. After the arrest, the investigating officer has come to know

that the appellant is a soldier serving in the army.

Upon further investigations, he has recorded a statement from the appellant and

based on that statement and as shown by the appellant, has recovered a parcel,

which was in a shopping bag at Bandanagala area, under the 33/5 culvert of the

main road.

The witness has produced the portion of the statement that led to the recovery

in terms of section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance as P-06. The witness has

marked the shopping bag he recovered as P-07. Inside the shopping bag, he has

discovered a knife with blood like stains, a maroon coloured pair of rubber hand

gloves, a short-sleeved black coloured shirt, a mud covered pair of shoes and

another black coloured short-sleeved t-shirt. The witness has marked the knife

he recovered as P-08 and the rest of the items accordingly.

According to the evidence of the PW-10, when the appellant was arrested at his

home, the wife of the appellant has given Nokia brand mobile phone to the

appellant, which the investigating officer has taken into his custody. The number

of the phone was 077-1660301, which had a Dialog SIM card and had the IMEI

number 353665615559241. The said phone has been marked as P-11 during

the trial.

He has taken steps to obtain call details of the phone from the relevant service

provider. The said report has been marked as P-14. According to the report, a

call has been taken on 01-12-2012 at 19.37 hours from Ambepussa area.

Another call has been taken on 02-12-2012 at 05.40 hours from Kaduruwela

area. Thereafter, at 06.44 hours, a call has been taken from Jayanthipura, which

was about 15 kilometers away from Kaduruwela. At 11.05 hours, another call

has been taken from an area called Laksha Uyana.

These times become relevant because of the alibi taken up by the appellant.

Page 6 of 18

The evidence reveals that the investigating officers have taken steps to send the

knife and several other items recovered during their investigations, along with a

blood sample taken from the deceased for DNA analysis, and the report prepared

by Genetech Institute in this regard has been marked as P-18.

The report marked P-18 is an admitted document in terms of section 420 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The call detail report marked P-14 has also been

admitted under the same provision.

According to the DNA Analysis Report marked P-18, blood has been discovered

on the knife, which has been marked as P-06 when sent to the DNA analysis.

The same knife has been marked as P-08 at the trial. The DNA analysis of the

blood has matched the DNA of the blood sample taken from the deceased.

The evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted the post-

mortem of the deceased reveals that there were 14 cut and stab wounds on the

body. The JMO has opined that a person who sustains this kind of injury would

die within 2 to 3 minutes of receiving the injuries. He has also expressed the

opinion that the cut and stab wounds he observed could be caused by using the

knife marked P-08.

The identification parade notes have been marked as P-17 at the trial. There had

been no challenge to the said notes.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case and when the appellant was called

upon for his defence, he has chosen to make a statement from the dock and has

called his wife as a witness on his behalf.

He has stated that he got married as a result of a proposal, and knew that his

wife has had an affair with the deceased, and the affair ended before he married

her. He and his wife had lived at his house in Unagalawehera and when their

daughter was about three years old, they have decided to come and live in the

village of his wife. He has joined the Army in April 2006. He and his family had

lived in the village of his wife until the daughter was in the 4th grade at school.

Page 7 of 18

His dock statement shows that the deceased was also married at that time and

had a daughter of similar age to his daughter and both families had a close

relationship as neighbours until the appellant moved back to his home village

with his family.

The appellant has proceeded to explain his whereabouts on the day of the

incident apparently to substantiate his claim of an alibi.

He has claimed that he worked at the Army hospital until 10.00 pm on the 1st

December 2012 and left the hospital on his prior obtained leave. He has claimed

that he left Colombo around midnight and reached home around 6.30 in the

morning of the following day.

According to his version of events, he has been arrested by the police while

attending to his paddy field in the morning hours, taken to the police station,

and severely assaulted, which has resulted in admitting, which may be a

reference to the crime, and has also stated that due to fear, he signed whatever

the documents given to him and has denied any involvement to the crime.

The wife of the appellant in her evidence has stated that she had an affair with

the deceased and since her family members did not approve the affair, she got

married to the appellant in April 2000. The deceased also has gotten married at

the same time. According to her evidence, both her family and the deceaseds

family had been neighbours over a long period of time in Ratmalkandiya,

Siripura.

After the marriage, she and her husband have lived at her husbands home for

some time. Later they returned to her parents house, and had lived there until

their daughter started attending the 4th grade at school. She has admitted that

the deceased also had a girl child of similar age who was a classmate of her

daughter and both families had a very close relationship until they decided to

move back to the husbands home village. She has claimed that although she left

the village, she maintained a close relationship with her village and used to go

there frequently. She has stated that about three days before this incident, she

Page 8 of 18

came to Batticaloa junction to attend a course and while she was there, she

received a call from the deceased and they met as a result.

While they were having a chat, her own brother who has seen them together,

had come and assaulted her telling her to go back home. She has claimed that

neither her brother nor she did not inform this incident to her husband who was

working at Narahenpita Army Camp at that time.

According to her, her husband has come home around 5.30 6.00 a.m. on the

day he was arrested by the police. She has admitted that before the police took

him away, she gave his mobile phone and the purse to the appellant. Later, she

has come to know that her husband is under arrest by the Aranaganwila police.

She has further clarified the assault of her by her own brother stating that he

assaulted her because her family opposed the affair she had with the deceased

during her school days, and has admitted that when she was assaulted, her

brother uttered the words go home, you have three kids. She has also admitted

that it was her brother who has taken the deceased to the hospital after the

incident. She has claimed that the appellant was innocent of the charges

preferred against him.

In his judgment, the learned High Court Judge has found the appellant guilty

based on the eyewitness account of the incident by PW-01 and 02, on the basis

that they have clearly identified the appellant at the time of committing the

crime.

Further to that, the learned High Court Judge has also considered the

circumstantial evidence led at the trial as well, in determining that the

prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following two grounds of appeal for consideration of the Court.

Page 9 of 18

1. Has the learned High Court Judge failed to evaluate the improbabilities

and infirmities regarding the identity of the appellant.

2. Has the learned High Court Judge failed to properly evaluate the

defence evidence, especially the defence of alibi taken by the appellant.

Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal

The 1st Ground of Appeal:-

It was the primary submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant that there

was no basis for the learned High Court Judge to determine that PW-01 and 02,

the two eyewitnesses to the incident, positively identified the appellant as the

person who caused cut injuries to the deceased.

The learned Counsel submitted that since it has been established by way of

evidence that the appellant was well-known to both the witnesses, there was no

purpose in holding an identification parade to identify him, and the statements

made by the witnesses to police clearly shows that the two witnesses have failed

to identify the perpetrator of the crime although they were eyewitnesses to the

incident. It was pointed out that they have also failed to disclose that they knew

the appellant, which may have resulted in the holding of an identification parade.

The learned Counsel also submitted that there was not enough circumstantial

evidence to connect the appellant to the crime, and therefore, the prosecution

has failed to prove the charge against the appellant, and the learned High Court

Judge was misdirected in his judgment as to the question of identity.

In this regard, I find that the learned High Court Judge has gone on the basis

that there was sufficient light for the PW-01 and 02 to identify the person who

came inside their house and caused cut injuries to the deceased, and has

determined that based on that positive identification, they have identified the

appellant at the identification parade subsequently. The learned High Court

Judge has chosen to brush aside the witnesss failure to inform the police that

they knew the appellant well before the incident as not an important factor.

Page 10 of 18

The learned High Court Judge has justified the PW-01s failure to mention to the

police that she knew the appellant well, by considering a portion of the evidence

of PW-01 where she has stated that she knew the appellant as Chuti Ayya. It

appears that the learned High Court Judge has failed to adequately address and

consider the overwhelming evidence placed before the trial Court to the effect

that the appellant was well known to both the eyewitnesses as he and his family

used to be their neighbours over a long period of time. If that fact was correctly

considered, there would have been no basis for the learned High Court Judge to

determine as to the reliability of the evidence by PW-01 and 02 in that regard.

It is also clear that both PW-01 and 02 has stated in their evidence they failed to

identify the attacker, other than describing his physical features, which goes on

to show that they have failed to identify the attacker as the appellant although

they were eyewitnesses to the incident. That clearly explains the reason why they

have failed to name him as the person who came inside their house and caused

cut injuries to the deceased when they made their statements to the police a few

hours after the incident.

According to the evidence of PW-10, the investigating officer, he has obtained an

information about a possible suspect only after he inquired from the villagers,

and not because of what the two eyewitnesses told him. He has arrested the

appellant based only on the information he received from an informant, which

goes on to show that the PW-01 and 02 have failed to identify the appellant at

the time of the incident. Once the arrest of the appellant becomes common

knowledge, there would be no difficulty for PW-01 and 02 to identify him at the

identification parade because of the previous knowledge they had as to his

identity.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the learned High Court

Judge was misdirected when it was determined that the two eyewitnesses had

positively identified the appellant at the time of the incident.

Page 11 of 18

Accordingly, I find merit in the 1st ground of appeal as to the way the learned

High Court Judge has considered the earlier mentioned evidence.

However, it needs to be noted that this is a matter where the prosecution has

relied on several pieces of circumstantial evidence against the appellant, besides

the eyewitness account of the incident. Therefore, I am of the view that just

because the learned High Court Judge was misdirected of the fact that the

relevant eyewitnesses have identified the appellant at the time the crime was

committed, it would not mean that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge

against the appellant in view of the circumstantial evidence.

Before I would proceed to consider the circumstantial evidence in order to

determine whether the said evidence has proved the charge beyond reasonable

doubt against the appellant, I would now go on to consider the 2nd ground of

appeal urged on behalf of him.

The 2nd Ground of Appeal:-

In the 2nd ground of appeal, the contention appears to be that the learned High

Court Judge failed to consider the alibi taken up by the appellant and thereby

failed to properly evaluate the defence evidence.

Although the learned Counsel for the appellant has stated that the appellants

defence of alibi was not properly considered, it needs to be mentioned that an

alibi is a question of fact. Although a misdirection may occur due to the fact of

an alibi being mentioned in our legal texts and judgments as a defence of an

alibi, once an alibi is taken up, it becomes imperative for a trial Judge to consider

that fact in relation to the other evidence led before him, be it by the prosecution

or by the defence, and decide whether a doubt has been created as to the

prosecution case because of such an alibi.

Considering an alibi, which is not a general or special exception, T.S. Fernando,

J. in the case of Martin Singho Vs. Queen 69 CLW 21 at page 22, remarked

as follows;

Page 12 of 18

As this Court has pointed out on many occasions in the past, where an

accused person is not relying on a general or special exception contained in

the Penal Code, there is no burden on him to establish any fact. In this case,

the appellant not relying on any such exception; even if the Jury declined to

believe the appellants version, he was yet entitled to be acquitted on the

charge if his version raised in the mind of the Jury a reasonable doubt as to

the truth of the prosecution case.

At this juncture, I must emphasize that any alibi taken up by an accused must

be to the effect that there was no possibility, given the facts of the matter, for

him to be present at the scene of the crime or participate in the crime.

In the case of The King Vs. Marshall (1948) 51 NLR 157 at 159, Dias, J.

having considered several legal principles and judgments in relation to how the

trial Court should test an alibi, observed as follows;

An alibi is not an exception to criminal liability like a plea of private defence

or grave and sudden provocation. An alibi is nothing more than an

evidentiary fact, which like other facts relied on by an accused must be

weighed in the scale against the case for the prosecution. In a case where

an alibi is pleaded, if the prisoner succeeds thereby in creating a sufficient

doubt in the minds of the Jury as to whether he was present at the scene at

the time the offence was committed, then the prosecution has not

established its case beyond all reasonable doubt, and the accused is

entitled to be acquitted- Rex vs. Chandrasekera (1942) 44 NLR at page

126 and Rex vs. Fernando (1947) 48 NLR at page 251. Although the

learned Judge did not deal with the alibi in this way, a study of the evidence

shows that no miscarriage of justice resulted thereby. There are

contradictions between the evidence of the second accused and his witness

Premasiri which may have induced the Jury to reject the alibi. In regard to

the case against the second accused, there was ample evidence before the

Jury, which, if believed, justified the verdict which they returned. We

Page 13 of 18

therefore think the conviction of the second accused is justified and we

dismiss his application.

I am not in a position to agree with the submission of the learned Counsel for

the appellant that the learned High Court Judge has not properly considered the

alibi.

Although notice of alibi has been given as required by the section 126A of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act, no such position appears to have been taken

when the relevant witnesses were giving evidence before the trial Court.

When the appellant was called upon for his defence, he has stated something

that resembles an alibi to the effect that he could not have been at the place of

the crime at the given time. However, what he has stated in his dock statement

is not something that there was no possibility under any circumstances for him

to be at the place of the crime around the midnight of 02-12-2012.

As pointed out correctly by the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG), his dock

statement in fact, cuts across the alleged alibi by him. What he has stated in his

dock statement, was that he left his workplace after 10.00 p.m. and left Colombo

around midnight and reached home around 6.30 in the morning of the following

day, which cannot under any circumstances be accepted as an alibi.

However, since notice has been given of an alibi, the prosecution has taken steps

to lead evidence to show that such an alibi cannot be possible. There is no denial

that the mobile phone mentioned in the call records provided by the service

provider marked P-14 belongs to the appellant. In fact, the wife of the appellant

in giving her evidence before the Court has admitted that it was she who gave

the phone to the appellant and the phone was taken charge by the police when

he was arrested,. The phone records clearly establish the possibility for the

appellant being at the place of crime at or about the time the witnesses say they

saw a tall person wearing dark clothes escaping their home after attacking the

deceased.

Page 14 of 18

I find that the learned High Court Judge in his judgment has clearly considered

these facts and has come to a correct finding that the alleged alibi has not created

any doubt as to the prosecution case, and in fact, the prosecution has proved

through phone call records sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish that

there was high a possibility for the appellant to be at the place of the crime when

this incident occurred.

Accordingly, I find no merit in the 2nd ground of appeal urged on behalf of the

appellant.

Having determined the grounds of appeal urged, I will now proceed to consider

whether there was sufficient circumstantial evidence before the High Court to

come to a finding independently to the determination by the learned High Court

Judge as to the identity of the appellant at the scene of the crime, so that the

conviction can be justified.

Our Courts have consistently determined as to the manner in which evidence

led before a trial Court should be considered in this regard.

In the case of The King Vs. Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 it was held:

Per Soertsz, J.,

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the jury must be

satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused and

inconsistent with any reasonable hypotheses of his innocence.

In the case of Don Sunny Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 01, it was

held:

1) When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the

proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must

irresistibly point towards only inference that the accused committed the

offence. On consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can

be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

Page 15 of 18

2) If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence, if an

inference can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the

accused, then one cannot say that the charges have been proved beyond

reasonable doubt.

3) If upon consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence the

only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the

offence, then they can be found guilty. The prosecution must prove that

no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of committing the

offence. The accused can be found guilty only if the proved items of

circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent

with their innocence.

However, when considering the circumstantial evidence, what has to be

considered is the totality of the circumstantial evidence before coming to a firm

finding as to the guilt of an accused, although each piece of circumstantial

evidence when taken separately, may only be suspicious in nature.

In the case of King Vs. Gunaratne 47 NLR 145, it was held:

In a case of circumstantial evidence, the facts given in evidence may, taken

cumulatively, be sufficient to rebut the presumption of innocence, although

each fact, when taken separately, may be a circumstance only of suspicion.

The jury is entitled to draw inferences unfavourable to an accused where he

is not called to establish an innocent explanation of evidence given by the

prosecution, which, without such explanation, tells for his guilt.

In the case of Regina Vs. Exall (176 English Reports, Nisi Prius at page 853),

Pollock, C.B. considering the aspect of circumstantial evidence remarked;

It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to be considered as a chain,

and each piece of evidence as a link in a chain, but that is not so, for then,

if any one link broke, the chain would fall. It is more like of a rope composed

Page 16 of 18

of several codes. One strand of the rope might be insufficient to sustain the

weight, but stranded together may be quite of sufficient strength.

It was observed in the case of Karunaratne Vs. Attorney-General (2005) 2 SLR

233,

Per Jagath Balapatabendi, J.,

The primary advantage of circumstantial evidence is that the risk of perjury

is minimized since it, unlike direct evidence, does not emanate from the

testimony of a single witness. It is therefore more difficult to fabricate

circumstantial evidence, than it is to resort to falsehood in the course of

giving direct evidence.

There is no principle of the law of evidence which precludes a conviction in

a criminal case based entirely on circumstantial evidence. There are no

uniform rules for the purpose of determining the probative value of

circumstantial evidence. This depends on the facts of each case.

As I have determined earlier, although PW-01 and 02 had been eyewitnesses to

the incident, they have failed to identify the appellant as the perpetrator at the

scene of the crime. However, it is clear that they have observed the attacker as a

lean, tall person, who was wearing dark-coloured clothes, before he escaped after

attacking the deceased. It is clear that after receiving the information about the

crime in the early morning of 02-12-2012, the OIC of the Aranaganwila police

has taken prompt steps to investigate the matter, which has resulted in him

coming to know of a possible suspect, and the arrest of the appellant in the early

hours of 03-12-2012.

The investigating officer has taken prompt steps to record a statement from him

and has recovered several items including a knife under a culvert in the main

road near the house of the appellant. I find that when considering the place

where the said items have been recovered, if not for the exclusive knowledge of

the appellant as to its whereabout, the items would not have been recovered.

Page 17 of 18

Among the recovered items, a pair of rubber gloves and some black coloured

clothes have also been recovered which matches the description of the clothes

worn by the attacker when the eyewitnesses saw him.

The mobile phone call records led in evidence also establish a high possibility of

the appellant being in the area where the crime occurred.

The knife recovered as a result of the statement made by the appellant has been

sent for a DNA Report and the DNA Report marked P-18 clearly establishes the

fact that the blood found on the knife had matched the blood of the deceased

through DNA analysis, which goes on to show that the knife recovered as a result

of the statement made by the appellant had been the knife used in committing

the crime.

The JMO in his evidence has opined that the cut and stab injuries he observed

on the body of the deceased could be committed by using the knife marked P-8,

which was the knife sent for DNA analysis.

Although a motive to commit a crime is not a matter that should be established

in a criminal case, I find that this is a matter where a motive can also be clearly

identified. As I have considered before, even the wife of the appellant has

admitted that the deceased had a relationship with her and they met 3 days prior

to this incident, where she was assaulted by her own brother accusing her of a

clandestine affair. The wife of the deceased has admitted this fact as well.

It is highly probable that the appellant may have come to know about the

incident that occurred 3 days before, which may provide a possible motive for

the offence.

It is my considered view that when taking all these circumstantial evidence as a

whole, the only conclusion that can be reached is that it was the appellant who

had committed the crime and no one else. I am of the view that the proved items

of circumstantial evidence are consistent with his guilt and inconsistent with

his innocence.

Page 18 of 18

Accordingly, I am of the view that although there was a misdirection by the

learned High Court Judge as to the establishment of the identity of the appellant

on the basis that the two eyewitnesses had identified him at the time of

committing the crime, it does not have a vitiating effect on the conviction as the

prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt by way of

circumstantial evidence.

It is well-settled law that any judgment or an order need not be reversed because

of any error, defect or irregularity unless such defect or irregularity has

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

The proviso to Article 138 of The Constitution, which provides appellate

jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal to determine appeals from the matters

determined by the High Court or other Courts of First Instance reads as follows:

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any Court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed as I find no basis to interfere with the

conviction and the sentence dated 09-02-2022 by the learned High Court Judge

of Ampara.
