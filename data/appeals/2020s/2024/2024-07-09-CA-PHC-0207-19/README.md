JUDGMENT

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Virtual Complainant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the Appellant) had filed this Appeal against the judgment of Learned

High Court Judge of Galle dated 04.11.2019.

According to the Appellant, the Officer-in-Charge of the Special Crimes

Investigation Unit of the Galle Police Station had filed a chargesheet

under Case No.78461 before the Magistrate Court of Galle against the

3rd to 7th Accused-Respondents-Respondents (Hereinafter referred to as

the Accused) for allegedly committing an offence punishable under

CA PHC 207-2019

6 | P a g e

Section 454 of the Penal Code. The Accused were separately charged

under Section 454 of the Penal Code in the same chargesheet.

After filing the chargesheet the trial was started and the Appellant had

started to give evidence on 16.10.2008. Although several dates had

been passed, the prosecution could not complete her evidence. On

20.01.2017, the 3rd Accused had pleaded guilty to the 1st count levelled

against him, and was sentenced accordingly.

On 23.06.2017, on behalf of 4th to 7th Accused an application was made

to discharge them from the case. Written submissions were filed

pertaining to the said application and the Learned Magistrate of Galle

citing the Section 186 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of

1979, had acquitted the 4th to 7th Accused on 26.10.2017.

Against the said order of the Learned Magistrate, the Appellant had filed

a revision application in the High Court of Galle under case No.HCRA

268/2018 and notices were issued to the 4th to 7th Respondents. All

parties had filed their written submissions and the Learned High Court

Judge pronouncing his order on 04.11.2019, had dismissed the said

revision application filed by the Appellant.

Aggrieved by the said order of Learned High Court Judge, the Appellant

had preferred an appeal by filing a petition of appeal on 18/11/2019 in

the High Court of Galle requesting it to be sent to the Court of Appeal

along with the original case record.

The Appellant had submitted following grounds of appeal:

A. The Learned Magistrate has failed to examine whether Transfer

Deed No. 577 is forged document.

B. The need for the Learned Magistrate to properly evaluate the

material elicited during the criminal investigation, and frame

proper fresh charges at a re-trial.

CA PHC 207-2019

7 | P a g e

Before commencement of the trial in the Magistrate Court of Galle, on

16.10.2008, as a preliminary objection, Counsel for 04th and 05th

Accused made an application under section 186 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act no. 15 of 1979 to discharge them from the case, as they

are merely witnesses to the deed No. 577 which is the subject matter in

this case. This application was rejected by the Learned Magistrate on

the basis that this question to be decided at the end of the trial. Hence,

trial was commenced but could not concluded as the 3rd Accused had

pleaded guilty and he was sentenced accordingly. Hence, the Appellant

now argue that she was not afforded an opportunity to present her case

fully and she submits this is an exceptional circumstance which should

have been considered by the Learned High Court Judge.

Section 186 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979

states:

Anything herein before contained shall not be deemed to prevent

a Magistrate from discharging the accused at any previous stage

of the case, but he shall record his reasons for doing so: Provided

that, if the Magistrate is satisfied, for reasons to be recorded by

him, that further proceedings in the case will not result in the

conviction of the accused, he shall acquit the accused.

In Parameshwaran v Officer-in-Charge, Police Station, Norwood

[188] 2 SLR 138 the Court held that:

The prosecution failed to identify the made, tea produced in the

case as Stockholm Estate tea and there was no cogent evidence

that the tea in question was' stolen tea` Hence at the end of the

prosecution case the accused had no case to meet and he should

have been acquitted. Where there is no: evidence at the, close of

CA PHC 207-2019

8 | P a g e

the prosecution case that the crime alleged had been committed by

the accused the case should be stopped as there is no case for the

accused, to answer.

In this case all the Accused we individually charged under Section 454

of the Penal Code for preparing a forged deed. The 3rd Accused was the

person who placed his signature as the seller in the deed No. 577. No

signatures of the 4th and 5th Accused found on the said deed. In the

evidence recorded from the Appellant nowhere revealed that the 4th and

5th Accused contributed towards preparing the deed No. 577 in

furtherance of Common Intention. Only their named is mentioned in

the chargesheet. Further, no conspiracy charge was levelled against the

Accused. In the attestation of the Notary Public, it is only mentioned

that the deed was executed in the presence of the 3rd,6th and 7th

accused. Since the presence of 6th and 7th Accused were not established

and cannot be held liable vicariously. Therefore, the finding of the

Learned Magistrate is not faulty in respect of 4th and 5th Accused.

In Ramachandran v The Queen 64 NLR 512, two accused were jointly

indicted in a District Court on certain charges. Before the indictment

was read and explained to the accused, Crown Counsel stated that the

evidence against the 2nd accused did not justify the prosecution

proceeding against him any further. The District Judge thereupon made

the following order: -" I acquit and discharge the 2nd accused ".

Thereafter the trial proceeded against the 1st accused on amended

charges.

The Court held that:

That knowledge was an essential ingredient of the charges

against the accused and that the burden was on the prosecution to

establish it.

CA PHC 207-2019

9 | P a g e

In this case, 6th and 7th Accused were the witnesses to the deed No.577.

In Bongso I.P.Matara v Gunasekera 60 CLW 64 the Court held that;

It was not sufficient to convict the Accused who was a mere

witness to the deed.

Although, in the evidence recorded from the Appellant revealed that the

6th and 7th Accused placed their signatures as witnesses to the

instrument, neither in the B-Report nor in the Plaint indicates that the

5th and 7th Accused acted in Common intention with the 3rd Accused or

aided and abetted the 3rd Accused or conspired along with the 3rd

Accused to commit the offence for which the 3rd Accused pleaded.

Therefore, the Learned Magistrate had discharged the 4th Accused to 7th

Accused after recording his reasons.

It is settled law that revision is a discretionary remedy, and such power

shall be invoked only upon demonstration of exceptional

circumstances.

In Marian Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed 69 CLW 34 the court held that:

Power of revision is an extraordinary power of the court

which is independent and distinct from the appellate

jurisdiction. The object of revisionary jurisdiction is to ensure

the due administration of justice and the correction of all

errors in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice.

CA PHC 207-2019

10 | P a g e

In the case of Rasheed Ali v.Mohammed Ali and Others [1981] 1 SLR

262, the court held that:

the powers of revision vested in the Court of Appeal are

very wide and the Court can in a fit case exercise that power

whether or not an appeal lies. When, however, the law does

not give a right of appeal and makes the order final, the

Court of Appeal may nevertheless exercise its powers of

revision, but it should do so only in exceptional

circumstances. Ordinarily the Court will not interfere by way

of review, particularly when the law has expressly given an

aggrieved party an alternative remedy such as the right to

file a separate action, except when non-interference will

cause a denial of justice or irremediable harm.

In Commissioner of Police v. Tanes (1957-58) 68 CLR 383, the court

held that:

"It is a deep-rooted principle of the law that before anyone

can be punished or prejudiced in his person or his property

by any judicial or quasi-judicial procedure, he must be

afforded adequate opportunity of being heard ... "

In this case the Learned High Court Judge considering the order of the

Magistrate Court of Galle decided to dismiss the revision application

stating that that the Petitioner had failed to adduce exceptional

circumstances to the satisfaction of the Court and that the order made

by the Learned magistrate under Section 186 of the CPC is not in

violation of the legal provisions contained therein.

CA PHC 207-2019

11 | P a g e

The Learned High Court of Galle also had observed that the Appellant

had not invoked Section 318 of CPC which lays down the Appellate

jurisdiction/Procedure with regard to an acquittal by the Magistrate. It

is very pertinent to observe that right of appeal under Section 318 is a

statutory right.

In Colombo Apothecaries Ltd v Commissioner of Labour 1998(3)

SLR 320 the Court held that:

The power of revision vested in the court is discretionary. The

power will be exercised when there is no other remedy available to

a party. It is only in very rare instances where exceptional

circumstances are present that courts would exercise powers of

revision in cases where an alternative remedy has not been

availed of by the applicant. Thus, the general principal is that

revision will not lie where an appeal or other statutory remedy is

available. It is only if the aggrieved party can show exceptional

circumstances, for seeking relief by way of revision, rather than by

way of appeal, when such appeal is available to him as of right,

that the court will exercise its revisionary jurisdiction in the

interests of due administration of justice.

Further, the Appellant had not mentioned in her revision application as

to why she resorted to revisionary jurisdiction instead invoking

appellate jurisdiction. Also, no reason adduced as to why she had not

acted under Section 318 of the CPC.

Further, the 1st and 2nd grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant in

her Petition of Appeal were never raised in the revision application filed

before the High Court of Galle. As it correctly pointed out by the

Counsel for the 4th to 7th Respondents, it has no standing in the instant

CA PHC 207-2019

12 | P a g e

appeal as it ought to have been canvassed in the Provincial High Court

of Galle by way of an appeal and not in the instant appeal against the

order of the revision application.

As such, I conclude that that the order of the Learned High Court Galle

is correct as the Appellant had failed to present exceptional

circumstances in her revision application filed before the High Court of

Galle.

While affirming the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Galle

dated 04.11.2019 and the order of Learned Magistrate of Galle dated

26.10.2017, I dismiss this appeal without any cost.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Galle and the Magistrate Court of Galle for information.
