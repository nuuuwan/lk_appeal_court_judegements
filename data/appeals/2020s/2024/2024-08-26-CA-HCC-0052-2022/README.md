Facts in brief

PW-01, the victim child of this incident was a 17-year-old youth when he gave

evidence before the High Court on 07-11-2018. In his evidence, he has stated

that the incident occurred in the year 2009, while he was studying in grade 4 at

his school. On the day of the incident, the victim child who was 9 years old at

that time, has gone to the nearby mosque for his daily prayers. While he was

returning from the mosque, he has met the appellant, who was a salesman at a

shop situated near the mosque. The appellant was not a stranger to the victim

as he has seen him previously working in the shop. When he was passing the

shop, the appellant has asked the victim child to help him to take some boxes

Page 4 of 15

which were outside the shop. When the victim child obliged, he has forced him

inside the shop and closed the door.

In his initial evidence, the victim child has stated that after closing the door, the

appellant showed his male organ to him and he pushed open the door and ran

away and informed his mother what happened.

However, upon questioning further, the victim child has stated that after

showing the male organ to him, the appellant held him by his hands and inserted

his male organ into the mouth.

According to his evidence, the shop was situated near his house and soon after

he informed his mother of the incident faced by him, he has gone with her to the

shop and showed the appellant to her.

Under cross-examination, the victim child has stated that when he left for the

mosque, he received Rs. 5/- from his mother, and purchased some toffees, not

from the appellants shop, but from another shop near the mosque. He has stated

that after telling the mother, she informed his father who was working away from

home, and they went to the police station on the following day.

The mother of the victim child has given evidence as PW-02. According to her

evidence, her son has left their house to attend to prayers at the nearby mosque

where usually the prayers conclude around 7.30 p.m. However, on the day in

question, her son has gotten late to come home and had come at around 8.30

p.m. After returning home, he has begun to weep uncontrollably and was

retching. He has come out of what happened to him only after being repeatedly

questioned by her and has told that a person working in a shop took him inside

and inserted his male organ into his mouth. The learned High Court Judge has

observed that the mother of the victim child being very emotional when she had

to narrate the incident that her minor son had to face.

She has immediately taken the child to the shop he mentioned, and the child

has shown the appellant to her. Thereafter, she has phoned her husband who

Page 5 of 15

was working away from home, and had gone and lodged a complaint with the

police on the morning of the following day.

It has been revealed at the cross-examination that the parents of the child have

initially taken the child to a private hospital and thereafter, on the advice of the

doctor at the hospital, had taken him to the Katthankudi Base Hospital where

he has been examined by the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO). The said JMO has

given evidence in this action as PW-04. He has examined the child on 07-08-

2009, some two and a half days after the incident. Although he has not observed

any visible marks as to a sexual assault or abuse, he has opined that an incident

of the nature described to by the child can occur without any marks being

present and, therefore, cannot overrule such an incident.

The JMO has given evidence as to the way he obtained the history of the incident.

According to him, he had been unable to get a proper history of the incident from

the child. It had been his mother (PW-02) who has given the history. She has

stated that her son returned home around 7.00 p.m. on 04-08-2009, and she

noticed something different in the boy and he was attempting to vomit. When

she questioned the child about his behavior, he has revealed to her that a person

from a nearby shop took him inside a room of the shop and thrust his penis into

the childs mouth.

The police officers who conducted the investigations have also given evidence at

the trial.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case, when the learned High Court Judge

called of a defence from the appellant, he has made a statement from the dock.

He has stated that he was employed in a shop and while working there on the

day of the incident, a boy poked a stick, which resulted in the goods stacked in

the shop collapsing. Because of that, he got very angry and wanted to attack the

boy with a pair of scissors. It had been his position that the boy went away and

later came with his mother and another person and threatened him. When he

went to the shop on the following morning, the same boy came with some police

Page 6 of 15

officers and arrested and assaulted him and took him to the police station had

been his position. He has denied that he committed any sexual abuse on the

victim.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel who represented

the appellant formulated the following ground of appeal for the consideration of

the Court.

1. PW-01s evidence, when taken in the line of his mothers and the

doctors evidence clearly demonstrates that PW-01s evidence was not

credible and the learned High Court Judge would not have acted upon

such evidence to convict the accused-appellant.

The Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

The learned Presidents Counsel pointed to the commencement of the evidence

by the victim (PW-01) where he has stated several times that the appellant took

him inside the shop and showed his private part, and thereafter, he ran away

from the place.

It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel that the victim has child

mentioned that the appellant held him by his hands and inserted his male organ

into his mouth only after the prosecuting Sate Counsel put some leading

questions to the witness. He lamented that the learned High Court Judge has

failed to consider the obvious discrepancies in the victim childs evidence as to

what really happened to him.

Pointing to the evidence of the mother of the victim child, it was stated that the

child has come and told his mother that the appellant gave some chocolates or

toffees and committed this act on him, whereas, the child in his evidence has

stated that he did not buy toffees from the appellant, but purchased from

another shop.

Page 7 of 15

Referring to the evidence of the JMO who examined the child after the incident,

the learned Presidents Counsel pointed out that the history of the incident has

been given by the mother to the JMO, and not by the child. However, the learned

High Court Judge in his judgment has considered the history as corroboration

of the childs evidence, which was a misdirection as to the value that can be

attached to the history given by a patient to a doctor.

It was also contended that the learned High Court Judge has only narrated the

evidence, but has failed to analyze it in its correct perspective. It was his view

that if analyzed correctly, there was no basis before the High Court to convict

the appellant for the charge preferred against him.

It was the submissions of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG)

that the child was an 8-year-old boy when this incident of grave sexual abuse

occurred and a young person of 17 years of age when he gave evidence. He was

of the view that there can be discrepancies in the evidence due to the time factor

which cannot be considered as someone not telling the truth of what happened.

He was of the view that the childs evidence had been perfectly corroborated by

what the mother observed of the child after he came home.

After coming to know what happened to her child, the mother has immediately

gone with him to the shop where the appellant worked, and has confronted him.

She has immediately informed her husband, and gone to the police station on

the following day morning, and lodged a complaint. It was the view of the learned

SDSG that the child has no reason to concoct a story against the appellant and

the evidence, when taken in its totality, shows that this was an incident that

actually occurred, where the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable

doubt.

Having considered the evidence placed before the Court, I am of the view that

the initial statement of the victim child where he has stated only about the

Page 8 of 15

appellant showing his male organ to him needs to be looked at not only taking

that piece of evidence in its isolation, but also looking at the entire picture.

The evidence of the victim child as well as his mother clearly shows that they

come from a conservative society. The child who was about 9 years old at the

time of this incident, was a 17-year boy who had a better understanding of the

social stigma attached to this type of an incident. That may be the very reason

why he was initially reluctant to come out with the full story as to what happened

to him.

I am not inclined to look at the questions posed by the prosecuting State Counsel

to the witness as prompting questions under the circumstances. It is well-settled

law that when a child victim is giving evidence, it may be necessary to put

questions to such a child to make the child calm and comfortable with the Court

environment, enabling him to come out with what happened. The child has

stated that after facing the incident, he came home and informed his mother

about what he had to undergo. At that point, the learned prosecuting State

Counsel has posed the following questions.

Q: Witness did this accused after showing his male organ, asked you to do

anything?

A: Yes.

Q: What did he asked you to do?

A: He, after holding my hands, took his male organ and placed it in my

mouth. I pushed him and came away.

Q: Witness you said that you talked about the incident to your mother?

A: Yes.

(Pages 78 and 79 of the appeal brief)

In the case of Perera Vs. The Attorney General (2012) 1 SLR 69, Ranjith

Silva, J. considering the credibility of the evidence of a victim observed as

follows;

It is inconceivable that one could apply the test of contemporaneity or

spontaneity in rape matters especially in child rape matters. A perusal of

the proceedings itself will give an indication as to how reluctant the victim

was to come out with the story at the trial in the High Court. A fair amount

of coaxing and persuasion which is justified under the circumstances was

needed to extract the evidence from the victim.

I am of the view that this was a situation which required such questioning given

the circumstances.

In the case of D. Tikiribanda Vs. Attorney General, CA 64/2003 decided on

6-10-2009 reported in Bar Association Law Journal (2010) (B.L.R.) 92, it was

held;

Mostly the victims of sexual harassment prefer not to talk about the

harrowing experience and would like to forget about the incident as soon as

possible (withdrawal symptom). The offenders should not be allowed to

capitalize or take mean advantage of these natural inherent weaknesses of

small children.

When it comes to the mothers evidence, she confirmed that when the child came

home later than usual, he was sobbing uncontrollably and retching. This has

prompted her to question the child, where the child has come out with what

happened to him. Initially she has described the incident stating that her son

came and told her that such a thing was done to him. When questioned in detail

only she has stated that her son told her that a person put his male organ into

his mouth.

Page 10 of 15

She has been very emotional when she was giving evidence as any mother would

be when forced to narrate such an incident in public. She has immediately gone

with the child and confronted the appellant, and at the same time has informed

her husband who was working away from home. After her husband arrived, both

of them had taken the child to the police station on the following day and had

lodged a complaint, which shows that they have acted promptly in that regard.

As argued by the learned SDSG, evidence of a case, especially in a case of this

nature, has to be taken and considered in its totality without compartmentalizing

the same.

In the case of James Silva Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 SLR 167

at 176 following the Privy Council case of Jayasena Vs. The Queen 72 NLR 313

(PC) it was observed;

"A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider

all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by

the defence in its totality, without compartmentalizing and, ask himself

whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he

believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty."

When it comes to the facts and the circumstances of the matter, and when taken

in its totality, it is abundantly clear that the child and his mother are not

concocting a false narrative against the appellant, and they have had no reason

to make a false allegation against him risking the repercussions the young child

may face in the future.

It is settled law that discrepancies, contradictions, or omissions in evidence of a

witness or witnesses has to be material so that it creates a reasonable doubt as

to such evidence.

Page 11 of 15

In the case of Mahathun and Others Vs. The Attorney General (2015) 1 SLR

74 it was held:

(1) When faced with contradictions in a witness testimonial, the Court

must bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions,

viewed in light of the whole of the evidence given by the witness.

(2) Too great a significance cannot be attached to minor discrepancies, or

contradictions.

(3) What is important is whether the witness is telling the truth on the

material matters concerned with the event.

(4) Where evidence is generally reliable much importance should not be

attached to the minor discrepancies and technical errors.

(5) The Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial judge

with regard to the acceptance or rejection of testimony of a witness

unless it is manifestly wrong.

In the case of State of U.P. Vs. M. K. Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48, it was held:

While appreciating the evidence of a witness the approach must be whether

the evidence of a witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth.

Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the Court to

scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies,

drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and

evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the

evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the

evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies

on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach

by taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the evidence,

attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating

officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection

of the evidence as a whole.

Page 12 of 15

The discrepancies highlighted in this matter is about whether the child

purchased toffees elsewhere, or it was the appellant who gave him chocolates

after taking him inside the shop. The evidence of the mother had been that her

son told her that the appellant gave him chocolates after taking him inside the

shop, but the evidence of the child in that regard had been to the effect that he

purchased toffees elsewhere.

As considered above, this discrepancy in no way relates to the actual occurrence

of the sexual abuse faced by the child. The child and the mother, possibly due

to the passage of time, may have forgotten such a detail as to the incident, which

cannot be interpreted as a discrepancy which affects the credibility of both the

witnesses.

According to the evidence of the JMO, as the child was not in a position to explain

what happened to him, it was his mother who has narrated the history. In that

process, the mother has informed the JMO what her son told her, as well as what

she observed when the child came home on that day.

It is settled law that the history given in an incident to a doctor cannot be

considered as corroboration of a fact, but only as evidence consistent of a fact.

Although the learned High Court Judge may have been misdirected in that

regard, it is my considered view that fact alone would not make the judgment

faulty. Although what the mother has told the doctor about the information

provided by her son becomes hearsay and cannot be used as evidence, the

mother of the victim has informed the doctor of what she observed of the child,

which in my view are very much consistent with the evidence of the victim child.

I am of the view that the said misdirection has not caused any prejudice towards

the appellant. I find that even without considering the history given by the

patient or his mother to the doctor, the prosecution has placed ample evidence

before the trial Court to prove the charge against the appellant beyond

reasonable doubt.

Page 13 of 15

Another matter that needs to be considered is the defence taken up by the

appellant when he was called upon for a defence. He has taken the position that

because the boy was instrumental in the collapse of the stacked goods that were

on display in his shop, he got angry and attempted to stab him with a pair of

scissors, which resulted him going to his mother and complaining.

However, it needs to be noted that when the child gave evidence, no such position

has been put to him and confronted. The childs mother has not been confronted

in that regard as well.

It is trite law that when an accused person takes up a certain position as his

defence, he must put that position to the relevant witnesses so that they can

respond to it. If a person comes out with a story for the first time when he was

called upon for a defence, that is also without giving evidence under oath, but

only as a dock statement, such a statement has little or no value.

Although it was contended that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

analyze the evidence in its correct perspective, I am in no position to agree. I find

that although there had been a misdirection in the judgment which has not

created any prejudice towards the appellant, the learned High Court Judge has

well considered the evidence placed before the Court in coming to his findings.

At this juncture, I would like to reproduce the proviso of Article 138 of The

Constitution, which gives appellate powers of the Court of Appeal to determine

appeals, which reads thus;

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

I am of the view that the prosecution has placed evidence, which has proved the

charge beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant, which needs no

disturbance from this Court.

Page 14 of 15

Accordingly, the appeal against the conviction is dismissed for want of merit. The

conviction dated 01-11-2021 affirmed.

However, It needs to be noted that the learned High Court Judge, in sentencing

the appellant for the first count has proceeded to suspend the sentence imposed

upon him. I find that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected as to the

relevant provisions of section 303 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when the

suspended sentence was imposed, which should be corrected by this Court.

The relevant section 303(2) reads as follows;

303(2) A court shall not make an order suspending a sentence of

imprisonment if-

(a) A minimum mandatory period of sentence has been

prescribed by law for the offence in respect of which the

sentence is imposed; or

(b) If the offender is serving or yet to serve, a term of

imprisonment that has not been suspended; or

(c) The offence was committed when the offender was subject to

a probation order or conditional release or discharge; or

(d) The term of imprisonment imposed or the aggregate terms

of imprisonment where the offender is convicted for more

than one offence in the same proceedings, exceeds two years.

Having considered the sentences imposed by the learned High Court Judge on

the appellant, it is clear that the two periods of imprisonment imposed upon the

appellant falls within the ambit of section 303(2)(b) and (d) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Code, where the sentence on the 1st count cannot be

suspended.

Accordingly, acting under the powers vested in this Court in terms of section

335(2)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the sentence given in relation to the

1st count preferred against the appellant is hereby varied by deleting the part

Page 15 of 15

where it states that the 01-year rigorous imprisonment period is suspended for

a period of five years.

However, since the 1st and the 2nd count preferred against the appellant refers to

offences committed in one and the same transaction, it is ordered that the two

periods of imprisonment imposed shall be served concurrently to each other,

which means a total period of 7 years imprisonment.

With the above variance to the sentence the appeal against the sentence dated

03-11-2021 is dismissed.

Having considered the fact that the accused-appellant had been in incarceration

from his date of sentence, it is ordered that the sentence shall deem to have

taken effect from that date, namely 03-11-2021.
