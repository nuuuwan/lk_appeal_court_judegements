Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the claimant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to

as the appellant) on the basis of being aggrieved by the judgment dated 03-06-

2019 of the learned High Court Judge of the Western Province holden in

Panadura, wherein the revision application filed by the appellant was

dismissed.

The said revision application has emanated from the order dated 28-08-2018,

whereby the learned Magistrate of Horana ordered the confiscation of the tipper

lorry number HG-3807.

The facts that led to the above order can be summarized in the following

manner.

One Thushara Sampath was charged before the Magistrates Court of Horana

for transporting 28 window frames and 8 doorframes made out of Mahogani

and Jak timber valued at Rs.172013.50 without a valid permit, and thereby

committing an offence punishable in terms of the Forest Act.

He has also been charged for having transported sand without a permit at the

same time and at the same transaction, which was an offence punishable in

terms of the Mines and Minerals Act.

The accused has pleaded guilty to the charges preferred against him, and had

been sentenced by the learned Magistrate. The illegally transported timber and

sand had been confiscated.

Thereafter, the learned Magistrate has allowed the appellant, who is the

registered owner of the tipper vehicle used in the commission of the offence of

transporting timber without a valid permit to show cause as to why the vehicle

should not be confiscated in terms of section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance.

Page 5 of 12

The relevant proviso of section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance, which provides

for confiscation of vehicles involved in an offence under the Ordinance, reads

as follows;

Provided that in any case where the owner of such, vehicle,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence,

is a third party, no order of confiscation shall made if such owner

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the

offence.

It is settled law that the mode of proof in an inquiry of this nature is on the

balance of probability. Hence, if it can be determined that the registered owner

of the vehicle has established that he has taken due precautions to prevent the

offence, and he was unaware of the commission of the offence, it needs to be

considered in favour of the owner of the vehicle.

In the case of The Finance Company PLC Vs. Priyantha Chandra and Five

Others (2010) 2 SLR 220, after considering several judicial decisions, Dr.

Shirani Bandaranayake, J. (As she was then) held:

On a consideration of the ratio decidendi of all the aforementioned

decisions, it is abundantly clear that in terms of section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance, as amended, if the owner of the vehicle in question was a third

party, no order of confiscation shall be made if that owner had proved to

the satisfaction of the Court that he has taken all precautions to prevent

the use of the said vehicle for the commission of the offence. The ratio

decidendi of all the aforementioned decisions also show that the owner

has to establish the said matter on the balance of probability.

Page 6 of 12

Held further:

As has been clearly illustrated by several decisions referred to above, it

would be necessary for the owner of the vehicle to establish that the

vehicle that had been used for the commission of the offence had been

used without his knowledge and that the owner had taken all precautions

available to prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission of such an

offence.

I must emphasize that what is meant by the legislature in its wisdom when it

was stated in section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance, had taken all

precautions to prevent the use needs to be interpreted in a pragmatic

manner, rather than giving a strict interpretation. It is my view that the facts

and the circumstances relevant to a given situation should be considered in its

totality, in order to find out whether there is justification in releasing a vehicle

to its owner. This is especially so, since, if the Court is to look for all the

possible precautions that an owner of a vehicle can take in a given scenario,

there can always be some other precaution that could have been taken.

At the inquiry held in that regard, only the appellant has given evidence to

substantiate his position.

After having considered the evidence placed before the Court, the learned

Magistrate of Horana by his order dated 28-08-2018 has determined that the

evidence of the petitioner cannot be relied upon and he has failed to establish

that he took all precautions to prevent the commission of the offence.

Accordingly, the vehicle No GH-3807 has been confiscated.

The appellant has filed an application in revision seeking to challenge the order

of the learned Magistrate before the Provincial High Court of the Western

Province holden in Colombo, where the learned High Court Judge of Colombo

had pronounced the impugned judgment dismissing the application on the

basis that it has no merit.

Page 7 of 12

It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the learned

Magistrate has imposed a very high burden of proof on the appellant as to the

matters stated by him while giving evidence at the inquiry, beyond the

requirement of proving the matters urged in the balance of probability. It was

his submission that based on a wrong burden of proof the learned magistrate

has considered the evidence of the petitioner and had rejected the same

without a sufficient basis. It was his contention that although the accused in

the matter has pleaded guilty to the charge preferred against him, he has been

convicted on a defective charge, which should have been considered at the

inquiry, as the defects of the charge upon which the accused had been

convicted are also relevant in an inquiry of this nature.

It was the position of the learned State Counsel who represented the

respondents that the learned Magistrate has come to a correct finding based on

the evidence placed before the Court that the petitioner has failed to prove that

he took necessary precautions to prevent the offence being committed. It was

the submission of the learned State Counsel that the accused in the case had

all the necessary knowledge about the charge against him when he pleaded

guilty to the charge and there was no material to show that he pleaded guilty

being misled as to the charge.

It was contended that since the learned Magistrate has pronounced a well-

considered order, and the learned High Court Judge who heard the application

in revision too has addressed his mind to the relevant provisions of law in the

impugned judgment and had rightly dismissed it, the appeal should stand

dismissed for want of merit.

It needs to be emphasized that, although it was only the petitioner who has

given evidence at the inquiry, it is not the number of witnesses that matters,

but the quality of the evidence.

Page 8 of 12

I find that the learned Magistrate was well aware of this legal principle and the

relevant section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance, when the evidence of the

petitioner was evaluated in order to find whether the petitioner has established

the fact that he had no knowledge of the offence being committed, and that he

had taken precautions to prevent such an offence.

Although the learned Magistrate has used wrong words when it was stated that

there is a much higher burden ( ) on the petitioner

to prove the facts, I do not find it a reason to accept that the learned Magistrate

has looked at the evidence other than on the balance of probability as required

by law.

Therefore, I am of the view that only if it can be established that the learned

Magistrate was misdirected in that regard and the learned High Court Judge

too had failed to consider the revision application in its correct perspective, the

petitioner becomes entitled to obtain the reliefs sought by him in his petition of

appeal.

As considered correctly by the learned Magistrate, the accused of the case or

the petitioner had never been misled as to the charges against him due to any

alleged defects in the charges.

The relevant section 166 of the Code Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows;

166. Any error in stating either the offence or the particulars

required to be stated in the charge and any omission to state the

offence or these particulars shall not be regarded at any stage of the

case as material, unless the accused was misled by such error or

omissions.

It is clear that the accused has pleaded guilty knowing very well that he was

being charged for transporting timber and sand without a permit as required

by law. After convicting and sentencing the accused, the learned Magistrate

following the due process of law, has allowed the petitioner, the person who

Page 9 of 12

came forward before the Court as the registered owner of the vehicle, who was

not the accused in the case, to establish the requirements of the proviso of

section 40 (1) of the Forest Ordinance in order to decide whether to confiscate

the vehicle involved in the offence or not.

It clearly appears that the petitioner knew very well the matters he needed to

establish before the Court when he gave evidence before the Magistrates Court

under the guidance of his Counsel. It is my view that any alleged defects of the

charge had no relevance to the inquiry held before the Magistrates Court as no

prejudice has been caused to the accused even if there was any defect as

alleged.

Under the circumstances, I will now proceed to consider whether the learned

Magistrate was correct when it was determined that the evidence of the

petitioner cannot be relied upon, and he has attempted to concoct a story

before the Court.

As determined correctly by the learned Magistrate, the petitioner had been the

registered owner of the vehicle subjected to the inquiry. According to the

petitioner, as stated in his evidence in chief, he has purchased this vehicle in

the year 2017, and after using it for his business purposes, had handed over

the vehicle to a close friend of him called Mahinda to be used in his cement

block manufacturing business.

He has handed over the vehicle in December 2017 on the basis that his friend

should pay a monthly amount of Rs. 50000/-. The vehicle had been subjected

to a finance facility and the petitioner had paid the monthly finance rental

which amounted to a sum of Rs. 42000/- out of the monthly payment he

received for the vehicle. It had been his evidence that he gave necessary

instructions to his friend that the vehicle should not be used for any illegal

activities, and his instruction was to hand over the vehicle every day after work

at his house.

Page 10 of 12

However, when questioned by the Court at a later stage of his evidence he has

stated that he purchased the vehicle in November 2014 and handed it over to

his friend in the year 2017.

The appellant has stated that on the 3rd of April 2018, he came to know

through his friend that the vehicle was detained by the Bandaragama police.

He has claimed that when he came later to the police station only, he came to

know that the vehicle has been used to transport timber and sand without a

valid permit. He has claimed that the person who used the vehicle to transport

timber has done so not to earn money, but to help one of his nieces, and the

timber had been purchased from a timber merchant. He has claimed that the

incident occurred without his knowledge and had urged for the release of the

vehicle.

I find the determination of the learned Magistrate highly justified as to the

reliability of the evidence of the petitioner. When he gave evidence, he has

failed even to mention the correct vehicle registration number of the vehicle.

Instead of the correct number GH-3807, the number stated by him as his

vehicle registration number had been GH-3704, which was wrong. Not only

that, he has claimed in his evidence in chief that he handed over the vehicle to

one Duminda, who is a good friend of him, but under cross-examination, has

stated that the friend's name is Mahinda.

Being the registered owner, and if he was claiming the vehicle on that basis, he

should at least know the driver of the vehicle, even if he was a person employed

by his claimed friend, if he was vigilant about his vehicle as claimed by him. He

has admitted in his evidence that he did not know who the driver was, until he

came to the police station after he was informed that the vehicle is under the

custody of police.

In his evidence, the appellant has stated that his instructions to his friend was

that the vehicle should be brought back to his house after each days work. If it

Page 11 of 12

was so, can there be any reason for him to not know who the driver of the

vehicle was. There was no evidence to suggest that the driver was a person

employed only for that day without the knowledge of the appellant either.

There cannot be any reason for his good friend to not inform him the reason for

the detention of his vehicle when he telephoned him to inform of that fact even

after when asked, which creates a serious doubt as to his claim that he knew

nothing until he came to the police station.

With all the above considered discrepancies and improbabilities in the evidence

of the appellant, I find that the learned Magistrate was highly justified in

determining that the evidence of the appellant appears to be a concocted story

in order to get over the problem he was faced with.

As I have considered before, although the number of witnesses called to prove a

fact is irrelevant in an inquiry of this nature, I find that given the unreliable

nature of the witness called in this particular inquiry, the failure by the

appellant to call the relevant witnesses who could have substantiated his story

becomes very much relevant.

If the person named Duminda or Mahinda, whom the appellant has claimed a

good friend, and the person responsible for the entire episode is called to give

evidence and substantiate the position of the appellant, most of the

discrepancies in the evidence by the appellant would have been cleared or

clarified.

I find that what had been stated as what was told to him by the said person

becomes mere hearsay, which cannot be considered acceptable evidence

without that person being called as a witness.

I find that the learned Magistrate has well considered all the relevant facts

based on the evidence placed before him in his determination.

Page 12 of 12

Even if this Court is to look at the evidence led in the case, giving a liberal

interpretation to the words he had taken all precautions to prevent the use

of such. as stated in the proviso to section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance,

there cannot be any justification whatsoever to disagree with the finding of the

learned Magistrate that the vehicle should stand confiscated.

Similarly, I find no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge as it had been reached after well considering the relevant

provisions of law.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of any merit.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to forward this judgment with the original

case record to the relevant High Court. The Registrar is also directed to send a

copy of the judgment to the Magistrates Court of Horana for necessary steps.
