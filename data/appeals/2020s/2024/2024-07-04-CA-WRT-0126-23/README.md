extent of 50 Acres pending the determination of this Application by Your

Lordships Court

(g) Grant Costs;

(h) Grant such other and further reliefs that Your Lordships Court shall deem meet.

The facts relevant to this case are as follows,

The 1st Respondent issued a quit notice to the Petitioner Company on 18.01.2023,

pursuant to section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, as

amended. This followed a previous quit notice dated 20.12.2021, against which the

Petitioner had filed Writ Application No. 36/2022 to quash the notice. The Respondent

thereafter withdrew this quit notice, and the Petitioner then moved to withdraw the

action. The proceedings were terminated on 26.02.2022. After these proceedings

concluded, the Petitioner received another quit notice on 18.03.2023.

The main contention of the Petitioners are that the company acquired the disputed

property through Deed of Transfer No. 171, dated 17.01.2016. According to Plan No. 354,

dated 27.12.2012, the property encompasses an extent of 50 acres. The said Deed, marked

as P9, describes the meets and bounds of the land as follows:

NORTH:- Remaining Part of the Land called Galahitiyawewa alias Galahitiya wewa

bedda,

SOUTH:- Remaning Part of the Land called Galahitiyawewa alias Galahitiya wewa

bedda,

EAST:- Remaining Part of the Land Called Galahitiyawewa alias Galahitiya wewa

bedda,

Page 4 of 8

WEST:- Road reservation and Remaining Part of the Land called Galahitiyawewa alias

Galahitiya wewa bedda,

According to the Petitioner, the land in question is private land. It has been developed for

a sustainable and environmentally friendly Cotton and Soybean Cultivation and

Processing Plant.

To strengthen their claim, the following documents were submitted as evidence that the

land is private:

1. A letter from the District Secretary of the Hambantota District Secretariat, dated

27.05.2016 and marked as P13, confirmed that the land is private, as verified by

the Senior Superintendent of Surveyor of Hambantota.

2. An extract from the tenement list, marked P19, issued by the Senior

Superintendent of Surveys on behalf of the Surveyor General, dated 08.10.2008,

confirms that the land, part of a larger land known as 'Galahitiyawewabedda

Jungle,' is private.

3. An extract from the Register of Land Settlement, marked P-19(a), establishes that

Lots 1U, 1AA, and 88C are determined to be private lands.

4. A letter from the Land Title Settlement Department, dated 25.05.2015, confirms

that, according to the Final Report dated 31.10.1933 in respect of Final

Topographical Plan No. 4, Lots 1U, 1AA, and 88C have been declared as paraveni

property, with no determination made regarding their ownership.

These documents were filed in Case No. CA/Writ/36/2022. It is pertinent to note that when

the Petitioners relied on these documents in the aforementioned case, the Respondents

withdrew the specific quit notice. However, three months later, the Respondents issued

another quit notice concerning the same land. For ease of reference and to determine

whether the land mentioned in the latest quit notice is the same, I would like to reproduce

both schedules referred to in the said notices.

; - : ... 4 10 m%foaYho ; - : ... 4 10 m%foaYho; - : ... 4 10 m%foaYho; - : .. 4 10 m%foaYho m%Odk

Page 5 of 8

The Petitioner has primarily relied on a document in which the Respondent expressly

acknowledges that Lots 1AA, 1U, and 88C of Final Topographical Plan No. 4 are depicted

as private land. The land in question, shown in Plan No. 354 dated 27.12.2012 and marked

as P8, clearly indicates that it is part of a portion of Lot 1AA from Final Topographical

Plan No. 4. The endorsement on this particular plan reads as follows:

.

According to P19, the tenement list extract indicates that Lot No. 1AA, as depicted in Plan

No. FTB No.4, comprises 160 acres and is acknowledged as private land. These facts have

not been disputed by the Respondent. It is important to note that these documents were

prepared by the Surveyor General.

Under Section 83 of the Evidence Ordinance, when maps are authenticated and signed by

the Surveyor-General, the Court is entitled to presume their accuracy.

Section 83 of the Evidence Ordinance (Chapter XIV) reads as follows:

'The Court shall presume that maps, plans, or surveys purporting to be signed by the

Surveyor-General, or an officer acting on his behalf, were duly authorized and are

accurate; however, maps, plans, or surveys not bearing a signature must be independently

verified for accuracy.'

Similar provision is available in the Section 22 of the Survey Act No 17 of 2002 which

reads as follows;

Any cadastral map, plan, or any other plan or map prepared in accordance with

any written law, purporting to be a true copy of such a plan or map and purporting

to be signed by the Surveyor-General or any officer acting on his behalf shall, be

admissible in evidence in all cases and for all purposes instead of the original, and

may (without proof that the original is not procurable) be taken as prima facie

evidence of the truth of the facts stated therein as being that of the original and it

shall not be necessary to prove that such copy was in fact signed or authenticated

by the Surveyor-General or such officer nor that it is a true copy, nor that the facts

Page 6 of 8

reflected therein are accurate, until evidence to the contrary shall have first been

given.

Both sections indicate that when the aforementioned documents are presented, the Court

should consider them as prima facie evidence of the veracity of the facts stated therein

until contradicted by other evidence. Thus, these documents establish that the said land

is private.

Conversely, the Respondents assert that Lot A, depicted in the referenced plan, is part of

Lot 1AA from Plan 4, and that Lot 1AA is delineated as a separate portion of land in

survey plan R1. According to the Respondents, the Petitioners occupy a piece of State

Land, which they have mistakenly identified as private land. We are cognizant that when

the Respondents form an opinion that the land in question is State Land, the Court must

ensure that such an opinion is founded on a rational basis. In this case, the Petitioners

have established through the Surveyor Generals plans that the land in question is

private. No evidence has been presented to suggest that the land is State Land.

The central question before us is whether the Respondent acted illegally, unreasonably,

or irrationally in forming the opinion that the land is State Land. Our courts have ruled

that the exercise of powers must be reasonable and within the conferred jurisdiction.

Ambagasdowa V Jayasinghe Mudiyanselage Chamila Indika Jayasinghe CA Writ

Application No. 293/2017 decided on 18.11.2019 has referred the Dicta of Lord Diplock in

Council of civil service union v Minister for Civil Service 1985 AC 374 held that,

This brings this Court back to the issue that arises for determination - i.e. did the

Respondent act illegally or unreasonably or irrationally when he formed his opinion that

the land which is the subject matter of the said quit notice is State land.

Further held that;

As observed at the outset, the starting point of the steps that are initiated under the Act

is Section 3(1), which clearly requires the Competent Authority to form an opinion that

Page 7 of 8

the land in respect of which he is going to put in motion the procedures laid down in the

Act, is land to which the State is lawfully entitled. When one considers the detailed

provisions of the Act, which has been outlined above, and the objective that is sought to

be achieved, which is the expeditious recovery of State land from persons who are in

unauthorised occupation of such State lands, it is the view of this Court that the

Competent Authority is only required to form an opinion that the impugned land is land

to which the State is lawfully entitled to, and that the possession or occupation is

unauthorized.

In the present case, the Petitioner is contesting the legitimacy of the quit notices through

a Writ of Certiorari, arguing that the land described in P7 is not state-owned but private

property. This action challenges the competent authoritys assessment. The disputed quit

notice was issued under Section 3(1) of the aforementioned Act.

The Petitioner has established, via the final report of the Final Topographical Plan No. 4

prepared on 31.10.1993 under the Land Settlement Ordinance No. 20 of 1931, as

amended, that Lot 1A is private land. This is supported by a letter dated 25.05.2015 from

the Land Settlement Department. These documents were not contested by the

Respondent. It was further established that the land depicted in Plan No. 354 is part of

Lot 1AA. Conversely, the Respondents failed to present the surveyor plan and argued that

the documents filed by the Petitioner do not pertain to the land in question. Their main

argument is that the impugned quit notice pertains not to Lot 1AA but to an adjacent Lot

A, as shown in R1, without providing evidence to contradict the Petitioners version. Upon

reviewing P7, no survey plan specific to this quit notice is present, and no survey plan

was indicated previously, demonstrating that the Respondent formed an opinion without

a Survey Plan or any other documents and have to come to conclusion that it is State

Land.

We hold that the Respondents have not established any rational basis for their opinion

that the property is state property, nor is there justification for such an opinion.

We recognize that when a competent authority, having determined that the land is state

land, issues a quit notice and the individual fails to vacate, the Respondent may apply

before the Magistrate Court. However, the Learned Magistrate is not empowered to

question the legality of this opinion. Under the act, the scope of inquiry before the

Page 8 of 8

Magistrate is limited to whether the Respondent has a valid permit or written authority.

If the answer is negative, the Magistrate must issue an order for ejection.

Therefore, our Courts have evaluated whether the opinions formed by the Competent

Authorities are Ultra Vires. We hold that the Respondent, in forming his opinion as

required by Section 3(1) of the act, acted illegally and unreasonably.

Accordingly, this Court issues a Writ of Certiorari in terms of paragraph C of the prayer

to the petition, quashing the decision of the 1st Respondent which was marked as P7, and

issues a writ of prohibition in terms of paragraph D of the prayer to the petition,

restraining the Respondents from taking steps to evict the Petitioner from the said land.

The application is allowed with costs.
