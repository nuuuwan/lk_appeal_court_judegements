on 2021/07/12 by the 1st Respondent, the District Judge, District Court of

c) Grant a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting further initial hearing of the case

M/1192/20 by the District Judge, District Court of Kesbawa.

d) Grant an interim order restraining the District Judge, District Court of

Kesbawa from hearing the case M/1192/20 until the final determination

of this matter.

Facts of the Petitioners Case

3) The Petitioner has submitted a petition with 54 paragraphs running into

73 pages. On perusal of paragraphs 1 to 53, the Petitioners contention is

that the District Judge had not given a hearing to the Petitioner and had

violated the Principles of Natural Justice.

4) Therefore, the said District Judge serving as a District Judge will cause

severe damage to the parties who are seeking justice before him.

5) Further, he had stated that even being an Attorney-at-Law his case had

been heard unlawfully, if in the event an ordinary citizen had appeared,

the injustice caused would be irreparable.

6) In addition, the complaints made by the Petitioner in respect of the

prayers sought in the case is that the District Judge has decided the order

in favour of the Defendants in case No: N/1192/20 of the District Court of

Kesbawa to be quashed and invalidated and to issue an interim order

against the said District Judge not to hear the aforesaid case.

7) When referring to the paragraphs 4 to 9 of the petition, the Petitioners

complaint was that the District Judge has given a 59 day gap to show

cause for not issuing interim orders against the Defendants and had not

considered the request and objections raised by the Petitioner.

8) Furthermore, it was alleged that the District Judge had arbitrarily used

his discretion, made favorable arrangements for the Defendants and had

not given a fair hearing to the Petitioner.

9) The District Judge was biased towards the Defendants and had noted the

details incorrectly when delivering the order. Further, he had given several

C.A. WRIT NO. 635-21

4

dates to submit their written submissions which have caused a reasonable

suspicion for the Petitioner of the Independence of the Judiciary.

10) In the other paragraphs of the said petition, the Petitioner had repeated

the same facts. In addition the Petitioner has contended that the

Petitioner has drawn the attention of the District Judge towards

inconvenience encountered with the court staff. However, the District

Judge has failed to consider the request made by the Petitioner.

11) It is also contended that when the Petitioner drew the attention of the

Court towards the fraudulent documents tendered by the Defendants, the

District Judge failed to take any action.

12) Although the Defendants have misled the Court, the District Judge has

given biased orders in favour of the Defendants.

13) On the aforesaid grounds, the Petitioner had sought to issue notice and

interim orders against the Respondents.

Disputed Facts

14) This case was supported by the Petitioner on 4th December 2023 and

sought formal notice against the Respondents. The Counsels appeared for

the 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the Deputy Solicitor General appeared for

the 5th Respondent objected for issuing notice against the Respondents.

15) After hearing the submissions, this case was fixed for the order to be

delivered on 12th January 2024.

16) In considering the petition, documents and the submissions made by the

Counsels to issue notice, the following disputed facts need to be

addressed.

I. Was case No: M/1192/20 heard before the 1st Respondent?

II. If so, was the District Judge biased towards the Defendants without

giving a proper hearing to the Plaintiff in that case?

C.A. WRIT NO. 635-21

III. Is there sufficient material to maintain a Writ Application against the 1st

Respondent that he was biased towards the Defendant in M/1192/20

and is it a matter to be decided in a different forum?

IV. Is there sufficient material to prove that the 1st Respondent considered

case No: M/1192/20 differently from other cases before him?

I. Was Case No: M/1192/20 heard before the 1st Respondent?

17) The aforesaid case had been heard by the 1st Respondent and delivered the

order related by the Petitioner.

18) Both parties have no dispute that the said matter was heard by the 1st

Respondent and the relevant order challenged by the Petitioner was

delivered by the 1st Respondent.

19) The Petitioner had sought the reliefs prayed for in the prayers (a) to (d)

based on the said order and the way in which the 1st Respondent had

conducted himself.

II If so, was the 1st Respondent biased towards the Defendants without

giving a proper hearing to the Plaintiff in that case?

20) The main contention of the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent acted bias

and favored the Defendants in case No: M/1192/20. To support that the

Petitioner had submitted the Documents P1 to P46.

21) The main argument raised by the Petitioner in the instant application is

that the 1st Respondent had neglected the submissions and the objections

raised by the Petitioner in the District Court of Kesbawa and made

favourable arrangements for the Defendants.

22) Further, the District Judge has given a 59 day gap to show cause for not

issuing an interim order and for the other applications made by the

Defendants in the aforesaid case.

C.A. WRIT NO. 635-21

23) In considering the aforesaid facts and perusal of the documents filed by

the Petitioner there is no evidence to show that the said dates had been

given by the 1st Respondent in favour of the Defendants in case No:

M/1192/20.

24) Beside these facts, there is no evidence or documents before this Court to

satisfy the work load of the District Court of Kesbawa and the context on

which the dates are given. To consider this, at least the Roll Book and the

Trial and Inquiry Roll should be considered. Without any of those this

Court cannot verify on the grounds on which the specific dates had been

given to the Petitioner and the Defendants.

25) Most often the District Judges grants dates according to their

Trial/Inquiry Roll and the Day Book. Therefore, without considering those

documents there is no evidence to prove that the 1st Respondent acted

favouring the Defendants by granting long dates.

26) Although the Petitioner had stated his facts in 54 paragraphs on the

petition, most of the facts are repeated more than once.

27) With the available documents there is no suspicion that can be drawn that

the 1st Respondent acted favourably towards the Defendants.

28) Furthermore, the Petitioner had drawn the attention of this Court that

even after complaining to the 1st Respondent about the inconvenience

which he encountered with the court staff, the 1st Respondent had not

taken any consideration of the said complaints.

29) It is my considered view, that it is a matter for the 1st Respondent to give

oral direction to the staff and there is no sufficient material before this

Court that the 1st Respondent had not attended to it.

30) Other than this, the Petitioner had contended that the 1st Respondent had

considered fraudulent documents tendered by the Defendants in case No:

M/1192/20 and the 1st Respondent accepted additional written

submissions made by the Defendants.

C.A. WRIT NO. 635-21

31) It is obvious that the said matters do not come within the purview of this

Court or Writ Jurisdiction. If the 1st Respondent had not considered the

documents and he was bias towards delivering the order it is up to the

Petitioner to go before an appellate forum to correct it and when there is

an alternative remedy, the Petitioner cannot seek a Writ Jurisdiction

remedy before this Court.

32) In the said circumstances, I do not see that the 1st Respondent was bias or

had made the relevant order in favour of the Defendants in case No:

M/1192/20.

III Is there sufficient material to maintain a Writ Application against the

1st Respondent that he was biased towards the Defendant in

M/1192/20 and is it a matter to be decided in a different forum?

33) In the instant action, the reliefs sought by the Petitioner is to make null

and void the order dated 12th July 2021 delivered by the 1st Respondent in

case No: M/1192/20 and to deliver an order in favour of the Petitioner and

to restrain the 1st Respondent from hearing the case No: M/1192/20.

34) In considering the reliefs sought by the Petitioner, if a Judge had acted

with bias or in favour of a particular party there are certain grounds to be

considered to issue a restrain order for the said Judge to hear that case.

35) As it was decided in Daya Wettasinghe V Mala Ranawaka1, Wijetunga J

had made the following observation in the instant action to consider

alleged bias against a Judicial Officer.

A party seeking to establish bias undertakes a heavy burden of

proof. Mere reasonable suspicion is not enough. A Judicial Officer

is a person with a legally trained mind and court will, not lightly

entertain an allegation of bias. The Petitioner has failed to

establish bias.

36) In the case of Abdul Haseeb V Mendi Perera and Others2, GPS De Silva

J had decided on a test for disquifying bias as follows;

The tests for disqualifying bias are

(a) The test of real likelihood of bias

(b) The test of reasonable suspicion of bias

On the application of either test, bias on the part of the Judge has

not been establishedThe expression expedient in Section 46

means advisable in the interests of justice.

37) Furthermore, in the case of Kumarasena V Data Management Systems

Limited3 Gunawardene J had decided as follows.

Re bias it is not only that the Judge should be impartial, he must

appear impartial. In considering whether there was a real

likelihood of bias, the court does not look at the mind of the justice

himself but at the impression which would be given to other

people. Even if he was as impartial as could be nevertheless if

right minded persons would think that in the circumstances there

was a real likelihood of bias on his part, then he should not sit.

There must appear to be a real likelihood of bias. Surmise or

conjecture is not enough. Will responsible people think the Judge

favoured one side unfairly?

38) In considering the aforesaid judgements, it is emphasized that the grounds

on which the Court has to consider whether a Judge is biased.

39) I do not see any grounds supported by the Petitioner come under the

purview of the aforesaid judgments.

40) Therefore, this Court cannot consider the contention made by the

Petitioner that the 1st Respondent has acted with bias and favoured his

decision towards the Defendants in case No: M/1192/29.

IV Is there sufficient material to prove that the 1st Respondent

considered case No: M/1192/20 differently from other cases before

him?

41) There is no material placed before this Court that the 1st Respondent had

heard case No: M/1192/20 in a different manner to the other cases before

him.

42) As there is no iota of evidence or material in considering the aforesaid

judgments, I am of the view that the Petitioner has failed to prove that the

1st Respondent had acted bias or favoured the Defendants in case No:

M/1192/20.

43) In the said circumstances, making allegation against the Judges

unnecessarily and trying to tarnish the reputation of the judges should not

be considered lightly.

44) On the aforesaid grounds, I am of the view that heavy cost should be

imposed in the instant matter against the Petitioner for making

applications of this nature.

CONCLUSION

45) In view of that I dismiss the undated petition of November 2021 subject to

payment of cost of Rs. 50 000/- for each Respondent.
