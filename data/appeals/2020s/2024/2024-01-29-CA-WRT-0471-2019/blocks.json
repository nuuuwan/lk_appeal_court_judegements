Pursuant to a formal disciplinary inquiry held against the Petitioner, a Disciplinary Order dated 14.09.2012, marked 1R1, was issued on the Petitioner. The said order imposes, inter alia, deferment of two salary increments as a punishment on the Petitioner. It is the contention of the Petitioner that as per the provisions of the Minute of the Sri Lanka Inland Revenue Service published in the Gazette Extraordinary No 133/5 dated 15.10.1974, promotion to Class II Grade I of the Sri Lanka Inland Revenue Service should be made on the basis of seniority and satisfactory work reports. As the Petitioner had acquired all the qualifications stipulated by the said Minute that are required to be promoted to the Class Il Grade I of the Sri Lanka Inland Revenue Service by 01.10.2009, the Petitioner made several requests from the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue to promote him to the Class II Grade I of the said Service with effect from 01.10.2009. Thereafter, the Minute of the Sri Lanka Inland Revenue Service published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 133/5 dated 15.10.1974, was replaced by the Minute of the Sri Lanka Inland Revenue Service published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1804/50 dated 05.04.2013. Subsequently, the Petitioner was absorbed to Executive Grade III of the Sri Lanka Inland Revenue Service as per the new Minute with effect from 01.10.2012 and thereafter the Public Service Commission promoted the Petitioner to the Grade Executive I (previously Class II Grade I) of the said Service with effect from 01.10.2013. As the said promotion has not been made with effect from 01.10.2009 the Petitioner made an appeal marked X1 to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal seeking that he may be promoted to Executive Grade II of the said Service with effect from 01.10.2009.",

In its observations the Public Service Commission has stated that the Petitioner could be promoted to Executive Grade Il of the said Service with effect from 01.10.2011. However, the Public Service Commission contended that in computing the satisfactory service two years should be deducted for the deferment of two salary increments, and therefore the Petitioner could not be promoted to Executive Grade II of the said service with effect from 01.10.2009. After concluding its hearing, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by Order dated 07.05.2019, marked X7, dismissed the appeal of the Petitioner. It is against this Order marked X7 that the Petitioner has made the present Application impugning the final Order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. However, Clause 09 of the Minutes of the Inland Revenue Service published in Extraordinary Gazette 133/05 dated 15.10.1974 (the Old Minutes of Service) marked 1R3 governs the promotion of the Petitioner to Class II Grade I of the Inland Revenue Service.

In the instant matter, it is undisputed that the Petitioner reached the salary scale of Rs 124,500 on 01.10.2005, as evinced by the Petitioner in the document marked X3 in paragraph (4). In ordinary circumstances, the Petitioner would rightfully merit promotion to Class II, Grade I of the Inland Revenue Service on 01.10.2009. However, the Respondents have appended a Disciplinary Order, marked as 1R1. Through this Disciplinary Order, the Petitioner was adjudged culpable on all charges outlined in a Charge Sheet, with the exception of the 2nd Charge. One of the punishments meted to the Petitioner was the deferment of two salary increments. The deferment of the two salary increments was done with respect to the years 2007 and 2008, as per document X at page 92. Accordingly, the Public Service Commission had to determine whether the Petitioner had 4 years of satisfactory service from 01.10.2005, in order to be promoted to Class II, Grade I of the Inland Revenue Service with effect from 01.10.2009. Therefore, the Public Service Commission had recourse to its Procedural Rules to determine whether the Petitioner had 4 years of satisfactory service from 01.10. 2005.

Accordingly, the Public Service Commission excluded the years 2007 and 2008 when computing the Petitioner's satisfactory service from 01.10.2005. Thus, the Petitioner has no entitlement under the Old Service Minute read with the Public Service Commission Procedural Rules to obtain a promotion to Class II, Grade I of the Inland Revenue Service with effect from 01.10.2009.
