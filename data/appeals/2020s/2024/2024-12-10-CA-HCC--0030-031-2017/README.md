JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) along with the 2nd Accused were indicted jointly in the High Court

of Puttalam under Section 296 of the Penal Code for committing the murder

of Jayasundara Mudiyanselage Nimal Dayaratna on or about 06th May 2006.

As the 2nd Accused passed away during the pendency of the trial, the

indictment was amended accordingly.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Puttalam as the

Appellants had opted for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of the

prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the defence

and the Appellants had given evidence from the witness box and had been

subjected to lengthy cross examination by the prosecution. Additionally, the

Appellants had called two witnesses on their behalf. After considering the

evidence presented by both parties, the learned High Court Judge had

convicted the Appellants as charged and sentenced them to death on

06/04/2017.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent to argue this matter in their absence. Also, at

the time of argument the Appellants were connected via Zoom platform from

prison.

Background of the Case.

The prosecution case rest mainly on the testimony of an eye witness and

circumstantial evidence.

PW1 Chandrasena is the eye witness in this case. According to him on the

date of the incident at about 11:00 a.m. while he was returning from

Palugaswewa along with the deceased in his motor bike, he had seen a lorry

following him. When he gave space to the lorry to overtake, the lorry had hit

the motor bike from behind and as a result the deceased had fallen down.

Immediately, the deceased had shouted for the witness to flee the scene.

When he was running away, he had seen the Appellants and the 2nd Accused

attacking the deceased with two swords and a knife. The witness had

identified the Appellants clearly at that time. As he shouted after seeing the

deceased being assaulted, people had gathered and the Appellants have fled

the scene in the lorry. No animosity has been reported between the deceased

and the Appellants. He had made his statement to the police on the same

day at 1.30 p.m.

Dr. Saman De Silva who had conducted the postmortem examination had

noted serious injuries on the neck region. According to the doctor the death

had been caused due to damage caused to major blood vessels in the neck

region of the deceased.

The Appellants had jointly canvassed the Appeal grounds through the

learned Presidents Counsel.

The First Appellant had filed the following grounds of appeal.

1. Has the prosecution proved their case beyond reasonable doubt.

2. Has the learned Trial Judge misdirected himself in considering the

omission referred in the trial.

CA/HCC/30-31/2017

3. The alibi taken by the accused have not been adequately considered

by the Learned Trial Judge.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellants had contended under the

1st ground of appeal that the infirmities in the evidence of the main eye

witness have not been given due consideration.

The Learned Presidents Counsel strenuously argued that the Learned Trial

Judge had failed to consider all the circumstances whether PW1,

Chandrasena had witnessed the incident as claimed by him in his testimony.

As stated above, PW1 Chandrasena who is an eye witness had vividly

explained how this gruesome incident had happened. He had clearly seen

the attack on the deceased before he could call for help.

In Wijepala v AG [2001] 1 SLR 46 the Court held that:

Evidence of a single witness, if cogent and impressive, can be acted

upon by a Court, but, whenever there are circumstances with suspicion

in the testimony of such witness, then corroboration may be necessary.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had considered the evidence

given by PW1 extensively and properly analyzed his evidence in its correct

perspective. He has reasonably considered all direct and circumstantial

evidence to arrive at his decision.

Further, the eye witness PW1 had given evidence in the High Court nearly

08 years after the incident. I consider his evidence to be clear and cogent

and it had not shaken his credibility or testimonial trustworthiness.

As the Learned High Court had Judge had considered all these evidences in

his judgment, it is incorrect to say that the Learned High Court Judge had

failed to give due consideration to the evidence of PW1 and the prosecution

CA/HCC/30-31/2017

6 | P a g e

had failed their duty to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Hence,

I conclude that this ground has no merit.

Under the 2nd ground of appeal, the Learned Presidents Counsel contended

that the Learned High Court Judge did not give due consideration regarding

the omission highlighted by the Appellant.

Owing to many different reasons, contradictions and omissions between the

testimonies presented by different witnesses of the same case are more or

less common in criminal trials. It is the duty of the Courts as well as the

professional legal representatives to accurately distinguish between minor

and major discrepancies, the latter of which would only stand to affect the

case.

Further, in a criminal trial it is not always possible for a trial judge to observe

all the witnesses who had testified before a court. This is due to various

factors including the transfers and retirement of judicial officers.

In State of Uttar Pradesh v. M. K. Anthony [AIR 1985 SC 48] the court

held that:

While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must

be whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears

to have a ring of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is

undoubtedly necessary for the court to scrutinise the evidence

more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies, draw-backs

and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and

evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor

of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier

evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of

belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core

of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking sentences torn

CA/HCC/30-31/2017

7 | P a g e

out of context here or there from the evidence, attaching

importance to some technical error committed by the investigating

officer not going to the: root of the matter would not ordinarily

permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. Even honest and

truthful witnesses may differ in some details unrelated to the

main incident because power of observation, retention and

reproduction differ with individuals. Cross examination is an

unequal duel between a rustic and refined lawyer.

In The Attorney General v Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa [2011] 2 SLR

292 the court held that:

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgment on the nature of the inconsistency

or contradiction and whether they are true material to the facts in issue.

In this case although the highlighted omission was not brought to the

attention of the learned High Court Judge who wrote the judgment, he had

given due consideration to it in his judgment and given plausible reason as

to why he disregarded the same.

Considering the circumstances under which the eye witness had witnessed

the incident and the time period in which he had given evidence after the

incident before the High Court, I consider the omission highlighted under

this ground of appeal has no significance to this case as it is not forceful

enough to affect the root of the case.

In the final ground appeal put forth by the Appellants, the Learned

Presidents Counsel contended that the alibi taken by the accused have not

been adequately considered by the Learned Trial Judge.

CA/HCC/30-31/2017

8 | P a g e

It is trite law that no burden is cast upon the accused to prove his alibi, as

an alibi is not a defense. It is the duty of the Learned High Court Judge to

consider the alibi and if doubt arises in the mind of the Learned Trial Judge,

the benefit of the doubt must be awarded to the accused.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment at pages 242 to 243 of the

brief had considered the evidence given by the Appellants and given reasons

as to why he rejects the defense evidence. Hence, this ground also has no

merit.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge had considered and analyzed the

evidence accurately even though he did not have the advantage of seeing the

demeanour and deportment of the witnesses who had given evidence before

his predecessor.

Further, the Appellants had given evidence under oath and had been

subjected to cross-examination by the State Counsel.

The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial is the

observance of the principle of equality of arms between the defence and the

prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed throughout the trial,

means that both parties are treated in a manner ensuring their procedurally

equal position during the course of the trial.

In this case the learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence

presented by both parties to arrive at his decision. He has properly analyzed

the evidence given by both sides in his judgment. As the evidence adduced

by the Appellants failed to create a doubt over the prosecution case, the

conclusion reached by the learned High Court Judge in this case cannot be

faulted.

CA/HCC/30-31/2017

9 | P a g e

As discussed under the grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellants, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating evidence against the

Appellants. The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly analyzed all

the evidence presented by all the parties and arrived at a correct finding that

the Appellants were guilty of committing the murder of the deceased in this

case.

Therefore, I affirm the conviction and dismiss the Appeal of the Appellants.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgement to the High

Court of Puttalam along with the original case record.
