Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. W. A. KALUARACHCHI, J. Counsel: R. Dabare with S. Ponnamperuma for the Petitioners. Ms. Navodi De Zoysa, SC for the Respondents. Supported on: 26.10.2023 Written Submissions tendered on: 08.12.2023 by the Petitioner 11.12.2023 by the Respondent Decided on: 12.02.2024 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. When this matter was taken up for support on 26-10-2023 for formal notices

to the Respondent, the learned State Counsel appearing for the Respondents

raised preliminary legal objections as to the maintainability of this

Application, which reads thus;

As several reliefs sought for by the Petitioners are either already granted

and/or public duty does not arise in order to issue a mandate in the nature of

a Writ of Mandamus against the Respondents, this matter has now become

futile.

In a nutshell, the Petitioners allege that certain parties have commenced

construction and expansion of an eighteen-kilometer gravel road from Neluwa

to Deniyaya running through the Sinharaja Forest Reserve and such

construction is in violation of several statutory provisions. The Sinharaja

Forest is a forest reserve that has been declared as a National Heritage

Wilderness Area. The construction of reservoirs at Madugate and Katapola

and the construction of the aforesaid roadway will negatively affect the

biodiversity of the ecosystem of the Sinharaja Forest Reserve. In those

circumstances, the Petitioners are seeking, inter alia, Wits of Mandamus

compelling the Respondents to take legal actions against the perpetrators in

terms of the provisions of the National Heritage and Wilderness Area Act

Page 4 of 5

No. 03 of 1988 and the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, directing

the 1st Respondent to protect the Sinharja forest, directing the Respondents

to prepare an updated management plan for Sinharaja National Heritage and

Wilderness area and for Sinharaja Forest Reserve in consultation with

pertinent stakeholders and implementation of a plan of action to address

threats and fill management gaps in conservation and protection of Sinharaja.

Seeking an Order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus compelling the

Respondents to demarcate the boundaries of the Sinharaja National Heritage

and Wilderness area and the Sinharaja Forest Reserve.

The contention of the Respondents was that there had been a roadway that

was in existence for several decades used by the people to travel from Neluwa

to Deniyaya. The portion of the said roadway which is from Lankagama to

Deniyaya is outside the Sinharaja World Heritage Site and such portion has

been widened and renovated. A certain portion of the said roadway which

traverses through the Sinharaja Heritage Site has been reconstructed without

widening up the existing roadway which will not cause any damage to the

forest. There was never a new construction of a roadway through the

Sinharaja World Heritage. In these circumstances, the learned State Counsel

has taken up the position that several reliefs sought by the Petitioners are

either granted or public duty does not arise to issue Writs of Mandamus

against the Respondents and therefore, the matter has now become futile.

This is a public interest litigation. The contention of the learned State Counsel

was that the Respondents had renovated the right of way in dispute which

traversed through the Sinharaja Forest without causing any damage to the

forest. These facts are to be substantiated with cogent and adequate

documentary evidence. It appears to this Court that before supporting the

main matter, tendering a comprehensive objection by the Respondents, and

hearing both parties in this regard, this Court is not in a position to come to

a conclusion that the matter is futile. The learned State Counsel has not

addressed the prayer (g) seeking a Writ of Mandamus directing the

Respondents to demarcate the boundaries of the said forest. In those

Page 5 of 5

circumstances, it is the view of this Court that the foregoing preliminary

objection raised by the learned State Counsel is premature.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court does not proceed to answer the

preliminary legal objection raised by the learned State Counsel for the

Respondents at this juncture.

The matter is fixed for support for formal notices.
