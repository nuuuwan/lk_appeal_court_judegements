Introduction

This appeal is filed by the Appellant challenging the judgment delivered by the

learned High Court Judge of Kalutara on 21st November 2019, in Revision

application No. WP/HC/KT/REV/23/2017. In that application the Appellant

sought to overturn the Order of the learned Magistrate of Kalutara, dated 8th

September 2017, in Case No. 59678.

Relevant facts

The Complainant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

"Respondent"), the Assistant Commissioner of Labour, filed a certificate1 in the

Magistrate's Court of Kalutara under Section 38(2) of the Employees Provident

Fund Act No. 15 of 1958, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the "EPF Act"),

along with a schedule2 outlining the details of the alleged default.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the "Appellant")

was named as the defaulter in the said certificate. The learned Magistrate

provided the Appellant an opportunity to show cause in terms of Section 38(2)

of the EPF Act.

Subsequently, the Appellant, by way of motion supported by an affidavit3, raised

a preliminary objection based on the legal principle of double jeopardy (being

prosecuted twice for substantially the same offence). The Appellant submitted to

the Magistrate's Court that the Respondent had initiated proceedings against the

Appellant in 2015 under Case No. 37759, during which a settlement was reached

between the Petitioner and the Respondent. As a result, the payable amount was

reduced to Rs. 163,350.00, which was fully paid by the Petitioner.

In response to the Appellant's contention, the Respondent argued that Case No.

37759 had been instituted to recover Rs. 163,350.00 for the period from August

1 At page 123 of the Appeal brief. 2 At page 124 of the Appeal brief. 3 At pages 126 and 127 of the appeal brief.

CA/PHC/00276/2019

2008 to January 2012. The certificate dated 4th August 20144, along with the

attached schedule5, confirmed this position. The period relevant to Case No.

59678 in the Magistrate's Court, however, covered February 2012 to May 20156.

Accordingly, the learned Magistrate, in an Order dated 8th September 2017,

rejected the Appellant's show cause argument that he had already paid the

amount stated in the certificate. The Magistrate ordered the Appellant to pay Rs.

344,205.00, the amount specified in the certificate filed in Case No. 59678.

Aggrieved by the decision, the Appellant filed Revision Application No.

WP/HC/KT/REV/23/2017 in the High Court of Kalutara, seeking to revise and

set aside the Order made by the learned Magistrate. In the Petition submitted to

the High Court7, aside from the claim of double jeopardy, the Appellant argued

that the certificate filed in the Magistrate's Court under Section 38(2) of the EPF

Act lacked the necessary information and, therefore, did not comply with

applicable law.

The Respondent filed objections to the Appellant's application8, and both parties

subsequently submitted written submissions. After the inquiry, the learned High

Court Judge delivered the Order on 21st November 2019.

The learned High Court Judge addressed the new ground raised by the Appellant

and correctly held that the certificate was in compliance with applicable law. The

Judge further analyzed the relevant facts and the order of the learned Magistrate,

affirming the Magistrate's decision that the certificate filed in Magistrate's Court

Case No. 37759 had no relevance to Magistrate's Court Case No. 59678, the

latter being the subject of the revision application.

CA/PHC/00276/2019

Consequently, both the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge

concluded that the amount paid by the Appellant in Case No. 37759 was

irrelevant to the amount due in the certificate filed in Case No. 59678.

Analysis

Preliminary objection

First and foremost, I will address the preliminary objection raised by the learned

Deputy Solicitor General.

Objection raised on ground of an incorrect section referred to in the

application to this court.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent raised the preliminary

objection in her written submission that the provision referred to in the Petition

of appeal filed by the Appellant is incorrect and therefore, the Petition of appeal

should be dismissed in limine. Specifically, the Appellant referred to Article

154G (6), which is irrelevant to an appeal to this Court. The correct provision

under which an appeal to this Court should be made is Article 154P (6). Despite

this infirmity, the Appellant addressed the Petition to the Court of Appeal and

has sought relief accordingly. It is evident that although the incorrect Article of

the Constitution was mentioned, the appeal is properly directed to the Court of

Appeal. Furthermore, specifying the section under which the appeal is made is

not a statutory requirement. Above all, the omission does not cause any prejudice

to the Respondent. There is always room for human errors even in making

applications to a Court of law. Our judicial system serves as both a court of law

and a court of equity. The Court should bear this in mind and grant relief as

deemed appropriate. Therefore, referencing an incorrect Article in the Petition

of Appeal should not be grounds for rejecting the appeal.

In the case of Jayawardane v. Ranaweera9 (C.A.) this Court observed as follows;

If a person making an application to a court, refers to a wrong section of a

statute in the caption as the provision of law under which such application is

9 [2004]3 Sri L.R. 37, at p. 41.

6

CA/PHC/00276/2019

made, such reference to the wrong provision of law itself will not deprive a court

of its jurisdiction it otherwise has, if the Court has jurisdiction under another

provision of law to deal with the substantive matter raised in the application, the

court has jurisdiction to deal with such matter notwithstanding the reference to

a wrong section in the caption.

In the case of Peiris v. The commissioner of Inland Revenue10, the Assistant

Commissioner, acting under Section 64(2)(b), accepted the return but made an

assessment in terms of Section 64(2)(a). However, the correct procedure should

have been for him to act under Section 65 and make an additional assessment, as

the original assessment was less than the proper amount. The Supreme Court

held that it is well-settled that the exercise of a power will be referable to the

jurisdiction that confers validity upon it, and not to a jurisdiction under which it

would be nugatory. This principle has been applied even in cases where the

Statute quoted as authority confers no power, while another Statute that does

confer the power was in force.

In view of the preceding analysis, I overrule the Respondent's preliminary

objection.

Substantial issues

New ground of appeal raised in the High Court

Regarding the new ground raised for the first time before the High Court,

questioning the validity of the certificate filed under Section 38(2) of the EPF

Act, the learned Deputy Solicitor General, on behalf of the Respondent, argued

that such a challenge is not permissible under the existing laws.

She cited H.W.R. Wade & C.F. Forsyth in Administrative Law11 The court

normally insists that the objection shall be taken as soon as the party prejudiced

knows the facts which entitle him to object. If, after he or his advisers know of

10 65 N.L.R. 457 at p. 458. 11 9th Edn, p. 464.

CA/PHC/00276/2019

the disqualification, they let the proceedings continue without protest, they are

held to have waived their objection and the determination cannot be challenged.

She also submitted to Court that waiver of an objection by the Appellant before

the Magistrates Court estops him from raising it at a later stage.

She cited Law relating to estoppel revised by Gopal S. Chathurvedi12, wherein

it is stated that In order to constitute abandonment or waiver, it must be a

voluntary act on the part of the person possessing the rights. Acquiescence or

standing by when there is a duty to speak or assert a right creates an estoppel.

In such cases knowledge of the act must be brought by the acquiescing party.

Acquiescence does not mean simply an intelligent consent, but may be implied if

a person is content not to oppose irregular acts which he knows are being done.

It was also argued that under Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance, it can be

presumed that evidence which could have been produced but was not would, if

produced, be unfavorable to the party withholding it. Furthermore, relying on

Section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance she submitted that When any fact is

especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is

upon him.

However, I am not inclined to accept these two arguments, as the issue at hand

is not about burden of proof or withholding evidence and presenting it later, but

rather a legal question that was not raised before the Magistrates Court and is

being brought up for the first time in the revision application before the High

Court, and subsequently in this Court.

The new ground the Appellant sought to raise was that the certificate filed by the

Respondent in the Magistrate's Court under Section 38(2) does not include the

particulars required by law.

In the case of City Carriers Limited v. The Attorney General13 the Supreme Court

observed that the certificate which does not contained the required particulars is

12 3rd Edn, p. 166. 13 [1992] 2 Sri L.R. 257, at p.260.

8

CA/PHC/00276/2019

as that no certificate filed under Section 38 (2) of the EPF Act. Further, it was

held that although this question of law was not specifically raised in the lower

court as an issue it could be raised in the higher court.

In this instance, the issue that was not raised before the Magistrate's Court, was

raised in the High Court14. In my view, it is a fundamental question that needs to

be addressed by the Court before proceeding further in view of the observation

made by the Supreme Court in the case of City Carriers Limited v. The Attorney

General15 that the certificate which does not contain the required particulars is

as that no certificate filed under Section 38(2) of the EPF Act. The learned High

Court Judge considered and addressed this issue in the order that is now under

appeal before this Court. I see no reason why this ground should not have been

allowed to be raised in the High Court. The Respondent did not object to the

aforementioned ground on the basis that it was a new ground but, replied to in

the objections16.

Given the reasons outlined, I am in agreement with the learned High Court judge

regarding this issue.

Significant argument

Next, I will consider the main argument raised by the Appellant: that the

certificate filed in the Magistrate's Court does not include the required

particulars. According to Section 38(2), the certificate must contain details of the

sum due and the name and place of residence of the defaulting employer. The

details of the defaulted sum that must be included in a certificate have been

subject to scrutiny by our Supreme Court.

14 Paragraphs 14 and 15 of the Petition filed in the High Court by the Appellant, at pages 4 to 8 of the appeal brief. 15 Supra note 13. 16 Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Objection filed in the High Court by the Respondent, at pages 160 to 165 of the appeal brief.

9

CA/PHC/00276/2019

The particulars required in a certificate, as stated in the case of City Carriers

Limited v. The Attorney General17 (S.C.), include the computation of the sum,

the period during which the sum became due, and details regarding the number

of employees involved in the computation, or their names and emoluments. In

Mohemmed Ameer and Another v. Yapa, Assistant Commissioner of Labour18

(S.C.), the Supreme Court held that the certificate under Section 38(2) must

contain the names of the employees for whom the default is alleged or be

otherwise adequately identified, along with the period during which there have

been changes in remuneration and/or the rate of contribution. Additionally, the

remuneration related to which the contribution and default have been computed

must also be disclosed.

As correctly observed by the learned High Court Judge, the impugned certificate

contains the information required under Section 38(2) of the EPF Act and

adheres to the judicial precedence. The certificate19 includes the membership

numbers and names of the employees in respect of whom the default is alleged,

as well as the period during which the sum became due. It also contains the

remuneration of the employees, the rates of contributions made by both the

employee and the employer, and the total aggregated amount. Additionally, the

surcharge on the total contribution due, and the aggregated amount is clearly

stated in the certificate. The Appellant contended that the necessary information

was submitted to the High Court through the document marked 'Y', but not to the

Magistrate Court. Consequently, it was argued that the application under Section

38(2) is flawed. However, as I have mentioned earlier, the certificate includes

the required information under the law, and the document marked 'Y' only

provides additional information. Moreover, the document 'Y' has been certified

as accurate by the Appellant himself cannot be claimed as information unknown

to him.

17 Supra note 13. 18 [1998]1 Sri L.R. 156. 19 At pages 123 and 124 of the appeal brief.

10

CA/PHC/00276/2019

Therefore, I concur with the learned High Court Judge's conclusion that the

certificate is in conformity with Section 38(2) of the EPF Act.

Revisionary power is an extraordinary authority exercised by a court only in

exceptional circumstances20. As correctly observed by the learned High Court

Judge, there were no exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction in this case.

Conclusion

In light of the above analysis, I find no valid reason to interfere with the judgment

of the learned High Court Judge of Kalutara dated 21st November 2019 and also

the judgement of the learned Magistrate dated 8th September 2017. Therefore, I

dismiss this appeal, subject to costs of Rs. 50,000/-.
