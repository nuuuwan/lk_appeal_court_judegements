Introduction

Jetwing Zinc Journeys Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, the Appellant, is a limited liability

company incorporated in Sri Lanka. The primary business of the Appellant was

to provide services to Royal Heritage Hotels (Pvt) Ltd and Seashells Hotels (Pvt)

Ltd. The Appellant filed its income tax return for the assessment year 2012/2013

with the Inland Revenue Department1 on 26th November, 2013. The Assessor

rejected this return in a letter dated 23rd November, 2015, citing reasons under

Section 163 (3)2 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, as amended

(hereinafter referred as the IR Act). Consequently, the Assessor issued a Notice

of Assessment dated 27th November 20153, which the Appellant allegedly

received around 15th December 20154.

Being aggrieved by the said assessment, the Appellant appealed to the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (hereinafter referred as the CGIR)

on 22nd December 20155, in accordance with Section 165 of the IR Act. The

CGIR acknowledged the appeal by a letter dated 6th January 20166. After hearing

the appeal, the CGIR decided on 21st December 20177, under Section 165 (13)

of the IR Act, upholding the Assessor's assessment. The reasons for this

determination were communicated to the Appellant in a letter dated 27th

December 20178.

The aggrieved Appellant lodged an appeal with the Tax Appeals Commission

(hereinafter referred to as the TAC) against the decision of the CGIR9.

Following the hearing of the appeal, the TAC rendered its decision on 25th

October 2022, upholding the CGIR's decision and dismissing the Appellant's

appeal.

Being aggrieved by the said determination of the TAC, the Appellant moved the

TAC to state a case to this Court on eleven questions of law10 for the opinion of

this Court, in accordance with Section 11A of the Tax Appeals Commission Act.

The eleven questions of law are;

(1) Did the Commission err in law in holding that the Appellant was an

associate company for purpose of Section 59B (1) of the Inland

Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)?

(2) Did the Commission err in law in failing to consider that the Appellant

was a joint venture and therefore did not fall within the definition of an

associate company under Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act No.

10 of 2006 (as amended)?

(3) Did the Commission err in failing and/or neglecting to consider the

Appellants submission that the Appellant company is a joint venture?

(4) Did the Commission err in law in arriving at the conclusion that holding

of 50% shareholding can be considered to be having significant

influence within the definition of associate company under Section

217 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)?

(5) Did the Commission err in law in failing to consider that the Appellants

investing companies had joint control over the Appellant, and thereby

did not exercise significant influence over the Appellant?

(6) Did the Commission err in failing and/or neglecting to consider that by

virtue of the conjunctive and being used by the legislature in the

definition of associate company, any company which is a joint

venture falls outside the definition of an associate company under

Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)?

(7) Did the Commission err in failing and/or neglecting to consider that

taxing statutes such as the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (as

amended) must be strictly interpreted in light of what is clearly express,

without resource to any extraneous material and/or assumption and/or

theories not based on the statute itself?

(8) Did the Commission err in law and/or misdirect itself in misapplying

and/or misconstruing the provisions under Section 59B read with

Section 217 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)?

(9) Did the Commission err in law in arriving at the conclusion that the

Appellant company was not entitled to apply the concessionary rate of

10% on its profits and income under Section 59B read with Section 217

of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)?

5

Appellant and the respondent agreed to adopt the proceedings to far

held before the Commission and that the Appellant made oral

submissions and/or that the appeal was taken up for hearing on 21st

September 2022?

(11) In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, did the Commission

err in law in arriving at the conclusion that it did?

Analysis

Questions of law No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9

The primary legal question at hand centres on whether the Appellant company

qualifies for the concessional income tax rate of 10% as outlined in the Fifth

Schedule of the IR Act, which is provided under Section 59B of the Act.

Section 59B (1) of the IR Act reads as follows;

59B (1). The profits and income of any person (not being the

holding company, a subsidiary company, or an associate company

of a group of companies) for any year of assessment commencing on

or after April 1, 2011, from any undertaking referred to in subsection

(2) shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other

provisions of this Act, but subject to provisions of section 59F be

chargeable with income tax at the appropriate rate specified in the

Fifth Schedule to this Act.

The Appellant company argued that their profits and income derived from an

undertaking stipulated in Section 59B (2) of the IR Act, thus making them

eligible for the concessionary income tax rate specified in Section 59B (1).

However, the TAC, in their impugned determination, upheld the CGIR's

determination, holding that the Appellant company is an associate company in

6

CA No. CA/TAX/0001/2023 TAC/IT/022/2018

terms of Section 217 of the IR Act, and consequently, ineligible for the

concessional tax rate.

As previously mentioned in this judgment, the Assessor categorized the

Appellant company as an associate company. However, the Appellant company

contested this classification, asserting that it operates as a joint venture and thus

should not be considered an associate company. It is important to note that the

Appellant did not claim that the company functions as a holding company or a

subsidiary within a group of companies.

Therefore, the determination of whether the Appellant is a holding company or

a subsidiary is not relevant to the questions of law that this Court is tasked with

resolving.

Associate company

According to Section 217, the interpretation Section of the IR Act, an associate

company means, a company over which an investing company has a significant

influence and which is neither a subsidiary of the investing company nor a joint

venture of which the investing company is a partner. (Emphasis added)

It is noteworthy to highlight that while the TAC acknowledged the necessity of

significant influence for a company to be categorized as an 'associate company',

it overlooked the second requirement crucial for such classification. This

requirement mandates that the company should neither be a subsidiary of the

investing entity nor a partner in a joint venture with the investing company.

The Respondent argues that the Appellant is deemed an associate company of

the investing companies. It was further contended that these investing companies

exercise significant influence over the Appellant but do not hold subsidiary status

nor partake in a joint venture. The Respondent asserted that among the five

Directors of the Appellant, two are appointed by Jewing Hotels Management

Services (Private) Limited, which undoubtedly grants Jewing Hotels

Management Services (Private) Limited the ability to 'participate' in the policy-

making process, thus exerting significant influence, yet falls short of control or

7

CA No. CA/TAX/0001/2023 TAC/IT/022/2018

joint control. However, it is worth noting that, according to the joint venture

agreement11, Innovation INC, the other investing company, also appoints two

directors, and both investing companies jointly nominate the fifth director. I will

examine the implications of this aspect in the subsequent sections of this

judgment.

It was further submitted that Jewing Hotels Management Services (Private)

Limited holds 50% of the total shareholding in the Appellant company. The

Respondent compared this shareholding with the 98% shares held by the

investing company in another company named Jetwing Hotels, arguing that the

50% shareholding demonstrates significant influence without having control or

joint control. The TAC also determined that holding 50% shareholding can be

considered as to have significant influence.12. However, controlling interest is

not a strict and automatic consequence of shareholding. A variety of mechanism

that are available to companies for exercising effective control. Control can be

exercise by legal forms or influence through the wide range of resources13.

Significant influence

While the term "significant influence" is used in Section 217 of the IR Act, it

remains undefined within the Act. However, it cannot be subject to arbitrary,

capricious, and self-serving interpretations, as these terms are not susceptible to

pure literal interpretation. Therefore, it warrants a logical interpretation with the

assistance of external aids. N. S. Bindra, in his treatise 'Interpretation of Statutes,'

provides guidance on obtaining external aid in interpreting fiscal statutes.

N. S. Bindras in his treatise Interpretation of Statutes states the following

regarding obtaining external aid in interpreting fiscal statutes;

The principle that fiscal statutes should be strictly construed does not rule out

the application of the principles of reasonable construction to give effect to the

11 At pp. 13-68 and 205-260 of the appeal brief. 12 At page 10 of the TAC determination/page 15 of the appeal brief. 13 Wolfgang Friademan, Joint International Business Ventures in Developing, Columbia University Press, New York (1971).

8

CA No. CA/TAX/0001/2023 TAC/IT/022/2018

purposes or intention of any particular provision as apparent from the scheme

of the Act, with the assistance of such external aids as are permissible under the

law.

We must also, of course, have regard to the subject-matter with which the

Legislature is dealing and the first thing to be done is, having regard to that

subject-matter, to find out what the Legislature has said as a matter of English,

that is, to discover the grammatical construction of the words used, of course

giving to words of art their technical meaning.14

N.S. Bindra further states15,

The technical words and phrases of the law presumed to have been used in their

proper technical signification when used in statutes, unless it plainly appears

that a different meaning was intended by the legislature similarly terms of

art should be understood according to their usage in the art to which they

belong.

the general rule with respect to terms used in trade or commerce, is that in the

absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent, words of commerce or

trade, when used in a statute relating to those subjects, are presumed to have

been used by the legislature in their trade or commercial meaning () words

and expressions in a sales tax should be construed as understood in the trade by

the dealer and the consumer

(Emphasis added)

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant cited from the case of United Offset Process Pvt Ltd v. Asst Collector of Customs, Bombay and others16

There is no specific technical definition as such provided in the Customs Tariff

Act or in the notification. If there is no meaning attributed to the expressions

used in the particular enacted statute then the items in the customs entries

CA No. CA/TAX/0001/2023 TAC/IT/022/2018

should be judged and analysed on the basis of how these expressions are used

in the trade or industry or in the market or in other words, how these are dealt

with by the people who deal in them

(Emphasis added)

In the case of Ramavatar Budhaiprasad ETC v. The Assistant Sales Tax Officer

Akola and another LNIND17 cited on behalf of the Appellant it was observed

that;

Reliance was placed on the dictionary meaning of the word vegetable as given

in Shorter Oxford Dictionary where the word is defined as of or pertaining to,

comprised or consisting of, or derived, or obtained from plants or their parts.

But this word must be construed not in any technical sense nor from the botanical

point of view but as understood in common parlance. It has not been defined in

the Act and being a word of everyday use, it must be construed in its popular

sense meaning that sense which people conversant with the subject-matter

with which the statute is dealing would attribute to it.

(Emphasis added)

Although the IR Act does not provide a definition for the term "significant

influence," such a definition can be found in the Sri Lanka Accounting

Standards18. The TAC also relied on this definition. According to LKAS 31 Sri

Lanka Accounting Standards, "significant influence" is defined as is the power

to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of an economic

activity but is not control or joint control over those policies

Accordingly, for an investing company to have significant influence over another

company, the investing company shall,

i. Have the power to participate in the financial and operating policy

decisions of the other company; and,

17 [1961] SC 107. 18 Annexed to the Written submission of the Appellant marked WS1.

10

CA No. CA/TAX/0001/2023 TAC/IT/022/2018

ii. Shall not be in control or joint control over financial and operating policy

decisions.

Therefore, in accordance with LKAS 31 of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards,

an investing company that exercises control or joint control over the financial

and operational policy decisions cannot be regarded as having significant

influence over a company19.

Furthermore, it is evident that possessing significant influence entails a position

below having outright control or joint control over operational policy decisions,

but it still involves the ability to participate in such decisions.

Control/Joint control

LKAS 31 of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards defines control and joint

control as follows;

Control Is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an

economic activity so as to obtain benefits from it.

Joint control The contractually agreed sharing of control over an economic

activity, and exists only when the strategic financial and operating decisions

relating to the activity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing

control (the ventures).

The Appellant cited the following extracts from the joint venture agreement20

and Articles of Association21 , arguing that the Appellant companys financial

and operating policy decisions are jointly controlled by the two investing

companies. Therefore, the Appellant company cannot be considered as a

company over which either of the two investing companies has significant

influence.

The provisions cited by the Appellant are;

1) No business shall be transacted at any general meeting of shareholders

unless a quorum consisting of two authorized representatives

representing each investing company shall be present22;

2) The Appellant company shall be managed by a board of directors

consisting five directors. Each investing company is entitled to appoint

two directors each and the 5th director shall be nominated by both

investing companies jointly who shall be the chairperson and shall

not have a casting vote23;

3) The investing companies by giving a written notice jointly signed by them

may remove the jointly nominated director24;

4) Any resolution on, inter alia, the following,

i. carrying on of any business other than the main object for which

the Appellant company was established,

ii. approval and/or amendment of the annual finance budget and all

vi. the approval of transfer of shares,

vii. the creation of any Bank Guarantees or any other form of

12

CA No. CA/TAX/0001/2023 TAC/IT/022/2018

shall be deemed to be passed only if the votes case in favour consists of

at least one nominee director representing each investing company25.

Upon careful consideration of the above extracts from the Articles of

Association26 and joint venture agreement27 reproduced by the Appellant, I

observe that the two investing companies have contractually agreed to share

control over the economic activities of the Appellant company. The unanimous

consent of the two investing companies, each holding equal shares, is required

for the implementation of the economic activities. Consequently, the power to

govern the financial and operating policies of the economic activity rests with

the two investing companies.

Significant influence or joint control

In light of the analysis provided above in this judgment, I conclude that the role

of the two investing companies is not merely one of participation exercising

influence, but rather one of joint control over the Appellant company.

Joint venture

In light of Section 217 of the IR Act and Sri Lanka Accounting Standards LKAS

31, if the investing companies exercise only significant influence over the

company by participating in the financial and operating policy decisions of the

company's economic activities, but do not have control or joint control, then the

latter is considered an associate company. In the case at hand, the Appellant

asserts that it is a joint venture.

The general definition of a joint venture is that Business entity created by two or

more firms through an agreement that typically includes shared governance,

resources, profits, losses and expenses for a particular project. It is a strategic

partnership where two or more companies develop a new entity in order to

collaborate on a specific project or venture. This agreement allows each

25 Vide Article 27(4) of the Articles of Association of the Appellant company, at p. 168-199 of the appeal brief and Clause 2.1.11 of the Joint Venture Agreement, at. pp. 13-68 and 205-260. 26 Supra note 21. 27 Supra note 11.

13

CA No. CA/TAX/0001/2023 TAC/IT/022/2018

company to pool their resources expertise and capital to achieve of a common

objective and share the risk and rewards.

As previously mentioned in this judgment, for a company to meet the definition

of an associate company under Section 217 of the IR Act, two requirements must

be fulfilled: the investing company must have significant influence, and the

company must not be a subsidiary or a joint venture of the investing companies.

In the instant case, the Appellant does not claim to be a subsidiary of the

investing companies but asserts that it is a joint venture in which the investing

companies are partners. The term "joint venture" is also defined in LKAS 31 of

the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards, which reads as follows:

A contractual arrangement whereby two or parties undertake and economic

activity that is subject to joint control

Blacks Law Dictionary28 defines a term joint venture as follows;

A business undertaking by two or more persons engaged in a single defined

project. The necessary elements are (1) an express or implied agreement; (2) a

common purpose that the group intends to carry out; (3) share profits and losses;

and (4) each members equal voice in controlling the project.

The Oxfords Advanced Learners Dictionary29 defines joint venture as follows;

A business project or activity that is begun by two or more companies, etc.,

which remain separate organizations.

A corporate joint venture is established when two or more entities form a

corporation. The partners become shareholders in the joint venture incorporated.

The Appellant cited the judgment in the case of the Northen Irland Court of

Appeal Sweeney v. Lagan Development limited and others30 wherein it was

observed that joint ventures may take the form of a partnership, contractual

alliance or a corporate joint venture.

14

CA No. CA/TAX/0001/2023 TAC/IT/022/2018

The Appellant also cited the following extract from the judgement of Girvan L.J.

in the above case,

As Hewitts Joint Venture 3rd Ed at para 1.11 makes clear it refers to a range

of collaborative business arrangements, the fundamental characteristic of a joint

venture being collaboration between the participants involving a significant

degree of integration between the joint venturers. The key element to be

considered and agreed by the joint venturers is the degree and nature of that

collaboration. Joint ventures may take the form of a contractual alliance, a

partnership or a corporate joint venture () There are clear legal differences

between running a joint venture as a company and running it as a loose

contractual alliance. These include the management framework, the decision-

making arrangements, the funding arrangements and the financial powers of the

entity (a company, for example, having powers to raise money by way of floating

charges). Clearly there will be different exist strategies and issued relating to the

division of profits. (Emphasis added)

There are two known types of joint ventures. One is agreeing to co-operate with

another business in a limited and specific way. The two partners could agree to

a contract setting out the terms and conditions how the business would work.

Alternatively, a separate joint venture business, like in this instance, could be set

up. The above options are alternatives to having a formal business partnership or

merge the two businesses. In this instance, it is a newly incorporated company

designated to manage a specific business endeavor. Each partner owns shares in

the company and agreed how the company should be managed by entering into

a joint venture agreement.

The Appellant, citing the Articles of Association31 of the Appellant company and

the joint venture agreement32 dated 2nd January 2010, submitted that the total

shareholding of the Appellant company is equally divided between the two

investing companies. It was also submitted that Clause 1.5 of the joint venture

31 Supra note 21. 32 Supra note 11.

15

CA No. CA/TAX/0001/2023 TAC/IT/022/2018

agreement clearly stipulates that both investing companies shall, unequivocally

and for all purposes, be considered entitled to equal rights in respect of the

Appellant company.

The Appellant submitted that it is a corporate joint venture set up by and between

Jetwing Hotels Management Services (Private) Limited and Cinnovation INC,

the two investing companies. The Appellant company is not a party to the joint

venture agreement. Consequently, the Respondent argued that the Appellant is

not a joint venture where the Appellant and the investing companies are

partners33. However, Clause 1.6 of the joint venture agreement provides that

immediately upon the incorporation of the joint venture company, the Appellant,

the parties shall cause the joint venture company to accept and adopt the

agreement and become bound by the same thereby adding the Appellant into the

joint venture.

Based on the analysis provided above in this judgment, I conclude that the

Appellant Company is not an associate company but rather a joint venture.

Consequently, questions of law Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 are answered

affirmatively in favour of the Appellant.

Questions of law No. 7

In contrast to the arguments presented by the Appellant regarding previous

questions of law No. 1 to 6, 8, and 9, the Appellant contends for question of law

No. 7 that taxing statutes must be strictly interpreted based on their explicit

language, without recourse to any extraneous material or assumption and

theories not based on the statute itself34.

The Appellant cited Vallibel Lanka Pvt Ltd v. Director general of Customs and

others35

33 Page 4 of the Respondents 1st Written submission. 34 At paragraph 46 of the appeal brief 35 [2008] 1 SLR 219.

16

CA No. CA/TAX/0001/2023 TAC/IT/022/2018

It is the established rule in the interpretation of statutes levying taxes and duties,

not to extend the provisions of the statute by implication, beyond the clear

import of the language used or to enlarge their operation in order to embrace

matters not specifically pointed out. In case of doubt, the provisions are

construed most strongly against the state and in favour of the citizen. (emphasis

added)

It was also cited from the case of The Cape Brandy Syndicate v. The

Commissioners of Inland Revenue36,which reads as follows;

In taxation you have to look simply at what is clearly said. There is no room for

any intendment; there is no equity about a tax: there is no presumption as to a

tax; you read nothing in; you imply nothing, but you look fairly at what is said

and at what is said clearly and that is the tax. (Emphasis added)

Further, cited the case of Charles James Partington Plaintiff In Error; and The

Attorney-General Defendant In Error37, wherein it is stated as follows;

If the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter or the law he must be

taxed, however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the

other hand, if the Crown, seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject

within the letter of the law, the subject is free, however, apparently within the

spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be. In other words, if there

be admissible, in any statute, what is called an equitable construction, certainly

such a construction is not admissible in a taxing statute, where you can simply

adhere to the words of the statute.

(Emphasis added)

Consequently, the Appellant sought to have question of law No. 7 answered in

their Favour. In its determination, the TAC relied on the Sri Lanka Accounting

Standards LKAS 31 to interpret the term significant influence as it is used in

the definition of associate company in Section 217 of the IR Act.

36 12 TC 358. 37 [1869] L.R. 4 H.L. 100.

17

CA No. CA/TAX/0001/2023 TAC/IT/022/2018

The Appellant relied on the same accounting standards as the TAC to interpret

the term 'significant influence,' but formulated the seventh question of law to

argue against using extraneous material to interpret the IR Act, which should be

strictly construed. In my opinion, the Appellant should not be allowed to

approbate and reprobate; to blow hot and cold.

Consequently, I answer the seventh questions as follows; The TAC did not err

in interpreting the IR Act with external aid; the Sri Lanka Accounting Standards

LKAS 31

Question of law No. 10

The Appellant base the above question on the following observation made by the

TAC in its determination. Hence, the appeal was taken for further hearing on

21.09.2022 with Mr. S. W. Wickramarachchi, Mr. B. J. Jayaratne in the

membership. Appellant and Respondent agreed to adopt the proceedings so far

held and made certain oral submissions before the new panel.

The Appellant contends that when the appeal was taken up for further hearing

on 21st September 2022, the Appellant's Attorney informed the TAC that the date

was inconvenient for their Counsel and requested a new hearing date before a

new panel. Consequently, the Appellant did not make any oral submissions, and

the appeal was not heard on 21st September 2022, but was adjourned to a later

date. Upon receiving the TAC's determination, the Appellant's Attorney

submitted a letter dated 4th November 2022, to the TAC, requesting the

proceedings from the hearing on 21st September 2022, as well as from two other

dates. The Appellant claims that in response, they were verbally informed that

the TAC does not maintain records of any hearings.

Consequently, other than the bare statement of the Appellant and the

aforementioned statement in the determination of TAC, which are contradictory

to each other, there is no other material before this Court to arrive at a conclusion

on question of law No. 10.

Therefore, I answer the question of law No. 10 as not substantiated.

CA No. CA/TAX/0001/2023 TAC/IT/022/2018

As submitted by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant, whether the

Appellant's income in question was from any undertaking referred to in

Subsection (2) of Section 59B of the IR Act was not an issue at the TAC or before

the CGIR. At the argument, the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

Respondent submitted that, although the return was not rejected on the ground,

it should not be construed as an admission by the Respondent that the income in

question is from an undertaking referred to in that subsection. Consequently, the

learned Presidents Counsel for the Respondent addressed this matter in his final

written submission.

It is important to note that no question of law was stated to this Court on the

question as to whether the Appellants income in issue was from an undertaking

referred to above or not. Nevertheless, Section 11A (6) of the TAC Act No. 23

of 2011, (as amended), provides that any two or more judges of the Court of

Appeal may hear and determine any question of law arising on the stated case,

(Emphasis added)

In the case of The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue v. Dr. S.S.L.

Perera38 His Lordship Janak De Silva J., sitting in the Court of Appeal (as His

Lordship was then) having considered an application to submit additional

questions of law to the Court of Appeal observed that it is open for this Court

to consider questions of law other than what is set out in the case stated.

However, I wish to state that such a course of action is permissible only if the

answers to the new questions of law may result in the confirmation, reduction,

increasing or annulling the assessment determined by the Commission, or

requires the remitting of the case to the TAC with the opinion of the Court.

Questions of law which are purely of academic interest cannot be raised.

In The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue v. Janashakthi General

Insurance Col. Ltd39 His Lordship Janak De Silva J., made a similar observation.

Illukkumbura Industrial Automation (Private) Limited v. Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue40 is a case where His Lordship A.H.M.D. Nawaz J., (P/CA)

sitting in the Court of Appeal (as His Lordship was then) dealt with the question

of law sought to be raised in the Court of Appeal and held that additional

question of law that surfaces to the fore and alleged failure to comply with a

statutory requirement of the Inland revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 must be permitted

to be raised, as this question of law impacts or impinges on the assessment made

in this case.

Although the learned Deputy Solicitor General simply stated in his written

submission that he does not concede that the Appellant is an undertaking, and

made the above statement during oral submissions, he did not raise a new

question of law nor did he seek permission from the Court to do so.

Hence, I am of the view that this Court need not labour on the aforementioned

matter.

However, for completeness, I will proceed to consider the submissions made by

the learned Presidents Counsel in that regard.

In the case of V. A. Muttiah v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue41

presided over by His Lordship Ruwan Fernando J., with whom I concurred, held

that The term undertaking has to be understood as an economically

independent and self-sustaining entity taken as a whole and in the context in

which it occurs.

() and profits and income earned by an individual or company as one

economically independent and self-sustaining invisible entity, as long as such

individual or company in the nature of an undertaking carried on business or

trading activities as a whole, from which profits and income arise for the purpose

and activity referred

As previously observed in this judgment, the Appellant company is a self-

sustaining separate entity, established as a corporate joint venture in which two

investing companies hold equal shares. It has been incorporated according to the

terms outlined in the joint venture agreement. As per the Articles of Association

of the Appellant company42, its purposes include the operation of resorts, hotels,

guest houses, and related infrastructure to provide comfort, relaxation, leisure,

and entertainment for vacationers, tourists, and travellers. Specifically, it

manages hotels named Jetwing Viluyana and Jetwing Seashells. Therefore, the

learned Presidents Counsel argued that the Appellant is economically

independent and self-sustaining.

Upon considering the contents of the joint venture agreement and the Articles of

Association, I am inclined to accept the submission of the learned Presidents

Counsel, that the Appellant is an undertaking in terms of Section 59B (1) of the

IR Act.
