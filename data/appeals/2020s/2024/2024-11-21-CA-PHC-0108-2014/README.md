Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the 2nd party-petitioner-appellant-appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the appellant) on the basis of being aggrieved of the

order dated 01-08-2014 by the learned Provincial High Court Judge of the

Central Province holden in Kandy.

From the impugned order, the learned High Court Judge has refused to issue

notice of the revision application filed before the Provincial High Court by the

appellant.

The matter relating to the above-mentioned order was a matter arising out of

an application made to the Magistrates Court of Hatton by the Officer-in-

Charge of Hatton Police Station in terms of the Primary Courts Procedure Act

(hereinafter referred to as the Act).

Although facts had been reported in terms of section 66(1) of the Act, it is clear

from the certified copy of the Magistrates Court case record, in fact, the

dispute between the parties had been over a blocking of a right of way enjoyed

by the 1st party named in the application before the Magistrates Court by the

2nd party named therein. The appellant is one of the persons mentioned as the

2nd party in the application.

It is clear from the order pronounced by the learned Magistrate of Hatton on

05-02-2002 in his capacity as the Primary Court Judge of Hatton, that the

learned Magistrate has correctly considered the facts placed before him in

terms of section 69 of the Act. It has been determined that the 2nd party

mentioned in the information filed before the Primary Court had illegally

blocked the right of way used by the 1st party by erecting a fence on the center

line of the six feet wide access used by them. Accordingly, it has been ordered

that the said disruption shall be removed. It has been also directed that the

order shall be in effect until and unless changed by a competent Court.

When the appellant sought to challenge the order of the learned Primary Court

Judge before the Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy

by way of a revision application, the learned High Court Judge, after having

considered the facts and the circumstances has refused to issue notice in that

regard, and had dismissed the same by his order dated 26-02-2002.

The appellant has challenged the said refusal by way of an appeal to the Court

of Appeal, where the Court of Appeal by the judgment dated 06-11-2013 had

set aside the order of the learned Provincial High Court Judge, and has

directed that the learned High Court Judge should consider whether there are

exceptional circumstances to allow the application after issuing notice to the

parties and should enter a judgment.

When the matter was referred back to the Provincial High Court of the Central

Province holden in Kandy, the learned presiding High Court Judge by his order

dated 01-08-2014 has determined that there is no purpose in issuing notice on

an order made in terms of section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act, 12

years after the impugned order, and has refused to issue notice of the revision

application.

It is against that order; the appellant has preferred the instant appeal to this

Court.

At the hearing of this appeal, this Court heard the submissions of the learned

Counsel for the appellant as well as the submissions of the learned Counsel

who represented the 1st party respondent-respondent in this regard.

Although we find that the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High

Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy may be wrong when he refused

to issue notice on the basis that 12 years had lapsed from the Primary Court

Page 9 of 10

order, hence, no purpose would be served even if notice is to be issued, this

Court is unable to agree that decision alone should provide a basis for the

appellant to succeed in this application.

It is the view of this Court that the impugned order by the learned Magistrate of

Hatton, which was temporary in nature, is a fact that needs to be considered

together with the relevant facts and circumstances in deciding whether the

appellant has provided to this Court, a basis to interfere with the order by the

learned Magistrate of Hatton. It becomes so since, whatever the order that the

learned High Court Judge may have given, ultimately it is the order made by

the learned Magistrate of Hatton, which would be the order that needs to be

considered.

It is amply clear from the information provided to the Magistrates Court of

Hatton in terms of the Primary Court Procedure Act that a clear dispute has

arisen which may cause disturbance of peace as a result of the appellant

erecting concrete polls on the center line of the access road used by the other

party mentioned in the application filed by the police.

The learned Magistrate of Hatton has well considered all the facts and the

circumstances that led to the dispute, and after being satisfied that this

dispute has arisen due to the reasons as stated above, has directed that the

disturbances caused to the right of way should be removed. It has been

specifically stated that the order should be kept effective until and unless

changed by an order from a competent Court.

It is the view of this Court that it is up to the appellant to go before a

competent Court of First Instance that has the jurisdiction to go into the rights

of the parties and get the dispute resolved.

For the reasons as considered above, this Court finds no reason to interfere

with the order of the learned Primary Court Judge as well as the Learned High

Court Judge.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the

Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy and to the

Magistrates Court of Hatton for information and necessary action.
