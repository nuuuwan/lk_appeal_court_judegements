However, the CEB, instead of adhering to the said clause, secretly introduced the impugned SORP (P4) which amounts to a violation of the Collective Agreement by the CEB. The Industrial Disputes Act provides a mechanism by which issues pertaining to a Collective Agreement could be resolved. It is borne out from the affidavit tendered by the Petitioners that they have already invoked the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Labour in this regard and several discussions have been held by the Commissioner with the CEB and the Petitioners. In fact, the matter is pending before the Commissioner of Labour. In this scenario, I am of the view that since the Petitioners have already invoked the alternative remedy provided in law and the same is pending, before the final determination of the Commissioner of Labour, the Petitioners are not entitled to invoke the Writ jurisdiction of this Court. As such, the instant Application is liable to be dismissed on this ground alone.",
