Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The first and the second accused-appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the 1st appellant or 2nd appellant) were indicted before the High Court of

Chilaw for causing the death of one Herath Jayasinghe Mudalige Anuruddika

Jayasinghe alias Bandara on 23-03-2022 at a place called Iddamalgama within

the Jurisdiction of the High Court of Chilaw and thereby committing an offence

punishable in terms of section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw of his

judgment, dated 25-06-2015 found the appellants guilty as charged and they

were sentenced to death accordingly.

Page 4 of 16

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellants have

preferred these appeals.

Before considering the grounds of appeal in detail, I would now proceed to briefly

consider the evidence placed before the trial Court.

The Evidence in Brief

At the trial, PW-02 and PW-16 has given evidence as eyewitnesses to the

incident.

According to the evidence of PW-02, he and another friend called Asoka, has

attended a village fair held in Meda Nattandiya area on 23-03-2022. While on

their way to the fair, around 10.30-11 in the night, he has seen the incident

relevant to this case, which occurred near the junction situated before one could

reach the fair ground. The junction had been well lit at that time. The witness

has seen the 1st appellant Pradeep and the 2nd appellant Saman, both of whom

were well known to him, attacking the deceased person. He had been about 15

meters away from them at that time. The deceased person was unknown to him.

He has seen the 2nd appellant stabbing the deceased twice using a knife, towards

the left-hand side of his body. He has seen the 1st appellant near the fence having

in his hand, a knife and a club. The distance between the 1st and the 2nd

appellant was about 5 feet. Once stabbed, the deceased had fallen and the two

appellants had gone towards opposite directions. Before they left, they have told

the witness not to divulge them ( ).

The witness and his friend had thereafter gone towards the fair and informed

one Janaka about the incident. The said Janaka has gone and identified the

deceased as one of his friends, and has taken steps to admit him to the hospital.

The witness has stated that he gave a statement about the incident to the

Marawila police on the same night, but informed that he did not see the incident.

Explaining the reasons as to why he made such a statement, the witness has

stated that he was scared and the appellants were not arrested by that time and

Page 5 of 16

he feared that some harm will happen to him if he told the truth. He has stated

further that after 2-3 days of making the 1st statement he made a 2nd statement

to the police and stated what really happened and what he saw, because his

fellow villages informed him that if he saw something to inform the police about

that.

Under cross-examination the witness has maintained the position that what he

told to the police in his 1st statement was false and it was in the 2nd statement

he divulged the truth. It had been his position that it was the 2nd appellant that

told him not to divulge their identity. He has stated that he is not giving evidence

under the influence of anyone, but because he actually saw what happened.

The other eyewitness namely PW-16, is a housewife who was living in a 10 perch

land adjacent to the junction where this incident occurred. On the day of the

incident, her husband has been out of the house as he has gone to attend the

fair. The fair had been on a playground situated about 5 houses away from her

house. Around 10.30 in the night she had heard a commotion near the cashew

tree situated by the side of the road in front of her land. She has come out of the

house and had seen three persons grappling against each other. After seeing

that, she has come near the fence of her land and had seen two persons holding

the 3rd person. She has seen the person whom she knew as Saman, namely the

2nd appellant, stabbing the person held by the 1st appellant namely Pradeep. She

has stated that there is a 3-way junction and also a 4-way junction in front of

her house and both junctions had street lights, therefore, she could see what

was happening in front of her.

She has stated that after the stabbing, the 2nd appellant punched the person

who was stabbed and as a result the injured person fell onto the nearby ditch.

After the attack, the two appellants have left leaving the deceased on the ground.

She has seen a person named Rexsy meaning PW-02, and another person also

observing the incident, and had seen Rexsy going towards the fair after the

incident. Thereafter, she had seen some persons coming and taking the injured

Page 6 of 16

person in a three-wheeler. Later, she has come to know that the injured person

had died.

She too has stated in her evidence that she did not inform the police that she

saw the incident initially, through fear. However, she has stated that after some

days, she went and informed about what she saw to the police. In her evidence

she has been categorical that it was the two appellants who attacked the

deceased and has stated that she is only speaking about what she saw and not

giving evidence having been influenced by others.

It is relevant to note that PW-02 has given evidence five years after the incident

while, PW-16 has given evidence some two years thereafter.

The other witness of relevance was PW-21, who is also well known to the

appellants, and a fellow villager. He too had attended the mentioned village fair

held on the day of the incident. He is a person who knew the deceased as well.

The deceased was a person from the neighbouring village and PW-21 had seen

the deceased Bandara also attending the fair.

According to his evidence, several persons who attended the fair had consumed

liquor at the playground and there had been a rumor that the deceased Bandara

was involved in a brawl occurred at the Nattandiya Church some days prior to

this incident. The witness has stated that while they were there, he inquired from

the 1st appellant whether the deceased Bandara was the one who was involved

in the previous brawl. He has later seen Bandara as well as the two appellants

leaving the fair. While in the fair, he has come to know about the incident of

stabbing, and had seen the deceased fallen near the junction.

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted the postmortem has observed

four stab wounds on the body of the deceased and has opined that the 1st stab

injury which has damaged the heart of the deceased has caused this death.

When the appellants were called upon for a defence, both the appellants had

chosen to give evidence under oath.

Page 7 of 16

It had been the position of the 1st accused appellant that on the day of the

incident, there was a party which he attended along with some other friends and

he consumed liquor at the party, returned home around 11.00 p.m. and slept.

He has stated that while he was at home, some persons came near his house

and shouted which frightened him and as a result he ran away from the house

and went to Puttalam area. Since he came to know that he is a suspect in a

murder case, he surrendered to police after two months, had been his position.

He has claimed that somebody had set him up for this murder.

The 2nd accused appellants evidence had been that, on the day of the incident

there was a fair in his village and he attended it, with several other friends

including the 1st accused appellant, and returned home around 11.30-12.00 in

the night. He has claimed that he did not know the deceased person and had no

animosity with him, but several persons came and accused him of the crime

and later assaulted and handed him over to the police. He has denied that he

was instrumental of the death.

On behalf of the 2nd accused-appellant, a person named Janaka Sujeewa has

given evidence. It had been his position that he knew the deceased Bandara. On

the day of the incident when he was returning from the fair held in his village,

Rexsy, Asoka and another person have come and informed him that a person

had been stabbed. This information had been provided around 11.00 and 12.00

in the night. When he went to the place of the incident, he has seen the person

who was stabbed and has recognized him as Bandara, and it was he who has

taken steps to admit him to the hospital.

It had been his position that, when he was informed by Rexsy or Asoka about

the stabbing, they did not tell him as to whether they actually saw the stabbing

but only informed that they saw a person fallen after being stabbed.

This shows that the purpose of calling this witness on the behalf of the appellants

had been to show that eyewitness PW-02 or the other person who was with him

Page 8 of 16

at that time did not inform that they saw the incident, to the first person whom

they met.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the 1st appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal.

1. The evidence of the two eyewitnesses is contradictory to each other.

2. The contradiction in relation to the other witnesses, especially the

medical evidence, has not been considered by the learned High Court

Judge.

3. The learned High Court Judge has not considered the possibility of a

sudden fight.

The learned Counsel for the 2nd appellant relied on the grounds of appeal urged

by him, in his written submissions.

The said grounds of appeal are as follows,

A. Has the learned Trail Judge failed to evaluate correctly the inter se

contradictions between PW-02 and PW-16 which goes to the root of the

matter?

B. Has the learned Trial Judge erred in accepting both versions of PW-02

and PW-16 as both testimonies are incompatible with the medical

evidence.

C. Has the learned Trial Judge failed to consider that PW-02 categorically,

in couple of occasions, that it is true in admitting that he did not

observe both accused Pradeep and Saman at the scene of the incident

under the statement dated 24-03-2002

D. Has the learned Trial Judge failed to properly analyze the

improbabilities f PW-02 evidence.

E. Has the learned Trial Judge failed to consider the omissions arisen out

from PW-02s testimony.

Page 9 of 16

F. Has the learned Trial Judge failed to consider per se contraindications

of PW-02

G. Has the learned trial judge failed to consider the evidence of defence

witnesss No.2 Dhadallage Janaka Sujeewa, for the 2nd accused.

H. Has the learned Trial Judge failed to analyze the contradictions arisen

out from the testimony of PW-16?

I. Has the learned Trial Judge failed to identify that a different type of an

attack (which has been gone uninvestigated) had been committed

beyond the described version of PW-02 and PW-16.

J. Has the learned Trial Judge made an error by accepting the reasons of

the delay of making statements to the police with the light of these

improbabilities and contradiction etc.

K. Has the learned Trial Judge failed analyze properly the improbabilities

arisen out of prosecution witness No.16s evidence.

L. Has the learned Trial Judge failed to recognize that, one Asoka being

not called during the investigations and it creates a doubt under section

114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance.

M. Are there inferences been created which would have been considered in

favor of the defence.

Consideration of the grounds of appeal

Although the learned Counsel for the 2nd accused-appellant formulated 13

grounds of appeal, I will now proceed to consider the grounds of appeal

formulated by both Counsel together, since they are similar in nature and

interrelated.

As it was argued that there were contradictions inter se and per se of the evidence

of PW-02 and that of PW-16, who are the eyewitnesses to the incident, I will now

consider whether such a contention can be accepted and whether the learned

High Court Judge was misdirected when it was decided to rely on the said

evidence to connect the appellants to the crime.

Page 10 of 16

At the very outset, it must be stated that the contradictions or omissions in

evidence of a witness have to be material contradiction and omissions that affects

the core of the case, which creates a reasonable doubt as to the evidence of such

witnesses.

Shiranee Thilakawardena J in the case of The Attorney General Vs Potta

Naufar and Others (Ambepitiya Murder Case) (2007) 2 SLR 144 observed that;

when faced with contradictions in a testimonial of a witness, the Court

must bear in mind the nature and the significance of the contradiction.

the Court must come to a determination regarding whether these

contradictions were an honest mistake on the part of the witness or whether

it was a deliberate attempt to mislead Court.

In the case of Mahathun and Others Vs. The Attorney General (2015) 1 SLR

74 it was held:

(1) When faced with contradictions in a witness testimonial, the Court

must bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions,

viewed in light of the whole of the evidence given by the witness.

(2) Too great a significance cannot be attached to minor discrepancies, or

contradictions.

(3) What is important is whether the witness is telling the truth on the

material matters concerned with the event.

(4) Where evidence is generally reliable much importance should not be

attached to the minor discrepancies and technical errors.

(5) The Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial judge

with regard to the acceptance or rejection of testimony of a witness

unless it is manifestly wrong.

Page 11 of 16

In the case of The Attorney General Vs. Sanadnam Pitchi Theresa (2011) 2

SLR 292 at page 303, Shirani Tilakawardane,J. stated:

that whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily

affect the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established

that the Court must exercise its judgment on the nature and tenor of the

inconsistency or contradiction and whether they are material to the facts in

issue. Discrepancies, which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the

basic version of the witness, cannot be given too much importance. (Vide-

Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai Vs. State of Gujarat, AIR (1983) SC

753)

In the case of State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Anthony 1985 AIR SC 48, the danger

of disbelieving an otherwise truthful witness on account of a trifling

contradictions have been spotlighted. It has been stated that;

The witness should not be disbelieved on account of trivial discrepancies,

especially where it is established that there is a substantial reproduction in

the testimony of the witness in relation to his evidence before the Magistrate

or in the session court and that minor variation in language used by witness

should not justify the total rejection of his evidence.

In the case of State of U.P. Vs. M. K. Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48, it was held:

While appreciating the evidence of a witness the approach must be whether

the evidence of a witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth.

Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the Court to

scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies,

drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and

evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the

evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the

evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies

on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach

by taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the evidence,

Page 12 of 16

attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating

officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection

of the evidence as a whole.

It is clear from the evidence of both PW-02 and PW-16 that the place of the

incident was well lit even though the incident has occurred around midnight.

There had been no dispute that the appellants were well known to the witnesses

as they are fellow villages. There had been no allegation that the two eyewitnesses

had any animosity towards the appellants or had any reason to say something

they did not witness.

It was also not a disputed fact that, both the witnesses did not come out and

informed the police that they are eyewitnesses to the incident at the initial stages

of the investigations. In fact, PW- 02 has given a statement to the police on the

day of the incident itself and has stated that he did not see the crime being

committed. It was after two- or three-days PW- 02 has made a 2nd statement to

the police stating that he was an eye-witness to the incident and as to what he

saw. PW-16 has also come forward as an eyewitness several days after the

incident.

Therefore, the fact that both of them are somewhat belated witnesses, has to be

considered in deciding whether their belatedness has been sufficiently explained

before the Court, and that can be accepted.

PW-02 has explained his reasons as to why he did not tell the police in his initial

statement that he was an eyewitness by stating that the two appellants told him

not to divulge what happened and he was fearful for his life because the accused

were not arrested when the initial statement was made. He has explained further

stating that, his fellow villagers persuaded him to come out with the truth if he

saw the incident and that was the reason that he came forward later and gave

his 2nd statement.

Page 13 of 16

PW-16 has been a female who had been living in the village with her husband

and children. She too has clearly stated that, although she saw the incident

clearly she did not come forward to make a statement as she too was fearful of

making a statement against the appellants, believing that there will be

repercussions for her if she comes forward as an eyewitness.

I am of the view that, the reasons given by the witnesses for the belatedness need

to be considered with the evidence they gave before the trial Court in relation to

the incident. I find that in a village setting this kind of behaviour on the part of

a witness or witnesses can be expected. It clearly appears that the witnesses

were reluctant to come forward initially due to fear and their hesitancy to get

involved. That is the very reason as to why the PW-02 has stated in his 1st

statement that he did not see the incident as explained by him. The PW-16 has

also well explained her delay in coming forward as an eye witness of the incident.

When considering the manner in which the witnesses have given their evidence,

there is no basis to conclude that they are lying or speaking about something

that they did not see.

For the reasons considered above, I am of the view that the belatedness in

making statements has not dented the credibility of the evidence of the two eye

witnesses.

Although the learned Counsel for the appellants claimed that, there were

contradictions inter se and per se in the evidence, I find no reasons to agree with

such a contention.

As I have emphasized before, for a contradiction or omission to become relevant,

it should be material that goes into the core of the case. No one can expect several

witnesses who speak about an incident that occurred some years ago to explain

the same incident in the same manner, as the power of observation and power

to remember and explain may differ from person to person.

Page 14 of 16

In the case of Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai Vs. Statee of Gujarat AIR 1983 753 the

Indian Supreme Court held as follows:-

"By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is

replayed on the mental screen.

Ordinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The Witness

could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element of

surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to attune to

absorb the details.

The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may

notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image on

one person's mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of

another. Ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately

the sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short

time span. A witness is liable to get confused, or mixed up when interrogated

later on."

What matters is whether the witness can be considered as trustworthy and

cogent enough to be believed. It is also trite law that evidence in a case has to be

looked at in its totality and not in isolation.

I find no basis for the contention that the evidence of the eye-witnesses, cannot

be believed as they are contradictory to the evidence of the Judicial Medical

Officer (JMO) who conducted the postmortem either.

The witnesses have clearly spoken about a stabbing and an assault on the

deceased by the two appellants. The JMO has observed four cut injuries on the

body of the deceased towards the heart and front chest area of the deceased. The

cut injury to the heart being the fatal injury. The witnesses not speaking about

the number of times the deceased was stabbed is not a reason to claim

contradictions in that regard. The JMO has not observed any other injuries than

cut injuries, although witnesses speak about an assault of the deceased. This

Page 15 of 16

may be due to the reason that although the deceased was assaulted, he has not

received any visible injuries as a result. However, I am of the view that, the

opinion expressed by the JMO does tally with the evidence of the eyewitnesses

where they say that the attack to the deceased using a knife was towards his

frontal area and it was only after the attack, the deceased fell on the ground.

Another matter argued by the Counsel was that, the learned High Court Judge

has failed to consider whether there had been a sudden fight between the parties,

which would bring down the offence to that of culpable homicide not amounting

to murder.

It is settled law that even if an accused did not take up such a position during

the trial, it is the duty of the trial Judge to consider such a possibility in

evaluating the evidence. However, for a trial judge to consider such an

eventuality there must be evidence placed on record in that regard, even though

no such position has been taken by an accused person.

In the appeal under consideration, no such position has been taken when the

witnesses were giving evidence. Therefore, the trial Judge did not have the benefit

of considering such a possibility when analyzing the evidence of the two

eyewitnesses or that of PW-21 who was the other relevant witness in that regard.

Although the JMO has been cross-examined expecting an opinion from him as

to whether the injuries observed by him on the body of the deceased could have

been a result of a sudden fight, the JMO has not been in a position to express

such an opinion for obvious reasons. Whether there was a sudden fight or any

provocation by either party is a fact sensitive issue, for which a JMO cannot

express an opinion. I am of the view that, since there was no evidence before the

Court that would bring down the charges to that of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder, in terms of section 294 of the Penal Code, there is no basis

to argue that conviction would have been on the basis of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder.

Page 16 of 16

I find that, in fact the learned High Court Judge has considered whether there is

material before him to come to such finding and had come to a correct

determination in that regard.

I am of the view that this is a case where, the prosecution has led sufficient

evidence to prove the charge against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt.

The appellants have failed to create a reasonable doubt or has failed to provide

a reasonable explanation as to the charge of murder against them.

It is the view of this Court that the learned High Court Judge has come to a

correct finding after analyzing the evidence in its correct perspective, which

needs no disturbance from this court.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit. The conviction and the

sentence affirmed.
