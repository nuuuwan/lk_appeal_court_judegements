Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The complainant-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) being the

Director General for the Prevention of Bribery and Corruption of the Commission

to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, filed this application invoking

the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court granted in terms of Article 138 of The

Constitution in order to challenge and get set aside the order pronounced on 31-

01-2023, and two other incidental orders dated 31-01-2023 and 01-02-2023 by

the learned High Court Judge of Colombo in the High Court of Colombo Case No.

HCB/115/2021.

Although the petitioner has sought a stay order pending determination of this

application in the petition, the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who

represented the petitioner informed the Court that he would no longer seek a

stay order when this matter was taken up in the open Court on 07-07-2023.

That was the very reason why the matter was allowed to be supported for notice

without a notice being issued to the accused-respondents mentioned in the

petition.

After having considered the petition, affidavit and the relevant supporting

materials, and the submissions of the learned DSG, this Court decided to issue

notice on the accused-respondents.

Page 5 of 17

Accordingly, accused-respondents filed their objections through their Counsel

and the petitioner also filed counter objections.

At the hearing of this application, the learned Counsel for the 1st accused-

respondent raised several preliminary objections as to the maintainability of this

application before this Court. It was his submission that this revision application

shall stand dismissed on the preliminary objections raised by him by itself.

The learned Counsel raised following preliminary objections.

The caption of the motion filed by the petitioner in order to get this

matter mentioned before this Court refers to Supreme Court Rule 8

(6) of 1990, whereas, no such rules, and hence, the application was

bad in law.

Although the petitioner has sought interim reliefs, the petitioner has

failed to follow the mandatory requirement of giving notice in that

relation to the accused-respondents. There is nothing in the motion

or the petition filed before the Court that this is a matter where

interim relief should allow to be supported without notice on the

basis of urgency and hence, the application was bad in law.

Although the petition filed before the Court is dated 02-06-2023, the

affidavit filed in support of the contents in the petition had been

dated 29-05-2023, which was a date before the signing of the

petition. Therefore, the petition is not supported by way of an

affidavit as required in an application of this nature.

Before going into the merits of the application proper, I will now consider whether

the above-mentioned preliminary objections have any merit.

In that regard, this Court heard the extensive submissions of the learned

Counsel who represented the accused-respondents as well as the counter

submissions of the learned DSG on behalf of the petitioner.

Page 6 of 17

It is the view of this Court that any application before this Court which requires

the exercise of a discretionary remedy granted to this Court in terms of Article

138 of The Constitution, shall, as much as possible considered sans deciding

based on mere technical defects of such an application, unless those technical

defects are defects that goes into the root of the matter, which have vitiating

effect on the application before this Court, and if not accepted, it will cause a

substantial prejudicial effect on the rights of the parties or occasioned a failure

of justice.

The proviso of the very Article 138 (1) of The Constitution reads as follows;

Provided that no judgement, decree or order of any Court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

In Kiriwanthe and Another Vs. Navaratne and Another (1990) 2 SLR 393, it

was held:

Per Fernando, J.

The weight of authority thus favours the view that while all these Rules

(Rules 46,47,49,35) must be complied with, the law does not require r permit

an automatic dismissal of an application or appeal of the party in default.

The consequences of noncompliance (by reason of impossibility or any other

reason) is a matter falling within the discretion of the Court, to be exercised

after considering the nature of the default, as well as the excuse or

explanation thereof, in the context of the object of the particular rule.

Per Kulatunga, J.

In exercising its discretion, the Court will bear in mind the need to keep the

channel of procedure open for the justice to flow freely and smoothly and

Page 7 of 17

the need to maintain the discipline of the law. At the same time the Court

will not permit mere technicalities to stand in the way of the Court doing

justice.

The first preliminary objection relates to a defect in the motion filed by the

petitioner to get the case mentioned before the Court. However, it is abundantly

clear that the petitioner has stated in the caption of the motion as well as the

petition that this is an application filed invoking the revisionary jurisdiction in

terms of Article 138 of The Constitution reads with sections 364 and 365 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. Although the petitioner may have

mentioned a wrong rule in the motion, it is abundantly clear that the petitioner

has a right to file an application of this nature, get the matter supported, and

obtain a suitable order from the Court. I find that, a minute technical defect of

such a nature shall not stand in the way of considering an application of this

nature before the Court.

The 2nd preliminary objection raised was that the accused-respondents were not

noticed despite an interim relief being sought in the petition. As I have mentioned

earlier, although such a relief has been sought, the petition was not supported

for an interim relief. When this matter was supported without notice, this Court

only considered whether there was any basis to issue notice only, and after

having satisfied, the relevant notices were issued to the accused-respondents

along with the relevant documents. The accused-respondents can claim that

they were prejudiced only if an interim relief was granted by this Court without

them not being heard, which was not the case in this matter.

I am of the view that none of the above preliminary objections has caused any

prejudice towards the accused-respondents and find no reason to consider the

said objections in favour of them.

Page 8 of 17

The learned Counsel for the accused-respondents relied on the Supreme Court

judgement of Roylin Fernando Vs. Christian Gamini Fernando And Others

SC/Appeal No. 18A-09, to support his contention that the application shall

stand dismissed due to the affidavit filed in support of the application being an

affidavit dated before the date of the petition.

No doubt that the affidavit filed before this Court in support of the averments in

the revision application has been signed three days before the date of the

petition.

It is my considered view that the mentioned judgement has been cited out of

context to support the said objection. The cited judgement was a matter where

an order by the learned Additional District Judge of Marawila dated 05-06-2008,

where the learned Additional District Judge refused to accept an amended plaint

in a District Court of Marawila case. When this order was appealed against, to

the High Court of Civil Appeal of the North Western Province Holden in

Kurunegala, the learned Civil Appellate High Court Judges of Kurunegala by

their order dated 25-09-2008 had affirmed the order of the learned Additional

District Judge, apparently on the basis of several procedural defects in relation

to the affidavit filed in support of the application before the Court.

When this order was challenged before their lordships of the Supreme Court by

way of a leave to appeal application, leave has been granted by the Supreme

Court on following questions of law.

a. The said order is contrary to law and against the weight of the evidence.

b. The insertion of the wrong date by the Justice of Peace after attesting

the affidavit cannot vitiate the affidavit.

c. That the insertion of the wrong date is clearly a clerical error.

Page 9 of 17

It has been found that although the petitioners had sought to challenge an order

pronounced by the learned Additional District Judge of Marawila dated 05-06-

2008, the affidavit in support of the matters stated in the petition had been dated

20th June 2006, more than 2 years before the impugned order. Even the petition

filed by the petitioners in that case had no date, but only the month of June

2008 had been mentioned as the date of the petition.

Their lordships of the Supreme Court have considered the essential

requirements of an affidavit and has found that the said affidavit was not in

order. It has been determined that since the petitioner in that case has sought

to challenge an order pronounced in June 2008, there cannot be any possibility

for the facts contained in the petition to be in existence in June 2006, some two

years before the order. Their lordships have further determined that the

mentioned date in the affidavit cannot be attributed to a clerical error, and

thereby affirmed the determination of the High Court of Civil Appeal and

dismissed the appeal.

It is my considered view that there is nothing to conclude that this Supreme

Court judgement expects an affidavit filed in support of the contents in a petition

filed before the Court should be after the date of the petition. The Supreme Court

has decided that matter based on the facts and circumstances unique to the

matter argued before their lordships in agreeing with the decision of the High

Court of Civil Appeal of the North Western Province Holden in Kurunegala, the

facts of which has con relevance to the facts of the matter under consideration.

In the case of Distilleries Company Ltd. Vs. Kariyawasam And Others (2001)

3 SLR 119, it was held:

In terms of section 757(1), the petition need not be precede in point of time

to that of affidavits so as to enable a party to support the contents of the

petition.

Page 10 of 17

Per Nanayakkara, J.,

The object of Civil Procedure Code is to prevent civil proceedings from being

frustrated by any kind of technical irregularity of lapse which has not

caused prejudice or harm to a party. A rigid adherence to technicalities

should not prevent a Court from dispensing justice.

The Court should not approach the task of interpretation of a provision of

law with excessive formalities and technicality. A provision of law has to be

interpreted contextually giving consideration to the spirit of the law.

For the above-considered reasons, I find no basis in the preliminary objections

taken up by the learned Counsel on behalf of the respondents.

I will now consider whether there is a basis to grant the relief sought by the

petitioner as submitted by the learned Counsel for the petitioner, and whether it

should be disallowed as opposed by the learned Counsel for the respondents.

This is a matter where the four accused-respondents stood indicted before the

High Court of Colombo on 14 counts preferred against them by the Director

General for the Prevention of Bribery or Corruption.

The counts include a charge of conspiracy in terms of section 113A of the Penal

Code, aiding and abetting to commit conspiracy punishable in terms of the same

section of the Penal Code read with section 25 (3) and 19C of the Bribery Act as

amended, solicitation of a sum as a gratification and aiding and abetting for such

a solicitation punishable in terms of section 19C of the Bribery Act, and

accepting and aiding and abetting to accept a sum of Rs. 125 Million as a

gratification.

At the trial, PW-01 who is the person from whom the solicitation was said to have

been made and the person who has made the complaint to the Bribery

Commission, has given evidence. During his evidence, he has stated, among

other things, that he recorded the conversations that took place between him

and the 1st and the 4th accused-respondents.

Page 11 of 17

There had been several video recordings between the meetings of the accused-

respondents and the PW-01 as well.

In leading evidence, the prosecution has marked the said video recordings, and

when the trial was taken up for further evidence, it appears that the prosecution

has moved to mark two recordings of the conversations alleged to have been

made between the PW-01 and the accused-respondents.

When the prosecution moved to play the recordings of the production marked as

P-25, which was a pen drive, and P-27, which was a CD recording, the learned

Counsel who represented the accused-respondents, has raised an objection to

playing the recordings and marking its transcripts in Court.

The said objection has been raised on the following basis.

1. The original mobile phone, which was said to have been used to record

the conversations contained in P-25 and 27 has not been listed as a

production.

2. The said mobile phone is not in working condition.

3. There was no scientific analysis of the contents of the recordings to

establish the identity of the persons involved in the conversations.

It appears from the proceedings that the conversations allegedly contained in the

productions marked P-25 and P-27 are conversations between the PW-01 and

1st and the 4th accused-respondents. PW-01 in his evidence has stated that he

recorded these conversations using his mobile phone and the contention of the

learned Counsel for the respondents had been that the mobile phone was not

produced for inspection in terms of section 7 of the Evidence (Special Provisions)

Act No. 14 of 1995.

The contention of the prosecution had been that although the mobile phone that

has been used to record the conversations had not been listed as a production,

it has been right throughout in the possession of its owner, the PW-01.

Page 12 of 17

Accordingly, it has been in safe custody. The prosecution appears to have relied

on the interpretation section of Evidence (Special Provisions) Act, namely section

12 to argue that the documents marked P-25 and P-27 falls within the

interpretation of a contemporaneous recording in terms of section 4 of the

Evidence (Special Provisions) Act, and therefore, the said recordings should be

allowed to be produced as evidence.

For matters of clarity, I would now reproduce the final determinations of the

learned High Court Judge in relation to the objections raised before the trial

Court. At page 3 and 4 of the order dated 31-01-2023, the learned High Court

Judge has stated;

It appears that the learned High Court Judge has considered the English law

principle of best evidence rule and the fact that there was no scientific analysis

of the conversations alleged to have been recorded in agreeing with the objections

raised on behalf of the accused-respondents.

It also appears that the fact that the mobile phone said to have been used in

recording the conversations was not available as evidence and the fact that it

has not been tendered for inspection as required in terms of the Evidence

(Special Provisions) Act has been considered relevant by the learned High Court

Judge in his determination.

As I have stated before, this determination relates to the English legal principle

of best evidence rule.

E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy in the book, The Law of Evidence Volume 1 at

page 42 considers the present applicability of this rule under the English law

principles.

But this principle, once considered so fundamental, is hardly more than a

maxim. It is now not true, that the best evidence must, or even may, be given,

though it is non-production may be a matter for comment or affect the weight

of that which is produced. Thus, section 114f of the Evidence Ordinance

provides that the Court may presume that evidence which could be, and is

not, produced, would, if produced be unfavourable to the person who

withholds it. The Court must however have regard to the extenuating

Page 14 of 17

circumstances. Section 114f is a reproduction of the best evidence rule which

according to Taylor, does not demand the greatest amount of evidence

which can possibly be given of any fact; but its design is to prevent the

introduction of any, which from the nature of the case, supposes that better

evidence is in the possession of the party. It is adopted for the prevention of

fraud; for when better evidence is withheld, it is only fair to presume that

the party has some sinister motive for not producing it, and that, if offered,

his design would be frustrated.

At page 44, Coomaraswamy narrates the position in Sri Lanka in the following

manner.

The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has recognized that the best evidence rule

has been whittled down in the country of its birth and is no longer of

general application. Thus, in the King Vs. Peter Nonis (1947) 49 NLR 16

at 17 Windham, J. said:

In any case, what is the meaning of best evidence in the English law

sense? It certainly does not and never did mean that no other direct evidence

of the fact in dispute could be tendered. Its meaning is rather that the best

evidence must be given of which the nature of the case permits The best

evidence rule in England has been subjected to whittling down process for

over a century and today it is not true that the best evidence must be given,

though its non-production where available may be a matter for comment and

may affect the weight to be attached to the evidence that is produced in its

stead.

In the case of Vanderbona Vs. Perera (1985) 2 SLR 62 at 67, the Supreme

Court recognized the fact that the best evidence rule is now whittled down, and

though the non-production of the best evidence may be a matter for comment or

may affect the weight of the evidence that has been produced, it is not true that

the best evidence must be given to prove a fact.

Page 15 of 17

The recent English case of Kajala Vs. Noble (1982) 75 Cr.A.R. 149, Cr.L.Rev.

433 was a case where very similar facts were considered and allowed to be

admitted.

This was a case where the defendant was identified by a prosecution witness as

one of the predominantly Asian youths involved in a serious disturbance in a

public street and accompanied by throwing of missiles at police officers. The

witness has recognized him on a B.B.C. news programme concerning the

incident. As the B.B.C. based on their policy not to allow originals of their films

to leave the premises, the prosecution has relied on a video cassette recording

which the Court was satisfied as an authentic copy of the original, and the

defendant was convicted based on the evidence.

In the appeal filed against the conviction, dismissing the appeal, it was held;

That the older rule that a party must produce the best evidence that the

nature of the case would allow no longer applied except where the original

document was available in the partys hands. The Court was not confined

to the best evidence but could admit all relevant evidence. The goodness or

badness of it goes only to weight, but not to admissibility. The old rule was

confined to written documents in the strict sense of the term and had no

relevance to tapes or films. Accordingly, the prosecution was entitled to rely

upon the copy, which copy the Justices were satisfied was an authentic

copy of the original.

In our law, further whittling down of this principle has been statutorily

recognized by the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995. Under the

provisions relating to contemporaneous recordings under section 4, in any

proceeding where direct oral evidence of a fact would be admissible, any

contemporaneous recordings or reproductions thereof, tending to establish that

fact, shall be admissible as evidence of that fact under certain conditions set out

in the section itself.

Page 16 of 17

Even the admissibility of a duplicate of such evidence also has been recognized

in terms of section 4 (5) of the Act.

It is my considered view that if the prosecution has allowed access to the items

of evidence intended to be marked as P-25 and 27 in terms of section 7 of the

Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995, a trial Court has no basis to

reject the leading of such evidence on the basis that the original instrument that

recorded the conversations is not available, and that there is no scientific

evidence to identify the voices contained therein.

I am of the view that those are matters of comment, and matters if relevant, that

can be considered in determining the value of such evidence in the overall

context of a case.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the learned High Court

Judge was not correct when it was decided to refuse to allow P-25 and 27 to be

led as evidence in the case.

Therefore, I set aside the order dated 31-01-2023 any other incidental orders by

the learned High Court Judge of Colombo in that relation and direct that the

learned High Court Judge shall allow leading evidence based on the productions

intended to be marked as P-25 and P-27.

As it was informed to this Court that the leading of the prosecution evidence in

this case has now come to a virtual end, it is up to the prosecution to decide

whether they are going to recall PW-01 for that purpose or not. If the prosecution

expresses their desire to recall the PW-01 for the above limited purpose of leading

evidence in relation to P-25 and P-27, the learned High Court Judge is directed

to facilitate that process and allow the learned Counsel for the accused-

respondents to cross-examine the witness in relation to the above.

Page 17 of 17

In such a scenario, the prosecution shall be entitled to call any other witnesses

listed in the indictment to prove P-25 and P-27, which they may not have called

due to the rejection by the Court to lead evidence in relation to P-25 and P-27.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the High

Court of Colombo for necessary compliance.
