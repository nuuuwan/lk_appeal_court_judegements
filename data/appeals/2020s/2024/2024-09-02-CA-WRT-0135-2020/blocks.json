Indeed, in terms of the Supreme Court Judgment, the vehicles in dispute owned by the 18th Respondent can be registered with the 17th Respondent. It is understood that when those vehicles are sold by the 18th Respondent to 3rd parties, still the said vehicles are entitled to be registered in view of the said judgment. There is no intimation in the said judgment that the vehicles cannot be registered by the new owners. It is the considered view of this Court that on the strength of the said judgment of the Supreme Court and the Cabinet Decision, the Petitioners those who purchased the vehicles from the 18th Respondents are also entitled to have those vehicles registered with the 17th Respondent despite the fact that they are not parties to the said Supreme Court case. It is pertinent to note that the Petitioners who purchased the vehicles from the 18th Respondent on the strength of the Supreme Court Judgment too are entitled to enjoy the fruits of the said Judgment.",
