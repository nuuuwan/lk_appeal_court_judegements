Facts of the case

3) The Petitioner is a Bank which was incorporated in 1987 in terms

of the Companies Act No. 117 of 1982 (as amended) and was re-

registered in terms of Companies Act No. 7 of 2007.

4) The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents are officers of the Labour

Department. And the 4th Respondent is a former employee of the

Petitioners Bank who had made a complaint to the 1st Respondent

in respect of gratuity purported to be payable to him by the

Petitioner Bank.

5) Up to the year 2008, the Petitioner Bank had performed profitably.

Subsequently, due to the crisis concerning Golden Key Credit Card

Co. Ltd, the Petitioner Bank was subject to unexpected

withdrawals and demands for repayment of moneys and deposits.

This had affected the existence and viability of the Petitioner Bank.

Due to that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka had intervened and

taken steps to sustain the existence of the Petitioner Bank.

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

6) In the instant action, the dispute had arisen between the Petitioner

Bank and the 4th Respondent.During the period the Bank was

performing profitably, the Board of Directors had issued a

unilateral internal memorandum titled Gratuity Payment as an

employee friendly measure on 5th October 2004.

7) Subsequently, due to the aforementioned crisis the Petitioner Bank

was unable to continue with the payment of enhanced gratuity

made by P3 document. A memorandum had been issued by the

Board of Directors of the Petitioner Bank by P5 document

rescinding the enhanced gratuity payment granted by P3

document.

8) On the aforesaid circumstances, the 4th Respondent and some of

the employees complained to the Department of Labour against the

Petitioner for cancelling the enhanced gratuity payment. The 3rd

Respondent had conducted an inquiry on the complaint made by

the 4th Respondent which is referred to in paragraphs 21 to 29 of

the petition. The Petitioner had explained in his petition that the

said inquiry held by the 3rd Respondent had shortcomings and the

difficulties faced by the Petitioner before the inquiry officer.

9) The 3rd Respondent had made an order and issued P8 document to

the Petitioner to make the enhanced gratuity payment which is

challenged by the Petitioner in the instant action.

10) Previously the Petitioner had instituted CA Writ application

420/2017 against an employee SBW Wickramaratne and later the

matter had been settled between the parties and the case had been

withdrawn.

11) Under the said circumstances the Petitioner had contended, that

the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents had acted illegally conducting the

inquiry between the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent, without

giving a proper hearing to the Petitioner.

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

5

12) In the event, the P8 decision issued by the 3rd Respondent is

executed, it will cause grave prejudice and will be an unlawful

enforcement.

13) On the said circumstances the Petitioner had prayed for the reliefs

claimed in the prayer of the petition dated 8th March 2019.

Objections of the 4th Respondent

14) The 4th Respondent has contended that he was an employee of the

Petitioner and his employment contract ended with effect from 19th

January 2013. When the 4th Respondent retired from the

Petitioners Bank, the Petitioner had failed to pay the full

entitlement of gratuity.

15) On that the 4th Respondent had made a complaint to the

Commissioner of Labour, as the Petitioner had agreed to pay

gratuity on the basis of one months salary for each completed year

of service to those who have served more than 10 years at the time

of resignation or retirement.

16) The 4th Respondent had rendered his service expecting the

aforesaid benefit offered by the Petitioner by P3 document.

Although the Petitioner had stated after the Golden Key

controversy the Petitioner failed to perform well, the 4th

Respondent had contended that he cannot admit the facts related

in the document marked and produced as P9.

17) Further, the Petitioner cannot unilaterally and retrospectively

change the facts pertinent to P3 document by issuing the P5

memorandum.

18) On the aforesaid grounds the 4th Respondent was compelled to

complain to the Labour Commissioner.

19) The Commissioner of Labour after the inquiry had directed the

Petitioner to pay the gratuity in accordance to the P3 document on

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

6

the basis of one month per each year of service to those employees

who had completed 10 years.

20) The Labour Commissioners decision was to pay the enhanced

gratuity which the Petitioner had wrongfully held back.

Furthermore, the Petitioner is not presently in danger of insolvency

and there was no necessity to reduce the gratuity entitlement of

the 4th Respondent.

21) Therefore the 4th Respondent reiterates that the direction given in

P8 is lawful and the Petitioners application is misconceived in fact

and Law.

22) On the said grounds the 4th Respondent had sought to dismiss the

Petitioners application.

Disputed facts

23) When this matter was taken up for argument on 19thOctober

2023, Presidents Counsel Romesh De Silva concluded his

submissions. The matter resumed on 18th January 2024and

Deputy Solicitor General Manohara Jayasinghe concluded his

submissions.

24) Considering the submissions, the facts pertinent to the petition

and statement of objections, documents and written submissions

submitted by the Petitioner and the Respondents the following

disputed facts need to be considered to arrive at my conclusion.

I. Has the Petitioner paid gratuity to the 4th Respondent, as

stipulated in terms of Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983?

II. Has the Petitioner agreed by P3, to pay enhanced gratuity of one

months salary for each year of service for employees who

completed ten years of service?

III. If so, is the Petitioner bound by the P3 letter?

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

7

IV. If not, can the order made by the Assistant Labour Commissioner

by P8 decision be enforced?

I. Has the Petitioner paid gratuity to the 4th Respondent, as

stipulated in terms of Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of

1983?

25) The payment of gratuity is defined in Section 2 of the aforesaid Act.

Further in Blacks Law Dictionary 11th edition1 the payment of

gratuity is referred to as follows;

a) A premium or benefit offered or given, esp. by a

government, to induce someone to take action or perform a service. b) A gift, esp. in a will; generosity in giving. c) The portion of a salvage award exceeding what the salvor

would be entitled to on the basis of quantum meruit. Also termed as bonus.

26) The payment of gratuity as mentioned above should be calculated

in accordance with Section 5(1) of the Gratuity Act. It is referred to

as follows;

Every employer who employs or has employed fifteen or

more workmen on any day during the period of twelve

months immediately preceding the termination of the

services of a workman in any industry shall, on

termination (whether by the employer or workman, or on

retirement or by the death of the workman, or by operation

of law, or otherwise) of the services at any time after the

coming into operation of this Act, of a workman who

hasunder that employer, pay to that workman in respect of

1Garner, B.A. (2019). Black's Law Dictionary. 11th ed. St. Paul, Minnesota: Thomson Reuters

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

8

such services, and where the termination is by the death of

that workman, to his heirs, a gratuity computed in

accordance with the provisions of this Part within a period

thirty days of such termination.

27) In the said Act, Section 8(1) refers to on which grounds the

gratuity can be recovered in the event of non-payment of by an

employer.

28) In the instant action, the Petitioner had sought 2 reliefs under Writ

Jurisdiction. The first one is the Writ of Prohibition against the 1st,

2nd and 3rd Respondents to initiate action under Section 8(1) of the

Payment of Gratuity Act. The second one is Writ of Certiorari,

quashing the P8 decision taken by the Assistant Labour

Commissioner.

29) Both parties have not disputed the payment of gratuity in

accordance with the Provision of the Gratuity Act other than the

enhanced payment sought by the 4th Respondent under P3.

30) Under the said circumstances, the payment of gratuity under

Section 2 and 5 which amounts to half a month of salary during

the period of 12 months is unchallenged.

II. Has the Petitioner, by P3, agreed to pay enhanced gratuity

of one months salary for each year of service for

employees who completed ten years of service?

31) The crux of this application is the non-payment of enhanced

gratuity by P3 to the 4th Respondent.

32) The Presidents Counsel Romesh De Silva appeared for the

Petitioner Bank and argued that P3 document is not a

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

9

memorandum issued by the Bank and none of the Directors have

signed the said document.

33) However, by P5 document which is the memorandum of the Board

of Directors had admitted the enhanced payment on P3 document,

and the said facility given in P3 document had been reverted on

24th March 2009.

34) My considered view is, it is necessary to incorporate the contents

referred to in P3 document and P5 document. The P3 document is

referred to as follows:

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

10

Subsequently,the P5 document which was the decision of the

Board of Directors, reverted the P3 decision which reads as follows:

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

11

35) The Deputy Solicitor General Manohara Jayasinghe in his

argument brought notice to this Court under Section 10 of the

Gratuity Act which reads as follows;

Where the gratuity payable to a workman is governed by a

collective agreement, award of an Industrial Court

orarbitrator under the Industrial Disputes Act or any other

agreement. The computation of such gratuity in respect of

his services shall be made in accordance with the terms of

such collective agreement, award of an Industrial Court or

arbitrator or other agreement as the case may be, provided

that the gratuity or terminal benefits set out therein

provided that the gratuity or terminal benefits set out

therein are more favourable to the workman than the

gratuity payable under this Act.

The enhanced payment agreed by P3 benefits should be given to

the 4thRespondent as there is no ground under any circumstance

for the Petitioner to revert it and to go back and pay gratuity under

the Provisions of Section 5(1) of the Gratuity Act.

36) This argument was rejected by the Counsel for the Petitioner. The

position taken by the Petitioner is, the enhanced gratuity indicated

in P3 was adopted and paid during the period the Petitioner Bank

was enjoying a profitable and financially successful period. In view

of that the employees identified in P3 document who have

completed 10 years unblemished service in the Bank were paid

enhanced gratuity after termination of their service or resignation.

37) However, due to the financial crisis faced by the Petitioner Bank

during the period 2008 onwards the Petitioner was unable to meet

the financial capabilities to make the enhanced gratuity payment

which is referred to in P3 document.

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

12

38) In the said circumstances the enhanced gratuity payment had

been agreed upon by the Petitioner when referring to the P3

document.

39) I will discuss whether the payment can be made or not or the

decision taken by the Assistant Commissioner of Labour is correct

or not in the following analyzations.

III. If so, is the Petitioner bound by the P3 letter?

40) This is a matter vehemently argued by both parties and the

AssistantLabour Commissioner had taken his decision on P8 letter

based on the P3 document.

41) President Counsel Romesh De Silvas argument was that the P3

letter was issued during the period that the Petitioner Bank was

faring well and was making a profit. On the said grounds, the

Petitioner Bank had enhanced the gratuity payment for employees

who had completed 10 years of unblemished service.

42) The said P3 document was issued on 5th October 2004 and there is

no reference that the Board of Directors had agreed or taken a

decision on this. Therefore there is no agreement of enhanced

gratuity payment between the employer and the employees and it

is an exgratia payment during the period the letter was issued.

43) In considering the said argument and observing the P3 document,

P3 document does not contain any decision taken by the Board of

Directors of the Petitioner Bank. However, P5 document which is

the extract of the minutes of the Board of Directors meeting

contains to revert the enhanced payment agreed by P3 document.

44) In the said circumstances, at the time the P3 document was issued

it was a valid document.

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

13

IV. If not, can the order made by the Assistant Labour

Commissioner by P8 decision be enforced?

45) The question had arisen in the instant action the validity of the P8

letter issued by the Assistant Commissioner of Labour as the

Petitioner in his prayer in the petition dated 8th March 2019 sought

for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the P8 decision taken by the

Assistant Commissioner of Labour.

46) In the instant application the main question to be considered is

that the Board of Directors of the Petitioner had taken the decision

by P5 to revert the facility of enhanced gratuity payment which was

granted to the staff category referred to in P3 document.

47) The grounds on which the said decision was taken was due to the

severe financial crisis faced by the Petitioner Bank and it was not

possible to continue the payment of the enhanced gratuity

payment to its employees in the manner indicated in P3 document.

48) On the said grounds, the Petitioner had no choice but to revert to

the statutory half months pay which is a requirement under

payment of Gratuity Act No.12 of 1983.

49) The said decision taken by the Petitioner was for the best interest

of the institution.

50) The objections filed by the 4th Respondent dated 19th July 2019

had admitted that there was a crisis due to the Golden Key

controversy. And the 4th Respondent had not denied that the

Petitioner Bank was subject to being monitored by the Central

Bank and was under their supervision.

51) At this stage I would like to refer to the definition of a Bank. In

Blacks Law Dictionary2, it states as follows;

2Garner, B.A. (2019). Black's Law Dictionary. 11th ed. St. Paul, Minnesota: Thomson Reuters

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

14

A financial establishment for the deposit, loan, exchange, or issue of money and for the transmission of funds, organized in accordance with state or federal law; esp., a member of the Federal Reserve System.

Under Securities law, a bank includes any financial institution if a substantial portion of the institutions business consists in receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks and if the institution is supervised and examined by a state or federal banking authority; or a receiver, conservator, or other liquidating agent of any of the above institutions.

52) In considering the aforesaid facts the Petitioner has the

responsibility to protect the depositors funds and maintain the

functioning of the institution without any failure.

53) At the time the Bank is monitored by the Central Bank,additional

encumbrances cannot be borne by the said institution that would

affect the smooth running of the institution.

54) The grievance before this court, forwarded by the Petitioner is that

the Assistant Labour Commissioner did not consider any of the

matters faced by the Petitioner during the financial crisis and had

taken the decision arbitrarily, unreasonably and against the

Principles of Natural Justice.

55) The Petitioner has brought to the notice of court, by P9 document

the income and the expenditure during the crisis faced by the

Petitioner Bank. It is obvious in the P8 decision the Assistant

Commissioner of Labour had only calculated the gratuity payment

and the enhanced gratuity payment and had not considered the

grounds on which the Petitioners Bank took the Board of

Directors decision by P5.

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

15

56) In the said circumstances, I am of the view that the Assistant

Commissioner should have given reasons for not considering the

Petitioner Banks failure to make the enhanced gratuity payment.

57) Therefore, it is obvious that the Assistant Commissioner had

issued the P8 letter arbitrarily, unreasonably and violated the

Principles of Natural Justice. On which the Petitioner Banks

rights had been violated and is entitled to invoke the Writ

Jurisdiction of this court.

58) In relation to the aforesaid position I draw my attention to the

following two decisions;

In Geeganage v Director General, Customs3 Gunawardena J.

made the following observations;

By way of preface, I may say that the arguments put forward

by the eminent Presidents Counsel for the petitionermight,

perhaps, have been more acceptably addresses to a court

exercising appellate and not supervisory jurisdiction-the latter

jurisdiction being the one invoked by the petitioner in his

petition seeking, under the judicial review procedure, a

quashing of the aforesaid decision made by the 2nd

respondent. The arguments advanced on behalf of the

petitioner are based solely on factual matters inviting the

Court of Appeal more or less, to substitute its view in the

interpretation of factual matters or situations dealt within the

written submissions. The submissions seem to be oblivious

of the distinction between appeal and review procedure. If one

appeals against a decision, one is claiming that it is wrong, or

incorrect. The Court of Appeal if it is persuaded of the merits

3[2001] 3 SLR 273.

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

16

of the case may allow the appeal and so it substitutes its view

for that of the courts or tribunal of first instance. Under the

judicial review procedure the courts is not concerned with the

merits of the case, that is, whether the decision is right or

wrong. In review (as opposed to appeal) the courts only

considers whether the decision is lawful or unlawful.

And in Podimhathmaya v The Land Reform Commission4

Palakidnar J made the following observations;

This Court can interfere where there is manifest

unreasonableness in an administrative act. The test is

whether the administrative authority has acted within the

rules of reason and justice.

59) In considering the said decisions it is obvious no authority can act

arbitrarily against the provisions provided by the statute.In the

instant action, I have already discussed that the Assistant

Commissioner of Labour had arbitrarily without giving a hearing to

the Petitioner had made the decision by P8. My considered view is

the said decision had violated Audi Alteram Partem of the

Petitioner.

60) Further the enhanced gratuity is not an entitlement by the 4th

Respondent and it is a discretionary remedy and it should be

granted in the event the Petitioner Bank is making fruitful profits

and not at a time it is failing to maintain its functions due to the

crisis which the Petitioner Bank had faced.

61) Furthermore, the facts pertinent to the decision of CA 891/2009

Writ cannot be considered in the instant action as the said case

4 [1990] 2 SLR 416.

C.A. WRIT 88-2019

17

was in pro forma set aside by the Supreme Court decision SC (Spl)

LA.No.25/2015

CONCLUSION

62) In view of the aforesaid facts, documents and in considering the

submissions made by the Counsel I grant the reliefs prayed for in

the prayer c and d of the petition dated 8th March 2019.

63) No cost ordered.
