Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Colombo on two counts of possession and trafficking of

Diacetylmorphine, commonly known as Heroin.

The allegation against him had been that on 22-05-2014 at Maligawatta, he had

in his possession 3.13 grams of Diacetylmorphine which is a prohibited drug in

terms of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by

Amendment Act No. 13 of 1984, and thereby committed the offences of

possession and trafficking of Heroin, punishable in terms of the Ordinance.

The appellant had pleaded not guilty to the indictment, and after trial, the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo had found the appellant guilty as charged,

of the judgement dated 12-01-2021. Accordingly, the appellant had been

sentenced to life imprisonment.

It is against the said conviction and the sentence; the appellant has preferred

this appeal.

Facts in Brief

PW-01 Police Inspector Ranasinghe was the officer who led the team of police

officers attached to the Colombo Crimes Division to conduct this raid, where the

appellant had allegedly been arrested while having Heroin in his possession. IP

Ranasinghe was a well-experienced officer in drug related detections. On 22-05-

2014, he has left the Colombo Crimes Division at 14.40 hours along with 10

other officers in a white coloured van belonging to the police department.

He had been dressed in number 02 police uniform, while all other officers had

been in civics. The team has left the police station on routine crime prevention

Page 4 of 11

duty. After traveling to various places, they have come near Babapulle road and

had parked the vehicle in front of a mosque named as Podi Palliya.

After leaving two police officers in the van, PW-01, along with other team

members had walked towards the Premadasa International Cricket Stadium.

While walking, he has observed a person coming towards him. After seeing him,

crossing the road towards the other side pavement, and having suspected the

movements of the person, PW-01 and the team has surrounded him.

When searched, PW-01 has found a pink-coloured cellophane bag with some

brown-coloured substance in his right-hand side pocket. Through his

experience, PW-01 has realized that the substance is Heroin, and arrested the

person, namely, Rohana Priyanthage Antony Kumara at 15.10 hours. The

witness has identified the suspect arrested as the appellant who stood indicted

before the High Court.

After the arrest, PW-01 and his team has gone to a place called Dedigama

Pawning Center in Dematagoda and had used the electronic scale available in

the pawning center to weigh the productions. The parcel had shown a weight of

20 grams and 30 milligrams. After the weighing, PW-01 has taken steps to seal

the productions, and had return to his station. PW-01 has entered his in entry

note at 16.25 hours. He has handed over the suspect and the productions to

police reserve under production receipt number 163/2014.

The evidence in chief of PW-01 itself shows that the learned State Counsel who

prosecuted has questioned the witness as to the duties he performed before he

left the station at 14.40 hours. It has been revealed that in fact PW-01 has left

the police station at 6.30 hours in the morning for his vice prevention duties. He

and his team have arrested 4 suspects including a female, and had returned to

the police station at 14.20 hours, which means, PW-01 and his team had left the

police station again within 20 minutes of their arrival, for vice prevention duties.

Page 5 of 11

It appears that the learned prosecuting State Counsel himself had doubts about

the timeline as mentioned by PW-01, which has led to several questions being

posed to PW-01 in that regard.

The other witness called by the prosecution to substantiate the evidence of PW-

01 had been PW-02, PS10757 Fonseka. His evidence had been similar to that of

IP Ranasinghe.

The position taken up by the appellant during the cross-examination of the

prosecution witnesses had been that he was not arrested in the manner stated

by PW-01. It had been his position that PW-01 got the female suspect whom he

arrested previously to call the appellant and persuaded him to come near

Kethtarama Stadium and he was arrested in the morning itself when he came in

a three-wheeler and got down near Kethtarama Stadium. He has denied that he

was arrested in the evening as claimed by the witnesses and had any Heroin in

his possession.

During the trial, several admissions had been recorded before the trial Court,

and the Government Analyst Report had been admitted.

When the appellant was required to present his defence at the close of the

prosecution case, he has made a dock statement. It had been his position that

in the morning of 22-05-2014, he came in a three-wheeler and got down from it

near Kethtarama Stadium to meet a person called Suresh with the intention of

obtaining employment, and he was arrested by the police at that point. He has

claimed that he was assaulted, although he had nothing in his possession, but

later took him to the police station and was charged for having Heroin in his

possession.

On behalf of the appellant, a person called Ismaldeen has given evidence. He has

stated that he took the appellant in his three-wheeler on a hire and when they

reached Maligawatta area, four police officers in civilian clothes stopped the

vehicle and arrested them, and both of them were assaulted and taken to the

Page 6 of 11

police station. According to the witness, he had been released by the police

around 6.00 p.m.

In his judgement, the learned High Court Judge has found no contradictions or

omissions in the evidence of PW-01 and 02 with regard to the detection of Heroin

in the possession of the appellant. He has found that after the arrest, the

productions had been properly sealed, handed over to the police reserve and

taken to the Government Analyst in the proper manner.

The Government Analyst Report reveals that the substance found in the

possession of the appellant had a pure quantity of 3.13 grams of

Diacetylmorphine, commonly known as Heroin.

The attention of the learned High Court Judge had been drawn to the timeline

given by PW-01 and his team about coming to the police station after conducting

several raids and leaving again within 20 minutes time. It had been determined

that there was no ambiguity in the timeline given by the witnesses as it was

probable for the police to complete their necessary duties within 20 minutes and

leave the station.

The learned High Court Judge has determined that the stand taken by the

appellant when the witnesses gave evidence for the prosecution, and when he

was called upon for the defence, were different to each other, and had determined

that the appellant has failed to create a reasonable doubt of the prosecution

evidence.

Accordingly, he has been convicted as charged.

The Ground of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel informed the Court

that he is relying mainly on the probability factor of the evidence presented by

PW-01 and supported by PW-02.

Page 7 of 11

The learned Presidents Counsel formulated the following ground of appeal for

the consideration of the Court.

(1) The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself of the facts of the

case by failing to properly analyze the evidence.

In his submissions the learned Presidents Counsel brought to the notice of the

Court the that for a team of police officers who left their police station at 6.30 in

the morning, and returned at 14.20 in the afternoon with 4 arrested persons, to

leave the station in 20 minutes time after completing the necessary formalities

that should be fulfilled in relation to the 4 arrested persons, is highly improbable.

He was of the view that if the learned High Court Judge looked at the

improbability factor in that relation in the correct perspective, there was no basis

to conclude that the charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt against

the appellant.

Although the learned Presidents Counsel made his submissions based on

several other factors he termed as weaknesses in the prosecution case, I will

proceed to consider all the factors on the basis of probability, as it was the main

ground of appeal urged on behalf of the appellant.

It was the submission of the Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) that the

arrest of the appellant by the police was not a disputed fact, and since there were

no omissions or contradictions as to the evidence for the prosecution, it has been

established that the arrest was made in the afternoon and not as claimed by the

appellant.

It was the position of the learned SDSG that the improbability factor as claimed

by the learned Presidents Counsel had drawn the attention of the learned High

Court Judge, and since the learned High Court Judge had considered the facts

and the relevant law in its correct perspective before reaching his conclusions,

the appeal should stand dismissed.

Page 8 of 11

Consideration of the Ground of Appeal

It is clear from the evidence of PW-01 that he and his team of police officers had

initially left the Colombo Crimes Division at 6.30 a.m. for their daily vice

prevention duties. According to the witness, they have returned to the station at

14.20 hours and had left again in 20 minutes time at 14.40 hours. It has been

established that the PW-01 has entered his in entry note at 14.20, which means

that he has begun to write the entry note at that time. When they returned to

the station at 14.20, the police team has had in their custody, four suspects,

including a female. Three of them had been arrested for having Cannabis in their

possession while the female had been arrested for having Heroin with her.

The question before this Court is whether it would have been possible for the

PW-01 to follow all the necessary formalities once an arrested suspect is brought

to a police station, especially, with productions relating to drugs, and leave the

police station within 20 minutes, again on vice prevention duties.

As I have stated before, when the witness says that he returned to the police

station at 14.20 hours, it is clear that it was the time he began to prepare his in

entry note in the relevant book. There is no doubt that after having arrested four

persons, it will at least take few minutes time for him to obtain the relevant book

and enter the notes. Then thereafter, he needs to hand over the four accused

persons and the productions to the police reserve, each one separately. It is hard

to believe that such a procedure can be completed within a short span of 20

minutes as claimed by the witness. Each production has to be entered in the

production register. The Production Officer has to accept the productions after

checking the relevant seals. If the suspected persons had any personal

belongings, such belongings need to be entered separately and handed over to

the Productions Officer.

Page 9 of 11

It is only thereafter, the PW-01 will have time to organize another outing on crime

prevention duties. He needs to search or inspect his fellow team members to

make sure that they do not carry unwanted items and also to search the vehicle

they were traveling before leaving for their duties. A police team who returned to

a police station after several hours of crime prevention duties needs at least few

minutes rest before they embark on another journey of crime prevention.

It is very much apparent that even the prosecuting State Counsel had a doubt

in his mind as to the timeline given by PW-01 in this regard when the witness

was examined in detail of this fact.

Although it is correct to say that this fact had drawn the attention of the learned

High Court Judge, I am not in a position to accept the justification given in that

regard. For matters of clarity, I would now reproduce the relevant portion of the

judgement, which appears at page 12 of the judgement (at page 257 of the appeal

brief).

It clearly appears that although the learned High Court Judge has drawn his

attention to the probability factor, he has failed to adequately analyze whether it

was possible under the given circumstances, other than merely accepting the

evidence of PW-01 in that regard on its face value.

I am of the view that if viewed at the viewpoint of a reasonably prudent person,

the evidence of PW-01 that he left within 20 minutes after arriving at the police

station having conducted several detections previously, was highly improbable.

Page 10 of 11

It is my considered view that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses fails the

test of probability as argued by the learned Presidents Counsel, which is a

matter that should be considered in favour of the appellant.

It is trite law that however weak the defence taken up by an accused person,

weaknesses of the defence will not lessen the burden of the prosecution to prove

the prosecutions case beyond reasonable doubt.

In the case of Narender Kumar Vs. State of Delhi (NCT of Delhi, AIR 2012 SC

2281, it was held:

Prosecution case has to stand on its own legs and cannot take support from

the weakness of the case of the defence. However great the suspicion

against the accused and however strong the morel belief and conviction of

the Court, unless the offence of the accused is established beyond

reasonable doubt on the basis of legal evidence and material on the record,

he cannot be convicted for the offence. There is an initial presumption of

innocence of the accused and the prosecution has to bring home the offence

against the accused by reliable evidence. The accused is entitled to the

benefit of every reasonable doubt.

In the appeal under consideration, the position taken up by the appellant as to

the reason why he came near the stadium on the day of his arrest differs from

what was suggested to PW-01 and stated in his dock statement. However, the

stand taken up by him as to the way he was arrested in the morning hours of

the day had been consistent. The witness who gave evidence on behalf of the

appellant had been consistent with the stand of the appellant that he was

arrested while traveling in his three-wheeler during the morning of the day of

arrest. When considering these factors together with the probability issue raised

on behalf of the appellant, I find strong merit in the ground of appeal urged by

the learned Presidents Counsel.

Page 11 of 11

Accordingly, agreeing that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt against the appellant, I set aside the conviction and the

sentence as it cannot be allowed to stand.

The appellant is acquitted of the charges preferred against him.
