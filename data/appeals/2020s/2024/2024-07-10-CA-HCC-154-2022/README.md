Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Badulla for committing the following offences.

1. That he kidnapped the minor child mentioned in the charge from her

lawful guardian at a place called Bowela in Welimada, on or about 31-

07-2008, and thereby committed an offence punishable in terms of

section 354 of the Penal Code.

2. At the same time and at the same transaction, he committed the offence

of grave sexual abuse for sexual gratification by having intercrural sex

with the mentioned minor child, and thereby committed an offence

punishable in terms of section 365B(2)(b) of the Penal Code as amended

by the Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1995 and 29 of 1998.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Badulla found the appellant guilty

as charged of his judgment dated 12-09-2022.

After having considered the aggravating as well as mitigatory circumstances, the

learned High Court Judge sentenced the appellant for a term of 1-year rigorous

imprisonment on count 1. He was ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 2,500/- and in

default, to serve 6 months simple imprisonment.

Page 3 of 14

On count 2, the appellant was imposed a rigorous imprisonment period of 9

years and was ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/- with a default sentence of 6

months simple imprisonment.

In addition to the above, he was also ordered to pay Rs. 250,000/- as

compensation to the minor child, and if the appellant fails to pay the said

compensation, it was ordered to be recovered as a fine, with a default sentence

of 12 months simple imprisonment.

The learned High Court Judge has directed that the two rigorous imprisonment

periods shall run consecutive to each other, which means a total period of 10

years rigorous imprisonment.

It is against this conviction and sentence; the appellant has preferred this appeal

on the basis of being aggrieved.

The Facts in Brief

This is an incident that has occurred on 31-07-2008. The victim child who has

given evidence as PW-01 before the High Court was a six and a half-year-old

school-going child at that time. The appellant was a known person to her to

whom she has referred to as uncle ().

On the day of the incident, she has returned from school and after having her

meal, she has gone to a neighbours house to play with some of her friends. She

has seen the appellant seated on a chair on the veranda of that house, and there

had been another old grandmother at that house. She has played with two

children in front of the house. While they were playing, the appellant has come

and told the victim child to come with him so that he can pick some mandarins

from a tree situated near an abandoned house, which was close to the place

where they were playing.

Although the child has resisted, the appellant has taken her to the abandoned

house and had made her lie down on the floor. Thereafter, he has removed her

clothes and spitted on to her vagina, and has had intercrural sex with the child.

Page 4 of 14

Although the child has attempted to scream, it has not attracted anyone. After

the act, the appellant has given two mandarins to her and asked her to go home.

When she returned home, only her father had been at the house and the child

has narrated to him what happened to her. The father has taken her to the police

station where she has made a statement, and a doctor has examined her at the

hospital.

The child has been cross-examined on the basis that although an incident may

have occurred, she was not sure as to the identity of the person who committed

sexual abuse to her. It appears that this line of cross-examination has been

based on the evidence of the child where she identified the perpetrator of the

crime only as the uncle (). However, it is abundantly clear from the evidence

of the child that the appellant was not a stranger to her, but a person well known

to her, although she has had no regular contacts with him. It appears that the

child has come to know the appellants name as Wimale () subsequent to

the incident, which may have been the reason why she has referred to him as

Wimale Maama ( ) in her evidence.

The fact that the victim child was a minor under the age of 16 years has been an

admitted fact during the trial.

According to the evidence of the father of the child (PW-02), he has come home

around 3.30 in the afternoon after attending to his days work. At that time, his

youngest son and the wifes mother had been at home. When inquired about the

victim child, he has been informed that she went to play at the neighbours

house, which was not unusual for him. Sometime later, the child has come

crying with two mandarins in her hand, and has informed that Wimale Maama

( ) dragged her to the forest and committed a sexual act on her. Since

his wife was not home at that time, he has immediately taken the child to the

police station and informed of the incident. The person mentioned as Wimale

Maama ( ) by the victim child was a neighbour well known to him.

Page 5 of 14

Under cross-examination, he too has been suggested to the effect that the victim

child was not sure about the person who committed the crime on her, but the

witness has been firm saying that the child always used to refer to the appellant

as uncle () and he was well known to her.

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who has examined the child after the incident

has testified and marked the relevant Medico-Legal Report (MLR) as P-02 before

the Court. The child has been examined on 01-08-2008 at 10 a.m. In giving the

history of the incident, he has made a consistent statement of the evidence the

child has given before the trial Court. The JMO has observed one scratch mark

on the left side of her face. He has not observed any injuries to the vaginal area

of the child, but has expressed the opinion that intercrural sex as described by

the child can occur without any injuries or marks being present on the victim

child. The doctor has stated that he is not certain whether the child described

the person who committed the act on her only as an uncle (), however he has

further stated that he took down the persons name as Wimaladasa. After leading

the evidence of police witnesses who conducted the investigations into the

matter, the prosecution has closed its case.

When the accused was called upon for a defence by the learned High Court

Judge, he has decided to make a statement from the dock. It has been his

position that he was arrested only on suspicion and he never took the child

anywhere.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. The burden of proof has been shifted to the appellant by the learned

High Court Judge.

2. Identification of the accused-appellant is doubtful.

Page 6 of 14

3. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the improbabilities

and impossibilities of the prosecution evidence.

4. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider omissions and

contradictions highlighted during the trial in his judgment.

Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal

I will now proceed to consider the 2nd, 3rd and the 4th grounds of appeal before I

would proceed to consider the 1st ground of appeal as the earlier-mentioned

grounds of appeal are interrelated.

The argument that the identity of the appellant was doubtful appears to have

been based on the evidence of PW-01 where she has initially referred to the

appellant as one uncle ( ) to argue that the victim child has failed to

clearly identify the perpetrator.

It is well settled law that the evidence of a witness cannot be considered by

bearing in mind few words uttered in its isolation, but the evidence has to be

taken in its totality. Especially, the evidence of small children in relation to

sexual abuse matters.

In James Silva Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 SLR 167, it was clearly

stated that;

"A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider

all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by

the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and, ask himself

whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he

believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty."

When taken in its totality, there can be no doubt that the appellant was a well-

known person to the child. It may be that the child did not know the name of the

appellant when he confronted her and committed the act of sexual abuse on her.

It may be that she has come to know the name of the appellant as Wimale Maama

( ) subsequent to the incident, which does not mean that she has failed

Page 7 of 14

to identify him positively at the time the incident occurred. It is not uncommon

in a village setting to address most of the known males and females of the village

as uncle () and aunty () etc. This may be the very reason why the child

has described the perpetrator as uncle (). I am of the view that the evidence

of the victim child has been cogent and trustworthy to the effect that she had no

issue in identifying the appellant when the incident occurred.

The appeal under consideration is not an incident where the victim only had a

fleeting glance at the perpetrator to consider Turnbull Guidelines set in the case

of Regina Vs. Turnbull (1977) Q.B.224 as relevant.

In the case of Segera Vs. The Attorney General (2011) 1 SLR 201 was case

the question of identity of the accused had been discussed. It was held:

The identification was not in a difficult circumstance or in a multitude of

persons in a crowd or in a fleeting moment. To apply Turnbull principles, the

identification had to be made under difficult circumstances.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no basis for the argument that the

identification of the appellant was doubtful.

In his submissions before the Court, the learned Counsel for the appellant stated

that since the incident was said to have occurred in a place where several other

houses are situated, if the child screamed as claimed by her in her evidence,

there was no reason for the neighbours not hear her screams. It was also

submitted that the police have failed to record statements from her friends who

were said to be playing along with her and any other members of the household

of the house where the appellant was alleged to have been seated before he took

the child away. It was also contended that the evidence of the victim childs

mother was not led at the trial, although she was listed as PW-03 in the

indictment.

It was pointed out that the police have recorded the victim childs fathers

statement more than 1 year after the incident. It was further argued that the

Page 8 of 14

alleged history of the incident narrated by the child to the JMO could not be

considered since it is clear that it was the mother of the child who has given the

history to the doctor. The learned Counsel pointed out the evidence of the victim

child in that regard which appears at page 86 of the appeal brief to support his

contention.

The learned Counsel also invited the Court to consider the failure by the

prosecution to call the mother of the victim child as a witness in terms of section

114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance in favour of the appellant.

In relation to the improbabilities raised as a ground of appeal, it was contended

that if the child was dragged by the appellant as claimed, there should have been

injuries on her and since there were no injuries, such a narrative cannot be

considered probable. In relation to the omissions as claimed, it was pointed out

that when questioned by the learned Counsel who represented the appellant at

the trial, the child has stated that as far as she can remember, she told the

uncles name to her father, whereas it has been pointed out that she has not

stated that in her police statement.

In the victim childs evidence, she has stated that when she refused to go with

the appellant, he took her despite her protests and when he removed her clothes

and started performing intercrural sex on her, she screamed. When the evidence

of the victim child is taken as a whole, it is clear that the screaming of a 6-and-

a-half-year-old child when a grown-up person subject her to intercrural sex, may

not be what one that can be expected to be heard by a person even a little

distance away from the place of the incident. The evidence is clear that the

incident has occurred in an abandoned house not frequented by the neighbours.

A person who is committing grave sexual abuse on a child or any sexual act done

without consent would normally make sure that his actions are not being

witnessed by anyone, else unless it is an unexpected sighting by a witness. I

have no basis to agree that the childs evidence in that regard was improbable or

not trustworthy merely because no one has heard her screams.

Page 9 of 14

I find no basis to consider the alleged failure of the police investigators to record

statements from the friends of the victim child with whom she had been playing

at the time of the incident or members of the relevant household, as a reason to

doubt the evidence of the victim child or to conclude that the prosecution has

failed to prove the charges.

The evidence of the child is clear that after the incident, she came home and

informed her father about what happened. Thereafter, the father has taken the

child to the police and the statement of the child has been promptly recorded by

the police officers in that regard. Although it appears that the victim childs

fathers statement has been recorded after a lapse of more than 1 year from the

incident, the said lapse by the part of the investigating officers cannot be

attributed as a doubt in relation to the evidence led at the Court. The evidence

of the victim child as well as her father corroborates the sequence of events and

are consistent with each other.

I find no basis to doubt the evidence of both the witnesses. The evidence clearly

establishes the fact that when these incidents occurred, the mother of the victim

child was not at home and she was unaware of the incident and would not be

able to say anything relevant to the incident proper, other than staying with the

child at the hospital. Therefore, I find no reason to consider the failure of the

prosecution to call her as a witness in terms of section 114 illustration (f) of the

Evidence Ordinance as there is no basis to consider if produced, such evidence

would be unfavourable to the prosecutions case.

When it comes to a history of an incident narrated to a JMO or any other Medical

Officer as to an incident, it is settled law that such a history does not amount to

corroboration, but a matter of consistency as to the evidence of the relevant

witnesses.

Page 10 of 14

In the case of D. Tikiribanda Vs. The Attorney General- Bar Association Law

Reports 2010 BLR 92, it was held;

When the medical report is consistent with the version of a sexually

harassed victim, it can be taken as evidence consistent and thus form to

some extent corroboration and is admissible under section 157 of the

Evidence Ordinance (although that may not be corroboration in the strict

sense.)

In the matter under appeal, the child under cross-examination at page 86 of the

appeal brief, when the learned Counsel for the appellant asked the question who

spoke to the doctor?, has stated that it was the mother.

However, the evidence of PW-15, the JMO who examined the child has been to

the effect that it was the child who narrated the history to him. The JMO has

given clear evidence as to the history given by the victim child to him, which was

very much consistent to the evidence of PW-01 at the trial. When the JMO was

cross-examined by the same Counsel who represented the appellant, no

questions have been put to the JMO as to who narrated the history to him or to

say that it was the mother of the victim child who did so. The only question asked

had been to the effect that the victim child told the doctor that it was one uncle

( ) who did this to her and it was the guardian who was with the child

who informed the name of the person.

I am of the view that having failed to challenge the evidence of the JMO in that

regard, the appellant is not entitled to harp on what the child stated in her

evidence to argue that it was the mother who narrated the history to the doctor.

It is obvious that when a 6-and-a-half-year-old child is taken to a hospital, any

doctor would speak to his or her mother as well, to ascertain certain facts. I am

of the view that does not mean that the JMO has taken down the history from

the mother of the victim child since the JMO has given clear evidence in that

regard.

Page 11 of 14

There had been no material contradictions as to the evidence of any of the

witnesses who testified before the Court. The alleged omission highlighted during

the arguments of this matter, in my view, is not an omission that can be

described as a material omission which can be considered in favour of the

appellant.

It is my considered view that the evidence of PW-01 was cogent and trustworthy

which can be relied upon. Her evidence has been corroborated by the evidence

of PW-02 at material points. The victim child has been consistent as to what

happened to her when she gave the history of the matter to the JMO. The

investigating officers have confirmed the locations stated by the witness as to the

place of the offence. I am of the view that this is a case where the prosecution

has established the charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

Therefore, I find no merit in the considered grounds of appeal.

The 1st ground of appeal raised by the learned Counsel for the appellant was on

the basis that the learned High Court Judge has shifted the burden of proof and

therefore, was misdirected as to the relevant law when the appellant was

convicted.

In the judgement after having considered the evidence placed before the Court

and having analyzed the same, the learned High Court Judge has come to a firm

finding that the prosecution has established a strong prima facie case against

the appellant. Having determined so, the learned High Court Judge has

proceeded to consider the defence put forward by the appellant in order to find

whether it has created a reasonable doubt as to the evidence against him.

The learned High Court Judge has considered that the appellant has made only

a statement from the dock when he was called upon for a defence. He has also

considered the value that can be attached to such a dock statement which

amounts to a mere denial of the allegations against him.

Page 12 of 14

For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the contentious part of the judgment

which reads as follows.

.

Although the last sentences of the above-mentioned paragraph may give an

impression that the learned High Court Judge has shifted the burden to the

appellant, I find that such a contention would be misleading.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has used the wrong words when it was

stated that the appellant should have produced acceptable evidence to

substantiate his claim. However, it is clear that when considering the way the

learned High Court Judge has analyzed the dock statement, no such burden has

been placed on the appellant. The learned High Court Judge has considered not

only the dock statement, but also the evidence by the prosecution to come to a

firm finding that the stand taken up by the appellant has not created a doubt in

relation to the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.

I find that despite the comment as considered above, the learned High Court

Judge has correctly considered the relevant legal provisions in this regard. I am

of the view that the said alleged misdirection, if it can be termed as a

misdirection, has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the appellant or

Page 13 of 14

occasioned a failure of justice as the relevant legal principles has been correctly

adhered to by the learned High Court Judge.

The proviso of Article 138 of The Constitution which provides for the appellate

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in relation to the judgments pronounced by

the High Court reads as follows.

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any Court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

The corresponding section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979 reads as follows.

436. Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment

passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or

altered on appeal or revision on account

(a) of any error, omission, or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrant, charge, judgment, summing up, or other

proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other

proceedings under this Code; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135, unless

such error, omission, irregularity, or want has occasioned a

failure of justice.

For the afore-mentioned considerations, I am of the view that the alleged

misdirection has not caused any prejudice towards the appellant or has

occasioned a failure of justice towards him. Accordingly, I find no merit in the 1st

ground of appeal urged as well.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed. The conviction and the sentence dated 12-

09-2022 by the learned High Court Judge of Badulla is affirmed. However, having

Page 14 of 14

considered the fact the appellant has been in incarceration from his date of

conviction, it is ordered that his sentence shall deem to have commenced from

the said date of conviction and the sentence, that is from 12-09-2022.
