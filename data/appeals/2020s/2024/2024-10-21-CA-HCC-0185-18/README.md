Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the appellant) on the basis of being aggrieved of her conviction and the sentence

dated 27-04-2018 by the learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Colombo for trafficking 4.73

grams of Diacetylmorphine, which is a prohibited drug, commonly known as

Heroin, and thereby committing an offence in terms of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Amendment Act No. 13 of 2004,

which is an offence punishable in terms of the same Ordinance. The offence is

said to have been committed on 01-02-2014.

She was also indicted for having in her possession, the same quantity of the

drug, which is also an offence punishable in terms of the same Ordinance as

stated above.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Colombo found her guilty of the 2nd

count preferred against her, which was the charge of possession of Heroin. She

Page 3 of 11

was acquitted of the 1st count. Accordingly, after having considered the

aggravating and mitigatory circumstances, the learned High Court Judge

sentenced her to life imprisonment.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant, although he

has raised several grounds of appeal in his written submissions, confined his

grounds of appeal to the following.

1. The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the improbabilities in

the evidence adduced by the prosecution.

2. The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the dock statement of

the appellant in line with the defence version of events.

Before considering the above grounds of appeal, I find it appropriate to consider

the evidence led in this case in brief.

The Evidence in Brief

PW-01 was the Police Inspector who conducted this detection along with several

other subordinate officers. He was functioning as the Officer-in-Charge of the

Vice-Prevention Unit of the Colombo Crimes Division. On 01-02-2014, PW-01,

along with several other officers, including WPC 8041 Anusha, has left their unit,

which was situated in Dematagoda area. PW-01 had been wearing his official

uniform while all the other officers had been in civilian clothing. After making

the necessary entries and completing the relevant procedural steps, the team

has left in a white-coloured Dolphin Van belonging to the Police Department.

They have left the station at 10.00 a.m. for routine vice-prevention duties.

After travelling to several areas, the police team have come to the Technical

Junction in Colombo 12 from the direction of the Tower Hall theater, and has

turned left and had entered Adhikarana Mawatha, which was again to the left

side of Sangharaja Mawatha. They have stopped the vehicle in front of the temple

situated at Adhikarana Mawatha, and PW-01, along with the earlier mentioned

Page 4 of 11

WPC Anusha and several other officers, had gotten down from the vehicle and

had entered the Locket Lane situated to their right side.

While walking 2530 meters on that lane, PW-01 has observed a female coming

out of a house that was about 1015 feet away from them, and she, after walking

about 45 feet, turning and going towards the house again. This has arisen his

suspicion and he has immediately rushed towards the female along with the

other officers and had detained her. She had been a woman of about 40-50 years

of age, wearing a blue-coloured long dress. He had managed to stop her in front

of the veranda of the house, just in front of the main entrance.

After the detention, PW-01 has instructed WPC Anusha to search the female.

WPC Anusha has recovered a pink-coloured cellophane bag, which contained a

kind of a powder from the right-hand side pocket of the dress worn by the female.

The cellophane bag has had a knot on the top. When opened and inspected, PW-

01 has realized through his experience that the powder contained Heroin.

After the detection, he and his team had searched the house where they had not

been able to find anything incriminating. PW-01 has taken steps to place the

quantity of Heroin he found in an envelope and to keep it with him. At the time

of the raid, the only other inmate of the house had been a girl of about 9 years

of age. After the detection and the arrest of the female, whom PW-01 has

identified as the appellant at the trial, the police team had travelled to Dedigama

Pawning Center situated on the Baseline Road in order to weigh the contents.

When weighed using the electronic scale available at the pawning center, they

have found that the suspected parcel contained 15 grams and 100 milligrams.

Thereafter, PW-01 has taken steps to seal the productions in front of the

appellant, and had returned to the police station. According to the evidence of

PW-01, the police party has reached Adhikarana Mawatha at 16.15 hours and

the appellant had been arrested at 16.20 hours. After the search of the house,

weighing of the parcel and sealing the same, the police party has returned to

their police unit at 17.40 hours. PW-01 has taken steps to enter the suspected

Page 5 of 11

Heroin parcel under the PR number 159/2014 and handover it to the reserve

officer at the police station. After coming to his unit, he has entered his in-entry

at 17.50 hours. He has also taken steps to handover the suspect, who is the

appellant, to the police reserve and had directed one of his subordinate officers

to record her statement.

Subsequently, the appellant has been produced before the learned Magistrate of

Maligakanda and remanded. He has also taken steps to forward the detected

quantity of the suspected drug to the Government Analyst for a Report.

At the trial, the PW-01 has identified the productions recovered, and had marked

them accordingly.

The position taken up by the appellant while cross-examining PW-01 had been

that PW-01 and his team came to Locket Lane looking for a known drug dealer

called Lena Paba, and since they could not find her, believing that the appellant

is one of her associates, she was arrested, and the witness was uttering a

falsehood.

To corroborate the evidence of PW-01, the prosecution has called WPC 8041

Anusha, who was the officer who assisted PW-01 in the arrest. She has testified

to the effect that she, along with the team led by PW-01, went on routine patrol

duty on the day relevant to this detection, and came to the road that leads to

Locket Lane. She has stated that after parking their vehicle in front of the temple,

they walked towards the Locket Lane where she has observed a female coming

out of a house and turning back. She has corroborated the evidence of PW-01 as

to the detention of the female on suspicion and says that upon the orders given

by PW-01, she searched the female and found a parcel in a pink-coloured

cellophane bag in the right-hand side pocket of the dress worn by the female.

When the parcel was given to PW-01, he has inspected the contents and had

confirmed that the parcel contained Heroin.

She has also given evidence to corroborate the subsequent steps taken by PW-

01 and his team to weigh the productions and handover the female arrested and

Page 6 of 11

the productions to the police. She has testified that she was a witness for all the

procedural steps as well. At the trial, she has identified the productions and has

also identified the appellant as the female she searched and recovered the parcel

of Heroin.

Under cross-examination, the witness has admitted that she has not made

detailed notes about the routes she and her team took on that day, before coming

near the lane where the raid took place, but has taken up the stand that it is

usually the officer who leads the team who takes such notes.

The defence has made the same suggestion to the witness as well, denying that

the appellant had any Heroin. The witness has stated that the appellant was

arrested because Heroin was detected from her possession.

The Government Analyst who has given evidence as PW-15 has confirmed that

the Government Analyst received the sealed parcel containing a substance

suspected to be Heroin on 03-02-2014 and she did the analysis on 21-02-2014.

When weighing the gross quantity of the contents, it has shown a weight of 14.73

grams which was different to the gross weight stated by PW-01, who says that

when he got the contents weighed at Dedigama Pawning Center, it showed a

weight of 15.1 grams. However, the Government Analyst has clearly explained

the probable reasons for such a small weight difference that can occur due to

various factors, but has stated that since the Government Analyst weighed the

productions under strict laboratory conditions, the accurate weight can vary in

this manner. After analysis, the Government Analyst has found 4.73 grams of

pure Heroin in the parcel sent to the Government Analyst Department. The

Government Analyst has identified the productions sent to the Department at

the trial confirming that it was she who analyzed the contents.

At the trial, the accused had admitted the chain of custody of productions from

the time of detection, and accordingly, that fact has been recorded as an

admission in terms of section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

At the conclusion of the prosecution evidence, the learned High Court Judge has

decided to call for a defence of the appellant where she has made a dock

statement. In her dock statement, the position taken up by her had been that

while she was watching TV in her house on 01-02-2014, a police team along with

a female police officer came and inquired from her as to the house of Lena Paba,

and she told them that her house is about 4 or 5 houses away from hers. It had

been her position that the police insisted she is the one who was hiding Lena

Paba and she should help them to locate her, and took her into custody. She has

claimed that after she was taken to the police station, she was questioned and

was unaware of what was written. She has also claimed that it was only after

she was produced before the Maligakanda Magistrates Court, she came to know

that Heroin has been introduced to her.

The Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

With the above facts in mind, I will now proceed to consider the grounds of appeal

urged by the learned Counsel on behalf of the appellant.

In the 1st ground of appeal, the learned Counsel urged that the learned High

Court Judge has failed to consider the inconsistencies and improbabilities in the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses. Although the learned Counsel claimed

that there are improbabilities in the version of events as stated by prosecution

witnesses, I am unable to find a reason to agree with such a contention.

The evidence of PW-01 and 02 is to the effect that the police team led by PW-01

left their station around 10.00 a.m. for usual vice-prevention duties and after

travelling to several areas, reached the place where the detection was made. I do

not find PW-09 not making detailed entries as to the other places where they

travelled during the day in her notes as to this raid as a major discrepancy in

her evidence.

At no stage of the trial, the appellant has not denied that the team of police

officers led by PW-01 including PW-09 came to Locket Lane where she was

arrested. In fact, it was an admitted fact, the only difference being the claim that

Page 8 of 11

the appellant was inside the house when the police team arrived at her house.

Therefore, based on that admission, as viewed correctly by the learned High

Court Judge, any minor discrepancy as to where the police team travelled during

the day would have no impact whatsoever in the evidence of PW-01 and 09.

It was contended that the piece of evidence in relation to the way the appellant

has come and attempted to turn back was not probable. It was claimed that if

that was the case, she should have either attempted to run away or throw away

whatever she was carrying.

However, the clear evidence of PW-01 as well as that of PW-09 in that regard had

been that they saw the appellant at a very close range coming out of her house,

walking a few feet towards them and turning back after seeing them. PW-01 says

that there was no room for the appellant to run away or throw away what she

was carrying due to the close proximity of the appellant to PW-01 and his team,

and they were able to apprehend her within few seconds of their suspicions being

raised. Under the circumstances, it is my considered view that unlike in a case

where there was some distance between the raiding party and the suspect when

a suspect sees the raiding party, a person who meets a police team at a very

close range cannot be expected to have the ability to run away or throw whatever

he or she was carrying which can be easily observed by the police party or raise

their suspicions to a higher level.

Therefore, I am unable to agree the earlier considered piece of evidence as

improbable. The learned Counsel raised the question whether a police party

would leave a 9-year-old child at home, virtually abandoning her without a

guardian as stated by PW-01. However, the evidence is that when they arrested

the appellant, there was a girl child who was about 9 years of age at the house.

Nowhere in the evidence or in the dock statement of the appellant, she has

claimed that the child was left abandoned by the police after her arrest, which

means that the child has been taken care by someone else after the raid.

Page 9 of 11

I am unable to find anything unusual in PW-09 not proceeding to body search

the appellant any further after she recovered a parcel from the right-side pocket

of the dress the appellant was wearing. After the finding, the police team has

searched her house which is also not unusual.

It was contended that the appellant has consistently maintained her defence that

the police party came looking for someone else, and when they could not find

her, the appellant was arrested instead.

The fact the defence version being consistent is not a reason to doubt the

prosecution evidence. I find that the learned High Court Judge has considered

the evidence being very well mindful of the legal requirement that it was the

prosecution who should prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The learned

High Court Judge has well considered the argued improbabilities of the version

of events, but has concluded with sound reasoning that the claimed

improbabilities cannot have a bearing on the prosecution case or has not created

a reasonable doubt.

The learned High Court Judge has considered the defence in order to determine

whether it has created a reasonable doubt as to the prosecution case or at least

has provided a reasonable explanation, as to the prosecution case.

I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge has correctly determined on

the relevant questions of law that he should have considered and the facts of the

matter in its correct perspective when analyzing the evidence placed before the

Court.

As correctly stated by the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) who

represented the Hon. Attorney General, beyond reasonable doubt does not mean

beyond any fanciful doubt.

Page 10 of 11

In the case of State of Punjab Vs. Karnail Singh (2003) 11 SCC 271, it was

held:

Exaggerated devotion to the rule of benefit of doubt must not nurture

fanciful doubts or lingering suspicion and thereby destroy social defence.

Justice cannot be made sterile on the plea that it is better to let hundred

guilty escape, than punish an innocent. Letting guilty escape is not doing

justice according to law. Prosecution is not required to meet any and every

hypothesis put forward by the accused. A reasonable doubt is not an

imaginary, trivial or merely possible doubt, but a fair doubt based upon

reason and common sense. It must grow out of the evidence in the case. If a

case is proved perfectly, it is argued that it is artificial; if a case has some

flaws inevitable because human beings are prone to err, it is argued that it

is too imperfect. One wonders whether in the meticulous hypersensitivity to

eliminate a rare innocent from being punished, many guilty persons must

be allowed to escape. Proof beyond reasonable doubt is a guideline, not a

fetish. Vague hunches cannot take place of judicial evaluation. A Judge

does not preside over a criminal trial, merely to see that no innocent man is

punished. A Judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape.

Both are public duties. (Per Viscount Simon in Stirland Vs. Director of Public

Prosecution (1944 AC(PC) 315) quoted in State of U.P. Vs. Anil Singh (AIR

1988 SC 1998). Doubts would be called reasonable if they are free from a

zest for abstract speculation. Law cannot afford any favourite other than

truth.

In the case of Ramakant Rai Vs. Madan Rai AIR 2004 SC at 84, it was stated,

A person has, no doubt, a profound right not to be convicted of an offence

which is not established by the evidential standard of proof beyond

reasonable doubt. Though this standard is a higher standard, there is,

however no absolute standard. What degree of probability amounts to

proof is an exercise particular to each case. Doubts would be called

Page 11 of 11

reasonable if they are free from a zest for abstract speculation. Law cannot

afford any favorite other than truth. To constitute reasonable doubt, it must

be free from an over emotional response. Doubts must be actual and

substantial doubts as to the guilt of the accused persons arising from the

evidence, or from the lack of it, as opposed to mere vague apprehensions. A

reasonable doubt is not an imaginary trivial or a merely possible doubt: but

a fair doubt based upon reason and common sense. It must grow out of the

evidence in the case. The concepts of probability, and the degree of it, cannot

obviously be expressed in terms of units to be mathematically enumerated

as to how many of such units constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt.

There is an unmistakable subjective element in the evaluation of the degrees

of probability and the quantum of proof. Forensic probability must, in the

last analysis, rest on a robust common sense and ultimately, on the trained

intuitions of the Judge. While the protection given by the criminal proceeds

to the accused persons is not to be eroded, at the same time, uninformed

legitimization of trivialities would make a mockery of administration of

criminal justice.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the grounds of appeal

urged. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The sentence and the conviction

dated 27-04-2018 affirmed.
