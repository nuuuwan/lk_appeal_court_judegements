JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam J

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted for committing the murder of Uduwarage Wijesiri

Silva on 13/03/2002 which is an offence punishable under Section 296 of

the Penal Code.

After a non-jury trial, the learned High Court Judge had found the Appellant

guilty of the charge and had sentenced him to death on 02/07/2020.

The Prosecution had called PW1, PW2, PW3, PW4, PW7, PW9, PW10 and the

Court Interpreter to substantiate their case. As the evidence of the

prosecution warranted a case to be answered, the learned High Court Judge

had called for the defence. The Appellant had given evidence from the witness

box and called five witnesses on his behalf.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

CA/HCC/146/20

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. At the time of

argument, the Appellant was connected via zoom from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant only a single ground of appeal is raised. According

to the Counsel for the Appellant, it is the failure on the part of the Trial Judge

to properly evaluate the defence evidence with regard to the plea of

Cumulative Provocation.

Background of the Case

The incident had occurred at PW2s new house which was under

construction. According to PW2, when the deceased was seated on the

veranda of the house and where other workers were having lunch, the

Appellant, had gone there with a pole and dealt a blow to the deceaseds

head. As a result, the deceased had fallen face downwards onto the floor.

This was witnessed by PW4, a passerby in the vicinity who had questioned

the Appellant before the assault as to why he was carrying a club. After the

attack, the Appellant dragged the deceased to an adjacent land. PW3, a

neighbour of the location also had seen the Appellant dragging the deceased

to the adjacent land. The witnesses who saw the assault and the accused

dragging the deceased to the adjacent land had not witnessed nor heard

anything from the adjacent land.

PW1, the father of the deceased had lodged the first complaint at the police

station. Police arrived at the scene and conducted the investigation. The

investigator had discovered the deceaseds body in the adjacent land with a

rock placed on the head. The Appellant was arrested and an iron rod was

recovered upon his statement under Section 27(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

CA/HCC/146/20

4 | P a g e

The post mortem examination revealed that the deceaseds body had seven

lacerations and two contusions. According to the findings of PW10, the JMO

who held the post mortem examination, injury number 04 on the head and

injury number 07 on the chest were fatal in nature.

The Counsel for the Appellant takes up the position that the case against the

Appellant should have been considered in combination with the plea of

cumulative provocation and that he should have been convicted not for

murder but for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section

297 of the Penal Code.

According to exception 1 of Section 294 of the Penal Code;

Culpable Homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the

power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death

of the person who gave the provocation, or causes the death of any other

person by mistake or accident

The explanation under this exception read as that;

Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the

offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.

Although the Counsel for the Appellant seeks relief for lesser culpability on

the plea of cumulative provocation, on perusal of the evidence led before the

High Court no evidence of sudden fight elicited either from the evidence of

the prosecution nor from the defence evidence. According to Section 105 of

the Evidence Ordinance it is the responsibility of the Appellant to prove the

existence of a general or special exception during the trial on a balance of

probabilities. In the absence the learned trial Judge should direct his mind

to the circumstances and the fact that the Appellant is entitled to have the

benefit of the lesser verdict.

CA/HCC/146/20

In The King v Bellana Vithanage Eddin 41 NLR 345 the court held that:

"In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury

the alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide

not amounting to murder when there is any basis for such a

finding in the evidence on record, although such defence was not

raised nor relied upon by the accused.

It is very important at this stage to discuss the development of law regarding

the acceptance of cumulative provocation as a special exception to a murder

charge in our jurisdiction.

In Premalal v Attorney General [2000] 2 SLR 403 Kulatilaka,J held that:

Until the judgment of Chief Justice H.N.G Fernando in Samithamby v

Queen (1) (de Krester,J-dissenting) our court followed a strict view in

applying Exception (1) set out in Section 294 of the Penal Code. Our judges

following their counterparts in England interpreted the phrase sudden

provocation to mean that provocation should consist of a single act which

occurred immediately before killing so that there was no time for the anger

to cool and the act must have been such that it would have made a

reasonable man to react in the manner as the accused did. Our Courts

were reluctant to take into consideration any special circumstances which

manifested in the particular offenders case.

Kulatilaka, J. further held that:

Of late we observe a development in other jurisdictions where Courts and

juries have taken a more pragmatic view of the mitigatory plea of

provocation. In a series of cases in applying the mitigatory plea of

provocation Courts took into consideration the prior course of relationship

between the accused and his victim.

CA/HCC/146/20

6 | P a g e

In W. A. Gamini v Attorney General CA/142/2009 the court held that:

the chain of stressful events in the troubled relationship of the accused

and the deceased culminating in the aforesaid unfortunate incident, are

probable reasonably sufficient to entertain a plea of continuing or

cumulative provocation because the accused retaliated at the spur of the

moment and that he could reasonably show that he was deprived of his

self-control.

Citing the above two judgments His Lordship Jayantha Jayasuriya C.J. in R.

W. Nandana Senarathbandara v Attorney General SC/Appeal/32/2015

decided on 17/07/2020 has held that:

Jurisprudence referred to above demonstrate that in considering the plea

of grave and sudden provocation an accused is entitled to rely upon a

series of prior events that ultimately led to the incident at which the death

was caused. A court should not restrict its focus to an isolated incident

that resulted in the death, in considering a plea of grave and sudden

provocation. The aforementioned jurisprudence has widened the scope of

this plea by expanding the limitations recognized in its statutory form.

Thereby, the concept of Continuing or Cumulative provocation has been

recognized as a plea coming within the purview of the plea of grave and

sudden provocation recognized under Exception-1, section 294 of the Penal

Code. Therefore, the proximity of time between the actus reus of the

accused and the provocative act of the victim should be considered in the

context of the nature and circumstances in each case, in deciding whether

an accused is entitled to the benefit of the plea of Grave and Sudden

Provocation.

CA/HCC/146/20

7 | P a g e

Further His Lordship in R. W. M. Nandana Senarathbandara v Attorney

General (Supra) has cited an Indian Judgment to explain how the concept

of Sustained Provocation has been recognised and developed by the Indian

superior courts.

In Poovammal v State 2012 (2) MLJ (Crl.) 482 the court held:

30. Under the English Criminal Law, the provocation must be grave and

also sudden. But, by way of judicial thinking, the Indian Criminal Law has

gone ahead. (K. M. NANAVATHI Vs STATE OF MAHARASTRA [A.I.R.) 1962

S.C. 605). In our system, there is the concept of Sustained Provocation. It

is concerned with the duration of the provocation. There may be

incidents/occurrences, which are such that they may not make the

offender suddenly to make his outburst by his overt act. However, it may

be lingering in his mind for quite some time, torment continuously and at

one point of time erupt, make him to lose his self-control, make his mind to

go astray, the mind may not be under his control/command and results in

the offender committing the offence. The sustained provocation/frustration

nurtured in the mind of the accused reached the end of breaking point,

under that accused causes the murder of the deceased.

.

34. In SUYAMBUKKANI Vs STATE OF TAMIL NADU [1989 LW (Crl.) 86], it

is held as under: - Though there has been here and there attempts in those

decisions to bring the sustained provocation under Exception-1 to Section

300, I.P.C., there is a cardinal difference between provocation as defined

under Exception-1 and sustained provocation. The only word which is

common is provocation. What Exception-1 contemplates is a grave and

sudden provocation, whereas the ingredient of sustained provocation is a

series of acts more or less grave spread over a certain period of time, the

last of which acting as the last straw breaking the camels back may even

be a very trifling one. We are, therefore, far from grave and sudden

CA/HCC/146/20

8 | P a g e

provocation contemplated under Exception-1 to Section 300, I.P.C.

Sustained provocation is undoubtedly an addition by Courts, as

anticipated by the architects of the Indian Penal Code.

Considering the above cited judgments and the facts of this case I `now

consider whether it is appropriate to consider the plea of cumulative

provocation under Exception-1 to Section 294 of the Penal Code under the

present circumstances.

In this case, according to the prosecution the Appellant had arrived with a

pole and assaulted the deceased who was just seated on the floor of the newly

constructed house of PW2. No iota of evidence surfaced that the deceased

had provoked the Appellant at that time. PW2 in his evidence stated when

he questioned the Appellant whether he was going to assault the deceased,

the Appellant had replied that he not only had come to assault the deceased

but to kill him as well. PW4 had heard the conversation which happened

between PW2 and the Appellant. Hence, it is quite clear when the Appellant

had assaulted the deceased, the deceased did not do anything in response

towards the Appellant.

Now I consider the evidence given by PW3, a neighbour who had seen the

Appellant dragging the deceased to the nearby land. While she was

witnessing this, the Appellant had shouted not to divulge.

PW9, the investigating officer stated that a large rock was placed over the

face of the deceased. According to PW10, the JMO one of the fatal lacerations

was noted on the head of the deceased. Although it was revealed that the

deceased was an Island Reconvicted Criminal (IRC) but at the time of the

incident the deceased had not been involved in brawls with anybody.

In the evidence given by the Appellant and his witnesses made a desperate

attempt to show that the incident had happened due to cumulative

provocation orchestrated by the deceased.

CA/HCC/146/20

9 | P a g e

The Appellant had told court that the deceased used to harass his father.

But the Appellant admitted that he had not made any complaint to the police

in this regard. Further, the Appellant had alleged that deceased had killed a

rooster belonging to his father as such a dispute existed between his father

and the deceased. But here too neither the Appellant nor his father lodged

any complaints with the police.

The defence witnesses brought forth evidence of bad character in relation to

the deceased. But there was no single complaint lodged against the deceased

either by the Appellant or defence witnesses or anybody in the village.

Ashworth in 1975 Criminal LR 558-559 opines as follows:

The significance of the deceaseds final act should be considered by

reference to the previous relations between the parties, taking into

account any previous incidents which add colour to the final act .

The point is that the significance of the deceaseds final act and its effect

upon the accused-and indeed the relation of the retaliation to that act-

can be neither understood nor evaluated without reference to previous

dealings between the parties.

In R. W. M. Nandana Senarathbandara v Attorney General (Supra) His

Lordship further held that:

Therefore, for an accused to succeed in a plea of Grave and sudden

provocation on the basis of continuing or cumulative provocation, the court

on a balance of probability should be satisfied that the accused had gone

through a state of continued mental stress and agony during the gap

between the provocative conduct and the fatal attack.

Upon the analysis of the evidence presented in this case it clearly

demonstrates that the events and the strained relationship of the Appellant

and the deceased had not resulted in the unfortunate incident. The learned

High Court Judge had very correctly considered the evidence presented and

CA/HCC/146/20

10 | P a g e

defence taken, had correctly refused to award the benefit to the Appellant

under the said mitigatory plea.

Considering all the circumstances stressed before this court I conclude that

this is not an appropriate case in which the Appellant should be given the

benefit of a plea of cumulative provocation under Exception-1 to Section 294

of the Penal Code.

Therefore, he is guilty of murder as charged. I affirm the conviction and the

sentence and dismiss this appeal.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to High Court of Kalutara

along with the original case record.
