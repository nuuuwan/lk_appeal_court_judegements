Introduction

1) The Petitioner-Appellant had preferred this appeal against the

Respondent-Respondents, seeking to set aside the Order made by

the Provincial High Court Judge of North Western Province and to

enter a Judgement endorsing the relief prayed in the original

petition to the Provincial High Court.

2) The reliefs prayed for in the instant appeal are as follows;

a) To set aside the Judgment/Order dated 2019.07.19 of the

Provincial High Court of North Western Province

C.A. (PHC) 221-19

b) To enter the Judgment endorsing the relief prayed in the

original petition to the Provincial high Court

c) To grant costs, and

d) To grant such other and further reliefs

Facts of this case

3) The Petitioner-Appellant is hereinafter referred to as Appellant and

the Respondent-Respondents as Respondents.

4) The Appellant was an employee at the 1st Respondent, Kurunegala

Co-operative Hospital Society Limited, as an attendant. The

Appellant had been charged with certain misconduct that had

occurred at the 1st Respondent Hospital. Thereafter, the charge

sheet had been served to the Appellant.

5) The initial charges had been subsequently amended, and a charge

sheet containing four charges had been served to the Appellant

subsequently.

6) On that, a preliminary inquiry had been conducted by the 2nd

Respondent, who imposed penalties following the said inquiry

resulting in the Appellant being sent on compulsory retirement.

7) Aggrieved by the said decision the Appellant had made an appeal

to the 4th Respondent the Co-operative employees Commission of

North Western Province.

8) The 4th Respondent also found the Appellant guilty of the charges

at the appeal inquiry and the compulsory retirement was endorsed.

9) The position taken by the Appellant is that, prior to amending the

charges the charge No.3 was raised on the basis that when a

patient named Peshala Herath was discharged, the Appellant had

C.A. (PHC) 221-19

5

failed to accompany the patient in a wheelchair to the patients

vehicle. The main grievance of the Appellant was although the said

charge was dropped later; the said Peshala Herath was one of the

Co-operative Employees Commission member who had affirmed

the permanent retirement of the Appellant at the 4th Respondents

meeting held on 26th April 2017.

10) On the said grounds the Appellant had filed a Writ/Revision

application to the Provincial High Court of Kurunegala, which was

dismissed by the Learned High Court Judge.

11) Aggrieved by the said decision the Appellant had preferred this

appeal.

Analysis of the Facts of the case

12) This case was taken up for argument on 19th June 2024. Counsel

for the Appellant and the Deputy Solicitor General appearing for

the Respondents concluded the argument.

13) As per the argument raised by the Appellant and on perusal of the

documents the following disputed points should be considered.

(i) Have the Respondents framed the initial charge sheet,

raising charge No.3 which related to a member of the 4th

Respondent Commission?

(ii) If so, can the decision taken by the 4th Respondent on 26th

April 2017 be maintained?

I) Have the Respondents framed the initial charge sheet,

raising charge No.3 related to a member of the 4th

Respondent Commission?

14) I reproduce the initial charge sheet framed against the Appellant.

C.A. (PHC) 221-19

15) It is evident from the said charge sheet No.3 refers to an individual

named Peshala Sarangi. Notably, the Gazette Notification No.

1936/43 dated 15th October 2015 specifies that the Attorney-at-

Law Peshala Sarangi had been appointed as a member of the 4th

Respondent from 1st October 2015 to 1st October 2018.

16) The said Gazette notification is reproduced as follows;

C.A. (PHC) 221-19

17) Although as per the Commission regulations, the minimum

Quorum of the 4th Respondents meetings can be maintained as

two. However, the meeting held by the 4th Respondent dated 26th

April 2017 three members named in the aforesaid Gazette

notification had participated and confirmed the inquiry appeal

decision to send the Appellant on permanent retirement.

18) To support the aforesaid fact, I draw my attention to page number

04 of the Co-operative Employee Commission Regulations of the

North Western Province No 05 of 1995 and it is reproduced as

follows;

C.A. (PHC) 221-19

10

19) It would be apparent to any prudent person that the 4th

Respondent Commission member Attorney-at-Law Peshala

Sarangis name had transpired on the initial charge sheet in

charge No.3. Therefore, it is my considered view that she should

not have participated at the meeting held to confirm the permanent

retirement of the Appellant.

20) The Learned High Court Judge had not considered the said fact

when she heard the revision application, her view was that the

Appellant was initially convicted on four charges and the said

Peshala Sarangi had acted in accordance with the guidance of the

3rd Respondent.

21) It is not a reasonable decision made by the Learned High Court

Judge knowing that the said Peshala Sarangi was the Complainant

against the Appellant as per the initial charge sheet.

II) If so, can the decision taken by the 4th Respondent on

26th April 2017 be maintained?

22) In view of the aforesaid facts, documents and the Gazette

notification, the decision taken by the 4th Respondent on 26th April

2017 cannot be sustained.

23) Thus, I set aside the order made by the Learned High Court Judge

dated 19th July 2019 and set aside the decision taken by the 4th

Respondent on 26th April 2017.

24) Further, it is evident that the inquiry panel had conducted the

inquiry against the Appellant with the knowledge that there had

been a charge initially against the Appellant by a member of the 4th

Respondent Commission.

25) As per the Co-operative Employee Commission Regulations of the

North Western Province No 05 of 1995 the appeal inquiry had been

C.A. (PHC) 221-19

11

conducted under the purview of the 4th Respondent Commission as

the Commission is in charge of all the disciplinary inquiry

procedures. It is abundantly clear the person who conducted the

appeal inquiry would have been biased towards the initial charge

sheet issued against the Appellant which included a charge related

to a Commission member.

26) Therefore, the decision of the appeal inquiry cannot be sustained

as the appeal inquiry had been held during the period when

Attorney at-Law Peshala Sarangi was a member of the 4th

Respondent Commission.

27) In the said circumstances, I hereby set aside the appeal inquiry

dated 27th January 2017 and direct the 1st Respondent to conduct

a fresh inquiry as the 4th Respondent Commission members period

is presently completed.

CONCLUSION

28) As per the facts related, I allow the appeal and set aside the High

Court Judges order dated 19th July 2019, 4th Respondent

commissions decisions dated 26th April 2017 and the inquiry

appeal decision dated 27 January 2017, and fix tax cost payable

by the Respondents to the Appellant.
