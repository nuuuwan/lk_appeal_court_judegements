Petitioner for the Supra Grade (v) as a Secretary in the 1st Respondent Company.

The facts of this matter briefly are as follows,

The Petitioner joined the 1st Respondent Company in the year of 1993 as a

secretary ( Grade III) and got promoted to grade II in the year of 1998 and to

grade I in the year 1999.

Thereafter on 01.08.2011 a new scheme of Recruitment and Promotion ( SORP)

for the secretaries has been introduced by the management of the 1st Respondent

named Supra Grade (v). The Petitioner states that, by that time, the Petitioner

had completed her service of 12 Years in the 1st Respondent Company as a

Secretary.

Accordingly, the 1st Respondent Company called for applications for the relevant

promotion and the selection for such promotion comprised of two tests namely

the Trade Test consisting the Competitive Test and Oral Test. Since the

Petitioner was eligible for the promotion, she sent her application and sat for

both English written test and the computer test. The Petitioner states that, she

was remained with the oral test and by that time she had taken leave to go

abroad and she had expected an email or a phone call regarding the oral test.

Furthermore, the Petitioner states that she was not informed about the marks

she obtained at the English written test and computer test, where the 1st

Respondent Company has failed to disclose her marks.

On the other hand, the 1st Respondent states in its statement of objections that

only those who were successful in the competitive tests were called for the oral

examination/ interview. According to the Company Circular No. AP/177 and

Notice issued on 01.09.2011 the 1st Respondent had informed the candidates that

they should obtain a minimum pass mark of 60% for the English and Computer

tests and the candidates who were successful in the aforementioned tests were

only informed about the Oral tests. Furthermore, the 1st Respondent states that

as a policy they does not disclose any results to any candidate at any

examination. However, the Respondent has sent a letter to the Petitioner on

08.03.2012 informing that she has not been successful at the tests which she sat

in 2011. According to the Respondent, the Petitioner has participated for the

Page 4 of 5

said promotion exams held on 14th and 23rd November and as per the results the

Petitioner has obtained 65 marks for the computer test and 49 marks for the

English Test. As a result, she couldnt participate in the oral exam. The

Respondent further states that they have not unjustifiably or unreasonably

prevented the Petitioner from participating the oral exam. These facts were

considered by the Arbitrator.

Several years later, after retirement, the Petitioner had made a complaintto the

Labour Office- Negamboand subsequently the dispute was referred for an

Arbitration.The Learned Arbitrator by her order dated 22.09.2022 had come to a

conclusion that the Petitioner had not obtained sufficient marks to the eligibility

to participate in the oral exam. Furthermore she held that the 1st Respondent

had not acted maliciously or arbitrarily towards the promotion of the Petitioner.

The relevant excerpt from the said order of the Arbitrator dated 22.09.2022 is

reproduced for ease of reference.

We hold that the Arbitrator has clearly identified the issues with her judicial

mind and has applied the rules of natural justice and has analyzed the evidence

placed before her correctly. There is no reason for us to disregard her decision.

According to the above said reasons we dismiss this application without costs.
