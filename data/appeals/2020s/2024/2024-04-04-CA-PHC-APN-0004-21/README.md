JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Complainant-Respondent (Hereinafter referred to as the

Complainant) filed a charge sheet against the 1-6 Accused under

Section 25(2) read with Sections 40(1) (a) (b) and 40(2) of the Forest

CA (PHC) APN 04/2021

Ordinance for transporting 09 Jack Trunks worth about Rs.21,921.25

using a vehicle bearing No. 41-0073 without a valid permit for such

transportation.

The charge sheet was filed against the 1-6 Accused in the Magistrate

Court of Embilipitiya. As the 1-6 Accused pleaded guilty to the charge

sheet, the Learned Magistrate of Embilipitiya had convicted the Accused

persons and imposed a fine of Rs.25000/- each and fixed for an inquiry

to confiscate the Vehicle bearing No. 41-0073.

At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate had decided to

confiscate the aforesaid vehicle by his order dated 28.03.2019. At the

inquiry the Petitioner, the 1st and 2nd Accused and person called Sunil

Shantha had given evidence on his behalf.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Magistrate, the Appellant filed a

revision application in the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa-

Province Holden at Embilipitiya to revise the order of the Magistrate of

Embilipitiya. After an inquiry, the Learned High Court Judge had

dismissed the said revision application and affirmed the order of

Learned Magistrate of Embilipitiya by her order dated 28.03.2019.

Now the Petitioner filed this Revision to set aside the order of the

Learned High Court Judge of Sabaragamuwa-Province Holden at

Embilipitiya dated 10/12/2020 as well as the order of the Learned

Magistrate of Embilipitiya.

The Petitioner is the father of the 1st Accused in the Magistrate Court

case No. 40290/16. At the inquiry the Petitioner had taken up the

position that he was never convicted for any offence. The Petitioner had

the custody of the key of the vehicle and only given to 1st Accused to

transport his merchandise when needed.

On 18.10.2016 the 1st Accused had taken the vehicle to transport some

bricks to Debarayaya. On his way he had met 3-6 Accused who were

trying to carry the logs to a carpenter and upon being urged to tender a

helping hand, helped the 3-6 Accused to move the logs to the carpenter

at which point they were arrested. The Petitioner had told Court that he

was completely unaware of the commission of the offence and he had

taken all necessary precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence.

At the very outset, in keeping with the highest traditions of the Attorney

Generals Department, the Senior State Counsel informed this Court

that the Hon. Attorney General is not supporting the confiscation order

of the Learned Magistrate of Embilipitiya having considered the facts

and the circumstances that led to the confiscation.

Considering all these matters into careful consideration, I set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya dated 10.12.2020

and the order of Learned Magistrate Court of Embilipitiya dated

28.03.2019.

Therefore, this appeal is allowed.

I direct that the vehicle No. 41-0073 be released to the Petitioner.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgement to the

High Court of Embilipitiya and the Magistrate Court of Embilipitiya.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.

I agree.
