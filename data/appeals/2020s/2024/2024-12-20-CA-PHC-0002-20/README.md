2) The dispute had arisen in the instant action under Section 66 of the

C.A. (PHC) 02 - 2020

(i) Issue Notice on the 1st Party Respondent-Respondent-

Respondent;

(ii) Set aside the Order dated 31.01.2020 in Central Province

Provincial High Court of Kandy Case No. Revision 107/2018;

(iii)Set aside the Order dated 15.10.2018 in Magistrates Court

Kandy Case No 11424/2018;

(iv) Make Order that the 2nd Party Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant is

entitled to possession of the land in question under Act No.44 of

1979;

(v) Grants costs, and

(vi) Such other and further reliefs.

Facts of this case

4) The Appellant had contended that proceedings were held between the

Appellant and the 1st Party Respondent-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) under Section 66 of Primary

Courts Procedure Act No 44 of 1979 before the Magistrates Court of

Kandy after facts were reported by the officer in charge of Kathugastota

Police Station.

5) The said matter had been instituted due to a dispute between the

Appellant and the Respondent over the possession of the disputed

property pertinent to the Magistrates Court Case No. 11424/18.

6) In the said matter, the Learned Magistrate, after the inquiry, had

granted possession to the 1st Party Respondent in the Magistrates

Court proceedings.

7) Aggrieved by the said Order, the Appellant had preferred a revision

application in the Provincial High Court of Kandy and the Learned High

Court Judge in the said revision matter had dismissed the application

made by the Appellant on the grounds that there are no exceptional

C.A. (PHC) 02 - 2020

5

circumstances supported by the Appellant to grant relief under

revisionary jurisdiction.

8) On the said grounds, the Appellant has preferred this appeal to set

aside the Order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 31st January

2020 and the Learned Magistrates Order dated 15th October 2018.

9) The Appellant had preferred this appeal on the grounds that she paid

Rs. 150 000/- as advance money to the predecessors in title with the

intention of purchasing the disputed land. Thereafter, continuously

possessed the said land in question.

10) According to the Appellant, the Learned High Court Judge had erred in

law by failing to take cognizance of the fact that the Learned Magistrate

had failed to determine who was in possession under the provisions of

Section 66(i) of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act.

11) Furthermore, the Appellant had contended that, when taking into

account the facts on which the Learned Magistrate had based his

conclusion in the Order dated 15/10/2018, it appeared that the

Learned Magistrate had failed to evaluate the evidential value referred

to in the affidavits and had held contrary to the facts produced by the

Appellant.

12) On the said facts, the Appellant has preferred this appeal to set aside

the Orders made by the Learned High Court Judge and the Learned

Magistrate.

Disputed Facts

13) In light of the pertinent facts of this case, the arguments advanced by

counsels for both the Appellant and the Respondent, and the

documentary evidence submitted, to grant the reliefs prayed for in the

petition of appeal, the following disputed points must be scrutinized in

order to arrive at my conclusion.

C.A. (PHC) 02 - 2020

(i) Had this dispute arisen to be considered under Section 66(1) of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act and was there a breach of

peace?

(ii) Has the High Court Judge erred when delivering the Order dated

31st January 2020 dismissing the Appellants revision

application?

(iii) Can the Appellant maintain this action as per the prayers sought

in the instant appeal?

I. Had this dispute arisen to be considered under Section 66(1) of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act and was there a breach of

peace?

14) Section 66(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act outlines the

conditions under which legal action may be initiated under the Primary

Court Procedure. Action may be initiated by a Peace Officer following a

complaint from a party in the event of a breach of the peace or a

dispute over land possession arises. Alternatively, when a breach of

peace occurs, a party may file an information by affidavit at the Primary

Court, as provided under Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

15) In the present case, the Katugasthota Police had initiated the action

under the Primary Courts Procedure by submitting an information

report to court.

16) Thereafter, this inquiry had been taken up by the Magistrate and

concluded by way of written submissions and the Learned Magistrate

was satisfied that there had been an imminent breach of peace.

17) The Learned Magistrate had perused the complaints lodged by the 1st

Party Respondent with the Police, which encompassed incidents such

as, the possession prior to the complaint made by the parties to

Katugasthota police and the dispute over possession between the

C.A. (PHC) 02 - 2020

7

Appellant and the Respondent, which had given rise to a breach of the

peace.

II. Has the High Court Judge erred when delivering the order dated

31st January 2020 dismissing the Appellants revision

application?

18) The Learned High Court Judge had very well considered the Order

made by the Learned Additional Magistrate of Kandy.

19) The Learned Additional Magistrate of Kandy had perused all the

documents submitted before him and had concluded that the

Appellant's claim of having paid an advance of Rs. 150,000/- for the

disputed property was unsubstantiated and the Appellant in the

instant action had failed to prove that he had been in possession of the

property for a period of two months prior to the complaint lodged with

the police.

20) Furthermore, the Learned Additional Magistrate had observed that

there were cases pending in the District Court concerning the disputed

property.

21) On these grounds, it is evident that the Appellant must assert his

rights in a different forum if there was an agreement to sell the

disputed property.

22) Thus, the Learned High Court Judge had correctly determined that

there were no grounds to invoke revisionary jurisdiction, as no

exceptional circumstances had been presented to warrant the

consideration of the application before the Judge of the High Court.

III. Can the Appellant maintain this action as per the prayers sought

in the instant appeal?

23) It is crucial to observe that, since this is an application for revision,

exceptional circumstances must be demonstrated to justify the

invocation of revisionary jurisdiction in granting relief to the party.

24) In the instant action, the High Court Judge has also specified that the

Appellant had failed to show any exceptional grounds

25) In the case of Caderamanpulle vs. Ceylon Paper Sacks Ltd 1 ;

The existence of exceptional circumstances is a precondition for the exercise of the powers of revision.

As Per Nanayakkara, J;

when the decided cases cited before us are carefully examined, it becomes evident in almost all the cases cited, that powers of revision had been exercised only in a limited category of situations. The existence of exceptional circumstances is a pre-condition for the exercise of the powers of revision and absence of exceptional circumstances in any given situation results in refusal of remedies

And it is decided in Hotel Galaxy Ltd v Mercantile Hotel Management Ltd 2; as per Sharvananda CJ;

It is settled law that the exercise of revisionary powers of the Appellate Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist warranting its intervention.

26) Therefore, it is evident, as established by settled legal principles, that

exceptional circumstances must be demonstrated to justify the

consideration of a revision application. In the instant action, I find no

1 [2001] 3 SLR 116

2 [1987] 1 SLR 006

C.A. (PHC) 02 - 2020

9

such exceptional grounds that would warrant the intervention of this

Court.

27) Thus, I do not see any reason to interfere with the Orders delivered by

Learned High Court Judge and the Learned Magistrate.

CONCLUSION

28) In the said circumstances, I dismiss the petition dated 17th February

2020 subject to payment of Rs. 75 000/- cost payable to the

Respondent.
