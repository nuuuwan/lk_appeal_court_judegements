D. N. Samarakoon J.,

Ahangamage Malani, the claimant petitioner petitioner had made an application

under section 241 of the Civil Procedure Code.

That section says,

241. In the event of any claim being preferred to, or objection offered

against the seizure or sale of, any immovable or movable property which

may have been seized in execution of a decree or under any order passed

before decree, as not liable to be sold, the Fiscal or Deputy Fiscal shall, as

soon as the same is preferred or offered, as the case may be, report the

same to the court which passed such decree or order; and the court shall

thereupon proceed in a summary manner to investigate such claim or

objection with the like power as regards the examination of the claimant

or objector, and in all other respects, as if he were a party to the action;

Provided always that when any such claim or objection is preferred or

offered in the case of any property so seized outside the local limits of the

jurisdiction of the court which passed the decree or order under which

such seizure is made, such report shall be made to, and such investigation

shall thereupon be held by, the court of the district or division within the

local limits of which such seizure was made, and the proceedings on such

report and investigation with the order thereon shall, at the expiry of the

appealable time, if no appeal has been within that time taken therefrom,

but if an appeal has been taken, immediately upon the receipt by such

court of the judgment or order in appeal, be forwarded by such court to

the court which passed the decree or order, and shall be and become part

of the record in the action;

Provided, further, that in every such case the court to which such report

is made shall be nearer to the place of seizure than, and of co-ordinate

jurisdiction with, the court which passed the decree or order.

The position of the petitioner, who now seeks to revise or restore is that

properties in Pe1 were purchased by her husband and hence not owned by hrr

son, the defendant in 9518/MS of the District Court of Horana.

The learned district judge has said in her order X7 that the petitioner has not

resisted to the Fiscal.

But as the petitioners written submissions have highlighted the following

questions and answers, in which she explained at the cross examination as to

why she did not object to the execution of the writ is acceptable.

attributed to the Registrar/Fiscals is characteristic of them. The problem is not

only with some of the officers but the lack of training they get in this regard.

Having functioned in the JSC for sometime I know of instances where writs of

5 | C . A . R I I 5 8 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 2 n d M a y 2 0 2 4

possession were executed well after 6.00 p.m. and families with small children

were evicted from premises which were not even the subject matter of the case.

In respect of one such property at Dematagoda I have testified against a Registrar

even after leaving the JSC. It is also accepted that all officers are not corrupt.

Then the non production of receipts, it is unlikely that such things of furniture

etc., will be retained after twenty years. But the photographs taken sometime

ago marked as X9 and X10 show that the items were in the possession and

ownership of the petitioner.

The plaintiff respondent has taken up certain preliminary objections, which will

be addressed at this stage,

(i) Restitutio in integrum not available for an order in a claim inquiry:

In the article Two unusual appellate remedies: revision and restitutio in

integrum in the law of Sri Lanka Jerold Taitz1 Senior Lecturer Faculty of Law

University of Cape Town and Attorney of the Supreme Court of South Africa says

that

Restitutio in Integrum originated in Roman law through the imperium

(supreme judicial powers) delegated to the praetors after the expulsion of the

kings. It has been described as the judicial termination of the inequitable

situation (created by the law per se) and the restoration of the status quo

Restitutio in Integrum was used as a form of appeal against a valid judgment

or magisterial order made in terms of the law and which caused inequitable

loss or injury to a party. Cicero refers to the rescission of a number of

judgments originally granted by Verres as governor of Sicily. The judgments

were rescinded by his successor Metullus on account of their having been

founded initially on incorrect premises of law. A further ground was that no

1 https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA00104051_856

6 | C . A . R I I 5 8 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 2 n d M a y 2 0 2 4

proper trial had taken place as the court had not been properly constituted.

The following example of restitutio in integrum being used as an appellate

remedy is given by Engelsman. The praetor set aside a decision on account of

an error in the formula. It would appear that although the formula was framed

correctly in terms of the contentions of the parties it contained an error which

could have led only to a wrong decision. An aggrieved party had locus standi

and could apply directly to the praetor for relief. The intercession of an official

was unnecessary in regard to restitutio in integrum. The remedy was wide

and could be invoked in a number of situations. For example it could be

granted to creditors who suffered loss resulting from the debtor undergoing

capitis diminutio minima. This form of legal disability extinguished all the

contractual debts of the affected party. By virtue of the remedy the praetor

restored the rights of action to creditors. The power to grant restitutio in

integrum was also held by the emperor. He used the remedy inter alia to

set aside administrative decisions eg. To pardon Roman citizens who

had been deported (deportio in insulam). As a result of the pardon the

citizen was restored to his patria potestas and was said to be restitutus in

integrum.

Therefore at the commencement too it was never a remedy available only in

regard to judgments fraudulently obtained, etc. It is a basic remedy that covers

the public as well as the private law including criminal law. It is the judicial

termination of the inequitable situation (created by the law per se).

Inequitable situations created by law are not limited to that which the

plaintiff respondent enumerates.

Those who try to enumerate instances of availability of restitution do it due to

ignorance of the law, with respect. What Alexander Hamilton said in Federalist

No. 78 about the inclusion of purported bills of rights in constitutions will apply,

mutatis mutandis.

(ii) No exceptional grounds:

Retitutio does not need them. The taken for granted law, that exceptional

grounds are necessary for revision was addressed by Justice Upali de Z.

Gunawardana in FERNANDO v. CEYLON BREWERYS LTD. (1997) 1998 (03) S.

L. R. 61.

The extraordinary nature of the power of revision was discussed in FERNANDO

v. CEYLON BREWERYS LTD. (1997) 1998 (03) S. L. R. 61, decided by Upali

de Z. Gunewardane J., in Court of Appeal, where it was said having considered

the dictum of Abrahams, CJ in Ameen v. Rasheed, that ' I can see no reason why

the petitioner should expect us to exercise our revisional powers in his favour when

he might have appealed and I would allow the preliminary objection and dismiss

the application with costs ', that,

'But the validity of the above reason for denying the relief in revision

can no longer be accepted with favour inasmuch as the Court of Appeal

in consequence of the amendment of section 753 by Act No. 79 of 1988

is now clothed with greater amplitude of power in making orders and

is not confined, as formerly, ie before the aforesaid amendment, to

making the same order which it might have made had the matter been

brought before it by way of appeal. Since, prior to the amendment of

section 753 the court could whilst acting in revision only make the same

order as it could have made in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction - the

right of appeal and right in revision were justifiably treated as more or less,

alternative remedies - available, more or less, in such a way that when one

was accepted or made available the other had to be rejected or refused.

When, as was the case prior to the amendment of section 753 of the

Civil Procedure Code, the reliefs available or the orders that could be

made by the court, by way of appeal and revision, were conterminous

or the same - it could legitimately and even logically be inquired or

8 | C . A . R I I 5 8 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 2 n d M a y 2 0 2 4

queried, as had been done by His Lordship, Abrahams, CJ, in the

excerpt of the judgment cited above, as to why the revisionary process,

which may be described as a privileged procedure, was invoked in

preference to that of appeal,several advantages or benefits being

attendant on the revisionary process which would not be available to

one who seeks relief by way of an appeal (for instance one need not

furnish security or keep to certain prescribed time-limits as in the case

when one appeals against an order) - the recourse to revision was treated

as an extraordinary procedure in contradistinction to the procedure of

appeal which was considered to be the normal remedy, when the order in

question was appealable - as is the order in this case before me'. Page 66

The amendment to which His Lordship Justice Gunewardane referred to

was that to section 753 made by Amendment Act No. 79 of 1988. Justice

Gunewardane observed,

'The essence of the difference between the two forms of section 753 ie in

its original and amended form is this: as the said section stood originally,

the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court in the exercise of its revisionary

powers could have only made the same order which it might have made had

the case been brought before it by way of an appealwhereas in the

amended form the section empowers the Court of Appeal, in the exercise

of its powers of revision, to make any order as the interests of justice

may require'. Pages 64,65

His Lordship concluded,

'Thus it would be noticed that the amended section enables the court

to be more flexible and less legalistic in its means and in approach in

dealing with a matter for section 753 in its amended form seems to

exalt not so much the rigour of the law but unalloyed justice, in the

sense of good-sense and fairness. So that the basis of the rationale for

insistence on the requirement of special circumstances as a condition -

9 | C . A . R I I 5 8 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 2 n d M a y 2 0 2 4

precedent to the exercise of revisionary powers had disappeared as a

consequence of the amendment of section 753 of the Civil Procedure Code

by virtue of which amendment the Court of Appeal is now freed from the

duty or rather the necessity of making the same order as it would have

made in appeal and is empowered to make any order as the interests of

justice may require'. Page 65

In deciding FERNANDO v. CEYLON BREWERYS LTD., in 1997, Justice

Gunewardane lamented that he has not been referred to any decision of superior

courts on this question made after the aforesaid amendment.

The judgment in Rustom vs. Hapangama& Co. 1978-79-80 (1) S. L. R. 352, in

which several other cases they also cite, had been referred to by Ismail J., was

decided in 1980. The decision in Bank of Ceylon vs. Kaleel and others 2004 (1)

S. L. R. 284, although decided in 2003, has not considered FERNANDO v.

CEYLON BREWERYS LTD. It is so in several other cases such as Somindra vs.

Surasena and others 2000 03 S.L.R. 159, Leslie Silva vs. Perera 2005 02 S.L.R.

184 and also in BengamuweDhammalokaThero vs. Dr. Cyril Anton Balasuriya

S.C. Appeal No. 09/2002, S.C. spl. L.A. No. 242/2001 in favour of availability of

revision too.

It appears to this court hence, the judgment in FERNANDO v. CEYLON

BREWERYS LTD., is a strong persuasive authority in favour of availability of

revision, especially as the decision is based on the very construction of the words

in the amended legal provision enacted by the legislature in its wisdom.

Though the decision in The Ceylon Brewery Limited vs. Jax Fernando, Proprietor,

Maradana Wine Stores, 2001 decided in the Supreme Court by Mark Fernando

J., overruled the above decision of U. de Z. Gunewardane J., it was done only in

respect of the decision in the latter that an application made under section 86(2)

of Civil Procedure Code can be allowed even if that was made one day after the

stipulated time of 14 days. The Supreme Court said, I therefore set aside the

judgment of the Court of Appeal on that point. The decision pertaining to wider

10 | C . A . R I I 5 8 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 2 n d M a y 2 0 2 4

powers given by amended section 753, the ability of the court to make a

justifiable order in revision and hence revision not being only an additional

remedy granted on mere discretion was hence not set aside.

The words such as to make any order as the interests of justice may require

or words of similar import are not found in Article 138 or Article 139(1) of the

Constitution.

But when a lower court has the authority to apply a legal remedy more

broadly, the scope of the higher court cannot be narrower.

(iii) The petitioner guilty of laches:

The delay in coming to this court, as alleged by the plaintiff, for 05 months from

09.08.2023 to 10.01.2024 is not laches in the circumstances of this case. Courts

must take a realistic approach taking into consideration (a) the circumstances

under which the order was made (the petitioner was not a party to the case in

which the writ was issued, etc.) (b) the practical difficulties in retaining Attorneys

at Law and counsel (c) the current situation as far as economy is concerned in

this country (The state itself declared its bankruptcy in April 2022 and presently

taking loans from the IMF which demands wide taxation) and (d) last but not the

least, that, in a vast majority of cases people come to court as the last resort.

(iv) Suppression and Misrepresentation:

Failure to attach certified copies and alleged suppression of the fact that her

so, the defendant, resides in the same address.

The former will be considered under the next heading.

Even if the defendant, lives in the same address, there is nothing that prevents

the items in question are in the ownership of petitioners husband and herself.

Hence it is, in any event, not a material fact to be stated. The permanent

residence of the defendant must not be confused with the fact whether the

defendant owns the items or not.

(v) Having failed to tender a full certified copy of the record in District Court

of Nugegoda CL/48/18 the petitioner has violated Rules 3(1)(a) and

3(1)(b) of Court of Appeal Rules:

On the evening of Wednesday, August 29, 1906, at the Annual Meeting of the

American Bar Association convened in the State Capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota,

Roscoe Pound, then thirty-six years old and the dean of the law department of

the University of Nebraska, read a paper entitled 'The Causes of Popular

Dissatisfaction with the Administration of Justice". That speech, as Dean

Wigmore wrote some thirty years later, "struck the spark that kindled the

white flame of high endeavor, now spreading through the entire legal

profession and radiating the spirit of resolute progress in the

administration of justice". The speech also launched Roscoe Pound on a

national career2. [Emphasis added in this order]

In that speech Pound said,

If we except the Connecticut Practice Act of 1878, which shows

English influence, American reform in procedure has stopped

substantially where that commission left it. In England, beginning

with 1826 and ending with 1874, five commissions have put forth

nine reports upon this subject. As a consequence we have nothing

in America to compare with the radical treatment of pleading in the

English Judicature Act and the orders based thereon. We still try

the record, not the case. We are still reversing judgments for

nonjoinder and misjoinder. The English practice of joinder of parties

against whom relief is claimed in the alternative, rendering

judgment against any that the proof shows to be liable and

2 https://www.jstor.org/stable/25725452

12 | C . A . R I I 5 8 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 2 n d M a y 2 0 2 4

dismissing the rest, makes an American lawyer rub his eyes. We are

still reversing judgments for variances. We still reverse them

because the recovery is in excess of the prayer3, though sustained

by the evidence4. [Emphasis added in this order].

As this Court sees, based also on what Pound said 118 years ago, there is a

use and abuse of paper; the use is when it records science, law, arts, history,

etc., the accumulation of millennia of cumulative human knowledge; the abuse

could be given in a one example, rather than in abstract terms, that is when a

man or woman is physically present, breathing, talking and crying, some

administrative officer ignoring that presence, due to the non availability of the

exact certification required in a document, with the seal. The law is there to

safeguard them in such situations. That has been described as The Laws

Finest Hour.

In a somewhat similar situation, though not exactly in respect of the Court of

Appeal rules, Dr. A. R. B. Amerasinghe, former Judge of the Supreme Court

said,

Judges, do not blindly devote themselves to procedures or ruthlessly

sacrifice litigants to technicalities, although parties on the road to justice

may choose to act recklessly. On the contrary, as the indispensable

vehicle for the appointment of justice, civil procedural law has a

protective character. In its protective character, civil procedural law

represents the orderly, regular and public functioning of the legal

machinery and the operation of the due process of law. In this sense the

protective character of procedural law has the effect of safeguarding

every person in his life, liberty, reputation, livelihood and property

and ensuring that he does not suffer any deprivation except in

accordance with the accepted rules of procedure." [Emphasis added in

this order].

(vi) Restitutio in integrum not available when there is another remedy:

There is no such rule. What was said under (i) applies. A comprehensive analysis

of local cases on restitutio in integrum for the last century or so mostly on a

chronological order is done in my order or final character in C. A. RII 53 2024

dated 07.05.2024.

(vii) Alleged fraudulent conduct of the petitioner:

The allegation is that the claimant (petitioner) or her husband did not produce

receipts at the inquiry before the District Court stating that since the items are

about 30 years old, the receipts are not with him, but with the present petition

some fraudulent receipts are attached.

The survey done for the plaintiff at page 07 of written submissions with a table

comparing dates and serial numbers of receipts; and especially the serial number

in the receipt dated 27.09.2007 being 000075 and that of the receipt dated

10.11.2010 being 000100 (the argument, that, for over 03 years that particular

establishment sold only 24 items) is commendable. But it is not final to establish

fraud. There can be other reasons why the number 000100 is there on the second

receipt, such as, the books having been renewed. It is a matter that needs cross

examination to prove.

Fraud if alleged must be established by cogent evidence.

It is well established in Fiona Trust v Privalov [2010] EWHC 3199 that cogent

evidence is required to justify a finding of fraud or other discreditable conduct.

This is because fraud and dishonesty are both very serious allegations. As such,

clearer evidence is required to prove fraud or dishonesty than other torts i.e.

negligence or innocence.

14 | C . A . R I I 5 8 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 2 n d M a y 2 0 2 4

One of the reasons the petitioner is moving in restitutio in integrum is on the

basis, that, receipts were evidence discovered after the inquiry on the basis of

SLIC vs. Shanmugam and others (1995) 1 SLR 55.

In respect of some cases cited by the plaintiff on the question of restitutio in

integrum, in Mapalatan vs Elayavan 41 NLR 115, SOERTSZ J. said, that, The

Supreme Court has no power to revise or review a case decided by itself.

But a decade later the Supreme Court did just that in Menchinahamy vs.

Muniweera of 1951 (Dias S. P.J.,).

In Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardena vs. Hector Perera, Officer in Charge, Police

Station, Kollupitiya and others S.C. Application 20/1983 Ranasinghe J.,

despite being on the minority said,

The real basis upon which relief is given and the precise nature of

the relief so given by the Supreme Court upon an application made to

it for relief against an earlier Order made by the Supreme Court itself

was very lucidly and very effectively expressed by Dias S.P.J. way

back in the year 1951 in the case of Menchinahamy v. Muniweera,

(40). In that case, about six weeks after an appeal to the Supreme Court

from an interlocutory decree in the District Court was dismissed by the

Supreme Court, an application was made to the Supreme Court, on

23.3.1949, " for revision or in the alternative for restitutio-in-integrum" by

the heirs of a party defendant, who had died before the interlocutory decree

was entered but whose heirs had not been substituted in his place before

the interlocutory decree was so entered. It was contended on behalf of the

respondents: that there was no merit in the application: that if the relief

sought is granted then the Supreme Court would in effect be sitting

in judgment on a two-Judge decision of the Supreme Court which had

passed the Seal of the Court that the Supreme Court cannot interfere

with the orders of the Supreme Court itself. In rejecting these

15 | C . A . R I I 5 8 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 2 n d M a y 2 0 2 4

objections, Dias S.P.J., placed this matter in its proper setting quite

convincingly in the following words:

"In giving relief to the petitioner we are not sitting in judgment either

on the interlocutory decree or on the decree in appeal passed by this

Court. We are merely declaring that, so far as the petitioner is

concerned, there has been a violation of the principles of

natural justice which makes it incumbent on this Court, despite

technical objections to the contrary, to do justice. "

Although his lordships opinion in Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardenas case was a

dissenting one, the passage he quoted from the judgment of Dias S. P. J., was

the majority opinion of the Supreme Court.

This shows that the purported authorities on restitutio in integrum are not final,

sometimes contradicting; and that the best explanation, given in terms of the

Roman and Roman Dutch laws is the one referred to by this Court under (i)

above, referring to Jerold Taitz.

In a claim inquiry, the claimant does not have the burden of proof similar to the

plaintiff in actio rei vindicatio.

The relevant provisions say,

Claimant to adduce

evidence. 243. The claimant or objector must on such investigation adduce evidence to show that at the

date of the seizure he had some interest in, or was possessed of, the property seized.

Discretion of court

to release the

property claimed.

244. If upon the said investigation the court is satisfied that, for the reason stated in the claim

or objection such property was not, when seized, in the possession of the judgment-debtor,

or of some person in trust for him or in the occupancy of a tenant or other person paying rent

to him, or that being in the possession of the judgment-debtor at such time, it was so in his

possession, not on his own account or as his own property, but on account of or in trust for some

other person, or partly on his own account and partly on account of some other person, the court

shall release the property wholly, or to such extent as it thinks fit, from seizure and make such

order as to payment of fees and charges already incurred by the Fiscal as it may deem fit.

This court is of the view, that, the petitioner has established the above.

Preliminary and other objections are overruled.

The order marked X7 is set aside.

It is declared that the items in question are not liable to be seized in execution.

I know, that, there is no prayer for that. But it is the very basis of the claim.

What Pound said, .We still reverse them because the recovery is in excess

of the prayer, referred to in (v) above is applicable; and therefore followed.

It is directed that they be released to the petitioner.

There is no order on costs.
