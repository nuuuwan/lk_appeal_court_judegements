S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

This Order is pertaining to two preliminary legal objections raised on behalf of the

Respondents about the maintainability of the Writ Application. The learned Counsel

appearing for the Petitioner informed Court that he would be confining his submissions

in respect of prayers (d) and (e) of the Petition. By this Writ Application, the Petitioner

is seeking reliefs, inter alia, to issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition

prohibiting one or more or all of the Respondents from adopting the District Merit-

based quota system of selecting 55% of candidates for higher education institutions and

universities from the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination here onwards as more fully

reflected in P4A and mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing one or

more of the Respondents to formulate new admission criteria of selecting students for

higher education Institutions and Universities from the G.C.E Advanced Level

Examination held in 2019 and onwards according to law.

On behalf of the Respondents, two preliminary legal objections were raised by the

learned DSG appearing for the Respondents about the maintainability of the

Application. As recorded by the Court, those objections are based on the following

facts;

1. That the Cabinet of Ministers being necessary parties have not been made

parties

4

2. In view of the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers not being challenged in these

proceedings, the Application is futile.

The facts of the case briefly are that the Petitioner to this Writ Application sat for the

General Certificate of Education (Advanced Level) Examination (hereinafter referred

to as G.C.E. A/L Examination) in Biology Stream in the year 2019 and the Petitioner

is one of the first batch of students to sit for the Exam under the new syllabus introduced

in 2017. It is stated in the University Admission Handbook (marked as P4) published

by the University Grants Commission (the 3rd Respondent), that following the Order of

the SC (FR) 29/2012 case the UGC has decided to consider the students sitting under

the old and new syllabuses as two distinct populations and would be allocated separate

island and district ranks and the admission to the State Universities would be decided

on the composite average percentage which would be based on the results of the

previous five years. Thus, the said criteria would place the students who sat for the

G.C.E. A/L Examination in 2019 at a greater disadvantage compared to the ones who

sat for the said Exam under the old syllabus. In terms of P4, 55% of the candidates

would be admitted to State Universities based on the District Merit Quota basis (marked

as P4A). The Petitioner has restricted the prayers to the Petition to challenge the legality

of the District Merit Quota system in selecting students to the Universities from the

G.C.E. A/L Examination.

5

According to the Publication of the University Grants Commission dated 9th November

2020 (marked as P5) which provides a detailed description of the University admission

for eligible candidates sitting for the G.C.E. A/L Examination in 2019, 43% of the

admissions should be under the new syllabus and 57% should be under the All Island

Merit Basis to follow the course of Medicine. In terms of P5, for the Academic year

2019/2020 only 27% of students qualified to get admitted under the new syllabus and

73% under the old syllabus based on District Merit to follow the course of Medicine

from the District of Galle under which the Petitioner sat for the Examination resulting

in only 14 students under the new syllabus and 38 students under the old syllabus

qualified to follow the course of Medicine. As a result of adopting the above-mentioned

method, the Petitioner suffered a great disadvantage and was unable to get admission

to follow the course of Medicine in the State Universities despite obtaining a Z score

of 2.0062. The Petitioner further states that due to the aforementioned admission

method, students from other Districts who obtained lower Z scores and students under

the old syllabus who obtained lower Z scores than the Petitioner were entitled to get

admitted to follow the course of Medicine in the State Universities while the Petitioner

was deprived of the same. The Petitioner alleges that the adoption of such admission

criteria resulted in manifest discrimination for the students who sat for the Examination

under the new syllabus. However, according to the Cabinet Decision dated 10.05.2021

(R4), the Secretary to the Ministry of Education has been directed to send the list of

next immediate qualified students to get admitted to follow the Medicine course in the

6

State Universities to the Vice Chancellor of the Kotelawala Defence University,

consequently to which the Petitioner was admitted as a Medical student at the

Kotelawala Defence University.

The first preliminary objection taken up by the Respondents is that the District Quota

System was implemented under the national policy set down by the Cabinet of

Ministers and failure to include the Cabinet of Ministers in the instant Application as

necessary parties is fatal.

The learned DSG appearing for the Respondents in the written submissions has

submitted that the national policy on University admission set out by the Cabinet of

Ministers should be complied with by the UGC and the said national policy is embodied

in the Cabinet Memorandum dated 07.12.1994, Cabinet decision dated 21.12.1994,

Cabinet Memorandum dated 06.03.1995 and Cabinet decision dated 17.03.1995. Citing

section 20(1) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 (the Act), the learned DSG

appearing for the Respondents argues that the UGC must comply with the directions of

the Minister embodied in the national policy and the UGC is bound by law to comply

with the national policy on University admissions. Section 20(1) of the Act reads thus,

20. (1) (a) The Minister may from time to time issue to the Commission such general

written directions as he may deem necessary in pursuance of national

policy in matters such as finance, university places and medium of

instruction, to enable him to discharge effectively, his responsibility for

7

university education and the administration of this Act. Every such

direction shall as soon as possible be tabled in Parliament.

(b) The Commission shall comply with such directions and the governing

authority of every Higher Educational Institution shall afford such

facilities, and furnish such information, to the Commission or any

member or officer thereof as may be necessary to enable the Commission

to comply with such directions.

In terms of Section 20(1) (a) empowers the Minister from time to time to issue written

directions as he deems necessary in pursuance of national policy in matters such as

finance, university places and medium of instruction, to enable him to effectively

discharge his responsibility for university education and such directions should be

tabled before the Parliament. When such directions are issued, UGC is bound to comply

with such directions under Section 20(1) (b) of the Act. When considering Section 20(1)

it is clear that it only gives the Minister the power to issue written directions in

pursuance of national policy and the instant Application neither any direction has been

issued by the Minister regarding the number of students to be admitted to State

Universities nor the Act stipulate that the UGC must follow the national policy on

University admission.

8

The Petitioner argues that in terms of Section 15(vi) of the Act, the UGC has the power

to select the number of students for University admission. Section 15(vi) of the Act

reads as follows;

15. (vi) to determine, from time to time, in consultation with the governing

authority of each Higher Educational Institution, the total number of

students which shall be admitted annually to each Higher Educational

Institution and the apportionment of that number to the different courses of

study therein;

The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court

to the judgement Pathiratne Vs UGC1 where Shirani Bandaranayake J. held that The

UGC is therefore, the only authority vested with power to admit students to Universities

in Sri Lanka. Admittedly there is no other authority in the country vested with such

power.

When considering the above-stated provisions of the Act and authority it is evident that

the UGC has the power to select the number of students to be admitted to the

Universities and the Minister has the power to issue written directions to the UGC about

university places in under national policy, which should also be table before the

Parliament. This does not stipulate that UGC must follow the national policy when

deciding the number of students to be admitted to the Universities. Therefore, this Court

1 SC FR Application No. 618/2002, SC Minutes of 05.08.2003.

9

is of the view that not naming the Cabinet of Ministers as necessary parties to this

Application is not fatal. Nevertheless, this Court has to consider the second preliminary

objection raised by the learned DSG appearing for the Respondents, which is that the

Application is futile as the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers has not been challenged

in these proceedings. Even though the Act does not stipulate UGC to follow the national

policy on University admissions in deciding the number of students to be admitted to

the State Universities, according to the University Admission Handbook marked as P4,

under section 1.1 which is about the admission policy for State Universities and Higher

Educational Institutes, states that the total number to be selected for a course of study

is based on a national policy. Section 1.1 of P4 reads thus;

.

Therefore, it is clear that UGC has relied on the national policy in deciding the number

of students to be admitted to the Universities. In the instant Application, the Petitioner

is seeking a Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to formulate a new admission

criterion in selecting students for higher education institutions and Universities from

the G.C.E Advanced Level Examination 2019 and onwards according to law. It is the

view of this Court that since UGC has based on the national policy in deciding the

number of students for University admission, not challenging the national policy which

10

has prevailed for a considerable period will render the Application futile. Hence, I hold

that the Petitioners are not entitled to maintain this Writ Application.

Thus, I dismiss the Writ Application without costs.
