JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Complainant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the 1st Respondent) filed a charge sheet Under Section 25(2) read with

Section 40(b) of the Forest Ordinance against the Accused in the

Magistrate Court of Kandy for illegally transporting timber without a

valid permit on 03.11.2015. As the Accused pleaded guilty to the charge

sheet, the Learned Magistrate of Kandy had convicted the Accused as

CA PHC 147/2020

4 | P a g e

charged and imposed a fine of Rs.10,000/- with a default sentence and

fixed for an inquiry whether to confiscate or not the vehicle bearing No.

48-3955 which had been used for the transportation of the timber

mentioned above.

At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate had decided to

confiscate the aforesaid vehicle by his order dated 01.04.2019. At the

inquiry, the Registered Owner-Petitioner-Appellant (Hereinafter referred

to as the Appellant), the Accused and a person from LB Finance had

given evidence on his behalf and marked two documents.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Magistrate, the Appellant filed a

Revision Application in the Provincial High Court of Kandy to revise the

order of the Learned Magistrate of Kandy. After an inquiry, the Learned

High Court Judge of Kandy by her order dated 25.11.2020 dismissed

the revision application on the basis that the Appellant had failed to

prove existence of exceptional circumstances.

Now the Appellant filed this appeal to set aside the order of the Learned

High Court Judge of Kandy dated 25.11.2020 and the order of Learned

Magistrate of Kandy dated 01.04.2019.

The Appellant submitted following grounds of appeal:

a. That there was no proof that the accused had knowledge

regarding the illicit transport of timber;

b. Conversely, there was proof that the appellant had no

knowledge of the illicit transport of timber;

c. That it is proved that the appellant took all necessary

precautions under the circumstances to prevent the commission

of an offence;

d. That the sole reason for the learned Magistrate to confiscate the

vehicle was a contradiction in the evidence of the driver, which

when assessed with other evidence, and the conduct of the

CA PHC 147/2020

5 | P a g e

police point to the fact that the appellant had taken all

necessary precautions under the circumstances to prevent the

commission of an offence;

e. That the learned Magistrate had failed to appreciate the words

under the circumstances attached to the words necessary

precautions that is found in section 40 of the Forest

Conservation Ordinance.

f. That the learned Magistrate had failed to follow the guidelines in

cases of confiscation laid down by the Court of Appeal.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge considering the order of the

Magistrate Court of Kandy decided to dismiss the revision application

stating that that the Appellant had failed shock the conscience of the

Court.

In this case a lorry had been confiscated for transporting timber worth

about Rs.4417.85 illegally.

The Appellant of the vehicle has given evidence in the Court and has

claimed that he was unaware of the crime being committed as he has

given the vehicle for hire after appointing the accused as the driver. The

Appellant had given evidence and vividly explained how he had taken

preventive measures that the vehicle not being used for illegal activities.

The Accused (driver) giving evidence endorsed the evidence given by the

Appellant regarding the precaution and preventive measures which had

been taken by the Appellant. But in the cross examination the Accused

was confronted with his statement given to the police by the

prosecution. The Accused admitted that he gave his statement to police

on his own accord. In his statement the Accused had stated that the

Appellant, being a timber seller had directed him to saw 05 logs of Milla

Timber from a place called Mudunkoth. As he has denied making such

a portion in his statement, the said portion was marked as X1 by the

prosecution. Also suggested to him that he had not mentioned that he

transported five logs of timber to make door frame for his house.

Now I am going to consider whether the grounds of appeal raised on

behalf of the Appellant have any merit. As the appeal grounds

mentioned above are interconnected, all appeal grounds will be

considered together hereinafter.

As the law stands today, the Claimant in a vehicle confiscation inquiry

should prove that he or she had have taken all preventive measures on

a balance of probability. Hence, the Learned Magistrate should consider

all the evidence very carefully before coming to a conclusion.

In The Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd v The Range

Forest Officer, Ampara and Hon. Attorney General [2013] 1 SLR

208 the Court held that:

1. Before an order for forfeiture is made the owner should be given

an opportunity to show cause. If the owner on balance probability

209 satisfies the Court that he had taken precautions to prevent

the commission of the offence or the offence was committed without

his knowledge nor, was he privy to the commission of the offence,

the vehicle has to be released to the owner.

2. When it comes to showing cause as to why the vehicle should

not be confiscated, only the person who was in possession and

control of the vehicle could give evidence to the effect that the

offence was committed without his knowledge and he had taken

necessary steps to prevent the commission of the offence.

In Mudankotuwa v Attorney General [1996] 2 SLR 77 the court held

that:

As seen from the evidence the vehicle was taken over by the

driver from the Petitioners house in the morning and it was

returned to him in the evening with the collections. Further, clear

instructions had been given by the Petitioner to the driver, not to

transport timber or use the vehicle for any illegal

purposeTherefore, the Magistrate was in error when he came

CA PHC 147/2020

7 | P a g e

to the conclusion that the Petitioner had exercise no control or

supervision over the driver regarding the use of the tractor.

In this case the Appellant had hired the Accused only in the capacity of

a driver.

Although the Appellant, as the owner of the vehicle had given evidence

and explained to the Court that he had taken all the possible and

necessary precautions to prevent the vehicle being used for illegal

purposes, but the Accused had given contradictory evidence which

certainly effect the root of the case. The Appellant failed to adduce

cogent evidence that the offence committed without his knowledge.

Hence, the Learned High Court Judge dismissing the application on the

basis that the Appellant had failed to show that he took all necessary

precautions to prevent a crime being committed is correct in this case.

Therefore, I affirm the order of the High Court Judge Kandy dated

25.11.2020 and the order of the Learned Magistrate of Kandy dated

01.04.2019. Therefore, this appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgement to the

High Court of Kandy and the Magistrate Court of Kandy for information.
