Deputy Director of Customs (Revenue Task Force) Sri Lanka Customs, Customs House No. 40, Main Street, Colombo 11.

Respondents Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. Counsel: Nihal Jayawardana, P.C. with A. R. P. Bandara, instructed by Emal Gunasekara for the Petitioner.

Ms. Chaya Sri Nammuni, DSG for the Respondents. Argued on: 16.02.2024 Written Submissions on: 01.04.2024 by the Petitioner 03.05.2024 by the Respondents Decided on: 13.06.2024 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. The Petitioner to this Application is before this Court seeking, inter alia,

the following reliefs.

b) An order quashing the decision made by the 1st to 4th Respondents not to release the consignment (CUSDEC) No. 28817of 5/10/2023 c) An order directing the respondents to grant Duty, VAT, and CESS exemptions on the product NUFLAM. d) An interim order releasing the consignment Under (CUSDEC) No. 28817 dated 5th October 2023. e) An order to waive off demurrage on this consignment.

3

However, at the outset it must be stated that, as submitted by the Learned

Counsel for the Respondents, prayers b) and d) are now futile as the

consignment of goods have been released to the Petitioner based on a bank

guarantee as evinced in 1R8 to the Objections of the Respondents.

Therefore, it is for this Court to only adduce whether such a consignment

is free from Duty, VAT, and CESS.

The Petitioner company engaged in the business of import and distribution

of pharmaceuticals products. The Petitioner imported a consignment of

471 packs of MOMCAL which is registered as "Medicine" and 2698 packs

of NUFLAM (P2a and P2b) registered as a "Borderline Product" by the

National Medicine Regulatory Authority (NMRA). It is stated by the

Petitioner that, when the consignment in question came into Sri Lanka on

05/10/2023, as NUFLAM is registered as a "Borderline Product", the

Petitioner entered the relevant code (707) in the goods declaration form, as

depicted in P2a, to get the due Duty, VAT, and CESS exemptions.

Thereafter, on 05/10/2023 the said consignment of medicine was stopped

by an officer attached to the 4th Respondent, Revenue Task Force of Sri

Lanka Customs, who informed the Petitioner that the Duty, VAT and CESS

exemptions could not be granted for NUFLAM and instructed the clearing

agent to pay all the applicable taxes due. In response to this, the Petitioner

made an appeal to the 1st Respondent through letter dated 19/10/2023,

marked P3, requesting to release the consignment as per the acceptable

practice carried out by the Sri Lanka Customs since 2011, to which the

4th Respondent verbally declined. It is clear that such a decision to have

the Petitioner pay the relevant dues on NUFLAM stems from the

4

categorization of NUFLAM as Borderline Product which is not exempt

from the relevant dues.

NUFLAM could be understood to be a capsule containing 500mg of

Glucosamine Sulphate, listed in the British National Formulary for

treating rheumatic diseases, marked P7c, and it holds a Certificate of a

Pharmaceutical Product issued by the Department of Health Therapeutic

Goods Administration in Australia, marked P21.

Prior to the implementation of the National Medicine Regulatory Authority

Act, No. 5 of 2015, the Cosmetics Devices and Drugs Act, No.27 of 1980

controlled the import of drugs, all medicines. And dietary supplements

with medicinal properties were accorded registration as "Drug under the

CDDA. NUFLAM previously carried the registration as a "Drug issued by

the CDDA. After the establishment of the National Medicine Regulatory

Authority (NMRA), the NMRA continued with the registration of NUFLAM

as "Drugs" for a period of 5 years. Thereafter, the NMRA replaced the

category of "Drugs" registered by the CDDA with two new designations,

namely "Medicine" and "Borderline Product. After the introduction of the

new registration criteria, NMRA registered NUFLAM under the "Borderline

Product" category.

As per the interpretation of Section 146 of the National Medicine

Regulatory Authority Act, No. 5 of 2015, borderline products are

interpreted as follows:

borderline products means the products having combined

characteristics of medicines and foods, medicines and medical devices

or medicines and cosmetics and in deciding whether a product is a

borderline product the following shall be taken into consideration:-

5

(a) the intended use of the product (or its primary function) and

its mode of action;

(b) the therapeutic claims that the manufacturer makes about

the product (claims to treat or prevent disease or to interfere with

the normal operation of a physiological function of the human

body);

(c) the pharmacological active substance(s), if any, used in the

product;

(d) the concentration of the active substances;

(e) the level of efficacy of the active substance of the product; and

(f) the ingredients used and the concentrations at which they are

used;

It is submitted that medicines classified under HS Heading 30.04 is tax

exempt. However, dietary supplements with medicinal properties are not

accepted under HS Heading 30.04. Instead, it is the practice that has been

adopted by Sri Lanka Customs to classify dietary supplements with

medicinal properties under HS Heading 21.06 and grant Duty, VAT and

CESS exemptions where such products are registered as borderline

medicine under the NMRA. Furthermore, as per the Customs Tariff, there

is a list of exemptions (P10) to exempt dues to products and preparations

certified by the Ministry of Health as having been registered as drugs under

the NMRA. An exemption introduced under HS heading 30.04 to grant

duty exemption for products other than medicine.

In adducing whether the importation of NUFLAM should exempt from

Duty, VAT, and CESS as prayed for in paragraph c) to the Prayers of the

Petition, it is my view that NUFLAM should be granted Duty, VAT, and

CESS exemptions based on several compelling factors.

6

Firstly, its classification as a "Borderline Product" under the NMRA aligns

it with the characteristics of medicinal products, which are typically

recognized for their therapeutic benefits and pharmacological effects and

its primary function as a treatment for rheumatic diseases, a purpose

clearly outlined in its registration and certification. Secondly, there has

been a historical and consistent practice by Sri Lanka Customs to exempt

such products under HS Heading 21.06, acknowledging their medicinal

properties even when they possess attributes of dietary supplements. This

practice reflects a recognition of the therapeutic claims and the active

pharmacological ingredients in products like NUFLAM. Lastly, the

therapeutic claims and pharmacological composition of NUFLAM meet the

criteria for tax exemption as specified in the Customs Tariff exemptions for

registered drugs. These exemptions are designed to support products with

significant medicinal benefits, a category into which NUFLAM undeniably

falls. Therefore, the refusal to grant these exemptions contradicts

established regulatory practices.

In these circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner is entitled to reliefs as

prayed for in the prayers to the Petition. This application is allowed without

costs.

Application Allowed. No costs.
