JUDGMENT

B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

This is an application for Writ of Certiorari on the Respondents to quash the decision of

the 4th Respondent who is the Principal of the Kingswood College Kandy, refusing to admit

the Petitioners son namely Mohamed Rushdi for 2022 Grade One admission to the

Kingswood College, Kandy.

The Petitioner states that the Petitioner has submitted the application dated 12.07.2021

marked as P1 to the said school and his son faced the interview on 09.12.2021 where his

son has obtained 85 marks. The Petitioner further avers that 10 marks were deducted for

the two schools namely Rasindev School and Siddi Lebbe Maha Vidyalaya which are

situated between the said school and the Petitioners residence in term of Clause 07 of

Circular No. 29/2019, and 05 marks for the title of deed. The Petitioner moreover states

that another 05 marks were cut off for Madduma Bandara School based on the further

search of the distance between the applied school and the Petitioners residence.

The Petitioner states that, although the school selected the students who obtained up to

the cut-off marks of 83, the Petitioners son was not selected for the said school.

Thereafter, the Petitioner appealed to the said school on 03.03.2022 on the basis of the

Page 3 of 4

said rejection of the application. Although at the said appeal the Petitioner claimed that

the rejection of the application of his son was unfair, the said appeal was rejected by the

school by letter dated 20.05.2022 based on clauses 7.2.4, 7.1.5, and 9.3.3 of the said

Circular.

The main contention of the Petitioner is that the non-selection of the Petitioners son to

the applied school is unfair and illegal.

On the other hand, the Respondents raise the objections that no marks have been

arbitrarily deducted and that they have acted in accordance with Circular No. 29/2019.

The Circular issued for the admission and the marking scheme provided in the said

Circular are to facilitate proper school admission. It is true that, all parents want their

children to be admitted to popular schools. However, we are mindful that, if this Court

intervenes with the school admission where the rules are applicable to all the candidates,

the proper administration of the school will be hindered, unless the Petitioner establishes

the compelling reasons such as bias, or that the Interview Board has not followed the

proper procedure laid down in the said Circular.

Further, the Petitioner states that, some other children who live further than the

Petitioner have gained admission. It is true that, it is discrimination, however

discrimination and denial of equal rights cannot be agitated in an application for writ of

Certiorari. The matter comes under the action for fundamental rights which should be

canvassed in the Supreme Court.

We are also mindful that when the Petitioner appealed to the Appeal Board, according to

their decision which is marked as P3, they have given reasons for deducting the marks.

For easy perusal, an excerpt of the said document is reproduced below:

I am of the view that the 4th Respondent has followed the instruction given by the said

Circular which is applicable throughout the country. The writ which is a discretionary

remedy is governed by the well-accepted principles. However, the Petitioner has failed to

establish bias or failure to follow the procedure with regard to the admission to issue

writs.

Thus, I see no merit in this application for writs of Certiorari for the reasons set out and

dismiss the application.

No order for costs.
