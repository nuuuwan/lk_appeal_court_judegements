Decided on: 17.01.2024

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The issues raised by the Petitioners in the instant Application revolve around the provisions

of Rule 5.1.2 of the Sri Lanka Cricket Domestic Hand Book 2018. Those rules are approved

and adopted by the Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) by virtue of the powers

vested in it, in terms of the provisions of the Constitution of SLC. The Unichela Sports Club

(Club) of which the 1st and 2nd Petitioners are Office Bearers is not a member club of SLC.

The said Rule 5.1.2 reads,

Only a Member Club of Sri Lanka Cricket (Controlling, Affiliated or Associate

Member) shall be eligible to play in Major Club Tournaments classified as First Class

under the Tournament Structure conducted by SLC.

Page 4 of 7

The Petitioners complain that this Rule has been time and again removed and replaced by the

SLC to accommodate situations where eligible and promising teams win a championship.

According to the Petitioners, during the time they were declared champions this rule had been

suspended. It is further stated that the said rule was suspended and made inactive when the

Petitioners applied for, participated in and won the tournament relevant to the instant

Application. However, SLC at an extra special general meeting decided to reactivate the

provisions of the said Rule 5.1.2 with effect from 16.10.2019. The Petitioners contend that the

SLC has reactivated the provisions of the said Rule without a due explanation. Further, the

Petitioners assert that such reactivation is arbitrary, as the Club achieved its victory when the

said Rule was inactivated. In addition to the above, the Petitioners contend that the

Petitioners have a legitimate expectation that Rule 5.1.2 will be kept inactive until the whole

tournament is over.

The 2nd to 7th, 8(a) and 19th to 23rd Respondents ('Respondents') on 22.10.2021 agreed in open

Court that the SLC would allow the said Club to participate in Tier B tournaments that

would be held or conducted later, provided the Club would be successful in the instant

Application after the final determination of this Case. Moreover, the learned Additional

Solicitor General who appears for the 1st Respondent has indicated on 03.06.2022 that the 1st

Respondent can consider an appeal made by the Petitioners. Whilst the instant Application

was pending the Petitioners tendered a formal appeal to the 1st Respondent and anyhow it is

apparent that the Petitioners have failed to deposit the relevant sum of money at the time of

tendering the said appeal.

The primary argument of the Petitioners is that the SLC cannot change the rules of a game

after it has been played and also the SLC cannot implement Regulations with retrospective

effect, after permitting a party to engage in the respective sport. The Petitioners, further submit

that the Club cannot be subjected to the aforesaid alteration of the relevant Rule because its

effective date fell after the Petitioners became entitled to the next tier. By letter dated

22.02.2021 marked P9(A) SLC has informed that the said Club is not entitled to play for the

next tier since the Club was not a member club of SLC in terms of the said Rule 5.1.2. The

letter dated 19.04.2022 marked P9(B) is another letter written by SLC referring to P9(A).

The SLC has informed its decision to amend the Tournament Rules to all Teams, Clubs,

Page 5 of 7

Associations and Membership of SLC through the letter dated 22.11.2019 marked P5(a). It

is noted that the background and reasons to reinstate the said Rule 5.1.2 are stipulated in the

said P5(a). The Petitioners seek a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the

said P5(a), P9(A) and P9(B).

The Respondents referring to the following provisions under the subheading League on page

15 of the SLC Tournament Hand Book, submit that the promotion to play in Major Club Tier

B Tournaments is subjected to the Tournament Rules and Regulations of SLC including

Rule 5.1.2 and thus, there cannot be any automatic entitlement for the Petitioner to play the

ensuing year.

The leader of the Final Points table will be declared Champions of the Governors

Trophy and qualify to be promoted to play Major Club Tier B Tournament in the

next Season, Subject to Rules governing the eligibility to play Major 1st Class

Tournaments specified in the Tournament Rules and Regulations of Sri Lanka Cricket

(Rule No. 5.1.2).

The Respondents further argue that the Petitioner's conduct following the reimposition of the

said Rule 5.1.2, on or around 10.12.2019, amounts to their acquiescence in respect of the

provisions of the said Rule. The attention of the Court has been drawn to the letter dated

10.12.2019 marked P6 written by the Club to the SLC requesting participation in the SLC

invitation T20 tournament. The Respondents submit that in view of the contents of the said

letter P6, the Club has admitted the limitations imposed against them because the Club is a

non-voting cricket club of SLC. Further, it is pointed out that the Club in the said P6 has

made a kind request to the SLC to extend an invitation to play in the said T20 tournament

instead of launching a protest. In support of these arguments, the Respondents rely upon the

judgment of this Court in K.G.D. Walter Abeysundera and Another v Secretary, Ministry

of Tourism and Others, CA/WRIT/371/2020, decided on 22.09.2021.

In addition to the above, the Respondents claim that the Petitioners are guilty of laches as

they have failed to apply to the Review Court diligently. Although the said Rule 5.1.2 was

reactivated in November 2019 the Petitioners have come before this Court almost after one

year and four months. The Petition of the Petitioners has been amended thereafter, in June

Page 6 of 7

2021. It is noteworthy that the Petitioners are not contesting the letter dated 20.12.2019 by

which SLC extends the invitation for the Club to participate in the "SLC invitation T20

tournament 2019/2020," provided that the Club agrees to abide by the SLC's rules and

regulations.

Another important objection raised by the Respondents is that the Petitioners are not entitled

to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court concerning the affairs mentioned in the instant

Application. The Respondents contend that the relationship between the SLC and the Club

is contractual and as such this Court cannot grant the reliefs as prayed for in the prayer of the

Petition. It is observed that this Court has constantly decided that the Court of Appeal has the

discretionary power to exercise writ jurisdiction even on a question arising out of a contract

of employment, inter alia, if the disciplinary order of a public authority was in breach of

statutory restrictions/ provisions. The question here is whether the relief sought by the

Petitioner can be granted on the basis that the impugned decisions were made exceeding the

power or without proper authority. In a similar vein, it is imperative to examine whether the

impugned decisions impede the due implementation of the provisions of Sports Law No. 25

of 1973.

The SLC is registered as a National Association of Sports in respect of the game of cricket to

meet the regulatory requirements set out in the said Sports Law No.25 of 1973. In view of the

relevant Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka, the Auditor-General may

audit the accounts of the SLC but, that solely does not give rise to a clear statutory flavour

that would allow one to invoke writ jurisdiction against the SLC. I take the view that the

question of whether one could invoke the writ jurisdiction against a body corporate such as

the SLC should be determined based on facts and circumstances of each case. One cannot

consider only the statutory flavour in the decision-making process of such an entity to be the

exclusive need for invoking writ jurisdiction. In addition to the element of statutory flavour

it is important to consider whether this court should be able to exercise its writ jurisdiction in

respect of such corporate body to the extent necessary to ensure giving due effect to the

relevant provisions of any statute passed by Parliament.

In light of the above, I am not convinced that the Petitioners are entitled to invoke the writ

jurisdiction of this Court quashing P5(a), P9(A) and P9(B) because neither the purported

Page 7 of 7

decisions in those documents nor the corresponding decision-making process meet any of the

previously stated requirements to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court. Anyhow, what

would be the consequence if this Court proceeded to quash the main impugned letter marked

P5(a)? To my mind, a mere annulment of P5(a) would not prevent SLC from passing

another resolution at a special general meeting to amend or suspend again the said Rule 5.2.1.

It is paramount that the decision taken at the special general meeting of the Membership of

the SLC (as stipulated in P9(A)) will remain unchanged even if this Court decides to quash

P5(a) which is a mere Notice to membership of SLC and Cricket playing non-member clubs.

In such a scenario I am reluctant to exercise the writ jurisdiction of this Court in respect of

the reliefs sought by the Petitioners.

However, for completeness, I am inclined to accept the submissions made on behalf of the

Respondents that the Petitioner's conduct especially through P6 and also not challenging

P7, amounts to acquiescence concerning the provisions of Rule 5.1.2. Moreover, I cannot

possibly overlook the delay in challenging the impugned decisions by the Petitioners and I

have reached this finding considering the overall circumstances of this case. The only other

effective relief sought by the Petitioner is for a writ of Prohibition preventing the Respondents

from holding any further SLC Major Tournaments in the Tier B category without the

participation of the Petitioners Club. In light of the reasons given above, I hold that the

Petitioners are not entitled to even a writ of Prohibition as prayed for in the prayer of the

Petition. In the circumstances, I proceed to dismiss the instant Application of the Petitioners.

Application is dismissed.
