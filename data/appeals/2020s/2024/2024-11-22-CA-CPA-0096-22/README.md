Facts of this case

3) The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

Respondent) had contended that he instituted action in terms of

section 66(1)(b) Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 before

the Magistrates Court of Welimada by way of a private plaint. The

dispute that had arisen between the Petitioners and the Respondents

concerned the possession of the land shown in Plan No. 4538 which

had been surveyed on 5th June 2003, which had been referred to in

page number 206 of the brief.

4) The said land was possessed under a permit obtained by the father of

both the 1st Petitioner and the Respondent. The said permit is referred

to on page number 284 of the brief. Both parties have admitted that

their father had demised in the year 2004.

5) Upon that, the Respondents possession was disturbed by the

Petitioners. The fence erected by the Respondent was removed by the

C.A. (CPA) 96 - 2022

7

Petitioners. Due to that there was an imminent danger of breach of

peace. On the said grounds, the Respondent had made several

complaints and filed a private information under the Provisions of

Section 66 Primary Courts Procedure Act.

6) However, as per Petitioners the Learned Magistrate had failed to

consider the facts pertinent to this action and had decided to grant the

possession to the Respondent.

7) Aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioners had filed a revision

application before the Provincial High Court of Badulla and Petitioners

contended that the Learned High Court Judge had erred and/or had

misdirected in Law and had failed to appreciate the facts pertinent to

the matter in dispute and dismissed the Petitioners application.

8) On the aforesaid grounds the instant revision application had been filed

by the Petitioners to obtain the reliefs prayed for in the revision

application dated 8th September 2022.

9) In their statement of objections, the Respondents have rejected the said

facts related to the petition and contended that the Petitioners have

suppressed material facts and misrepresented facts to court.

10) Further, the Petitioners have failed to demonstrate the existence of

exceptional circumstances that would warrant the invocation of the

revisionary jurisdiction of this court.

11) Moreover, the Respondents were wrongfully dispossessed by the

Petitioners.

12) The Learned Magistrate appropriately evaluated the facts and relevant

documents, leading to the rightful restoration of possession to the

Respondents. The Learned High Court Judge also upheld the said

Judgement.

13) Therefore, the Respondents have prayed that the application made by

the Petitioners should be dismissed.

Disputed facts

14) This matter was taken up for argument on 15th October 2024 and the

argument was concluded on the same date. Both parties agreed to file

written submissions, however, only the Respondents have filed their

written submissions.

15) In considering the facts, documents and the Orders made by the

Learned Magistrate and the High Court Judge to warrant the

intervention of this court in exercising its extra ordinary revisionary

powers, the following disputed points should be considered.

i) Had this dispute arisen to be considered under Section 66(1) of

the Primary Court Procedure Act and was there a breach of

peace?

ii) Had the Learned Magistrate and Learned High Court Judge

considered the facts related to this dispute acting under Section

66(1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act?

iii) If not, can the Petitioners get reliefs prayed for in the petition

dated 8th September 2022?

I. Had this dispute arisen to be considered under Section 66(1) of

the Primary Court Procedure Act and was there a breach of

peace?

16) Section 66(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act outlines the

conditions under which legal action may be initiated under the Primary

Court Procedure. Action may be initiated by a Peace Officer following a

complaint from a party in the event of a breach of the peace or a

dispute over land possession arises. Alternatively, when a breach of

peace occurs, a party may file an information by affidavit at the Primary

Court, as provided under Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

C.A. (CPA) 96 - 2022

17) In the present case, the Respondent initiated the action under the

Primary Courts Procedure by submitting private information to the

court.

18) Therefore, this inquiry had been taken up by the Magistrate and

concluded by way of written submissions.

19) On the said context, this action had been instituted under the Primary

Courts Procedure Act. The Learned Magistrate had satisfied that there

had been imminent breach of peace.

20) The Learned Magistrate had perused the complaints made to the Police

by the Respondents which included incidents such as, cutting down tea

bushes, damaging a parapet wall, threatening the Respondents,

provoking the parties which could have caused breach of peace.

21) Although, this action was filed in the Magistrates Court by way of a

private information there had been incidents between the Respondents

and the Petitioners that could have caused breach of peace in the event

the Learned Magistrate had not intervened.

II. Had the Learned Magistrate and Learned High Court Judge

considered the facts related to this dispute acting under Section

66(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act?

22) Upon reviewing the Learned Magistrates Order dated 29th September

2020, it is evident that the Magistrate issued a well-reasoned decision,

carefully considering the facts and relevant documents. In the Order,

the Magistrate examined the parties' rights, noting that the 1st

Petitioner and Respondent are siblings, and that the property in

question, a state land, had been issued a permit to their father, the

said permit is annexed to the case brief at page 284.

C.A. (CPA) 96 - 2022

10

23) The permit holder, Abdul Wahid, the father of the 1st Petitioner and the

Respondent had demised on 15th June 2004. The death certificate had

been produced at the Magistrate Courts as 1B2.

24) The argument put forward by the Petitioners counsel is that in the said

permit, Abdul Wahid had nominated his son Abdul Wahidu Jailabdeen,

the 1st Petitioner as the nominee.

25) However, after the demise of Abdul Wahid in the year 2004, the 1st

Petitioner had not taken any steps to obtain a valid permit in his name

as the nominee.

26) Therefore, given that 10 years have passed with respect of the title, it is

submitted that the decision should be taken by the Divisional Secretary

who is entitled to determine the rightful ownership of the disputed

land.

27) Thus, this is a separate matter to be decided in a different forum.

Beside these issues, the Learned Magistrate noted that, prior to the

incident; the Respondents had been in possession of the property for a

period of two months. This fact was corroborated by Plan No. 4538,

dated 5th June 2003, on which the Respondents and Petitioners had

divided their respective lots and had been in occupation for an

extended period.

28) It is important to note that under the Primary Courts Procedure,

Section 66 provides only a temporary measure to preserve the status

quo between the parties. The rights of the parties, based on the

available evidence, should ultimately be determined by the Divisional

Secretary, as the property in question belongs to the State.

29) The Learned High Court Judge had correctly considered the Order

made by the Magistrate and had decided that the Learned Magistrate

had correctly evaluated the facts and the documents and there was no

legal ground to revise the said Order under Revisionary Jurisdiction

C.A. (CPA) 96 - 2022

11

and/or no exceptional ground had been taken up by the Petitioners at

the High Court.

30) Therefore, I concur with the Learned High Court Judges decision to

dismiss the revision application filed by the Petitioners.

31) At this juncture, I am of the view that there is no reason to interfere

neither with the Order of the Learned Magistrate dated 29th September

2020 nor with the Order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 25th

August 2022.

III. If not, can the Petitioner get reliefs prayed for in the petition

dated 8th September 2022?

32) In the instant action, I have already analyzed that the Learned High

Court Judge and the Magistrate had acted in accordance with the

provisions of the Primary Courts Act No. 44 of 1979

33) In the petition, filed by the Petitioners the position that had been taken

up is that the Learned Magistrate and the High Court Judge had erred

and misdirected themselves when reaching at their conclusions.

However, I find no evidence of misdirection, nor do I believe that either

the Learned High Court Judge or the Learned Magistrate erred in law or

fact in arriving at their conclusions.

34) Based on available documents, Police investigation notes, complaints

made to the Police and on perusal of all the other documents, the

Learned Magistrate had issued a well-reasoned Order and arrived at

her conclusion correctly. The said conclusion was based on the

following judgements;

35) It is decided in the case of Ramalingam v Thangarah1;

In an inquiry into a dispute as to the possession of any land, where a breach of peace is threatened or is likely under Part VII, of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the

1 [1982] 2 SLR 694

C.A. (CPA) 96 - 2022

12

main point for decision is the actual possession of the land on the date of the filing of the information under section 66; but, where forcible dispossession took place within two months before the date on which the said information was filed. And in the case of Punchi nona v. Padumasena and others 2 Ismail J articulated as follows;

The primary object of the jurisdiction so conferred is the prevention of a breach of the peace arising in respect of a dispute affecting land. The Court in exercising this jurisdiction is not involved in an investigation into title or the right to possession which is the function of a civil Court. He is required to take action of a preventive and provisional nature pending final adjudication of rights in a civil Court. It was therefore incumbent upon the Primary Court Judge to have initially satisfied himself as to whether there was a threat or likelihood of a breach of peace and whether he was justified in assuming such a special jurisdiction under the circumstances. The failure of the judge to satisfy himself initially in regard to the threat or likelihood of the breach of peace deprived him of the jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry and this vitiates the subsequent proceedings. For these reasons, acting in revision, 1 set aside the Order of the Primary Court Judge dated 30.1.90.

36) In terms of the aforesaid decisions, it has been specifically stated that

the Magistrate should satisfy him or herself initially in regard to threat

or likelihood of a breach of peace. In failing, action under Section 66

cannot be maintained.

37) In addition to the aforementioned facts, it is imperative to note that, as

this is a revision application, there must be exceptional circumstances

present to justify the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction in granting

relief to a party.

2 [1994] 2 SLR 122

C.A. (CPA) 96 - 2022

13

38) In the case of Caderamanpulle vs. Ceylon Paper Sacks Ltd 3 ;

The existence of exceptional circumstances is a precondition for the exercise of the powers of revision.

As Per Nanayakkara, J;

when the decided cases cited before us are carefully examined, it becomes evident in almost all the cases cited, that powers of revision had been exercised only in a limited category of situations. The existence of exceptional circumstances is a pre-condition for the exercise of the powers of revision and absence of exceptional circumstances in any given situation results in refusal of remedies

And it is decided in Hotel Galaxy Ltd v Mercantile Hotel Management Ltd 4; as per Sharvananda CJ;

It is settled law that the exercise of revisionary powers of the Appellate Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist warranting its intervention.

39) Therefore, it is evident, as established by settled legal principles, that

exceptional circumstances must be demonstrated to justify the

consideration of a revision application. In the instant action, I find no

such exceptional grounds that would warrant the intervention of this

Court.

40) Thus, I do not see any reason to interfere with the Orders delivered by

Learned High Court Judge and the Magistrate. The Petitioners had

prolonged this matter for a long period unnecessarily and made this

application without any merit.
