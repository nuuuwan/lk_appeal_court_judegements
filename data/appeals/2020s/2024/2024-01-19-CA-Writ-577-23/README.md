S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

This Order is on the issuance of notices of this Writ Application to the Respondents.

The Court heard the learned Presidents Counsel in support of the Application. The

facts of the Application briefly as follows; the Petitioners are Companies duly

incorporated under the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007. By the Deeds of Transfer No.

660 dated 04.04.1995, No. 526 dated 11.04.1995 and No. 31 dated 01.11.2010 (marked

P3A - P3C respectively), the Petitioners became the owners of land in the extent of 113

Acres, 1 Rood and 1 Perch. The said Deeds were duly registered under Folio No.

Attorney General's Department, Colombo 12.

RESPONDENTS

C/39/150 in the Trincomalee Land Registry (P5). Since purchasing the land, the

Petitioners have been in possession and control of the land by cultivating various crops

in some portions of the land. The Petitioners hired security officers to guard the

premises and placed display boards in and around the land to show that the Petitioners

are the owners of the said land. On or about 03.09.2020, Batticaloa District Office of

the Land Reform Commission, the 1st Respondent purported to survey a part of the land

and the Petitioners objected to the survey being carried out by letter dated 03.09.2020

addressed to the Director of the District Land Reform Commission and letter dated

15.09.2020 addressed to the Chairman of the Land Reform Commission, the 2nd

Respondent marked as P11 and P13 respectively. By letter dated 28.09.2020 marked

P14, the District Land Reform Commission Office informed the 2nd Respondent that

the Petitioners raised objections in carrying out the survey and they tendered the

objections by the letter dated 15.09.2020 and requested the 2nd Respondent to take

necessary action. By the letter dated 16.10.2020 addressed to the Director of the District

Land Reform Commission marked as P15, the Petitioners reiterated their objection to

carrying out the survey. However, no action has been taken in this regard.

On or about 21.06.2021, an attempt was made by the 15th Respondent and an

agent/nominee of the 16th Respondent, to enter into the Petitioners land claiming that

they are the owners of land in extent of 18 Acres 2 Roods and 38.37 Perches. The

agent/nominee of the 16th Respondent made a statement to the police (P18) and in that

statement, he has stated that he bought the land from a person making a payment of Rs.

6

29 Lakhs to the Land Reform Commission, and he went with a surveyor to survey the

land, however, the Watcher did not allow them to enter into the land to carry out the

survey. The Petitioners subsequently came to know that the 1st Respondent had entered

into a Deed of Exchange No. 13918 on 09.03.2021 marked as P22 to exchange a plot

of land in the extent of 18 Acres 2 Roods and 38.37 Perches with the 13th and 14th

Respondents. The Petitioners allege that the 1st Respondent did not own the land

mentioned in the Deed of Exchange marked as P22 and the 1st Respondent has no right

or entitlement to deal with the same.

By the Petition dated 24.10.2019 to this Application, the Petitioner seeks reliefs, inter

alia, Writs of Certiorari quashing the purported decision of the 1st Respondent and/or

2nd to 12th Respondents and/or their predecessors in office to enter into the purported

Deed of Exchange marked as P22. However, the Petitioners neither specifically pleaded

a document containing the decision of the 1st Respondent to enter into the said Deed of

Exchange marked as P22 nor have produced any document containing such decision of

the 1st Respondent.

In Weerasooriya v. The Chairman, National Housing Development Authority and

Others1 Sripavan J. (as he then was) held that the Court will not set aside a document

unless it is specifically pleaded and identified in express language in the prayer to the

Petition. This position was followed in; Navaratnamany Sriramachandran Vs. Mr.

1 CA. Application No. 866/98, CA Minutes 08.03.2004.

Vethanayagam and Others2, Hatton National Bank PLC Vs. Commissioner General of

Labour and Others3, Binthi Huzaima Nizar and Others Vs. Minister of Lands and

Others4, H.K.D. Amarasinghe and Others Vs. Central Environmental Authority and

Others5. In view of the above-stated authorities, the relief sought in prayer (b) for Writ

of Certiorari quashing the purported decision of the 1st Respondent to enter into the

purported Deed of Exchange marked P22 must fail.

In prayer (c) to the Petition the Petitioners seek a mandate in the nature of Writ of

Certiorari quashing the execution and/or entering into the Deed of Exchange marked as

P22 by the 1st Respondent and in prayer (d) a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st and/or

the 2nd to the 12th Respondents to cancel and set aside the Deed of Exchange marked as

P22. It should be noted that, in the Petition the Petitioners have not mentioned a date

which they came to know about the execution of the purported deed marked as P22.

P22 had been executed on 09.03.2021 and this action was instituted on 04.10.2023 after

laps of more than 2 years from the date of execution of P22. The Petitioners have not

explained the delay in filling this Application.

In the case of Hopman and others Vs. Minister of Lands and Land Development and

others,6 it was held that,

2 CA (Writ) Application No. 369/2017; CA Minutes of 16.12.2019.

3 CA (Writ) Application No. 457/2011; CA Minutes of 31.01.2020.

4 CA (Writ) Application No. 141/2002; CA Minutes of 29.05.2020.

"The appellants have failed to give a satisfactory explanation for their conduct

and the delay in making their application to the Court of Appeal and hence that

Court cannot be faulted for exercising its discretion against the issue of the writ."

In Jayaweera Vs. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and another7

Jayasuriya, J. held that " A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the

issue of a Writ of Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter

of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a

discretion to deny him relief having regard to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver,

submission to jurisdiction - are all valid impediments which stand against the grant of

relief.

In Dissanayake Vs. Fernando8 and Sarath Hulangamuwa Vs. Siriwardane,9 it was also

held that undue delay stands against the grant of relief in a Writ Application.

By the Prayer (e) to the Petitioners seek a Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st to 12th

Respondents and/or their successors in office from taking any step against the

Petitioners in consequent to the purported decision of the 1st Respondent to enter into

the Deed of Exchange marked as P22. The relief sought in that prayer is ambiguous and

7 (1996) 2 SLR 70.

8 71 NLR 356.

9 (1986) 1 SLR 275.

9

the Court cannot understand about the relief sought in prayer (e). In such a situation the

Court cannot exercise its Writ Jurisdiction.

This Court is of the view that the Petitioners have a Civil law remedy concerning the

matter involved in the instant Application. Prerogative Writs are discretionary

remedies, and therefore, the Petitioners are not entitled to invoke the Writ jurisdiction

of this Court when there is an alternative remedy available.

In the case of Linus Silva Vs. The University Council of the Vidyodaya University10 it

was held that,

The remedy by way of certiorari is not available where an alternative remedy is

open to the petitioner subject to the limitation that the alternative remedy must be

an adequate remedy

It was held in the case of Tennakoon Vs. Director General of Customs11 that,

the petitioner has an alternative remedy, as the Customs Ordinance itself

provides for such a course of action under section 154. In the circumstances, the

petitioner is not entitled to invoke writ jurisdiction

Under the above-stated circumstances, I hold that the Petitioners are not entitled to the

reliefs sought in the Petition dated 07.11.2019. Therefore, the Court refuses to issue

10 64 NLR 104.

11 (2004) 1 SLR 53.

notices formally on the Respondents. Accordingly, the Application is dismissed. No

costs ordered.

Application dismissed.
