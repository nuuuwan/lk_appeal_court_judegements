S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner-Company (the Company) is a duly incorporated Company under the

Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007 and seeking a mandate in the nature of a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the Order dated 14.02.2020 marked as P-14 of the Commissioner

General of Labour, the 1st Respondent to pay the salary of the 3rd Respondent for the

period of 24.10.2017 to 08.10.2018. The 3rd Respondent, a shareholder of the Company

was employed as a Director of the Company with effect from 14.06.1991 and

3

subsequently appointed as the Managing Director. The Company informed its decision

by the letter dated 23.10.2017 marked as P-3 for him to retire from the service, giving

effect to the Company policy of retirement age of all employees which is 55 years. By

the letters sent to the Company dated 24.10.2017 and 06.11.2017 marked as P-4(a) and

P-4(b) respectively, the 3rd Respondent refused to accept the said decision of the

Company and made a complaint dated 27.11.2017 marked as P-5(a) to the 1st

Respondent in terms of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special

Provisions) Act, No. 45 of 1971 (as amended) (the Act). The Assistant Commissioner

of Labour, the 2nd Respondent commenced an inquiry regarding the complaint and

while pending the inquiry, the 3rd Respondent resigned from the post of Managing

Director on 08.10.2018. Based on the findings of the Inquiry, the 1st Respondent

decided that the Company has terminated the employment of the 3rd Respondent in

contravention of the provisions of the Act and in terms of Section 6 of the Act made

the Order dated 14.02.2020 marked as P-14 to pay Rs. 5,244,000/- which should be the

salary of the 3rd Respondent for the period from 24.10.2017 to 08.10.2018 without

ordering to reinstate since he has resigned from the service with effect from 08.10.2018.

The position of the Company is that it has not terminated the services of the 3rd

Respondent but it was a retirement affected due to attaining the age of retirement thus

he is not entitled to reliefs in terms of the Act. The learned Counsel appearing for the

Company argued that the Company has a policy regarding the age of retirement which

is 55 years and the same policy should apply to the 3rd Respondent since he is an

4

employee of the Company. He has drawn the attention of Court to the appointment

letters issued by the 3rd Respondent marked as P-8(h), P-8(i) and P-8(j) to two

employees of the Company giving effect to the Company policy that the retirement age

is 55 years.

The position of the 3rd Respondent is that there is no such Company policy for the senior

executives at the level of Directors to retire upon reaching 55 years and a letter of

appointment has not been issued to him which stipulates the retirement age. Further, it

is the practice of the Company to employ family members as Executive Directors of

the Company and his father and uncle had served in executive capacity in the Company

until they reached 65 and 73 years respectively. Therefore, the learned Counsel

appearing for the 3rd Respondent argued that the Company cannot unilaterally terminate

the employment of the 3rd Respondent based on the purported policy that he has attained

the age of 55 years and further that the termination of employment of the 3rd Respondent

is a violation of the provisions of Section 2(1) of the Act that the services of an

employee could not be terminated without his/her prior consent or the approval of the

Commissioner General of Labour.

It is the position of the learned SSC appearing for the 1st and 2nd Respondents that on

the complaint of the 3rd Respondent, an inquiry was held by the 2nd Respondent and the

recommendations of the 2nd Respondent upon the findings at the inquiry were approved

by the 1st Respondent on the Inquiry Report dated 24.01.2020 marked as 1R4 and

5

thereafter the 1st Respondent has made the impugned Order dated 14.02.2020 marked

1R5/P-14 upon the recommendations approved by him on 1R4.

The learned Counsel appearing for the Company argues that in the impugned Order

marked as P-14, the 1st Respondent has failed to make any reference to the inquiry held

by the 2nd Respondent and has failed to give reasons as to why the decision of the

Company to retire the 3rd Respondent could not be made effective. Upon referring the

Inquiry Report marked as 1R4 to the 1st Respondent he has approved the

recommendations of the 2nd Respondent on the 1R4 itself on 29.01.2020 before P-14

was sent on 14.02.2020. Since the 1st Respondent has approved the recommendations

of the 2nd Respondent on the 1R4 itself I hold that a necessity does not arise to refer to

the Inquiry conducted by the 2nd Respondent in the impugned Order marked as P-14.

Further, the reasons are given considering 1R4 for the conclusions of the 1st Respondent

mentioned in P-14. Hence, I hold that the above-stated arguments of the learned

Counsel appearing for the Company are devoid of merits.

It is the view of this Court that the Company has failed to satisfy the Court that the 1st

Respondent has violated any provisions in the Act in arriving at the decision mentioned

in the Order marked P-14 to be unlawful. Under the said circumstances, it is clear that

in the guise of a Writ Application, the Company is attempting to challenge the

correctness of the P-14 by invoking the Appellate jurisdiction of this Court. When

deciding Writ Applications, the Court has to see whether the decision sought to be

6

quashed is lawful or unlawful and it is not ought to exercise Appellate powers and

decide whether the impugned decision is right or wrong.

H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth on Administrative Law (11th edn) at page 26, states

thus;

The system of judicial review is radically different from the system of appeals.

When hearing an appeal Court is concerned with the merits of a decision; is it

correct? When subjecting some administrative act or order to judicial review, the

Court is concerned with its legality, is it within the limits of the powers granted?

On an appeal the question is right or wrong. On review the question is lawful or

unlawful.

In Best Footwear (Pvt) Ltd., and Two Others Vs. Aboosally, Former Minister of Labour

& Vocational Training and Others1, F. N. D. Jayasuriya, J. held that,

The remedy by way of certiorari cannot be made use of to correct errors or to

substitute a correct order for a wrong order. Judicial review is radically different

from appeals. When hearing an appeal, the Court is concerned with the merits of

the decision under appeal. In judicial review, the court is concerned with its

legality. On appeal the question is right or wrong. On review, the question is

whether the act or order is lawful or unlawful. Instead of substituting its own

decision for that of some other body as happens when an appeal is allowed, a court

1 (1997) 2 SLR 137.

7

on review is concerned only with the question whether the act or order under attack

should be allowed to stand or not.

Since the Application at hand is a Writ Application, the Court can only consider the

legality of the Order of the 1st Respondent marked as P-14 and whether it should be

allowed to stand.

Sub-section 1 of Section 2 of the Act provides that;

No employer shall terminate the scheduled employment of any workmen without-

(a) prior consent in writing of the workman; or

(b) prior written approval of the Commissioner.

Accordingly, it is clear that if an employment of a workman is terminated without

obtaining prior consent of the workman or the prior approval of the Commissioner, such

termination is illegal, null and void and will have no effect whatsoever. In the instant

Application, the Company has neither obtained the consent of the 3rd Respondent nor

the approval of the 1st Respondent to terminate the employment of the 3rd Respondent.

Section 5 of the Act reads as follows;

where an employer terminates the scheduled employment of a workman in

contravention of the provisions of this Act, such termination shall be illegal, null

and void, and accordingly shall be of no effect whatsoever.

8

In the case of Onally Holding PLC Vs. Minister of Labour2 where an employee of a

Public Leasing Company made an application to the Commissioner General of Labour

alleging that his employment was unjustly terminated by the company, Sriskandarajah

J. (P/CA) held that, if the position of the company is that the employee has reached the

age of 67 and that he is unable to carry out his duties as Maintenance Manager, and if

the responsibility warrants him to be of sound mind and memory and be physically

competent to manage several employees, and that he cannot at his age satisfactorily

carry out these responsibilities, and that it will severely prejudice the company to

continue to permit the employee to serve in the company, it would have presented these

facts to the Commissioner and would have obtained prior written approval of the

Commissioner to terminate his services. The fact that there is no retirement age

mentioned in the letter of appointment does not mean that the services of the employee

cannot be terminated at a given time when he reaches an age where he cannot serve the

company efficiently. As I have observed above, it is the duty of the company to comply

with the provisions of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special

Provisions) Act in terminating the services of an employee.

As per the above-mentioned legal provisions and the decision of the Court, it is clear

that the termination of employment of the 3rd Respondent in the instant Application is

illegal, null and void and accordingly will have no effect whatsoever.

Section 6 of the Act reads thus;

Where an employer terminates the scheduled employment of a workman in

contravention of the provisions of this Act, the Commissioner may order such

employer to continue to employ the workman, with effect from a date specified in

such order, in the same capacity in which the workman was employed prior to such

termination, and to pay the workman his wages and all other benefits which the

workman would have otherwise received if his services had not been so

terminated; and it shall be the duty of the employer to comply with such order.

In the case of Lanka Multi Moulds (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Wimalasena, Commissioner of Labour

and Others3 where a British national was employed on a contract basis for 3 years, the

employer terminated the employment of the workmen before the expiration of 3 years

and the Commissioner ordered reinstatement with back wages for 17 months. The

Court of Appeal affirmed the order that the termination of employment is illegal for

want of prior consent of the workman under Section 2(1)(a) of the Act. The court

quashed the order for reinstatement and reduced the back wages to 13 months (the

balance period of the contract of three years). Fernando J. held that,

I hold that "may" in section 6 confers a discretion on the Commissioner; that

"and" must be interpreted disjunctively; and that the Commissioner had the power

to order payment of wages and benefits for the balance period of the 2nd

3 (2003) 1 SLR 143.

10

Respondent's contract without making an order for reinstatement. The Court of

Appeal was therefore entitled to order such payment when setting aside the order

for reinstatement.

In the instant Application, since the termination of employment of the 3rd Respondent

is illegal, null and void and accordingly has no effect whatsoever, in terms of Section 6

of the Act the 1st Respondent is legally entitled to order to pay the salary of the 3rd

Respondent for the period mentioned in the impugned Order.

After considering all the above-stated facts, legal provisions and the authorities, I hold

that the impugned Order marked as P-14 is legal and should be allowed to stand.

In terms of Section 17 of the Act, the proceedings at any inquiry held by the

Commissioner for the purposes of the Act may be conducted by the Commissioner in

any manner, not inconsistent with the principles of natural justice, which to the

Commissioner may seem best adapted to elicit proof or information concerning matters

that arise at such inquiry. The Company do not argue that the principles of natural

justice were violated at the Inquiry held by the 2nd Respondent. When considering the

Inquiry Report marked as 1R4 and the Inquiry proceedings marked as P-7 it is clear

that opportunities had been given to both parties to present their respective cases.

Therefore, the Court can be satisfied that the impugned Order marked as P-14 has been

made according to law.

11

Considering all the above-stated facts and circumstances, I hold that the impugned

Order marked as P-14 of the 1st Respondent is in conformity with the provisions of the

Act and cannot be considered unreasonable, unfair and ultra vires and therefore it

should not be quashed. Since this Writ Application is without merits, I dismiss the

Application. No costs ordered.

Application dismissed without costs.
