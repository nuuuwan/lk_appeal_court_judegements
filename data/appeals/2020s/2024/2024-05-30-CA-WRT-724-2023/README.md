Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. Counsel: Kuvera De Zoysa, P.C with Samuditha Kumarasinghe, instructed by Sanjay Fonseka for the Petitioner.

Yuresha Fernando DSG with Dr. R. Gunaratne SC for the 1st and 2nd Respondents Hasanthi Welikale for the 3rd Respondent. Supported on : 06.02.2024 Written Submissions on : 09.04.2024 (by Petitioner) 25.04.2024 (by 1st and 2nd Respondents) Decided on : 30.05.2024 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner supported this Application in support for issuance of formal

notices and interim relief as prayed for in prayers (g) and (h) of the Petition.

This Court heard the Leard Presidents Counsel for the 1st to 3rd Respondents

as well. Thereafter, the parties were permitted to file written submissions in

this regard.

This matter concerns the payment of gratuity to the 3rd Respondent by the

Petitioner who was charged for fraud/malpractices regarding

misappropriation of funds and thereafter, found to be guilty by the Petitioner.

The 3rd Respondent was employed by the Petitioner Bank as a Credit Officer

(Grade II) by a letter of appointment dated 15.03.1999. On or about

01.03.2005, the 3rd Respondent was promoted to the position of Chief

Manager of the Matale Branch of the Petitioner Bank. Subsequently, on or

about 20.09.2016, the 3rd Respondent was transferred to the Credit Division

at the Head Office of the Petitioner Bank. Upon reaching the age of 55 years,

the 3rd Respondent's services were extended on three separate occasions until

Page 3 of 8

the Board of Directors of the Petitioner Bank denied a fourth extension,

resulting in the termination of the 3rd Respondent's service on 21.11.2020.

During the period from 01.09.2016 to 31.03.2017, while employed as the

Chief Manager of the Credit Division at the Head Office of the Petitioner Bank,

the 3rd Respondent had facilitated the release of forty-nine (49) loan facilities

in total amounting to Rs. 71,090,000/- (Rs. Seventy-One Million Ninety

Thousand) to individuals purportedly employed by three private companies,

namely Masters Packaging (Pvt) Ltd, A & D Data Solutions (Pvt) Ltd, and Auto

Tech (Pvt) Ltd, which were later discovered to be fraudulent and non-existent.

Subsequently, the Internal Audit Division of the Petitioner Bank conducted a

preliminary investigation and submitted two interim reports dated

21.08.2017 and 28.08.2017, marked as "P6" and "P10" respectively. These

reports revealed that the applicants of the aforementioned loan facilities had

submitted forged and/or fraudulent documentation and identified fifteen (15)

officers of the Petitioner Bank, including the 3rd Respondent, as responsible

for the fraud.

It is submitted that the 3rd Respondent was subsequently issued a Charge

Sheet dated 20.11.2017, including thirteen (13) charges marked as "P13" and

a second Charge Sheet dated 14.08.2018, including twelve (12) charges

marked as "P14". Accordingly:

a. The 1st Disciplinary Inquiry relating to the 1st Charge Sheet marked as "P13"

against the 3rd Respondent commenced on or about 29.08.2018 and

concluded on or about 05.12.2019.

b. The 2nd Disciplinary Inquiry relating to the 2nd Charge Sheet marked as

"P14" against the 3rd Respondent commenced on or about 27.05.2019 and is

presently ongoing.

It is observed that while these matters were pending, the 3rd Respondent

submitted an application for an extension of service from 22.11.2020 to

Page 4 of 8

21.11.2021 by an application dated 03.07.2020 marked as "P18" to the

General Manager of the Petitioner Bank. The Board of Directors of the

Petitioner Bank, considering the two pending disciplinary inquiries against

the 3rd Respondent and the gravity of the said inquiries, declined the

application for an extension of service. As per the decision of the Board of

Directors on 20.11.2020, the service period of the 3rd Respondent ended on

21.11.2020. This decision was recorded in the minutes of the Board of

Directors of the Petitioner Bank dated 21.08.2020 and 20.11.2020, marked

as "P19". The 3rd Respondent was informed by letter dated 23.11.2020,

marked as "P20" that the application for an extension of service had been

denied, thus terminating the 3rd Respondent's service on 21.11.2020.

The Board of Directors of the Petitioner Bank, at a meeting held on

22.12.2020, had then resolved to deposit the gratuity payment of the 3rd

Respondent into the savings account of the 3rd Respondent and to freeze the

said gratuity deposit until the final decision by the Disciplinary Authority of

the Petitioner Bank regarding the aforementioned Disciplinary Inquiries

against the 3rd Respondent.

Dissatisfied with these steps, the 3rd Respondent filed a complaint against the

Petitioner Bank at the 2nd Respondent District Labour Office, Kandy South on

or about 31.12.2020.

In this backdrop, the Final Inquiry Report dated 14.12.2020 of the first

Disciplinary Inquiry concerning the First Charge Sheet, marked as "P13" had

been received by the General Manager of the Petitioner Bank on 29.01.2021.

The Acting General Manager of the Petitioner Bank, via letter dated

02.12.2021 marked as "P27" informed the 2nd Respondent that according to

the inquiry report of the formal inquiry, the third Respondent was found guilty

of six charges. Furthermore, the 3rd Respondent had been issued a second

charge sheet containing 12 charges on 14.08.2018, and the second

disciplinary inquiry had still been ongoing as of this date.

Page 5 of 8

Notwithstanding the two pending disciplinary inquiries against the 3rd

Respondent, the 2nd Respondent issued an order in favour of the 3rd

Respondent as evident in "P28" for payment of gratuity.

Thereafter, the Disciplinary Authority of the Petitioner Bank issued a

Disciplinary Order dated 19.10.2022 marked as "P29" finding the 3rd

Respondent guilty of all 13 charges wherein:

a. It was held that the services of the third Respondent stand terminated

with effect from 21.11.2020.

b. Further, it was held that a financial loss of Rs. 6,757,818/- had been

caused to the Petitioner by the third Respondent, and therefore, the

third Respondent's gratuity amounting to Rs. 2,677,434.80/- would be

set off against the said amount, with the remaining balance of Rs.

4,080,383.20/- to be payable in three monthly installments within

thirty days of receipt of the disciplinary order.

Being aggrieved by the impugned order and certificate of the 2nd Respondent

marked as "P28(i)" and "P28(ii)," the Petitioner Bank appealed had then to the

1st Respondent, namely the Commissioner General of Labour, by appeal

dated 17.01.2023, inter alia stating that the Petitioner Bank has proceeded to

exercise its rights under and in terms of Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity

Act and forfeited the gratuity payment of the third Respondent.

However, the 1st Respondent, by Order dated 28.04.2023 marked as "P32",

dismissed the appeal of the Petitioner Bank, citing inter alia that the forfeiture

of gratuity under Section 13 of Act No. 12 of 1983 does not arise.

The Petitioner pleads that the impugned order dated 28.04.2023 of the 1st

Respondent marked as "P32" was made assuming a jurisdiction which the

first Respondent does not possess, in contravention of Section 31B(1)(c) of the

Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended) and therefore, the order

is ultra vires. They assert that the matter should have been decided by a

Page 6 of 8

competent Labour Tribunal in terms of Section 31B(1)(c) of the Industrial

Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended) which provides as follows:

A workman or a trade union on behalf of a workman who is a member

of that union may make an application in writing to a labour

tribunal for relief or redress in respect of any of the following matters: ..

The question whether the forfeiture of a gratuity in terms of the

Payment of Gratuity Act, 1983 has been correctly made in terms

of that Act..

This Court further observes the following pertinent provisions of law with

regard to these disputes:

It is duly noted that the payment of gratuity to an employee may be forfeited

under and in terms of Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of

1983, which reads thus:

Any workman, to whom a gratuity is payable under Part ll of this Act

and, whose services have been terminated for reasons of fraud,

misappropriation of funds of the employer, willful damage to

property of the employer, or causing the loss of goods, articles or property

of the employer, shall forfeit such gratuity to the extent of the

damage or loss caused by him.

Further, the Petitioner Bank had been formed by the State Mortgage &

Investment Bank Law No. 13 of 1975, amalgamating the Ceylon State

Mortgage Bank and the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation. The

3rd Respondent is an employee of the Petitioner Bank as evidenced by

document marked as "P20". This Court observes that Section 74 of the said

State Mortgage & Investment Bank Law No.13 of 1975 provides as follows:

Section 74(1): The Board may make rules for or in respect of all or any

of the following matters;

Page 7 of 8

(a) all matters stated or required by this Law to be prescribed or for which

rules are authorized to be made by this Law;

(b) the issue, registration, transfer, redemption and cancellation of

debentures and all matters incidental to, or consequential upon, such

issue, registration, transfer redemption or cancellation;

(c) the forms to be used for any of the purposes of this Law.

In terms of Section 74(1) of the State Mortgage & Investment Bank Law No.13

of 1975, the Board of Directors of the Petitioner Bank had issued the

Disciplinary Rules of the State Mortgage & Investment Bank marked as "P1"

to regulate the disciplinary control and the conduct of all employees of the

Petitioner Bank. As an employee, the 3rd Respondent is bound by the said

rules. Rule 23.3 of the rules provides as follows:

23.3

.

.

Accordingly, it provides that if employees attain the age of retirement while

disciplinary proceedings are either contemplated or ongoing against them,

their retirement shall be subject to the outcome of such disciplinary actions.

Any subsequent disciplinary order issued may result in a reduction or

forfeiture of payments or gratuity, as deemed necessary.

In light of the aforementioned circumstances, the order of the first Respondent

is ex facie erroneous, necessitating the determination of essential questions

of law.

The Petitioner has established sufficient grounds for the issue of notice of the

Application on the Respondents. Furthermore, this Court is also satisfied to

issue the interim orders as prayed. Accordingly, I grant an interim order

staying the proceedings of the case bearing No. 44428/2023 in the Magistrate

Court of Kandy, pending the hearing and final determination of this instant

Page 8 of 8

Application as prayed for in prayer (g). I also grant an interim order until the

final determination of this instant Application, as prayed for in prayer (h)

restraining the 1st Respondent and/or the 2nd Respondent and/or the 3rd

Respondent and/or any one or more of them and/or their servants and/or

agents and/or their successors in office, from taking any steps to enforce the

impugned order and/or certificate of the 2nd Respondent dated 03.10.2022

marked as "P28(i)" and "P28(ii)" and/or the impugned order of the 1st

Respondent dated 28.04.2023 marked as "P32".

Notices are issued and Interim Orders (g), (h) granted.
