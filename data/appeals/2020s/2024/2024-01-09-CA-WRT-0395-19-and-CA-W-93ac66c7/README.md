conducting a preliminary inquiry against the Petitioner.

From 01.06.2016 the Petitioner has been functioning as the Director

GeneraloftheSouthernDevelopment Authority. According to the

internal Audit report, the Petitioner had committed serious financial

misconduct by misusing State funds and thereby violating the Provincial

Financial Regulations. Consequently, the 19th Respondent, the Chief

Secretary of the Southern Province, took steps to have a preliminary

inquiry conducted through the Chief Secretariat Audit Division. The

inquiry report dated 24.06.2019 is produced as R13. Accordingly, by

letterdated04.07.2019(P22),thePetitionerwasinterdictedfrom

services by the Governor of the Southern Province. The Preliminary

inquiry report dated 10-12-2019 marked as P25 was submitted by the

20th and 21st Respondent, and accordingly the Petitioner has been charge

sheeted on 08.06.2020 (P27).

The contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner is

thatthePetitioner,DirectorGeneraloftheSouthernProvincial

Development Authority (SPDA), is not deemed to be a Public Officer or

does not fall under the category of the Provincial Public Service, and the

Governor or the Public Service Commission has no power whatsoever,

regardingtheappointment,transfer,termination,interdictionor

disciplinary control regarding the said post. In terms of the provisions of

the SPDA Statute No. 01 of 1995, the 1st Respondent, SPDA is vested

with disciplinary control over the Petitioner. Hence, the said interdiction

and further steps taken thereafter by the Governor are ultra-vires,

arbitrary, unfair, capricious, unreasonable and irrational.

The contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the

Respondents is that the Southern Provincial Council stood dissolved on

01.04.2019 and the Office of the Chief Minister of the Province became

defunct. The Board of Management of the 1st Respondent was not

constituted and there was no subject Minister assigned to oversee the 1st

Respondent Authority. In this scenario, under Articles 154C and 154F of

the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, the

Governor is empowered to issue the letter of interdiction (P22) to the

Petitioner. However, the learned DSG submitted that the impugned

charge sheet (P27) was issued under the Authority of the Board of

Management of the 1st Respondent.

Moreover, the learned DSG took up the position that under Article 125 of

the Constitution, the legal issue of whether the Governor was empowered

to issue the letter of interdiction under Articles 154C and 154F of the

Constitution is to be referred to the Supreme Court and this Court has

no jurisdiction to determine the said question of law.

Page 6 of 10

Undisputedly, in terms of Section 24 of the SPDA statute, the Board of

Management of the SPDA is empowered to appoint, terminate, interdict,

and disciplinary control of employees of the 1st Respondent Authority. As

aresult of the dissolution of the Southern Provincial Council on

01.04.2019, the Office of the Chief Minister of the Province became

defunct, the Board of Management of the 1st Respondent was not

constituted and there was no Subject Minister assigned to oversee the 1st

Respondent Authority. As such, the 1st Respondent was not in a position

to take disciplinary measures against the Petitioner in respect of the

alleged serious financial misconduct and misuse of state funds by the

latter. The Internal Audit Report (R1) recommended that steps be taken

against the Petitioner as expeditiously as possible against the Petitioner.

In those circumstances, the Governor had taken steps to issue the letter

of interdiction (P22) and directed to hold a preliminary inquiry on the

said Audit Report.

The Constitution envisages the Governor of a Province playing an

overarching supervisory role to ensure the due administration of the

affairs of a province. Article 154B (11) of the Constitution imposes an

obligation on the Chief Minister to communicate to the Governor all

decisions of the Board of Ministers relating to the administration of the

affairs of the province. The Governor is also empowered to call for

information pertaining to the administration of the affairs of the province

from the Chief Minister. Article 154B (11) is reproduced as follows;

It shall be the duty of the Chief Minister of every Province

(a) to communicate to the Governor of the Province all decisions of

the Board of Ministers relating to the administration of the affairs of

the Province and the proposals for legislation ;

Page 7 of 10

(b) to furnish such information relating to the administration of the

affairs of the Province and proposals for legislation as the Governor

may call for ; and

Furthermore, under Section 27A of the Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of

1987 (as amended), the Governor is statutorily reposed with certain

residuary powers to ensure that the due administration of the affairs of

the Province continues unhindered in a situation where the relevant

Provincial Council has been dissolved, which reads thus;

Where a Provincial Council has been dissolved before the annual

financial statement for the financial year has been approved, or a

Provincial Council ceases, for any other reason to function, the

Governor may, notwithstanding anything in the preceding provisions

of this Part, authorise the issue from the Provincial Fund, and the

expenditure of such Funds, as he may consider necessary for the

administration of the province, until the expiry of a period of three

months from the date on which the new Provincial Council is

summoned to meet or the date on which the Provincial Council

resumes functioning.

The Court's perspective is that the Governor, utilizing his discretionary

executive authority under Article 154C of the Constitution, has taken

steps to suspend the Petitioner and initiate a preliminary inquiry. This

decision stems from an unprecedented situation where there is no

operational Provincial Council, Chief Minister, Board of Ministers, or

Board of Management of the Southern Provincial Development Authority.

The Governor's actions are based on the need to address the unique

circumstances created by the absence of these governing bodies at the

provincial level.Article 154C reads thus;

Page 8 of 10

Executive power extending to the matters with respect to which a

Provincial Council has power to make statutes shall be exercised by

the Governor of the Province for which that Provincial Council is

established, either directly or through Ministers of the Board of

Ministers, or through officers subordinate to him, in accordance with

Article 154F.

Article 154F of the Constitution reads thus;

There shall be a Board of Ministers with the Chief Minister at the

head and not more than four other Ministers to aid and advise the

Governor of a Province in the exercise of his functions. The Governor

shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such

advice, except in so far as he is by or under the Constitution required

to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion.

In the instant Application, when the Audit Report (R1) was produced to

the Governor stating that the Petitioner has been involved in serious

financial irregularities, the Governor in terms of the residuary executive

powers vested in him interdicted the Petitioner and directed to commence

a preliminary inquiry against the Petitioner for the due administration of

theSouthernProvince Development Authority which is within the

purview of the Constitution and the Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of

1987 (as amended).

This Court is mindful of the fact that the charge sheet marked as P27

has been issued under the authority of the Board of Management of the

1st Respondent, and therefore, challenging the charge sheet on the basis

that the same was issued by the Governor is erroneous.

Page 9 of 10

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the

Governor exercising his residuary executive powers under Articles 154C

and 154F of the Constitution is erroneous and misconceived in law.

Accordingly, it is clear that the central question to be determined by this

Court is whether the Governor can interdict the Petitioner with the

powers vested in him by the Constitution. Under Article 125 of the

Constitution, this Court has no jurisdiction to interpret the Constitution

which is exclusively vested in the Supreme Court. Article 125 reads as

follows;

The Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear

and determine any question relating to the interpretation of the

Constitution and accordingly, whenever any such question arises in

the course of any proceedings in any other court or tribunal or other

institution empowered by law to administer justice or to exercise

judicial or quasi-judicial functions, such question shall forthwith be

referred to the Supreme Court for determination. The Supreme Court

maydirectthatfurtherproceedingsbestayedpendingthe

determination of such question.

For the foregoing reasons, the Application is dismissed without costs.

Application dismissed. No costs.
