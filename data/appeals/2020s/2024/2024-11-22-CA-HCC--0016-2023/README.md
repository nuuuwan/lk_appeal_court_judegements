JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General under

Section 365B (2) (b) of the Penal Code for committing three counts of grave

sexual abuse on Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Sachini Hansika Dissanayake

between 01.12.2013 and 03.02.2014

The trial commenced on 30.11.2020. After leading all necessary witnesses,

the prosecution closed the case. The learned High Court Judge had called

for the defence and the Appellant had given evidence from witness box and

closed his case.

CA/HCC/16/23

The learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties before him and his predecessor, convicted the Appellant only on

the 3rd count and sentenced the Appellant to 10 years of rigorous

imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs.10,000/- subject to a default

sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment.

In addition, a compensation of Rs.100,000/- was ordered with a default

sentence of 12 months rigorous imprisonment.

The Appellant was acquitted from 1st and 2nd counts.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. During the argument

he was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows.

According to PW1 - the victim of this case, she had been about 10 years old

when she faced this bitter ordeal. When she gave evidence, she was 16 years

old and was schooling. The victim has two siblings and she had been in grade

05 when she encountered this incident. The Appellant was her class teacher

at B/Arawa Maha Vidyalaya.

The alleged incident had happened during the afternoon Mathematics class

conducted by the Appellant. The Appellant had called her behind the

teachers desk on several times and under the guise of helping her with

sums, has squeezed her breasts. Additionally, he had inserted his finger into

her vagina.

Due to fear and the respect placed on the Appellant she did not divulge these

incidents to anybody initially. The Appellant had also told her not to tell

anybody. As the victim could not bear these abuses anymore, she had

divulged these incidents to her mother on 04.02.2014. A complaint was

lodged at the Mahinyangana Police Station on 05.02.2014.

The JMO who had examined the victim had opined that the findings upon

conducting an examination of the genital area are consistent with the alleged

type of digital penetration as he had observed a superficial tear in the victims

hymen at the 3 oclock position.

After the closure of the prosecutions case, the defence was called, and the

Appellant denied the charges while he gave evidence form witness box.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant:

1. Did the learned High Court Judge fail to consider the inconsistencies

and contradictions between PW1s evidence and the short history given

to the Medical Officer.

2. Did the learned High Court Judge fail to properly evaluate the

prosecution evidence particularly on the consideration of

improbability.

3. Has the learned High Court Judge erred in law by considering the

portion of the statement made by the Appellant which were not marked

during the defence.

4. The learned Trial Judge erred in law by placing the burden on the

Appellant to prove his innocence.

In a case of this nature, the testimonial trustworthiness and credibility of

PW1, mainly the probability of the occurrence of events as recounted by her?

should be assessed with utmost care and caution by the Trial Judge. The

learned Trial Judge must satisfy and accept the evidence of a child witness

after assessing her competence and credibility as a witness.

In the first ground of appeal, the learned Counsel argued that the learned

High Court Judge misdirected himself about the medical evidence.

The learned Counsel drew attention to the history narrated by the victim to

the doctor. In her evidence she had said that the Appellant had inserted his

CA/HCC/16/23

5 | P a g e

finger into her vagina only on one occasion. But in her short history she had

said that the Appellant inserted his finger into her vagina several times.

Hence the Counsel argued that the evidence given by the victim is not

consistent with the history provided by her to the doctor.

The admissibility of the recorded history in the Medico-Legal Report as

evidence in criminal trials has been discussed in several decided cases.

In Gamini Dolawatte V. Attorney General [1988] 1 Sri. L. R 221 held that:

While a Medico-Legal Report is admissible in evidence under Section

414(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, hearsay evidence by way

of the case history embodied in such a report is not admissible as such

history is information not ascertained by the Doctor from his own

examination of the injured.

In Bhargavan v. State of Kerala AIR 2004 SC 1058 (Supreme Court of

India)

At para 20: So far as non-disclosure of names to the doctor, same is

really of no consequence. As rightly noted by the Courts below, his

primary duty is to treat the patient and not find out by whom the injury

was caused.

Although the victim had given evidence that the Appellant had inserted his

finger into her vagina only once, the doctor found a superficial tear in the

hymen at 3 Oclock position when he subjected the victim to a genital

examination. The doctor had opined that the findings from the examination

of the genital area are consistent with the alleged digital penetration.

CA/HCC/16/23

6 | P a g e

As the doctors findings are consistent with the evidence given by the victim

in court, there is no justification for undervaluing the victims testimony in

this case. Hence, this ground has no merit.

In the second ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellant contended that

the learned Trial Judge had not properly evaluated the evidence of the

Prosecution.

In this case, the creditworthiness of the evidence given by the victim did not

suffer at any stage of the trial. Although the victim said that her mother had

come to know the incident only from her aunt, her mother PW2 had said that

she came to know the incident from her daughter. This contradiction cannot

be considered an important one which affects the root of the case.

The learned DSG highlighting this evidence of the victim accurately

submitted that even if this was to be considered as a contradiction, it is not

forceful enough to shake the credibility of the victim or the core issues of the

case against the Appellant.

The learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence given by PW1

with caution and care and correctly held that her evidence is convincing and

cogent and sufficient on its own to prove the case against the Appellant.

Hence, this ground also has no merit.

In the third ground of appeal the learned Counsel for the Appellant

contended that the learned High Court Judge erred in law by considering the

portion of statement made by the Appellant which was not marked during

the defence.

The relevant portion is re-produced below:

The above portion of the judgment has not caused any prejudice to the

Appellant as the learned High Court Judge had only commented about the

defence evidence adduced in this case.

Although this is a misdirection, it had not caused any prejudice to the

Appellant.

Article 138 of The Constitution of Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka

states:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to

the provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an

appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact

or in law which shall be committed by the High Court, in

the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by

any court of First Instance, Tribunal or other institution

and sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal,

revision and restitution in integrum, of all cases, suits,

actions, prosecutions, matters and things of which such

High Court of First Instance, Tribunal or other institution

may have taken cognizance;

Provided that no judgment, decree, or order of any

court shall be revised or varied on account of any

error, defect, or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

the substantial right of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice. [Emphasis added]

CA/HCC/16/23

8 | P a g e

The above-mentioned provision of the Constitution clearly

demonstrates that misdirection can be disregarded only if such

misdirection has not caused any prejudice to the substantial rights of

the parties or occasioned a failure of justice. As such, the third ground

is also devoid of any merit.

In the final ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellant contended that

the learned Trial Judge erred in law by placing the burden on the Appellant

to prove his innocence.

In criminal law, the presumption of innocence is a fundamental

principle that requires the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused

beyond reasonable doubt.

The learned Presidents Counsel highlighting the following portion of

the judgment contended that the learned High Court judge had reversed

the burden of proof and had placed it upon the Appellant. The relevant

portion is re-produced below:

flfia jQjo" tlS ia:djrh me'id' 01 iy me'id' 02 m%;slafIam lr we;s w;r" biqre

keue;s wh me'id' 01 f.a iy me'id' 02 f.a {d;sfhl= jk njg Tjqkaf.a idlaIs

,e fkdue;'

Considering the above quotation from the judgement, it cannot be considered

that the learned High Court Judge had reversed the burden of proof. Hence

it has not caused any prejudice to the Appellant. As such this ground is also

devoid of any merit.

Considering the evidence led in this case and guided by the judgements

mentioned above, I conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which

CA/HCC/16/23

9 | P a g e

the judgement delivered by the learned High Court Judge on 02/12/2022

against the Appellant can be interfered upon. I therefore, dismiss the appeal.

Having considering the circumstances of this case, I order the sentence be

operative from the date of sentence namely on 02.12.2022.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgement to the High

Court of Badulla along with the original case record.
