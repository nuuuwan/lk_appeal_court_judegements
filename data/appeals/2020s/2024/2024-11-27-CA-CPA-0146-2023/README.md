Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application by the accused-appellant-petitioner (hereinafter referred

to as the petitioner) seeking to invoke the discretionary remedy of revision

granted to this Court by Article 138 of The Constitution.

The Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of Mawathagama Police has charged the petitioner

before the Magistrates Court of Pilassa Case No. 89548 for possessing 11,250

milliliters of illicit liquor, and thereby committing an offence punishable in terms

of section 47(1) of the Excise Ordinance.

The offence had allegedly been committed on 02-03-2020 at a place called

Kongoda Bridge within the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court of Pilassa.

The petitioner has pleaded not guilty to the charge preferred against him, and

after trial, the learned Magistrate of Pilassa, of the judgment dated 18-05-2022

has found the petitioner guilty as charged. Accordingly, he has been fined Rs.

25,000/-.

Page 4 of 14

After sentencing the petitioner, the learned Magistrate of Pilassa has ordered the

petitioner to show cause as to why the motorcycle bearing No- WP CQ-7037,

which was allegedly used in the commission of the offence, should not be

confiscated.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the petitioner has

preferred an appeal in terms of Article 154P of The Constitution to the Provincial

High Court of the North Western Province holden in Kurunegala.

The learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the North Western

Province holden in Kurunegala, after having heard the appeal, has dismissed the

same by the judgment dated 12-10-2023, on the basis that there exists no reason

to interfere with the conviction and the sentence of the petitioner by the learned

Magistrate of Pilassa.

The petitioner has preferred this application in revision seeking to challenge the

above-mentioned judgment of learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High

Court of the North Western Province holden in Kurunegala, as well as the

conviction of him by the learned Magistrate of Pilassa, on the basis that he has

exceptional grounds to challenge the said judgments by invoking the revisionary

jurisdiction of this Court.

The remedy for a person who is dissatisfied of a judgment pronounced by a Judge

of the Provincial High Court exercising the appellate jurisdiction granted in terms

of Article 154P of The Constitution has been statutorily provided in High Court

of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990.

If a person is dissatisfied by such a judgment, the proper remedy available for

such a person would be to seek Leave to Appeal from the same High Court to

appeal to the Supreme Court or seek Special Leave to Appeal from the Supreme

Court itself to challenge the appellate judgment pronounced by the High Court

of the Province.

Page 5 of 14

The petitioner, without adhering to the statutory remedy available for him has

filed this application in revision invoking the discretionary remedy of revision,

which is a special jurisdiction granted to this Court by the Constitution.

It is well-settled law that even in a situation where the proper remedy would be

filing an appeal, the Court of Appeal can exercise its revisionary jurisdiction in

a fit case where exceptional circumstances exists that warrant the intervention

of the Court.

In the case of Thilagaratnam Vs. Edirisinghe (1982) 1 SLR 56, it was held that,

Though the appellate Courts powers to act in revision were wide and be

exercised whether an appeal has been taken against the order of the original

Court or not, such powers would be exercised only in exceptional

circumstances.

It was held in Jonita Vs. Abeysekara (Sriskantha Law Report Vol IV Page 22),

The Court of Appeal empowered with revisionary jurisdiction in exceptional

circumstances even though the alternative remedies are provided.

In the petition filed before this Court, the petitioner has mentioned several

reasons as exceptional circumstances available for him to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Court. He has also explained the reasons for the delay in filing

this application before the Court.

When this matter was supported for notice, after having considered the facts and

the circumstances relevant to this case, this Court decided to issue notice of the

application to the complainant-respondent-respondent, as well as the

respondent-respondent, namely, the Hon. Attorney General.

The complainant-respondent-respondent, the OIC of Mawathagama police was

represented by the Hon. Attorney General and the respondents were allowed to

file their objections in relation to the application before the Court.

Page 6 of 14

When this matter was argued before the Court, this Court had the benefit of

listening to the learned Counsel for the petitioner, as well as the learned State

Counsel, who represented the respondent-respondents.

As I have stated before, this is a matter where the Court will interfere into the

impugned decision of the learned High Court Judge, as well as that of the learned

Magistrate, if this Court is satisfied that the petitioner has adduced sufficient

exceptional circumstances for this Court to interfere with the said judgments.

What constitutes exceptional circumstances had been defined over time by our

Superior Courts when pronouncing judgments in relation to the applications

which requires the Courts intervention using its discretionary powers of

revision.

It was held in the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Mercantile Hotels

Management Ltd (1987) 1 SLR 5 that,

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the appellate

Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist

warranting its intervention.

In the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Thamararatnam (Sriskantha Law Report

Volume IV page 47) it was stated that;

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the Court.

In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd Vs. Jayasekare (1997) 2 SLR 365, it

was observed,

Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has

occasioned due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only

when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice.

Page 7 of 14

I would also like to quote from the case of Sadi Banda Vs. Officer In Charge of

Norton Bridge Police Station (supra) which I find relevant in the above context.

The revisionary power of Court is a discretionary power. This is an

extraordinary jurisdiction which is exercised by the Court and the grant of

relief is entirely dependent of the Court. The grant of such relief is of course

a matter entirely in the discretion of the Court, and always be dependent on

the circumstances of each case. Existence of exceptional circumstances is

the process by which the extraordinary power of revision should be adopted.

The exceptional circumstances would vary from case to case and their

degree of exceptionality must be correctly assessed and gauged by the Court

taking into consideration all antecedent circumstances using the yardstick

whether a failure of justice would occur unless revisionary powers are

invoked.

At the hearing of this application, it was the contention of the learned Counsel

for the petitioner, when the petitioner was arrested and produced before the

Magistrates Court of Pilassa by way of a B-Report, the police had thought it fit

to give case numbers and fines imposed on the petitioner in relation to 34 cases

of previous similar offences against him. When the plaint and the charge sheet

was filed too, the police have attached same previous conviction report to the

plaint as well.

It was the position of the learned Counsel that as a result of the said action by

the police, when this matter was taken up for trial, the learned Magistrate was

obviously prejudiced, and therefore, the petitioner was denied a fair trial.

It was also contended by the learned Counsel that when PW-01, the police officer

who conducted the alleged raid where the petitioner was arrested gave evidence

before the Court on 15-03-2022, he has given evidence referring to the bad

character of the petitioner stating that the petitioner is a person who is engaged

in illicit liquor trade and a person very difficult to catch while engaged in illicit

liquor trade.

Page 8 of 14

He was of the view that the evidence of PW-01 was contrary to the provisions of

the Evidence Ordinance where character evidence cannot be led unless it is

relevant. He submitted that this was a clear violation of the fair trial principle,

which has caused prejudice to the petitioner.

Referring to the judgment, it was also submitted that the learned Magistrate has

failed to consider the defence put forward by the petitioner in its correct

perspective, and misdirected when it was determined that the accused has failed

to break the strength of the prosecution case.

It was the position of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the same legal

matters were pointed out to the learned High Court Judge when this matter was

argued before the Provincial High Court of the North Western Province holden in

Kurunegala. However, it was his position that the learned High Court Judge was

also misdirected when it was determined that what was stated as part of the B-

Report as to the previous convictions had not influenced the mind of the learned

Magistrate since she has not referred to previous convictions in pronouncing the

judgment.

It was also submitted that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected when

it was decided to disregard what was stated by PW-01 in his evidence as to the

bad character of the petitioner on the basis that it was not a reason to interfere

with the judgment of the learned Magistrate. It was pointed out that the learned

High Court Judge was misdirected again when the manner in which the learned

Magistrate has considered the defence of the petitioner was justified.

It was the submission of the learned State Counsel that although the previous

conviction record of the petitioner has been submitted to Court before he was

found guilty to the charge, since the learned Magistrate who heard the evidence

had the judicial mind to disregard irrelevant evidence, that fact has not caused

any prejudice towards the petitioner or has denied a fair trial towards him.

Page 9 of 14

He was of the view that the application of the petitioner should fail as he has

failed to establish sufficient exceptional circumstances that warrant the

intervention of the Court.

It is very much clear from the proceedings before the Magistrates Court of

Pilassa that, when the relevant B-Report was filed after the arrest of the

petitioner, the police has mentioned his previous conviction record in writing

along with the B-Report. The police had done the same thing when the plaint

and the charge sheet was preferred against the petitioner by attaching the

previous conviction record of the petitioner to the plaint.

This goes on to show that when the petitioner was charged before the learned

Magistrate of Pilassa, the petitioners previous conviction record was before the

Court, which was not something that is expected from a complainant when filing

a charge of this nature against an accused.

It is the view of this Court that whatever may be said on the basis that such a

procedure would not prejudice the accused person, informing the Court in

writing the previous conviction history of an accused person would definitely

have a detrimental effect towards an accused in deciding a case against him.

Apart from the above, when the OIC of Mawathagama Police was giving evidence,

the trial Court has permitted evidence in relation to the bad character of the

petitioner to go in as part of the evidence.

Section 54 of the Evidence Ordinance which refers to the previous bad character

as to its irrelevance reads as follows.

54. In criminal proceedings the fact that the person accused is of a

bad character is irrelevant, unless evidence has been given that he

has a good character, in which case it becomes relevant.

Explanation 1 This section does not apply to cases in which

the bad character of any person is itself a fact in issue.

Page 10 of 14

Explanation 2 A previous conviction is relevant as evidence of

bad character in such case.

E.R.S.R Coomaraswamay in his book the Law of Evidence Volume 01 at page

684 referred to bad character in the following manner.

Section 54 lays down the general rule that in criminal proceedings, the

fact that the accused has a bad character is irrelevant, except in the

exceptional cases mentioned therein. Evidence may not be given of the

accuseds previous convictions or misconduct on other occasions for the

purpose of supporting and argument that he is the kind of person who

would commit the crime charged. As Wigmore puts it, the rule, then,

firmly and universally established in policy and tradition is that the

prosecution may not initially attack the defendants character.

The desire for fair play and even indulgence has led to this rule. The

principle underlying the rule is that hardship is possible, as evidence of

bad character may lead the mind of the judge or jury away from the point

to be decided, namely, the guilt or innocence of the accused person in

regard to the particular offence which he is charged. The main ground is

prejudice.

At page 486 Coomaraswamy discusses the duties of a trial judge in such a

situation.

When evidence of bad character of an accused person has been led the

duties of the trial judge are as follows:-

(a) To stop such questions himself without waiting for any objection

from the accuseds counsel.

(b) If the question has been put by mischance, to direct the jury to

disregard it and not to let it influence their minds- to put it out of

their minds entirely. But as stated in R. vs. Norton, (1910) 2 K.B.

Page 11 of 14

500 Whatever directions be given to the jury, it is almost impossible

for them to dismiss such evidence entirely from their minds.

(c) If the position is realized and the counsel for the accused applies

for a fresh trial before another jury, to begin the trial again.

(d) The judge can order a fresh trial if it is impossible to say that

what conclusion the jury might arrive owing to the irregularity and

it being impossible to dismiss the impression from their minds. The

court of appeal would order a new trial if the statement is prejudicial

to the accused even where the judge has warned the jury to

disregard the questionable evidence.

Although the above mainly refers to the trials before a jury, I am of the view that

same should be equally applicable to cases where a trial is before a judge without

a jury, since it is a question of fair trial towards an accused.

I find that the learned Magistrate has avoided referring to the bad character

evidence led before her, but has considered it in a different manner on the basis

that it was a question put to PW-01 when he was cross-examined on behalf of

the petitioner.

I am of the view that since the entire case has been commenced and concluded

before the same Judge, it would also be the duty of the learned Magistrate to

shut out any evidence relating to bad character when the prosecution attempts

to lead evidence in that regard. I am of the view that when considering the bad

character evidence, together with the previous conviction record made available

to the Court at the very commencement of the case, it has contributed towards

the probable denial of a fair trial towards the petitioner.

I am unable to agree with the contention of the learned State Counsel that since

the learned trial Judge was a person of trained judicial mind, such prejudice

may not have been caused towards the petitioner.

Page 12 of 14

I am of the view that it is not only a judgment pronounced by a Court of Law ,

but it is also necessary to show that the proceeding before the Court was in

accordance with the law.

The next matter that needs consideration is the manner the learned Magistrate

has considered the defence put forward by the petitioner. It appears that the

learned Magistrate has considered the defence on the basis that the petitioner

has decided to make a dock statement when he was called upon for his defence

in order to avoid being cross-examined. Because the prosecution was unable to

cross-examine the petitioner on the position taken by him in his dock statement,

the prosecution had no opportunity of examining him in order to test the

truthfulness of his defence, and therefore, the strength of the prosecution case

has not been diminished because of the mere statement by the petitioner.

It needs to be noted that this is not the manner in which a statement made by

an accused person from the dock should be looked at by a trial Judge. It is trite

law that an accused person is entitled to make a statement from the dock when

he was called upon for a defence, and such a statement, although not made

under oath or subjected to the test of cross-examination, has evidential value. If

such a dock statement provides a reasonable explanation as to the evidence

against him or creates a reasonable doubt as to the prosecution case, he is

entitled to have that benefit of doubt in his favour.

The position in Sri Lanka as to the value that can be attached to a dock statement

by an accused was considered in the case of Queen Vs. Kularathne (1968) 71

NLR 529.

The Court referred to King Vs. Vellayan Sittambaram (1918) 20 NLR 257 and

Queen Vs. Buddharakkita Thero (1962) 63 NLR 433 and expressed their

agreement with the view taken in the latter case that the unsworn statement

must be treated as evidence subject to its infirmity referred to therein. The Court

held that the Jury must be directed that:

Page 13 of 14

a. The statement must be looked upon as evidence, subject to the infirmity

that the accused had deliberately refrained from giving testimony, and

therefore, was not subject to an oath or cross-examination;

b. If they believe the unsworn statement, it must be acted upon;

c. If it raised a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case for the

prosecution, the defence must succeed; and that it should not be used

against another accused.

I am of the view that the learned Magistrate was misdirected when the dock

statement made by the petitioner was determined on a different footing, as I have

stated before.

When the petitioner preferred the appeal against his conviction before the

Provincial High Court of the North Western Province holden in Kurunegala, it

appears that the learned High Court Judge too has decided to justify the

conviction on the basis that it has not caused prejudice towards the petitioner.

However, I am of the view that by allowing the character evidence against the

petitioner to be led, as well as allowing his previous conviction record to be

known before he was found guilty, a clear violation of the fair trial principle has

been occasioned towards the petitioner, which has not drawn the attention of

the learned High Court Judge.

It is correct to argue when the learned High Court Judge determined that the

learned Magistrate has considered the dock statement of the petitioner in the

judgment. However, it is the view of this Court that it had been considered not

in the manner it should have been considered, which makes the determination

in that regard unacceptable.

For the reasons considered as above, I am of the view that the petitioner has

established sufficient exceptional grounds for this Court to intervene into the

judgment of the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the

North Western Province holden in Kurunegala and also that of the learned

Magistrate of Pilassa, as both the said judgements cannot be allowed to stand.

Page 14 of 14

Accordingly, I set aside the judgment dated 12-10-2023 pronounced by the

learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the North Western

Province holden in Kurunegala, and also the judgment dated 18-05-2022

pronounced by the learned Magistrate of Pilassa.

I do not find this as a matter fit to order a retrial against the petitioner since the

relevant witnesses are police witnesses. Such witnesses, who will have the

advantage of studying their notes in that regard will have the obvious advantage

of correcting any previous shortcomings in the evidence, which will again give

rise to the question of fair trial towards the petitioner.

Hence, the petitioner is acquitted of the charge preferred against him.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the

Provincial High Court of the North Western Province holden in Kurunegala and

also to the Magistrates Court of Pilassa for information and necessary

compliance.
