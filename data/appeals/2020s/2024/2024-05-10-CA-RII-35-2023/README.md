Petitioner

The petitioner argues, that, her deed is not pending partition as the original

deed in the above pedigree is dated 1973, prior to the institution.

The above is not correct.

Section 66 of Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 says, that,

Sale, lease or mortgage pendente lite is void.

66.

(1) After a partition action is duly registered as a lis pendens under the Registration of Documents Ordinance no voluntary alienation, lease or hypothecation of any undivided share or interest of or in the land to which the action relates shall be made or effected until the final determination of the action by dismissal thereof, or by the enter of a decree of partition under section 36 or by the entry of a certificate of sale. (2) Any voluntary alienation, lease or hypothecation made or effected in contravention of the provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall be void: Provided that any such voluntary alienation, lease or hypothecation shall, in the event of the partition action being dismissed, be deemed to be valid. (3) Any assignment, after the institution of a partition action, of a lease or hypothecation effected prior to the registration of such partition action as a lis pendens shall not be affected by the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section.

Hence deeds executed after the registration of the lispendence are invalid,

unless the partition action is dismissed.

But the lispendence must be registered in the correct folio.

The petitioner says that the lispendence was not registered in the correct folio.

5 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

Then again, she says, the folio M 1234/147 was damaged. X.13

He deeds were registered in M 1042/43, M 3133/140 and B 268/92.

Her applications made to the District Court, Provincial High Court exercising

civil appellate powers and to the Supreme Court were of no avail.

The written submissions of the 15B and 16B defendant respondents state,

among other things, that, the decision in Somawathie vs. Madawala 1983 will

not apply as Mr. [R. B.] Madawala was a co owner.

A co owner is a person who has some right on the land. The petitioner too says

she has a right. The application of the prohibition in section 66 of Partition Law

to her deeds after the registration of lispendence, is a question to be

determined considering the evidence pertaining to the destruction of the folio in

which the lispendence was registered.

For the provisions of section 66 to come into effect, there must be a duly and

physically registered lispendence. If the folio was not in extant after the

purported registration how can a buyer come to know about the pendency of

the partition action?

This is a matter to be decided by the court without summarily dismissing the

petitioners application based on a single section of Partition Law, section 48

and its parts.

This Court noticed all the parties to the partition action. Their presence was

personally recorded by this Court on 08.11.2023. The proceedings/journal

entry of that day records each and every one who is present.

The court directed, in addition, to publish notices on each of the Gramasewaka

divisions in which the land is situated, as it is a fairly large land; and also in

the Divisional Secretariat and in the District Courts of Mt. Lavinia and

Nugegoda. It was from the cases in the District Court of Mt. Lavinia, the

6 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

District Court of Nugegoda was created towards the end of the first decade in

the present millennium.

Only the 15B and 16 B defendant respondents and 62(b) and 82(b)

respondents have objected.

The petitioner going to the Civil Appellate High Court and the Supreme Court

and those courts refusing her application is no bar for the exercise by this

Court of its powers of restitutio in integrum and revision.

As it has been shown by this Court in several orders where preliminary

objections of similar nature were raised, neither the Civil Appellate High Court,

nor the Supreme Court, with respect, have the power to restore. The Civil

Appellate High Court does have the power of revision, which, it had not

exercised in the petitioners application due to a misconception.

Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardena vs. Hector Perera, Officer in Charge, Police

Station, Kollupitiya and others S.C. Application 20/1983 was an

application filed in respect of an alleged violation of a fundamental right, where

Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardena alleged, among other things, that she was

unlawfully arrested by the OIC of Kollupiya Police Station. The IGP, the 02nd

respondent filed an affidavit from one Vinayagam Ganeshananthem, Sub

Inspector, to the effect that he and not the 01st respondent who arrested Mrs.

Vivionne Gunawardena because she had no permit to go in a procession.

Although Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardane countered this position, the Supreme

Court consisting of a three Judge bench did not believe her, but believed the

affidavit of Vinayagam Ganeshananthem and decided that the petitioners

fundamental rights have been violated as Vinayagam Ganeshananthem is

guilty of unlawfully arresting her.

Vinayagam Ganeshananthem then petitioned to the Supreme Court requesting

to set aside the said decision of the Supreme Court itself, as he was only a

witness (on affidavit) and he was not informed before finding him guilty and

7 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

therefore the rule audi alteram partem is violated. This second case was

decided by a Seven Judge bench of the Supreme Court, including the

incumbent learned Chief Justice. The decision was divided 05 to 02 and the

majority decided against Vinayagam Ganeshananthem.

The learned Chief Justice, N. D. M. Samarakoon, who wrote the leading

judgment of the majority said,

He submits that this caption read with prayer (a) to the petition

invokes a jurisdiction in revision which this Court does not have. One

has to look at the legislation which created this Court to find an answer

to this dispute. That legislation is to be found in the second Republican

Constitution of 1978. The Supreme Court which existed up to the

time of the first Republican Constitution of 1972 and which

continued to exist under that Constitution ceased to exist when the

1978 Constitution became operative. (Vide Article 105 (2) of the

Constitution). Its place was taken by the Court of Appeal (Vide Article

169 (2) of the 1978 Constitution). A new Supreme Court has been

constituted which is the highest and final Superior Court of Record.

(Article 118 of the Constitution).

The relevant portion of Article 169(2) says,

Unless otherwise provided in the Constitution, every

reference in any existing written law to the Supreme Court shall be

deemed to be a reference to the Court of Appeal.

Ranasinghe J., despite being in the minority of the 07 Judge bench judgment

referred to a case decided by Dias S.P.J. in 1950 which was on restitutio in

integrum and said,

The real basis upon which relief is given and the precise nature of

the relief so given by the Supreme Court upon an application made

to it for relief against an earlier Order made by the Supreme Court

8 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

itself was very lucidly and very effectively expressed by Dias S.P.J.

way back in the year 1951 in the case of Menchinahamy v.

Muniweera, (40). In that case, about six weeks after an appeal to the

Supreme Court from an interlocutory decree in the District Court was

dismissed by the Supreme Court, an application was made to the

Supreme Court, on 23.3.1949, " for revision or in the alternative for

restitutio-in-integrum" by the heirs of a party defendant, who had died

before the interlocutory decree was entered but whose heirs had not been

substituted in his place before the interlocutory decree was so entered. It

was contended on behalf of the respondents: that there was no merit in

the application: that if the relief sought is granted then the Supreme

Court would in effect be sitting in judgment on a two-Judge decision

of the Supreme Court which had passed the Seal of the Court that

the Supreme Court cannot interfere with the orders of the Supreme

Court itself. In rejecting these objections, Dias S.P.J., placed this matter

in its proper setting quite convincingly in the following words:

"In giving relief to the petitioner we are not sitting in judgment

either on the interlocutory decree or on the decree in appeal

passed by this Court. We are merely declaring that, so far as the

petitioner is concerned, there has been a violation of the

principles of natural justice which makes it incumbent on this

Court, despite technical objections to the contrary, to do justice."

So a seven judge Bench of the present Supreme Court, that came after 1978 had decided, that,

(i) It does not have the power of restitutio in integrum (ii) Its power of revision is very rarely exercised (iii) All references to the Supreme Court prior to 07th September 1978 are to the present Court of Appeal (Article 169(2)). (iv) In Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera, 1951, Dias S. P.J., (one of the finest judges this country produced) exercised the power of restitutio in integrum to set aside the judgment of the Supreme Court itself

9 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

The jurisdiction under Article 138(1) of the Constitution:

The Constitution is the Grundnorm. In applying the law on the directions set

by the Preamble to the Constitution, which not only refers to JUSTICE but also

to the ingredients of Rule of Law, convenience must yield to justice. The

words..in the Preamble makes it impossible for a Court to do the vice versa,

that is, to give in to convenience at the expense of justice. There are no fetters

imposed on restitutio in integrum by Article 138(1) of the Constitution. That

Article envisages,

(i) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution,

(ii) Subject to the provisions of any law

(iii) an appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law

and

(iv) sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio

in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and

things

There is no question, with respect, of the interpretation of this provision here.

There is no doubt whether it means A or B. There is no impediment in law in

its direct application. This Article describes the jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeal. Despite the side note in the very next Article, Article 139(1) saying

powers in appeal, the body of the article refers to the exercise of the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. Hence the exercise of the power of restitutio

in integrum must also be done according to law. As it was seen above the

term law is defined in Article 170. There is no statute on restitutio in

integrum. There is a direct affinity between subject toany law in Article

138(1) and according to law in Article 139(1).Hence, restitutio in integrum

must be applied under the Constitution in its purest form. That is the power of

Royal Prerogative delegated by the Emperor to the Preator. Its nature and

characteristics will be examined under the next section of this judgment.

The extension of restitutio in integrum to cover an illegality (i.e., ultra

vires):

It is said, as follows in regard to the position in United States in respect of what

is called restitutio ad integrum,

The Latin term restitutio in integrum translates to restoration to

original condition. It serves as one of the primary guiding principles in

common law negligence claims. When a plaintiff successfully proves

negligence, the principle implies that the amount of compensation

awarded should restore the injured party to the position they would have

been in if the tortious action had not occurred. This includes

compensating for direct expenses (such as medical bills and property

repairs), loss of future earnings due to the injury, and even the decrease

in expected standard of living and pain and suffering - Graham v. Egan,

which is cited as 15 La. Ann. 97, 98 (1860).

This is the Louisiana State Law Institute Reports.

It is also said, that,

In ancient Roman law, restitutio in integrum was a specific

method of praetor intervention in an otherwise-valid legal action

that was deemed especially unjust or harmful. Interestingly, this

concept also extends to European patent law, where it provides a means

of redress for applicants or patentees who have missed a time limit

despite exercising all due care. If the request for restitutio in integrum is

accepted, the applicant or patentee is re-established in their rights as if

the time limit had been duly met.

In regard to its scope, it has been said, that,

In classical Roman law, restitutio in integrum could be granted on

various grounds, including metus (fear), where the praetor and iudex

(judge) worked together to order restitution. It was a powerful tool in

11 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

the hands of the praetors to ensure fairness and justice in the legal

system of ancient Rome1.

Kupischs work in 1974, especially on pages 105107, challenged existing

views on this remedy. His insights shed light on how the praetor and iudex

functioned when ordering restitutio2.

In summary, Berthold Kupischs scholarship significantly enriched our

understanding of in integrum restitutio within the framework of Classical

Roman Law. His contributions continue to shape legal discourse in this field.

In the article Two unusual appellate remedies: revision and restitutio in

integrum in the law of Sri Lanka Jerold Taitz3 Senior Lecturer Faculty of

Law University of Cape Town and Attorney of the Supreme Court of South

Africa says that

Restitutio in Integrum originated in Roman law through the

imperium (supreme judicial powers) delegated to the praetors after the

expulsion of the kings. It has been described as the judicial termination

of the inequitable situation(created by the law per se) and the restoration

of the status quo

Restitutio in Integrum was used as a form of appeal against a valid

judgment or magisterial order made in terms of the law and which

caused inequitable loss or injury to a party. Cicero refers to the rescission

of a number of judgments originally granted by Verres as governor of Sicily.

The judgments were rescinded by his successor Metullus on account of

their having been founded initially on incorrect premises of law. A

further ground was that no proper trial had taken place as the court had 1Hommage Berthold Kupisch, In Integrum Restitutio under Classical Roman Law, Particularly on the Ground of Metus, and Berthold Kupisch, Jeroen Chorus * Universit de Leiden, https://www.academia.edu/42303353/In_integrum_restitutio_under_classical_Roman_law_particularly_on_the_ground_of_metus_and_Berthold_Kupisch 2https://www.academia.edu/42303353/In_integrum_restitutio_under_classical_Roman_law_particularly_on_the_ground_of_metus_and_Berthold_Kupisch 3https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA00104051_856

not been properly constituted. The following example of restitutio in

integrum being used as an appellate remedy is given by Engelsman. The

praetor set aside a decision on account of an error in the formula. It

would appear that although the formula was framed correctly in terms

of the contentions of the parties it contained an error which could

have led only to a wrong decision. [This is a question of jurisdiction or a

jurisdictional question, a wrong answer for which affects the jurisdiction of

the Tribunal] An aggrieved party had locus standi and could apply directly to

the praetor for relief. The intercession of an official was unnecessary in

regard to restitutio in integrum. The remedy was wide and could be invoked

in a number of situations. For example it could be granted to creditors who

suffered loss resulting from the debtor undergoing capitis diminutio

minima. This form of legal disability extinguished all the contractual debts

of the affected party. By virtue of the remedy the praetor restored the rights

of action to creditors. The power to grant restitutio in integrum was also

held by the emperor. He used the remedy inter alia to set aside

administrative decisions[This is administrative justice]eg. To pardon

Roman citizens who had been deported (deportio in insulam). As a

result of the pardon the citizen was restored to his patria potestas and was

said to be restitutus in integrum. [The parts within [ ] Square brackets

added in this judgment]

Therefore at the commencement too it was never a remedy available only in

regard to civil disputes. It is a basic remedy that covers the public as well as

the private law including criminal law. It is the judicial termination of the

inequitable situation (created by the law per se). Inequitable situations

created by law are not limited to civil law.

In Perumpuli Arachchige Sajith DilhanAlutwatte vs. Perumpuli Arachchige

BandutissaHenegamagedara C. A. 40/2009 dated 27.03.2009 His Lordship

Justice Chithrasiri opined that the whole of restitutio in integrum could be

13 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

included in revision. In C. A. RI 15 2018 02.11.2018 Justice M. A.

Samayawardhena said,

I must state that there is no magic in the word restitution, as the relief,

in my view, can also be sought in a revision application. Although, in

law, revision and restitutio in integrum are two different applications, in

practice, they go hand in hand, and, almost all the time, are sought in

combination4.

Hence the statement that all restitutio in integrum is included in revision could

be, with respect, a mostly correct statement as far as empirical5 observation is

concerned. But the magic in those words, so to speak, with respect, lies in

the jurisprudential origin of this remedy for it is the judicial termination of

the inequitable situation created by the law per se.

Hence the preliminary objections cannot be sustained. They are overruled.

The objecting respondents refer to Odiris Appuhamy vs. Caroline Nona 66 NLR 241.

This case is as interesting as Mrs. Vivionne Gunawardenas case.

Basnayake, C.J., with Abeyesundere, J., held, that,

Held (SRI SKANDA RAJAH, J., dissenting): Once interlocutory decree has been. passed in a partition action instituted under the Partition Act, a new party is not entitled, by invoking the provisions of section 48 (3) of the Act, to intervene and have the interlocutory decree set aside by the Court of first instance on the ground that the lis pendens has not been duly registered.

Sri Skanda Rajah J., dissented and said,

respectful agreement, two learned and experiencedJudges,

eminent in their countries, though their observations are " not

In Elliot v. Duchess Mill [(1927) 1 K. B. 182], which came up before the

Court of Appeal consisting of Lord Hanworth, M.R., Scrutton, L.J., and

Romer, J., at 201, Scrutton, L.J., commenced his judgment, " The Court,

with occasional assistance from counsel, took more than a day in

discussing this case . . . . ."

In The Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Hoffnung & Co., Ltd.,

(1928) 4 C. L. R. 39, which came up before the Full Court consisting of

Isaacs, Higgins and Starke, JJ., at 62, Starke, J., commenced his

judgment, " This is an appeal from the Chief Justice, which was argued

by this Court over nine days, with some occasional assistance from the

learned and experienced Counsel who appeared for the parties. The

evidence was taken and the matter argued before the Chief Justice in two

days. This case involved two questions, of no transcendent importance,

which are capable of brief statement, and could have been exhaustively

argued by learned counsel in a few hours7. "

This is a partition action filed on 21.5.1958, i.e., after the new

Partition Act 16 of 1951 came into operation. Interlocutory decree

was entered on 25.3.1960. On 15.3.1961 one Caroline Nona

(Respondent to this appeal), who was not a party to this action, filed

petition and affidavit alleging, inter alia, that this action, had not

been duly registered as a lis pendens, in that it was not registered in

the correct folio, and prayed that the interlocutory decree be set

aside. After inquiry the learned Additional District Judge made

mind at least partly could be cultivated in a man with proper judicial training. I am glad, that, I have finally come across with that phrase itself. 7 It appears, that, Justice Sri Skandha Rajah says this avoiding the commission of a breach of discipline.

order on 17.4.1963 setting aside the interlocutory decree on the

ground stated above. This appeal is from that order.

It seems appropriate to reproduce certain provisions of the Partition

Act:

Section 3 (1)-Every partition action shall be instituted by presenting

a written plaint to the court, . . .

Section 6 (1)-The plaintiff in a partition action shall file or cause to be

filed in court with the plaint-

(a) .... an application (in duplicate vide sub-section(2)) for the

registration of the action as a lis pendens addressed to the Registrar of

Lands . . .

Section 7-Where the plaintiff in a partition action fails to comply with

the requirements of .... section 6, the court may-

(a) return the plaint so that the plaintiff may, .... comply with those

requirements, or

(b) reject the plaint . . .

Section 8-Where the plaint in a partition action is accepted, the court

shall forthwith-

(a) cause to be inserted in each copy of the application for the

registration of the action as a lis pendens a reference to the number

assigned by the Court to the action, and transmit the application in

duplicate to the Registrar of Lands of each land registry in which the

action is to be registered as a lispendens ;

by a court under section 8 shall, upon registration of the action as a lis

pendens, return to the court the duplicate of the application duly

endorsed in the manner prescribed by the Registration of Documents

Ordinance. . . .

Section 12 (1)-After a partition action is registered as a lis pendens . .

Section 13 (1)-Where the court is satisfied that a partition action

Section 26-(deals with the entering of interlocutory decree).

Section 48 (1)-Save as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the

interlocutory decree entered under section 26 and the final decree of

partition entered under section 36 shall, subject to the decision on any

appeal which may be preferred therefrom, be good and sufficient

evidence of the title of any person as to any right, share or interest

awarded therein to him and be final and conclusive for all purposes

against all persons whomsoever, whatever right, title or interest they

have, or claim to have, to or in the land to which such decrees relate and

notwithstanding any omission or defect of procedure or in the proof of

title adduced before the court or the fact that all persons concerned are

not parties to the partition action ; and the right, share or interest

awarded by any such decree shall be free from all encumbrances

whatsoever other than those specified in that decree.

(2) The interlocutory decree and the final decree of partition

entered in a partition action shall have the final and conclusive effect

declared by subsection (1) of this section notwithstanding the provisions

of section 44 of the Evidence Ordinance, and accordingly such provisions

shall not apply to such decrees.

(3) The interlocutory decree or the final decree of partition

entered in a partition action shall not have the final and conclusive effect

given to it by subsection (1) of this section as against a person who, not

having been a party to the partition action, claims any such right, title or

interest to or in the land or any portion of the land to which the decree

relates as is not directly or remotely derived from the decree if, but only

if, he proves that the decree has been entered by a court without

competent jurisdiction or that the partition action has not been duly

registered under the Registration of Documents Ordinance as a lis

pendens affecting such land.

Section 70 (1)-The court may at any time before interlocutory decree is

entered in a partition action add as a party to the action, on such terms

as to payment or prepayment of costs as the court may order-

(a) any person who, in the opinion of the court, should be, or

should have been, made a party to the action, or

(b) any person who, claiming an interest in the land applies to

be added as a party to the action.

(2) Where a person is a party to a partition action and his

right, title and interest to or in the land to which the partition action

relates are sold, during the pendency of the partition action, in execution

of, or under, any decree, order or process of any court, the purchaser of

such right, title and interest at the sale shall be entitled to be substituted

for that person as a party to the partition action, and such purchaser,

when so substituted, shall be bound by the proceedings in the partition

action up to the time of the substitution.

From the provisions reproduced above the following emerge :-

(1) Where a plaint in a partition action is filed it may be either

accepted or rejected by the Court.

18 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

(2) If the Court accepts the plaint a number should be

assigned to it. From that moment it would be pending.

(3) Thereafter steps should be taken to register the action as a

lis pendens.

(4) Summons can issue only after the lis pendens is registered.

To put it another way, registration of lis pendens is a condition precedent

to the issue of summons.

(5) Before interlocutory decree the court may add parties.

(6) In section 48 (3) want of due registration of the lis pendens is

equated with such a fundamental matter as want of jurisdiction of the

court in the sense of the power to act at all.

It is elementary that every act of a court which lacks jurisdiction in the

sense that it has no power to act at all is void and not merely voidable.

Anyone who has even a passing acquaintance with the procedure in

the original courts would know that if, after the issue of summons, it is

discovered that the lis pendens has not been duly registered, i.e., not

registered in the correct folio, then the court orders that the lis pendens

be duly registered, i.e., in the correct folio. After that order is carried out

fresh summons is issued. This is done in the exercise of the Court's

inherent powers, though there is no special provision in the Partition Act

requiring this procedure to be adopted. In Wijeyesinghe v. Uluwita1[ 1

(1933) 34 N. L. R. 362 at 364.] Macdonell, C.J., said, " . . . .1 cannot

help thinking that a District Court has the power to recall process which

it has issued improvidently, that is to say, on information which is or

which is alleged to be insufficient and misleading. It seems clear from

section 839 that a District Courthas inherent powers, and the various

authorities cited to us in argument support this view. It would indeed be

extraordinary if such court has not the power of vacating an order which

19 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

had been obtained from it on insufficient or inaccurate information and

there is abundant authority that it has that power."

The reason for doing so is that want of due registration of lis

pendens has the same effect as failure to register the lis pendens at all

and renders the issue of summons and all further proceedings null and

void. Even an interlocutory decree entered under such circumstances

would be null and void.

If all the proceedings from and after the registration of lis

pendens are null and void, the resulting position would be that the

action is still pending, and any person who has not been made a party

will have the right to intervene and to be added as party.

In an unreported case, S.C. 74-B.C. (Inty.) Colombo 8115 P : S. C.

Minutes of 3.2.1961, Sansoni, J., with whom Tambiah, J., agreed, said, "

The learned District Judge has found that lis pendens was not duly

registered. In view of that finding, it appears to us that summons should

not have been ordered to issue on the defendants, since the correct

registration of the lis pendens was a necessary step to have been taken

by the plaintiff before such an order was made. We therefore set aside

the interlocutory decree entered in this case and all proceedings taken at

the trial. The case will go back in order that the plaintiff might register

the lis pendens correctly. Thereafter, summons may be issued on the

defendants, and the intervenient will also have an opportunity of putting

forward his claim. A fresh commission to survey the land must also be

issued. As all proceedings that have taken place since the filing of the

plaint are bad, proceedings must commence de now."

In Noris v. Charles1 [1 (1961) 63 N. L. R. 501.] Sinnetamby, J., with

whom H. N. G. Fernando, J., agreed, held that it is not open to a new

party to intervene to have a decree set aside on the ground that lis

pendens was not registered in the correct folio. The learned Judge took

20 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

the view that to permit this would be to unduly prolong partition actions

and thereby defeat the purpose of the new Partition Act.

Section 48 (3) restricts the grounds depriving an interlocutory decree of

its "final and conclusive" character to : (1) want of jurisdiction in the

court; and (2) want of due registration of lis pendens. The determination

of one or the other or both these will not take an unduly long time. There

was no such restriction under the old Partition Ordinance. Therefore, it

was that repeated interventions were possible and partition actions took

many years. But, once these matters are decided, there can be no further

interventions.

It behoves the court which enters a " final and conclusive "

decree, to satisfy itself that it had jurisdiction and/or the lis pendens

wasduly registered when such a matter is brought to its notice,

regardless of the source of information being an outsider and the stage at

which it is made aware. This power is inherent.

In considering the effect of section 48 (3), Sinnetamby, J., said at

503, " In the case of persons who are not parties to the action, however,

sub-section 3 provides, inter alia, that the fact that the lis pendens had

not been properly registered would deprive the decree of its final and

conclusive effect." With respect I would agree. But with respect I am

unable to agree with the learned judge's further statement, " This does

not mean that he is entitled to intervene and have the interlocutory

decree set aside." Why should a person wait till action is taken on the

decree which in reality is no decree at all ? Why cannot he go to the court

and intimate to it one or both these grounds ?In order to do so and to

prove his allegation he will have to be permitted to intervene.

Section 48 (3) is concerned with a person who was not a party to the

partition action. It only places the burden on a person who was not a

party to the partition action to prove want of jurisdiction in the court or

21 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

want of due registration of the lispendens, as the case may be. It does

not lay down the procedure he should adopt for doing so. It does not say

that he should wait till " steps are taken against him under the partition

decree " ; nor does it say that he should wait till " his proprietory rights

are in any way challenged in other proceedings ", as stated by

Sinnetamby, J., at 504 in Noris v. Charles (supra).

The observation of the learned judge that the question whether the lis

pendens was duly registered will arise only if steps are taken against

him under the partition decree carries with it the implication that, if

steps are taken under the partition decree, e.g., to be placed in

possession, he will be entitled to show in the partition action itself, that

there was want of due registration. If he can do so at that stage, why

should he not be permitted to do so without waiting till then ?

Section 70 is a permissive or enabling provision regarding addition of

parties before interlocutory decree is entered. It is not exhaustive. It

should not be construed as prohibiting the addition of parties altogether

after interlocutory decree regardless of its validity. In the absence of

express provision prohibiting the addition of parties after interlocutory

decree the Court will have to act on the principle that the non-

observance of an essential step such as due registration of lis pendens

renders the proceedings void and puts back the partition action to the

stage of the acceptance of the plaint by the court.

Due registration of lis pendens, like due service of summons on a

party, is an essential step. Failure to comply with either would not come

within the term "omission or defect of procedure" in section 48 (1).These

words should be confined to omissions or defects of much more venial

character as pointed out by Sansoni, J., in Siriwardene v. Jaya Sumana

1.[1 (1958) 59 N. L. R. 400]

22 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

This view derives support from the judgment of T. S. Fernando, J., with

whom Abeyesundere, J., agreed in Victor Perera v. Don Jinadasa1,[1

(1962) 65 N. L. R. 451.] which I discovered after judgment was reserved

and to which I have drawn the attention of My Lord the Chief Justice and

brother Abeyesundere. The caption reads thus :-

In partition suit No. 7059 R, who was added as a party, did not

take any action herself in respect of the suit and did not participate at

the trial. After interlocutory decree was entered she attempted to

intervene in the suit in order to obtain either a dismissal of the suit or an

exclusion of lots 1 and 2 in the corpus. Her attempt proved unsuccessful.

Thereafter she transferred her rights in lots 1 and 2 to V.P. Belying upon

this deed of transfer, V.P. instituted the present action No. 8576 claiming

a declaration of title to lots 1 and 2, citing as defendants all the persons

who had been allotted shares in the interlocutory decree which dealt with

lots 1, 2 and 3 as one corpus. He claimed that, inasmuch as the partition

action had not been duly registered as a lis pendens, his right to a

declaration of his title was unaffected by the interlocutory decree.

Held, that under section 48 (3) of the Partition Act the trial judge

was obliged to address his mind to the question of due registration of the

partition action as a lis pendens.

R. was already a party to the partition action 7059 when

interlocutory decree was entered. Therefore, if that was a valid decree or

the court had jurisdiction to enter it, not only R. but also her successor

in title V.P. would be bound by it and by the final decree. I have

examined the record in 8576, the issues, the learned District Judge's

answers to them and the petition of appeal and find that, inter alia, the

following points were before this Court for decision in appeal:

If lis pendens was not duly registered :-

23 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

(a) V.P., the appellant who derived title from R., would not be

bound by the interlocutory decree in 7059 in spite of section 48.

(b) The interlocutory decree could not operate as res

judicata because the court had no jurisdiction to enter it.

The question of due registration of lis pendens, to which this Court

directed the District Judge to address his mind, would arise only if R.

and, therefore, her successor in title V.P. were not bound by the

interlocutory decree. This judgment can be explained only on the footing

that if the lis pendens is not duly registered both the interlocutory and

final decrees do not have the " final and conclusive " effect sought to be

conferred on them by section 48 (1) and (2) even as regards parties to the

partition action. That would seem to be because due registration i& an

essential step and not an " omission or defect of procedure ".

The learned Additional District Judge was right in permitting the

respondent to intervene. All proceedings since the acceptance of the

plaint are bad. Therefore, proceedings should commence de novo. I

would dismiss the appeal with costs.[End of Quotation8]

It is true that by majority decision, the appeal was allowed in that case.

In a literal, realistic and dramatic sense of what goes around comes around,

the 15B and 16B defendant respondents cite Nonnohamy vs. Odiris Appu 68

8 From page 13 to 23 I have quoted the entire dissenting judgment of Sri Skandha Rajah J. For those who decry that it is too long what I have to say is (i) that since every passage of it was necessary to convey the logic and reason contained and if summarized or paraphrased it would not convey the same meaning and (ii) that judgment escaped attention of generations thereafter due to the label dissenting. The majority, with respect, is not always right and it is for the posterity to assess the truth of the opinion of the minority. In C. A. RII 46 2023 dated 15.02.2024 I have argued that both stare decisis and cursus curiae are matters of practice (conclusion of the reasoning at page 64 of that judgment). The importance of dissenting opinion in shaping up the legal landscape of a country and in that case in respect of one of the richest and most influential, United States of America, is depicted in Melvin I. Urofskys Dissent and the Supreme Court: Its Role in the Court's History and the Nation's Constitutional Dialogue, Pantheon books 2015, which is also available at the book shop in the Supreme Court in Washington D. C.

Justice, Sansoni. Melanie Claude Sansoni had been the District Judge of

Tangalla; and incidentally, this partition action, that his lordship decided, was

also from the District Court of Tangalla.

Chief Justice Sansoni said,

After final decree was entered in this partition action, the appellant

petitioned the District Court to set it aside on the grounds (1) that the

lispendens had not been duly registered, and (2) that the plaintiff's

proctor had not included the appellant's name in the declaration filed

under section 12 (1) of the Partition Act.

The District Judge dismissed the application for reasons the soundness

of which it is not necessary to examine.

We are of the view that the application to set aside the decree and to be

allowed to intervene could not possibly succeed, because no intervention

can be allowed after interlocutory decree has been entered.

Mr. Wijeyaratne argued that (1) the failure to register the action correctly

as a lis pendens and (2) the breach of section 12 (1) by the plaintiff's

proctor rendered the decree invalid, and entitled the appellant to have it

set aside.

For the reasons we have given in S. C. No. 414/62 (F)-D. C. Point Pedro

6611/P [[(1965) 68 N. L. R. 145.]] decided today, we are unable to accept

these submissions.

Justices T. S. Fernando and Abeyesundere agreed.

Sri Skandha Raja J., said,

After careful consideration of the arguments submitted to us from the

Bar and the judgment of My Lord the Chief Justice I am confirmed in

theview to which I ventured to give expression in the dissenting judgment

25 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

in the Divisional Bench case of Odiris Appuhamy v. Caroline Nona [1

(1964) 66 N. L. R. 241 at 244.]. The appeal should be allowed with costs.

G. P. A. Silva J., said, [Beginning of the Quotation]

I agree that the appeal should be dismissed. In the case S. C.

414/1962 (F)-D. C. Point Pedro-6611/P [ 2 (1965) 68 N.L.R. 145,] I have

disagreed with the decision of my Lord The Chief Justice and my brother

Judges who have concurred on the question whether a person can

intervene after the interlocutory decree has been entered and would have

expressed my disagreement in this appeal as well, if the only ground of

appeal was based on the question of law whether a person can intervene

after the interlocutory and the final decree.

In the instant case, however, the learned District Judge has, after

inquiry, held that the folio in which the lis pendens has been registered

was a continuation from another folio which too was a continuation from

another folio, according to the extracts of encumbrances produced in the

case. He accordingly concluded that there was no material to show any

irregularity in the registration of the lis pendens. In view of this

conclusion he held, correctly, in my view, that the appellant was not a

party to whom section 48 (3) would apply. In the circumstances, I do not

see sufficient reason to interfere with the decision of the learned District

Judge.[End of Quotation]

The Partition Act applicable in these cases was Act No. 16 of 1951. Its section

48(3) read as,

The interlocutory decree or the final decree of partition enteredin a

partition action shall not have the final and conclusive effectgiven to it by

subsection (1) of this section as against a personwho, not having been a

party to the partition action, claims anysuch right, title or interest to or

in the land or any portion of theland to which the decree relates as is not

26 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

directly or remotelyderived from the decree if, but only if, he proves

that the decree has been entered by a court without competent

jurisdiction or that the partition action has not been duly registered

under the Registration of Documents Ordinance as a lis pendens

affecting such land.

The corresponding provision of the present Partition Law No. 21 of 1977

is section 48(5). It does not mention of the registration of the

lispendence. In fact present section 48 nowhere refers to a lispendence.

It is pertinent, at this stage, to refer to the other case, the learned Chief Justice

and Justice G. P. A. de Silva referred to, [[(1965) 68 N. L. R. 145.]] It has also

been decided on the same day as Nonnohamy vs. Odiris Appu, 07th December

1965.

That case is, R. RASAH and others, Appellants, and M. THAMBIPILLAI,

Respondent, decided by the same five Judge bench who decided Nonnohamys

case.

Sansoni C. J., said, [Beginning of the Quotation]

The question arising on this appeal is the effect, on an interlocutory

decree entered in a partition action, of the failure to register the action

duly as a lis pendens under the Registration of Documents Ordinance.

The appellants petitioned the District Court to quash all the proceedings

on this ground, but the District Judge held that once interlocutory

decree had been entered no such relief would be given to them and

dismissed their application.

In two cases decided recently it was held that even if the lis pendens had

not been duly registered, the interlocutory decree entered under section

26 and the final decree entered under section 36 cannot be set aside. The

cases are-Noris v. Charles [1 (1961) G3 N. L. R. 501. ] and Odiris

Appuhamyv. Caroline Nona [2 (7964) 66 N. L. R. 241.]. According to

27 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

these decisions there can be no intervention by a stranger to the action

who pleads such a defect in the registration. The former decision does

not refer to section 70 of the Partition Act, Cap. 69, but the latter does.

Section 70 (1) provides that the Court may at any time before

interlocutory decree is entered add as a party to the action-

(a) any person who, in the opinion of the court, should be, or should

have been, made a party to the action, or

(b) any person who, claiming an interest in the land, applies to be added

as a party to the action.

The effect of this provision is that no intervention can be permitted at

any stage after interlocutory decree has been entered. [End of the

Quotation]

His lordship the Chief Justice, then referred to the argument of C.

Ranganathan, Q.C., who appeared for the appellant. [Beginning of the

Quotation]

The argument for the appellants is that the interlocutory decree

does not exist so far as they are concerned, and therefore section 70

does not apply. The reasoning on which this argument is based is that

where the action has not been duly registered as a lis pendens, the

appellants are entitled under section 48 (3) to say that there is no valid

interlocutory decree.

To consider this argument one must have regard to the whole of section

48. Section 48 (1) reads :-

" Save as provided in sub-section (3) of this section, the

interlocutory decree entered under section 26 and the final decree

of partition entered under section 36 shall, subject to the decision

on any appeal which may be preferred therefrom, be good and

28 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

sufficient evidence of the title of any person as to any right, share

or interest awarded therein to him and be final and conclusive for

all purposes against all persons whomsoever, whatever right, title

or interest they have, or claim to have, to or in the land to which

such decrees relate and notwithstanding any omission or defect of

procedure or in the proof of title adduced before the court or the

fact that all persons concerned are not parties to the partition

action ; and the right, share or interest awarded by any such

decree shall be free from all encumbrances whatsoever other than

those specified in that decree."

I omit the definition of " encumbrance " which follows, as it has no

bearing on the matter under consideration.

Sub-section (3) provides that neither the interlocutory decree nor the

final decree shall have the final and conclusive effect given to it by sub-

section (1) "as against a person who, not having been a party to the

partition action, claims any such right, title or interest to or in the land

or any portion of the land to which the decree relates as is not directly or

remotely derived from the decree if, but only if, he proves that the decree

has been entered by a court without competent jurisdiction or that the

partition action has not been duly registered under the Registration of

Documents Ordinance as a lis pendens ".

Sub-section (2) is not relevant to the question at issue and I need not

consider it.

The terms of the relevant sub-sections show that whether a decree has

been entered in a court of competent jurisdiction or not, and whether the

action has been duly registered as a lis pendens or not, the onlyeffect of

any omission or defect in these respect is to deprive the decree of its final

and conclusive effect as against a stranger to the action claiming an

29 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

interest independently of the decree. He is not bound by it and is free to

attack it as being incorrect where it defines the rights of the parties.

There is nothing in section 48 or any other section of the Act to

support the argument that a decree which has either of the two

flaws mentioned in section 48 (3) is invalid. On the contrary, the

provision in section 48 (1) that " the decree shall be good and sufficient

evidence of the title of any person as to any right, share or interest

awarded therein to him ", is deliberately left unaffected. The decree is still

to be treated as being in force, and effective, though it is not final and

conclusive against the particular persons just mentioned. [End of

Quotation]

The judgment of the learned Chief Justice then comes to the question of the

non registration of the lispendence. [Beginning of the Quotation]

Mr. Ranganathan then sought to equate the wrong registration of a Lis

pendens with the non-service of summons on a party to the action, by

arguing that each constitutes a failure to take an essential step in

procedure. Even if it be conceded that the correct registration of a lis

pendens is an essential step in procedure which the Proctor for the

plaintiff, and perhaps also the Proctors for the defendants, should seek

to ensure, a wrong registration is still nothing more than an omission or

defect of procedure such as section 48 (3) specially provides for. It is in

no way to be compared with the non-service of summons on a party, for

that has always been recognised as offending the first principle of justice,

which requires that a party is entitled to be summoned and to be heard.

It is impossible to overlook, in this connection, the repeal of section 12 of

the Registration of Documents Ordinance, Cap. 101, by the Partition Act.

Section 12 had laid down that " a precept or order for the service of

summons in a partition action shall not be issued unless and until the

action has been duly registered as a lis pendens, "

30 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

We have now the much less stringent provision in section 13 (1) of the

Partition Act that " where the court is satisfied that a partition action has

been registered as a Rs pendens under the Registration of Documents

Ordinance " it shall order that summonses, etc., shall be issued to the

Fiscal. The Legislature cannot have overlooked the wording of the earlier

provision, or inadvertently failed to provide for due registration if that

was intended. Furthermore, the Partition Act itself shows that when due

registration is necessary it says so in express terms. For sections 51 and

67 speak of due registration, and the omission of that requirement in

section 13 (1) is significant.

Finally, Mr. Ranganathan who laid stress on the word " under" argued

that an interlocutory decree entered under section 26 and final decree

entered under section 36 can only mean decrees which ate regular in the

sense that they have been entered after all the requirements of the Act

have been obeyed, and that they are valid not merely in form but in

substance. This argument cannot be sustained in view of the very terms

of section 48 (1) which contemplate decrees entered despiteomissions or

defects of procedure, or inadequate proof of title, or non joinder of parties

who had an interest in the land. For the same reason I would hold that

registration of an action as a lis pendens under the Registration of

Documents Ordinance (as required by section 13 (1)) does not mean

registration in accordance with all the provisions of that Ordinance, since

due registration is not required by section 13 (1).

Before I conclude I ought to say that my judgment dated 3rd February

1961 in S. C. 74-D. C. (Inty.) Colombo 8116/P, which was not followed in

the two later judgments which I have cited, must be treated as wrong

and is now overruled.

I would dismiss this appeal with costs.[End of Quotation]

The appeal should be allowed with costs9.

G. P. A. Silva J., dissenting, said, among other things, that,

The entire question at issue revolves round sections 48 and 70 of the

Partition Act. Sub-section (1) of section 48 sets out in strong terminology

the finality attaching to an interlocutory and final decree in a partition

case filed under this Act, subject to the exception contained in sub-

section (3). Sub-section (2) seeks to fortify this finality by expressly

removing the exceptional circumstances in section 44 of the Evidence

Ordinance which would ordinarily affect the finality of any other

judgment. Sub-section (3), which is in the following terms sets out the

exceptional case referred to in sub-section (1) :-.

Here his lordship reproduced section 48(3) of Act No. 16 of 1951.

Thereafter, his lordship analysed that section as follows,

On an analysis of this sub-section the conditions which would prevent

an interlocutory decree from having that final and conclusive effect are :-

(i) the person to be affected should not have been a party to the partition

action,

9 This is the passage ipsisimaverba Justice Sri Skandha Rajah incorporated in the judgment of Nonnohamy vs. Odiris Appu at page 385 of 68 NLR which incidentally was given on the same day. This episode that took place on 07th December 1965, 58 years ago is interesting. Unfortunately, The Law Net does not have both these judgments. But Law Lanka have them.

(ii) he should claim any such right, title or interest to or in the land or

any portion of the land to which the decree relates as is not directly or

remotely derived from the decree, and

(iii) he should prove that the decree has been entered by a court

without competent jurisdiction or that the partition action

has not been duly registered under the Registration of

Documents Ordinance as a lis pendens.

G. P. A. Silva J., further said, [Beginning of the Quotation]

There being no dispute as to the existence of any of these conditions in

the instant case, I shall proceed to examine the question on the basis

that the appellant in this case fulfilled these conditions and was,

therefore, qualified to be a person to whom the final and conclusive effect

of the interlocutory decree did not attach. If one pauses to consider what

the resulting position will be, one will see that the law intended that such

a person should not be adversely affected. The only reasonable way hi

which his right, title or interest to or in the land can be preserved will, in

my view, be by permitting him to intervene. If any other view is taken

such as that the party aggrieved should be entitled to assert his rights as

against a holder of a decree in any steps which are sought to be taken,

under it, it can lead to results which are far from reasonable. In Noris v.

Charles[1 (1961) 63 N. L. R. 501 at 503.], Sinnetamby, J. stated in the

course of his judgment at page 503 as follows :-

" A person who was not a party to the partition action is not bound

by the interlocutory decree if the lis pendens had not been properly

registered. This does not mean that he is entitled to intervene and

to have the interlocutory decree set aside. His position would be

much the same as a person who is not a party to a vindicatory

action. He is unaffected by the decree and is entitled to assert his

rights as against the holder of the decree in any steps which are

33 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

sought to be taken under it. He is in exactly the same position as a

claimant to an interest in the land which had been partitioned

under the repealed Ordinance, where the final decree had not been

entered ' as hereinbefore provided'. "

Earlier in this judgment, Sinnetamby, J. expressed the view that the

Partition Act of 1951 sought to put an end to the considerable delay

occasioned by such interventions. While this was a very correct

observation, if I may say so with respect, it seems to me that the

main decision he took in the appeal was to some extent influenced

by this consideration. One has to be careful not to overstress the

importance of expedition in the disposal of a partition case to the

extent of overlooking the paramount consideration underlying such

a case, namely, to put an end to the various problems arising from

common possession and to give an unimpeachable title to the co-

owners. It is because of the strictly binding nature of a partition decree

once it has been entered that the law has taken great care to impose

certain safeguards by way of obligations on the parties, on the proctor,

and even on the court before the stage of the interlocutory decree so that

any party who has a claim of title, etc., shall be before court and that his

case shall not go by default. A necessary corollary to this consideration is

that the sanctity attaching to an interlocutory decree can only prevail

when all the necessary parties are before court. The finality given to such

a decree in section 48 (1) is also based on the broad assumption that all

the parties have been represented, despite the notwithstanding clause

which gives finality in spite of certain omissions. The notwithstanding

clause does not, in my opinion, give a licence to omit certain essential

steps. Whatever that may be, sub-section (3) definitely creates an

exception to the notwithstanding clause or, to put it in another way, it

expressly provides for two instances in which finality does not attach to

an interlocutory or final decree. The instance with which we are

34 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

concerned in this case is where a person, not having been a party to

the action, claims a share in the land through a title not directly or

remotely derived from the decree and is able to prove that the

lispendens was not properly registered. [End of Quotation]

At this stage, it is pertinent to consider the other case in the series which was

not examined up to now, Noris v. Charles[1 (1961) 63 N. L. R. 501 at 503.] This

is one of the cases Sansoni C. J., purported to follow in the majority judgment.

In S. D. NORIS, Appellant, and P. M. G. CHARLES and others, (1961) 63 NLR

501, which was a decision of two judges of the Supreme Court, where the

judgment was written by Sinnetamby J., (with the concurrence of H. N. G.

Fernando J., (later Chief Justice)) the court said, [Beginning of the Quotation]

Under the old Partition Ordinance, interventions were generally never

allowed after final decree was entered. The final and conclusive effect

given by Section 9 of the old Ordinance related to the decree that was

entered under Section6 in the case of an order for partition and under

Section 4 in the case of an order for sale. Once there was a confirmation

of the partition proposed by the Commissioner and final judgment

entered under Section 6, interventions were not permitted. A decree duly

entered under Section 6 would be final and conclusive against all parties

if in terms of Section 9 it was entered " as hereinbefore provided ". If the

steps taken prior to the entering of the decree under Section 6 were not "

as hereinbefore provided ", it did not give a party affected by the decree,

who was not a party to the action, the right to have the decree set aside.

It only gave such a party the right to dispute the conclusive effect of that

decree and to maintain that it was not binding on him. That was the

effect of the cases decided under the provisions of the old Partition

Ordinance. It was always open to a party after the interlocutory decree

had been entered and before final decree to intervene in proceedings

under the old Ordinance and trials had in consequence to be adjourned

35 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

from time to time as a result of successive interventions made sometimes

at the instance of an unsuccessful party. This followed as a necessary

consequence from the decisions of our Courts which refused to give to

the interlocutory decree entered under Section 4 the final and conclusive

effect contemplated by Section 9. It seems to me that the Partition Act of

1951 sought to put an end to the considerable delay occasioned by such

interventions. Section 48 of the new Act expressly provided that the

interlocutory decree entered under Section26 which I corresponds with

the interlocutory decree under Section 4 of the repealedOrdinance shall

have a final and conclusive effect. No intervention thereafter would

ordinarily be permitted and Section 48 further provided that both the

interlocutory decree entered under Section 26 and the final decree

entered under Section 36 shall "be good and sufficient evidence of title of

any person as to any right share or interest awarded therein to him and

be final and conclusive for all purposes against all persons whomsoever";

and it further went on to provide that this would be so "notwithstanding

any omission or defect of procedure or in the proof oftitle adduced before

the court or the fact that all persons concerned arenot parties to the

partition action ". This conclusive effect was subject 'to the provisions of

sub-section 3 to which I shall refer later.

It seems to me that by expressly denying the right of intervention on the

ground of "omission or defect of procedure or in the proof of title or the

fact that all the persons concerned are not parties to the partition

action", the new Act sought to negative the effect of any failure to

conform to the earlier essential steps contemplated by the words "as

hereinbefore provided" in Section 9 of the Partition Ordinance, as

interpreted by judicial decisions. The object of the legislature no doubt

was to enable partition actions to be brought to a speedy conclusion.

Under the old Ordinance, it was not uncommon for actions to be

pending for lengthy periods of time extending in some cases to as

36 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

much as 25 to 30 years and even more. Once the interlocutory decree

was made final and conclusive no intervention should ordinarily be

permitted thereafter, and a partition action would consequently be

brought to a much speedier conclusion.. The legislature at the same time

realised that persons may be adversely affected by the conclusive effect

given to both the interlocutory and the final decree and by Section 49 re-

enacted the provisions of the proviso to Section 9 of the earlier Ordinance

which gave such persons the right to bring an action for damages. In the

case of persons who are not parties to the action, however, sub-section 3

provides, inter alia, that the fact that the lis pendens had not been

properly registered would deprive the decree of its final and conclusive

effect. That is all that sub-Section 3 provides. A person who was not a

party to the partition action is not bound by the interlocutory decree if lis

pendens had not been properly registered. This does not mean that he is

entitled to intervene and have the interlocutory decree set aside. His

position would be much the same as a person who is not a party to a

vindicatory action. He is unaffected by the decree and is entitled to assert

his rights as against the holder of the decree in any steps which are

sought to be taken under it. He is in exactly the same position as a

claimant to an interest in land which had been partitioned under the

repealed Ordinance, where the final decree had not been entered " as

hereinbefore provided".

After judgment was reserved in the present appeal10, our attention

was drawn to the unreported case of Don Gardin Arangala v.

TuduhenageMethias et al. 2[S. C. 74 D. C, Inty. Colombo No. 8116 (P) S.

C. Minutes of 3.2.61.] wherein this court set aside an interlocutory

decree at the instance of a petitioner intervenient on the ground that lis

10 These words are omitted in the pdf available in the Law Net. May be the editor thought it inappropriate. But it was said so by Sinnetamby J.

37 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

pendens had not been properly registered. In a short judgment, Sansoni,

J. in that case, permitted the intervention. The effect of Section 48(3) was

not considered and I would, with great respect, disagree with the views

therein expressed.

There are, however, several cases where the Supreme Court, acting

in revision, has set aside interlocutory and even final decrees. I wish

to add that the powers of this court to act in revision are in no way

restricted by the provisions of the Partition Act. The present appeal

is not a case in which we should, in my opinion, act by way of

revision. [End of Quotation]

Coming back to Rasah vs. Thambipillai and referring to the dissent of G. P. A.

Silva J., His Lordship said, that, [Beginning of the Quotation]

There would be no purpose in making an exception in such a case

unless it were to give the party who is benefited by such exception an

opportunity to intervene and have his title investigated and his shares

allotted. If such a course is not open to him and if he is to follow the

course suggested in the judgment cited earlier he would either have

to file a rei vindicatio action against all persons who were allotted

any shares or, his rights as a co-owner not being extinguished, to

bring a fresh partition action. This would, in my judgment, lead to a

negation of the very object that the new Partition Act intended to

serve, namely, the expeditious disposal of partition cases. For,

instead of being allowed to intervene after the interlocutory decree was

entered which would be a comparatively early stage in this situation we

will have the curious position of an interlocutory decree having been

entered in the teeth of a claim having been brought to the notice of court

and the person affected filing another partition action or a vindicatory

action all over again.

38 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

For these and other reasons which are not relevant to this case, I

think that in referring to the interlocutory decree in the Act the

legislature had in mind that interlocutory decree to which no

exception was attached and which was unqualified in its scope.

Therefore, when section 70 (1) went on to provide for the point of

time before which a court may add a party, namely, at any time

before the interlocutory decree is entered, it must be deemed to

refer to an interlocutory decree in the normal case and not an

interlocutory decree which was qualified by the exception provided

in section 48 (3). For, if it is conceded that a person, who comes within

the exceptions provided in section 48 (3), can, by reason of the

inconclusive nature of an interlocutory decree or even the final decree so

far as he is concerned, file another partition action or a vindicatory

action in order to establish his rights which are protected by section 48

(3), it must surely stand to reason that he should be allowed to

intervene in the same action rather than be told that even though

his claim of title is sound he cannot intervene as the interlocutory

decree has been entered11. If he can bring an action long after an

interlocutory and a final decree and, if successful, disturb all the shares

allocated in the partition decree, a fortiori it must be possible for him to

intervene soon after the interlocutory decree. In such an event the

interlocutory decree will, by necessary implication, have to be set aside

and a fresh interlocutory decree will have to be entered after

consideration of the new claim of the intervening party. [End of

Quotation]

The absolute reason in the two paragraphs above stand testimony to the fact

that His Lordship has been underrated.

11 To say that, with respect however, is lopsided logic, to say the least.

What GardiyePunchihewageAmaraseela Silva, who later became the 34th

Chief Justice of Ceylon (for a very brief period12, preceded by Hugh Norman

Gregory Fernando and succeeded by Victor Tennekoon) said next makes one

think, that, the final judgment I wrote in the draft of this judgment to support

my argument, Mrs. SOMAWATHIE v. Mr. R. B. MADAWELA AND OTHERS

would not be necessary (with great respect to Justice J. F. A. Soza who

authored the same) unless for the purpose of giving numerical validity to the

dissenting views of G. P. A. Silva J., in the form of later acceptance of similar

logic in a majority judgment of the Supreme Court. It is as follows,

In short, one cannot, in my view, give a meaning to section 48 (3)

unless it be construed as enabling a person falling in the category to

which that sub-section refers to assert his rights which are kept alive by

that sub-section. The other view, to my mind, will result in a

situation which savours of being illogical and unreasonable. For, if a

person in such a case is not allowed to intervene and the parties to the

action have been allotted their respective shares of a land by the

interlocutory and final decrees, there would be nothing to prevent such

person who fell within the exception in sub-section (3) of section 48 and,

therefore, was unaffected by these decrees, from filing another partition

action on the basis of the original shares owned by him and the others

who were parties to the action. In such a case the object of

expeditious disposal will be completely defeated and there will be

two partition cases in respect of the same corpus. Even though the

earlier judgments have referred to the possibility of a vindicatory

12 His Lordship joined Attorney Generals Department in 1944 as Temporary Additional Crown Counsel. He was promoted Crown Counsel in 1947. In 1953 he joined the Ministry of Justice as assistant secretary and reverted to the Attorney Generals Department in 1954 as Senior Crown Counsel. It is stated that in 1960 he was appointed the acting permanent secretary of the Ministry of Justice and then in 1961 as the permanent secretary and in 1962 to the Bribery Commission in addition to his duties. These particulars are from the book The Supreme Court, first 185 years of Dr. A. R. B. Amerainghe. However, just as His Lordships full name is not mentioned there the only mention about his judicial career there is that he served a brief period as the Chief Justice in 1973. Unfortunately, judgments like the above, where His Lordships opinion has represented absolute logic and reason have not come to limelight.

action in such a situation, I can see serious difficulties in the way of

such an action which will make it even more chaotic than a second

partition action. The plaintiff in such a case will have to ask for a

declaration of title to his share from each of the parties to the

original partition action who have by now been allotted divided lots.

Either alternative, therefore, would lead to a curious, not to call an

absurd result. The only reasonable view, therefore, seems to me to

interpret the section in a way that will not lead to such a situation. This

situation will not arise if it is construed that an interlocutory decree

which is entered without due registration of the Lis pendens is not

the interlocutory decree which is in the contemplation of section 70

(1). Such a construction is, to my mind, not based on an argument of

convenience but on the special provision contained in section 48 (3).

Obvious as it may seem, chronologically too, section 48 precedes section

70 and the latter has, therefore, to be read subject not only to the main

provision but also to the exception contained in the former. To refrain

from doing so will be to ignore the exceptional circumstances

provided for in section 48 (3) and to leave the person who is

protected by this sub-section with only the feeling of satisfaction

that the interlocutory decree does not have the conclusive effect so

far as he is concerned but without any direction by the legislature

as to what step he should or can take to retrieve his position after

his lands have been apportioned in divided lots among his original

co-owners by a decree of court. It has to be borne in mind that the

remedies available to him are not those specifically provided by law

but only those which have been judicially interpreted as possible

remedies13. The judgment referred to earlier and the judgment in the

case of Gomis Appuhamy v. Caroline Nona[1 (1964) 66 N. L. R. 241.],

13 My order in C. A. Writ 41 2024 dated 09.04.2024 commenced saying, No court in this country ever, made a correct decision by going beyond the provisions of law laid down by the parliament in its wisdom. It did so, [made a correct decision] by adhering to the letter of that law. [Also George S Patton Movie]

which have decided that a person coming within the exceptions in

section 48 (3) can bring a separate action, do not base such a right on a

specific provision of law. A person who comes within the exception to

section 48 (3) should, therefore, be allowed to intervene at any stage and

the District Judge would have the power to set aside the interlocutory

decree entered by him for this purpose because it ceases to be an

interlocutory decree.

Not stopping there, His Lordship researched for the intention of the

legislature in bringing fourth several provisions of the Partition Act

including that dealt with the failure to properly register the lispendence,

having gone through the Hansards. [Beginning of the Quotation]

According to the Hansards, the Partition Bill was presented in the

Senate on 20th September, 1950, deemed to have been read the first

time, and ordered to be printed. On the 4th of October, 1950, the Bill

was read a second time and debated. On the 6th of October, 1950, it was

decided that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee. At that stage

section 48 of the Bill contained only sub-section (1) of the present Act

and not sub-sections (2) and (3). The Select Committee which consisted

of some eminent lawyers held several meetings at which a large volume

of evidence and suggestions was received. On the 20th of March, 1951,

the Report of the Select Committee was presented together with the

Minutes of the Proceedings, and was ordered to lie upon the Table. The

Select Committee reported that clause 48-which is the present section 48

(1)- should be amended by adding a proviso as follows :-

" Provided that it shall not prevent any person who is not a party to

the proceedings or privy of such party from impeaching such a

decree on the ground that the lis pendens has not been duly

registered or on the ground of want of jurisdiction." (Minutes of

Proceedings-20th January, 1951).

42 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

On the 27th of March, 1951, clauses 34 to 52 as amended by the Select

Committee were ordered to stand part of the Bill. It must, therefore, be

assumed that sub-sections (2) and (3) were inserted in section 48 to give

effect to the decision of the Select Committee. The result was that the Bill

laid down definitely that the validity of an interlocutory decree canonly be

impeached on the ground that the lis pendens in respect of the action

has not been duly registered or on the ground of want of jurisdiction. On

the same day the Bill was reported with the amendments, read the third

time, and passed. The second and third readings of this Bill were taken

up in the House of Representatives on the 6th of April, 1951, and passed

without amendment.

The history of the Partition Act, therefore, shows that the intention of the

legislature was to give an opportunity to a party who was prejudiced by

an absence of due registration of the lis pendens to impeach the decree.

It seems fairly clear that it was not the intention of the legislature to give

this same opportunity to the other categories such as mortgagees,

lessees, fidei commissaries, beneficiaries of trusts, etc. In my view, it is to

safeguard these categories whose rights may have been extinguished by

an interlocutory decree that specific provision has been made in section

49 empowering such party by a separate action to recover damages from

any party to the action by whose act, whether of commission or

omission, such damages may have accrued, and where the whole or any

part of such damages cannot be recovered from any such party, recover

such damages or part thereof from any other person who has benefited

by any such act of such party. The fact that there is no such specific

provision to protect a person who has been prejudiced by the failure to

register duly the lis pendens by empowering him to bring a separate

action appears to me to be an additional reason for thinking that the

impeachment of the interlocutory decree referred to by the Select

Committee was to be achieved by such a party being allowed intervention

43 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

after the interlocutory decree. The fact that what was sought to be

achieved was the impeachment of the interlocutory decree presupposes

that an interlocutory decree did exist in form earlier. Such interlocutory

decree would, however, be lacking in one of the essential attributes,

namely, the due registration of the lis pendens at the appropriate stage,

which decree for that reason will be invalid. The requirement in section

70 that a party should intervene before the interlocutory decree will,

therefore, have no application to a case where the lis pendens has not

been duly registered.

The question may arise here as to whether the remedy prescribed in

section 49 is or is not available to the category of persons referred

to in section 48 (3). I can see at least three reasons for answering

this question in the negative. In the first place, section 48 (3) refers

to a person who claims any such right, title or interest to or in the

land or any portion of the land to which the decree relates as is not

directly or remotely derived from the decree, while section 49 refers

to a party whose rights to the land to which the action relates have

been extinguished or who is otherwise prejudiced by the

interlocutory decree entered in the action. Secondly, a party under

section 48 (3) to whom the final and conclusive effect will not apply

can claim the benefit of this sub-section if, but only if, he proves

that the decree has been entered by a court without competent

jurisdiction or that the partition action has not been duly registered

as a lis pendens. There is no such requirement for one to claim a

benefit under section 49. Thirdly, if the remedy under section 49

was to apply to the category of persons mentioned in section 48 (3)

as well, I should have expected section 49 to have been part of

section 48 or at least to have some connecting link with section 48

(3) so as to include among the persons who can recover damages by

a separate action, the category referred to in section 48 (3). In all

44 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

humility and with the utmost respect to the views of my Lord The Chief

Justice and my brother Judges from which I have dissented I would say

that the interpretation which I have given above will, without doing any

violence to the provisions of the Act, enable the smooth working thereof

and where two views are possible it behoves14 the court to lean towards

the view that is conducive to the smooth working of an Act of the

Legislature.

As there was considerable argument on the question of registration

simpliciter and due registration of the lis pendens, it is apposite to say a

word or two on that aspect. When I state in the earlier paragraph that

the requirement of section 70 will have no application to a case where

the lis pendens has not been duly registered, I must not be understood to

mean that under section 13 of the Act it is necessary for a court to be

satisfied that a partition action has been duly registered as a lis pendens.

I think the omission of the word " duly " in this section and its presence

in section 48 (3) is of significance. Whereas under section 13 a court has

to be satisfied inter alia, that the step of registering the lis pendens has

been taken, under section 48 (3) the categories of persons mentioned

therein will be able to impeach the decree if only the lis pendens has not

been duly registered. That is to say, that, despite all the steps for the

registration of the lis pendens being taken by the plaintiff as required by

section 6, if some error has occurred in the actual registration in

consequence of which a necessary party would have been prejudiced,

such a party would be able to impeach the decree.

For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the

learned District Judge dated 31st August, 1962, as well as the decree of

sale dated 30th November, 1960, and make order that proceedings be

held de novo from the point of time of the registration of the lis pendens-

In view of the circumstances under which the learned District Judge

found himself constrained to decide this matter against the appellant, I

make no order for costs. [End of Quotation]

Hence they are identical.

But there is a distinction between section 48(3) of the Old (1951) Act and its

corresponding section 48(3) of the New (1977) Law. They are as follows,

1951

46 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

48 (3) The interlocutory decree or the final decree of partition entered in a

partition action shall not have the final and conclusive effect given to it

by subsection (1) of this section as against a person who, not having

been a party to the partition action, claims any such right, title or

interest to or in the land or any portion of the land to which the decree

relates as is not directly or remotely derived from the decree if, but only

if, he proves that the decree has been entered by a court without

competent jurisdictionor that the partition action has not been duly

registered under the Registration of Documents Ordinance as a lis

pendens affecting such land.

1977

48 (5) The interlocutory decree or the final decree of partition entered in a

partition action shall not have the final and conclusive effect given to it

by subsection (1) of this section as against a person who, not having

been a party to the partition action, claims any such right, title or

interest to or in the land or any portion of the land to which the decree

relates as is not directly or remotely derived from the decree, if, but only

if, he proves that the decree has been entered by a court without

competent jurisdiction.

The part referring to the Lis pendence is omitted.

But it is against all reason to say that it is because the Lis pendence is no

longer material.

The Lis pendence is the sentinel who guards the sanctity of the decree to be

entered in Rem.

It is omitted, because, as all writers of texts on interpretation agree the

legislature does not waste words.

The court is no longer competent when the Lis pendence is not duly registerd.

It is covered by the last eleven words highlighted in present section 48(3).

That is what Sri Skandha Rajah J. and G. P. A. Silva J., said.

The dissenting views gets at least an implied assent by a five Judge Bench of

the Supreme Court after 19 years where four judges, including a future Chief

Justice assented to a well composed judgment written by a judge who started

his career as a judge and had the experience of presiding in heavy partition

courts of the south of this island such as Galle, Matara and Tangalla, which

usually has complicated pedigrees too, Justice Joseph Francis Anton Soza.

The case is, celebrated, for good reason too, Mrs. SOMAWATHIEv. Mr. R. B.

MADAWELA AND OTHERS, that came up from another heavy partition area of

this country, Kurunegala, with its twin Kuliyapitiya.

Soza J., said,

Further it must be observed that after the Divisional Bench of the

Supreme Court had held in the case of Mariam Beebee v. Seyed

Mohamed (supra) that section 48(1) of the Partition Act No. 16 of 1951

(Cap 69) did not preclude the Supreme Court from exercising its powers

of revision in appropriate cases in respect of interlocutory and final

decrees entered under the Act, the then National State Assembly enacted

section 651 (1) of the Administration of Justice (Amendment) Law No. 25

of 1975 following closely the language of the old section 48(1) and

elaborating only on the meaning of "omission or defect of procedure".

Section 651(1) was later superseded by section 48(1) of the Partition Law

No. 21 of 1977 again retaining almost the identical language. It is well

recognised that where cases have been decided in Courts on particular

forms of language in a statute and in later statutes on the same subject

and passed with the same purpose and the same object, Parliament uses

the same forms of language which have earlier received judicial

construction, it must be presumed, in the absence of any indication to

48 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

the contrary, that Parliament intended the forms of language used by it

in the later statutes to be construed in the same manner as before. This

is, of course, not a canon of construction of absolute obligation but a

presumption that the Legislature intended the language used by it in the

later statute should be given the meaning already attributed to it by the

courts. As Sir W. M. James L. J. said in the case of Ex parte Campbell, In

re Catheart:

"Where once certain words in an Act of Parliament have received a

judicial construction in one of the Superior Courts, and the

Legislature has repeated them without any alteration in a

subsequent statue, I conceive that the Legislature must be taken

to have used them according to the meaning which a Court of

competent jurisdiction has given to them".

Soertsz S.P.J. cited this passage as authority for a like propo-sition

which he stated as follows in the Divisional Bench case of Perera v.

Jayewardene:

"....... it is a well established principle that when a word has

received a judicial interpretation and the same word is re--enacted,

it must be deemed to have been reenacted in the meaning given to

it".

The principle is an aid to construction and has been applied in a number

of cases, e.g. Barlow v. Tea., Greaves v. Tefield, and Webb v. Outrim. See

also Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes 12th edition (1969) pp.

71, 72: Craies on Statute Law 7th edition (1971) p. 141: Bindra on The

Interpretation of Statutes 6th edition (1975) pp. 257,258.

Accordingly the use by the Legislature in successive enactments of

a form of words substantially similar to the form of words in section

48(1) of the repealed Partition Act No. 16 of 1951, supports the

49 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

assumption that the Legislature intended to leave unaffected the

powers of revision and restitutio in integrum vested now in the

Court of Appeal in conformity with the construction adopted by

Sansoni C.J. in Mariam Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed (supra).

While on the subject of interpretation, I would like to refer to one further

matter. A point was made of the fact that in the new Partition Law No. 21

of 1977 a special reservation of the powers of the Supreme Court by way

of revision and restitutio in integrum has been included in subsection 3

of section 48 after insulating partition decrees from attack on grounds of

fraud and collusion. It was submitted that the maxim

expressiouniusestexclusioalterius applies. The maxim is that the

expressmention of one thing implies the exclusion of another. But it is

not of universal application and great caution must be exercised in

applying it. As Lopes, L. J., said in the case of Colquhoun v. Brooks

"It is often a valuable servant, but a dangerous master to follow in

the construction of statutes or documents. The exclusio is often

the result of inadvertence or accident, and the maxim ought not to

be applied when its application, having regard to the

subjectmatter to which it is to be applied, leads to inconsistency

or injustice."

Where the words expressed are intended to be illustrative only, the rule

is inappropriate (Maurice & Co. Ltd. v. Minister of Labour19). Nor should

the maxim be applied where what is expressed has been put in by way of

abundant caution (Bindra (supra) p. 137).

The saving of powers of revision and restitutio in integrum was

probably put into subsection 3 of section 48 of the Partition Law No.

21 of 1977 out of abundance of caution because of the decision of

the Privy Council in the case of MohamedalyAdamjee v Hadad

Sadeen. In this case the Privy Council following the decisions of

50 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

Burnside C. J. in Nono Hami v. De Silva and Sir Alexander Wood

Renton in Jayawardene v. Weerasekera, held that a partition decree

is conclusive against all persons whomsoever, and that a person

owning an interest in the land partitioned whose title, even by

fraudulent collusion between the parties, had been concealed from

the Court in the partition proceedings, is not entitled on that

ground to have the decree set aside, his only remedy being an

action for damages. Lord Cohen who delivered the judgment of the

Board went on to say that although the law abhors fraud and equity has

an undoubted jurisdiction to relieve against every species of fraud, still to

say that fraud vitiates everything obtained by it is too broad a

proposition. When adequate relief can be had at law and when in fact

there is a full, perfect and complete remedy otherwise, it is not the

course to interfere.

Whatever the reason for the saving of the powers of revision and

restitutio in integrum in section 48(3) of the Partition Law No. 21 of

1977, to say that these powers will not be available outside the area

of fraud and collusion would be to leave victims of miscarriages of

justice where there is no fraud and collusion without remedy15. The

expressiounius rule should not be applied where to do so would produce

a wholly irrational situation and gross injustice. Further there is nothing

to support an inference of legislative intent on the basis of the maxim

expressiouniusexclusioalterius. The omission to reserve specially the

powers of revision and restitutio in integrum of the Supreme Court in

section 48(1) of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 does not support the

conclusion that these powers that were already there have been impliedly

taken away. Nothing less than an express removal of these powers would

be required to achieve such a result.

15 This is very important

51 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

The pronouncement of Sansoni C. J. in regard to the revisionary

powers of the Court in Mariam Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed (supra)

therefore remains applicable even after the enactment of the

Administration of Justice (Amendment) Law No. 25 of 1975 and the

Partition Law No. 21 of 1977. The powers of revision and restitutio

in integrum have survived all the legislation that has been enacted

up to date. These are extraordinary powers and will be exercised only in

a fit case to avert a miscarriage of justice. The immunity given to

partition decrees from being assailed on the grounds of omissions and

defects of procedure as now broadly defined, and of the failure to make

"persons concerned" parties to the action should not be interpreted as a

licence to flout the provisions of the Partition Law. The Court will not

hesitate to use its revisionary powers to give relief where a miscarriage of

justice has occurred.

In the instant case R. B. Madawela the original intervenient was a

"person concerned". He was a necessary party. The deed in his favour

would have come to the plaintiff's notice when the Land Registry was

searched before her purchase from some of Ensina Perera's heirs. She

would have come to know of it had she caused a search to be made, as

any prudent plaintiff should have done, before she filed the present case.

But be that as it may. The declaration under section 12(1) of the

Partition Act No. 16 of 1951 which was the law in operation at the

time this case was filed, was a legal imperative. Section 12(1)

stipulates that afterthe partition action is registered as a lis

pendens the plaintiff must file or cause to be filed in the case a

declaration under the hand of a proctor certifying that he personally

inspected all the registration entries relating to the land which is

the subject--matter of the action and stating the names of all the

persons found by him to be necessary parties to the action under

section 5 of the Act

[The rest is not that material to this case]

Although Justice Sozas judgment is not 100% similar to the present one, it

shows, two matters of significance. They are,

(i) The proposition that, Where once certain words in an Act of

Parliament have received a judicial construction in one of the Superior

Courts, and the Legislature has repeated them without any alteration

in a subsequent statue. the same interpretation must be given, can

apply in converseto the omission in section 48(5) (1977 version) the

reference to non registration of the Lis pendence referred to in section

48(3) (1951 version) to say that, it is because a decree entered in

respect of a land for which the Lis pendence is not duly registered

cannot be considered, a decree in law (as the learned Ranganathan Q.

C. argued) that, that part is omitted in the present version and

(ii) Even otherwise, as per the argument in the earlier part of this

judgment, as a Seven Judge Bench of the present Supreme Court said

that Restitutio in Integrum is no longer with that court; and that every

reference in that respect in the old Supreme Court is a reference to

this Court (Court of Appeal); and as Article 138(1) specifically confers

that power in the Court of Appeal, in exercising that power, together

with that of revision, saved by present section 48(3); and recognized by

Five Judges of the present Supreme Court, in Justice Sozas judgment;

and also accepting the views of Jerold Taitz, which could be traced to

ancient Rome and to Johannes Voet16, in the judicial termination of

the inequitable situation (created by the law per se), for the present

situation was created by finality the law purports to give to a decree in

rem, this Court, deciding that the Lis pendence in this case has not

been duly registered to be the sentinel that safeguards the sanctity of a

decree in rem; and that the omission of the reference to the Lis

16 See C. A. RII 46 2023 of 15.02.2024

53 | C . A . R I I 3 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

pendence, that was in section 48(3) of Act No. 16 of 1951, in the

corresponding section 48(5) of Law No. 21 of 1977 is due to the fact,

that, it does not have to say specifically, because, when the Lis

pendence is not duly registered the decrees are not those entered by a

competent court; and hence are not endowed with the finality the

Law purports to confer, sets aside all decrees entered in partition

action 1144/P in the District Court of Mt. Lavinia, together with the

judgment and allow the petitioner to be added a party and directs the

learned District Judge to (having added her a party and allowed her to

file statement of claims) to proceed to hold a trial and the action

according to law17.

There is no order on costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

17 In as much as I wrote my first judgment in a case in the Magistrates Court of Gangodawila in 1994, almost 30 years ago; and the District Court of Nugegoda where I functioned as the District Judge, being an off shoot of the District Court of Mount Lavinia; and this judgment being one of my last, I consider it as my privilege, that this case comes from the old station to which I have a romantic attachment.
