Facts of this case

2) The Appellant had contended that the Appellant had filed an

application in the nature of a Writ of Habeas Corpus in the High

Court of Vavuniya concerning her son Kandasamy Ravichandran.

Acting in accordance with Article 141 of the Constitution, the High

Court Judge had directed the Magistrate of Vavuniya to conduct

an inquiry and report on the said matter.

3) Subsequently, the Learned Magistrate had submitted a report

stating the 2nd and 3rd Respondents in that application were

accountable for the said disappearance.

4) After receiving the said report from the Magistrate of Vavuniya, the

Learned High Court Judge by his Order dated 4th April 2018 had

dismissed the action of the Appellant.

5) Being aggrieved by the said Order of the High Court Judge, the

Appellant had sought this appeal seeking the reliefs prayed for in

the petition dated 23rd April 2018.

Disputed facts

6) This matter was taken up for argument on 18th September 2024

and on 3rd October 2024. After both parties had made their

submissions, the case was concluded and fixed for judgement.

7) Upon considering the arguments raised by the parties, on perusal

of the documents and written submissions, to arrive at a

conclusion, I have to evaluate the following disputes to determine

whether the Learned High Court Judge of Vavuniya had erred in

dismissing the Habeas Corpus application.

i) As per the Habeas Corpus application made by the

Appellant at the High Court of Vavuniya under Article 141

has the Magistrate conducted a comprehensive inquiry?

ii) Has the High Court Judge considered the facts pertinent to

the inquiry?

iii) If so, can this appeal be maintained?

i) As per the Habeas Corpus application made by the

Appellant at the High Court of Vavuniya under Article

141, has the Magistrate conducted a comprehensive

inquiry?

8) At the outset, I draw my attention to the definition of a Writ of

Habeas Corpus. The general meaning of the Writ of Habeas Corpus

is a legal procedure that allows an individual to challenge their

C.A. (PHC) 0110-18

5

unlawful detention or imprisonment. The term derives from Latin

and means that you shall have the body.

9) As per the book of Administrative Law1;

The Writ of Habeas Corpus plays a part in

administrative law, since some administrative

authorities and tribunals have powers of

detention. The cases most likely to arise are those

where some person is detained as an illegal

immigrant or in order that he may be deported, or

as being unsound mind

10) Therefore, it is essential to consider the definition of arbitrary

detention as articulated in Blacks Law Dictionary2;

The detention of a person without due process of

law; the indefinite or unreasonable delayed

holding of a suspect or defendant without

bringing the person before a competent court,

esp.in a case involving terrorism or illegal

immigration.

11) It is apparent that the Appellant filed a Writ of Habeas Corpus

application before the High Court Judge of Vavuniya. Acting under

Article 141, the High Court Judge directed the Magistrate of

Vavuniya to conduct an inquiry and submit a report. In response,

the Magistrate conducted the inquiry, considered the evidence, and

submitted the report to the High Court Judge.

12) On the face of it, the Appellant was represented by Attorneys and

had the opportunity of leading evidence and to cross examine the

Respondents Witnesses. Therefore, there is no doubt as per Article

141 that the Learned Magistrate had conducted a proper inquiry 1 Wade, H.W.R. and Forsyth, C.F. (2014) Administrative Law, 11th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 501 2 Garner, B.A. (2014) Black's Law Dictionary, 11th ed. St. Paul, MN: Thomson Reuters, p. 563

C.A. (PHC) 0110-18

and submitted a report to the Learned High Court Judge of

Vavuniya.

ii) Has the High Court Judge considered the facts pertinent

to the inquiry?

13) The Learned Magistrate of Vavuniya submitted his findings on the

said inquiry dated 7th December 2016. In his findings he had

decided that the Respondents should be accountable for the

corpus Kandasamy Ravichandran who disappeared after entering

the Omanthai checkpoint.

14) The Learned High Court Judge had considered the findings of the

Learned Magistrate of Vavuniya as well as the evidence presented

during the inquiry, however, he dismissed the Habeas Corpus

application on the grounds that the evidence did not support the

assertion that the corpus was taken into custody and illegally

detained.

15) Given the existence of a dispute of fact, the Learned High Court

Judge had declined to issue a Writ and dismissed the application

submitted by the Appellant in the High Court.

iii) If so, can this appeal be maintained?

16) As the High Court Judge had dismissed the Habeas Corpus

application, the Appellant had initiated this appeal as he was

aggrieved by the said Order.

17) The grievance of the Appellant is that her son, an employee of the

Multipurpose Cooperative Society of Mallawi Thunukkai, was

supposed to travel to Vavuniya on the date the incident occurred.

C.A. (PHC) 0110-18

7

To reach Vavuniya he had to pass through the Army checkpoint

from the uncontrolled area.

18) As per the evidence and the document submitted to Court the

corpus had entered the army checkpoint on 25th April 2006. The

document marked as 1RB specifies the said Kandasamy

Ravichandran had passed through the checkpoint. There are no

details to support the assertion that the corpus was

detained/arrested by the Army.

19) The evidence presented by the Appellant at the Magistrates Court

does not disclose any factual basis indicating that the corpus was

detained by the Army at the Omanthai checkpoint.

20) The evidence submitted by her to the court, was hearsay as she

stated that the General Manager of Multipurpose Cooperative

Society had told her that her son was arrested. However, no

witness was called from the Cooperative Society to verify that

position.

21) During the argument stage, the counsel who appeared for the

Appellant also admitted the said position. Aside from her

testimony, there were no other witnesses to support the assertion

made by the Appellant that the corpus was detained at the

Omanthai checkpoint.

22) As per the Respondents Witnesses and the documents submitted

to court, the said corpus Kandasamy Ravichandran had crossed

the Omanthai checkpoint manned by the Army and there is no

evidence to suggest that he was detained or was in the custody of

the Respondents and/or taken into the custody of the Police post

located at the Omanthai checkpoint.

23) Counsel for the Appellant vehemently argued that the corpus

entered from the uncleared area into the Omanthai checkpoint,

and that the Respondent failed to produce any document to

C.A. (PHC) 0110-18

8

substantiate that the corpus exited from the Omanthai checkpoint.

Upon reviewing the evidence presented before the Magistrate, it is

evident that the Omanthai checkpoint was primarily manned to

facilitate the passage of individuals into government-controlled

areas at the time in question. Furthermore, no separate records

were maintained regarding entry or exit. The only record kept was

of the individuals who passed through. In light of these

circumstances, the argument advanced by Counsel for the

Appellant cannot be accepted.

24) Thus, the High Court Judge in his decision had correctly noted

that there was no evidence before the Court regarding whose

custody the corpus was in, as referenced in Article 154P (4) and

decided that the Magistrate had failed to consider the evidence led

before him. In these circumstances, it is evident that the assertion

of a disputed fact is supported by the evidence and documents

reviewed.

25) Now I will draw my attention to the decision of Kodippilage Seetha

v Sarvanathan and Others3;

a) The burden of proof must lie fairly and squarely on the

party (Petitioner) who makes the assertion which is denied as here, that the corpus was taken into custody by the 1st Respondent b) an ordinary citizen making a serious allegation of the

corpus being taken into illegal custody which would amount to a crime must prove the allegation beyond reasonable doubt

26) Further, In the case of Rosalind V Sudaralingam4 it was held

that in this Habeas Corpus application, the version of the

Respondent Police Officers, that they never took the corpus into

custody, was upheld as being true.

27) When referring to the aforesaid matters, the burden of proof rests

upon the party who makes this application. The said burden of

proof had not been fulfilled by the Appellant at the Magistrate

Courts.

28) On the said grounds, my considered view is that the Appellant had

failed to satisfy the Learned High Court judge to obtain the Writ of

Habeas Corpus.

CONCLUSION

29) In view of the aforesaid reasoning, I dismiss the Appellants

petition of appeal dated 23rd April 2018.

30) No costs ordered.
