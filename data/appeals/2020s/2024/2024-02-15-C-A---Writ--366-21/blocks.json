The statement of the Petitioner merely set out his grievance without identifying a person who has caused him such alleged injustice. In other words, the Petitioner does not specifically make allegations against a particular officer which would enable the relevant authorities to conduct an inquiry under the provisions of the Establishment Code. Provisions under Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code shall only be applicable in the event where disciplinary actions are required to be taken in respect of a particular public officer. Under such circumstances, no burden lies upon the said Committee to follow the provisions of Chapter XLVIII of Volume II of the Establishment Code to look into such grievance in terms of its provisions. If any misconduct or inadvertent of a particular officer is revealed, then the Disciplinary Authority could have conducted an inquiry following the provisions of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code.",
