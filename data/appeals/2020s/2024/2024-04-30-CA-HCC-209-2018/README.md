The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Balapitiya for

committing the murder of his wife Pahuru Thotage Nirosha Sanjeewani

Abeywickrama on or about 23rd April 2005, an offence punishable

under Section 296 of the Penal Code. After trial, the learned High Court

Judge convicted the accused-appellant for the offence of murder and

imposed the death sentence on him. This appeal is preferred by the

accused-appellant against the said conviction and sentence.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions were filed on behalf of both

parties. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel

for the appellant and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

respondent made oral submissions.

In brief, the prosecution case is as follows:

At the time of this incident, the deceased Nirosha Sanjeewani had been

living with the accused-appellant and her grandmother; the mother of

PW-1 in Meetiyagoda, Ranasinghewatte. The deceased was the

daughter of PW-1s sister. PW-1 also lived in Ransainghewatte, few

houses away from the house of the deceased. According to PW-1, the

accused and the deceased got married in 2004.07.21 and the deceased

was pregnant at the time of the incident. On the day of the incident

Page 3 of 8

around 11.30 a.m, PW-1 had gone to the house of the deceased with

her mother who came to ask PW-1 to have lunch with them. When they

arrived at the house where the accused, deceased and PW-2 (mother of

PW-1) lived, PW-1 has witnessed accused having a quarrel with the

deceased. The accused chased the deceased shouting at her in filth and

threatening that he is going to kill her. when PW-1 and her mother

arrived at home, the accused scolded them in filth asking PW-1 as

to why she came. At this moment, the deceased asked PW-2, her

grandmother (to whom the deceased used to address as mother) to go

to the police saying that there is no escape this time. Accordingly, PW-

2 went to the police. PW-1 also left the place because the accused

chased her away throwing stones at her. However, after going halfway

to her house, PW-1 returned running to the deceased's house, as she

was worried about the deceased, who was pregnant. When PW-1 was

returning to the house of the deceased, PW-1 has seen the accused-

appellant putting the deceased into the well situated in front of the

house of the deceased and then the appellant running away. Thereafter,

PW-1 had screamed for help and the neighbours have got the deceased

out of the well. The deceased was admitted to the hospital and found

dead.

The following grounds of appeal have been stated in the written

submissions filed on behalf of the accused-appellant.

i. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

improbability of the prosecution case.

ii. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

medical evidence which explains the absence of injuries

caused by resistance which should have been considered in

favour of the accused-appellant.

iii. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

evidence of the police officers who inspected the scene of crime

and testified that there were no signs of fight or resistance

Page 4 of 8

which should have been considered in favour of the accused-

appellant.

iv. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider and

properly evaluate the vital inter-se contradictions.

v. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider and

evaluate the inconsistencies in the testimony of the sole eye

witness.

vi. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

interestedness in the witnesses.

vii. Grave prejudice has been caused to the accused due to the

failure of the High Court Judge to notify the accused-appellant

of his rights in presenting his defence before the Court.

However, when this matter was taken up for hearing, the learned

Presidents Counsel for the appellant confined his arguments to the

following three grounds:

I. Improbability of the prosecution case.

II. Failure to consider the absence of injuries (signs of fights or

resistance) on the body of the deceased.

III. Not considering the inconsistencies in the testimony of the eye

witness, PW-1.

All these grounds could be considered together because the aforesaid

all three grounds rely on the ground of improbability of the prosecution

story narrated by PW-1.

The accused-appellants position was that the deceased committed

suicide by jumping into the well. The said position has been suggested

to PW-1 and PW-2. When the learned Trial Judge called for the defence,

two witnesses were called on behalf of the appellant. However, the

accused-appellant had not even made a dock statement and stated that

the deceased committed suicide by jumping into the well especially,

when there was evidence that the accused-appellant chased the

Page 5 of 8

deceased shouting at her in filth and threatening that he is going to kill

her. Also, there is evidence that the appellant ran away after putting

the deceased into the well.

What the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant pointed out was

that according to PW-1, the appellant lifted the deceased and dropped

her into the well and the deceased and the appellant were facing each

other when the deceased was put into the well by the appellant. The

learned Presidents Counsel contended that no human being could put

another person into a well in this manner by raising the deceased by

her waist. In substantiating his argument, the learned Presidents

Counsel pointed out that according to the evidence of the police officer

who inspected the scene of the crime, there were no signs of a fight or

resistance and according to the medical evidence, there were no injuries

on the body of the deceased in resistance.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent contended that

the eyewitness PW-1 precisely described how she witnessed the

incident, that there is no ambiguity in the chain of incidents that she

described, that she is a credible witness, and that the incident that she

narrated is entirely plausible. In addition, the learned DSG submitted

that not only PW-1 stated in her evidence that the deceased never had

intention to suicide (Page 117 of the Appeal Brief) but also PW-1 stated

that the deceased requested her to inform the police saying that there

is no escape this time (Page 72 of the Appeal Brief).

The following facts are not in dispute:

i. At the time of the death, the deceased was pregnant and

expecting delivery in seven days.

ii. The well relating to the incident of this case is about 4.5 feet

in diameter and about 17 feet in deep. The well is surrounded

by a wall of about 2 feet.

iii. The first information regarding the incident was given by the

accused-appellant and the appellant was a police officer.

Citing the Judgments of CA HCC 0289/ 2014, Kosgoda

Durayalage Premachandra V. The Honourable Attorney General,

Decided on 26.07.2022; CA - HCC 44/2015, Don Chandana

Priyantha Rupasinghe V. Hon. Attorney General, Decided on

26.11.2019; King V. Seneviratne reported in 38 NLR 208; the learned

Presidents Counsel for the appellant contended that in a case of this

nature, the possibility of committing the suicide must be excluded by

the prosecution. It is correct that in the instant action, the prosecution

must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the death of the deceased

was not a suicide but a murder. Therefore, the issue to be decided in

this case was whether the deceased jumped into the well and committed

suicide or the appellant pushed or dropped her into the well.

The witness Anoja Darshani has been called to give evidence on behalf

of the appellant. She stated that the appellant had a quarrel with

PW-1, Hemakanthi. PW-1 has also stated in her evidence that the

appellant scolded in filth asking PW-1 as to why she came and chased

her away throwing stones at her. Corroborating these items of evidence

the aforesaid defence witness also stated that the appellant threw

stones at her. Apart from that, this defence witness stated that the

appellant told her that the deceased jumped into the well. However, the

defence witness has admitted in cross-examination that she did not

state to the police when making a statement that the accused-

appellant, Sujeewa told her that the deceased jumped into the well.

Hence, it is clear that the story of the appellant that the deceased

jumped into the well is an afterthought and the learned Trial Judge is

correct in not accepting the said defence version. Accordingly, defence

evidence does not create a reasonable doubt whether the deceased

jumped into the well and committed suicide.

In careful perusal of the evidence of this case, it is apparent that there

was no impossibility in putting the deceased into the well by holding

her waist while facing the appellant. It is also clear that it is very difficult

for the deceased, who was in her last stage of pregnancy to resist the

appellant in a situation where he held by her waist and lower part of

her body was hanging down in the well. It is also important to note that

when explaining the incident, PW-1 has never stated that the deceased

did any act to resist. Therefore, her evidence is consistent with the

medical evidence that there were no external injuries on the body of the

deceased.

The only other matter to be considered is whether the absence of

injuries on the deceased's body implies that she jumped into the well.

The doctor who conducted the Post-Mortem Examination stated in his

evidence that it is common sense that if someone is held firmly and then

released, there may not be injuries (Page 155 of the Appeal Brief). The

doctor was of the clear opinion that if somebody puts a person into a

well, there would not necessarily be injuries. Therefore, there is no

improbability in the evidence of PW-1 as well as the prosecution case.

No reasonable doubt arises as to whether the deceased jumped into the

well. I regret that I am unable to agree with any of the grounds of appeal

raised by the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant for the

reasons stated above.

As it is proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused-appellant

put the deceased into the well with the murderous intention, the

conclusion of the learned High Court Judge that the accused-appellant

has committed the offence of murder is correct.

For the reasons stated above, I find no reason to interfere with the

Judgment of the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly, the Judgment

dated 21.09.2018, the conviction and the death sentence passed on the

accused-appellant are affirmed.
