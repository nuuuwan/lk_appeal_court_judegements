The accused-appellant was convicted for dishonestly misappropriating

Rs.2,200,000/- belonging to Damith Nandalal Sahabandu (PW-1), and

thereby committing an offence under Section 386 of the Penal Code. Prior

to the hearing of the appeal, written submissions were filed on behalf of

both parties. At the hearing, the learned counsel for the appellant and the

learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent made oral

submissions.

Briefly, the prosecution case is as follows:

The complainant (PW-1) had entered into a tenancy agreement with the

accused-appellant in October 1999 for 2 years. This tenancy agreement

Page 3 of 12

has been extended for a further period of 2 years. With the expiry of the

tenancy agreement in 2003, there had been a discussion to purchase the

property by the complainant and he agreed to purchase the property for a

sum of Rs. 2,700,000/-. Both parties had signed an agreement to sell. This

agreement has been marked as P-1. Admittedly, an advance payment of

Rs.1,000,000/- was paid by the complainant. The agreement was to pay

the balance of Rs.1,700,000/- within one year and upon payment of the

balance, the property was to be transferred to the complainant.

The complainant has admitted in his evidence that since October 2004 up

to date, he continued to occupy the premises without paying rent. The

appellant had filed a case in the District Court to eject the complainant

from the premises.

The learned High Court Judge has convicted the accused-appellant for

misappropriating Rs.2,200,000/- by her judgment dated 30.08.2016.

The grounds of appeal urged in the written submissions of the appellant

are as follows:

I. The learned trial judge failed to address and attach any significance

to items of uncontroverted evidence led at the trial that militated

against and negatived any dishonest intention allegedly

entertained by the accused at that time.

II. The learned trial judge had erred in fact and in law by concluding

that the accused dishonestly misappropriated/converted to his

own use thereby intentionally causing wrongful gain to himself

and/or wrongful loss to the complainant by unlawful means.

In addition, in his brief oral submission at the hearing, the learned counsel

for the appellant raised another ground that the learned trial judge failed

to observe that the transaction subject to this case is only a civil

transaction.

Page 4 of 12

According to clause 8 of the agreement to sell, if the vendor (the appellant)

neglects and fails to execute the deed of transfer after the purchaser (the

complainant) paid the due amount on or before the relevant date as

specified in the agreement, the purchaser is entitled to enforce specific

performance of the vendor's covenant to sell and convey the property to

the purchaser or his nominee. In addition, the purchaser is entitled to

claim liquidated damages.

According to clause 8 of the agreement, if the vendor performs the terms

and conditions outlined in the agreement and the purchaser neglects and

fails to complete the purchase on or before October 31, 2004, the vendor

is entitled to forfeit Rs.100,000/- from the advance payment.

A similar clause such as clause 8 of this agreement is usually set out in

most of the agreements to sell. The purpose of this clause is to allow either

party to go before the District Court and secure the fulfillment of the terms

of the contract if the other party breaches the terms and conditions of the

contract. Failing to perform the terms and conditions of a sales agreement

gives rise to only civil liability and not criminal liability.

However, the learned high court judge in this case convicted the accused-

appellant on the ground that the appellant had misappropriated a sum of

Rs. 2,200,000/- given by the complainant in order to purchase the

property relating to this sales agreement. In deciding so, the learned judge

accepted the complainants evidence that he had given another

Rs.1,200,000/- to the appellant apart from the initial payment of

Rs.1,000,000/-.

The prosecution proved by producing cheques bearing the numbers

775612, 775618, and 775605 that the complainant gave the appellant

Rs. 2 lakhs, Rs. 3 lakhs, and Rs. 2.5 lakhs on three separate occasions.

Page 5 of 12

With that Rs.750,000/- given by three cheques, it is proved that the

complainant had given Rs.1,750,000/- to the appellant. The complainant

(PW-1) stated in his evidence that he paid Rs.12 lakhs in six occasions

(page 99 of the Appeal Brief) to the appellant in addition to the initial

payment of Rs.10 lakhs. According to the complainant, Rs.50,000/-,

Rs.100,000/- and Rs. 300,000/- had been paid in three occasions in cash,

apart from the payments made by the aforesaid three checks. However,

there are no receipts or any other documentation to prove the aforesaid

three cash payments. In addition, the complainant could not remember

when these cash payments were made. Since the complainant stated in

his evidence that he gave this money to the appellant, the learned high

court judge decided that the complainant had altogether paid 22 lakhs to

the appellant.

In the District Court case bearing No. 20695 L, the learned additional

district judge decided by answering issue No.5 that the payment of Rs.22

lakhs is not proved. The said portion of the District Court Judgment has

been marked as V-8a. However, the learned High Court Judge stated in

the impugned judgment that although the learned additional district judge

decided so, I decide that the complainant has paid Rs. 22 lakhs to the

appellant because complainants testimony can be believed than the

statement made by the accused-appellant from the dock. Accordingly, the

learned high court judge has come to the conclusion that apart from the

proved amount of Rs. 1,750,000/-, the sum of Rs. 4 and a half lakhs that

the complainant claims to have paid to the appellant, which he cannot

prove, has also been paid by the complainant to the appellant.

Although, there was no proof regarding the aforesaid cash payments, a

settlement entered in the District Court has been marked as V-1 (page 132

of the Appeal Brief) in cross-examining PW-1 in the High Court. According

to the said settlement, the appellant had agreed to pay and the

Page 6 of 12

complainant had agreed to receive the balance amount from the Rs. 22

lakhs, after deducting the rent relating to the period during which the

complainant occupied the premises of the appellant without paying rent.

Since both parties had come to an agreement in the district court on the

basis that an amount of twenty-two lakhs has been paid by the

complainant, it will not be necessary to consider further in this appeal, the

proof regarding the payment of the sum of Rs. 22 lakhs.

The vital issue to be considered in this appeal is how the learned high

court judge came to the conclusion that the appellant had misappropriated

the said Rs. 22 lakhs. As to the issue of how the offence of criminal

misappropriation is proved, the finding of the learned trial judge and the

contention of the learned DSG are the same. When the court posed the

question as to the criminal element in this transaction, the learned DSG

responded that the sales agreement in question had been executed in

contravention with Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance. Her

contention was that the sales agreement was not executed by a notary,

was not registered and that it is evident that the spouse of the accused

who is a lawyer and a notary public signed as a witness thereby being privy

to this improperly formulated transaction. Further, the learned DSG

contended that the dishonest intention of the appellant is clear from the

beginning of the series of events that have transpired by executing this

invalid agreement. Also, she contended that it is clear that the intention of

the appellant was to evade from transferring the property to the

complainant as per the agreement and to evict the complainant from the

property. In perusing the impugned judgment, it is apparent that the

learned high court judge has also taken the same views in determining

this action.

It is important to realize that occupying the premises on a tenancy/lease

agreement and the transactions pertaining to the said tenancy/lease

Page 7 of 12

agreement are different from the transactions pertaining to the sales

agreement. In this case, the complainant who came to the occupation of

the premises on a tenancy/lease agreement wanted to purchase the

property. The complainant, PW-1, in his evidence admitted that he had

not paid rent since October 2004. Therefore, acting in accordance with the

law, the appellant sent a notice to quit and then filed an ejectment action

in the District Court. It is apparent that the appellant filed the District

Court action to eject the complainant because he occupied the premises

owned by the appellant without any legal authority. It is unfair and wrong

to decide that the appellant intended to misappropriate the complainants

money and eject him from the property for the reason of filing an ejection

action for which he is legally entitled. The complainant has admitted

clearly in the following manner that he continued the occupation of the

premises without paying anything to the appellant.

: 2004

?

: .

: 09 ?

: .

When the complainant continued in occupation of the appellants property

without any legal authority and without paying any rent, the appellant has

all the rights to file an action to eject him. Exercising the appellants legal

right has also been used as a ground for assigning criminal liability to the

appellant by the learned trial judge.

Now, I proceed to consider whether the appellant had misappropriated

Rs.22 lakhs with dishonest intention. Undisputedly, the agreed amount to

transfer the property is Rs. 27 lakhs. The complainant paid Rs. 22 lakhs

to the appellant. He had to pay another Rs. 5 lakhs. The complainant

stated in his evidence that he attempted to pay the balance Rs. 5 lakhs to

Page 8 of 12

the appellant but he avoided taking the same and the appellant wanted to

increase the agreed amount. The appellants position was that he took all

endeavours to meet the complainant to obtain the balance Rs. 5 lakhs but

the complainant evaded because he had no money at that time to pay the

balance amount. In this case, the accused-appellant has made a statement

from the dock and three witnesses were called on his behalf. In his dock

statement and while cross-examining PW-1, the appellant has proposed to

pay back to him the money that the complainant gave to him. In the said

circumstances, it has to be considered whether it is proved beyond a

reasonable doubt that the appellant had misappropriated the

complainants money.

The only reason stated by the learned DSG for assigning criminal liability

to the appellant is executing the sales agreement in contravention with

Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance with dishonest intention.

The learned trial judge found guilty of the accused for criminal

misappropriation on the ground that the appellant dishonestly executed

the said invalid sales agreement in order to misappropriate the money

given by the complainant. In addition, the learned judge stated in her

judgment that as a lawyer, the wife of the appellant should have taken

steps to execute the sales agreement by a notary and to register the

agreement. The learned trial judge was of the opinion that it appears from

the evidence presented to the court that the accused-appellants wife, as a

lawyer knowing that such property should be registered, deliberately did

not register it in this way and received an amount of Rs. 22 lakhs from the

complainant. The said finding contained in her judgment appears as

follows:

,

22 . (Page 421

of the Appeal Brief)

Page 9 of 12

According to this finding of the learned judge, not the accused-appellant,

but his wife had received Rs.22 lakhs from the complainant. According to

the said finding, the accused-appellant could not be convicted of criminal

misappropriation.

However, again in her judgment, the learned high court judge stated as

follows: ,

,

.

.

. (Page 425 of

the Appeal Brief)

I regret that I am unable to agree with that finding also because according

to her own observation, the sales agreement had not been registered not

only for the need of the appellant but for the need of both the appellant

and the complainant. (

. Page 37 of the Judgment) According to the

evidence of the case, the said observation of the learned judge is correct.

Therefore, her finding that the agreement had not been registered because

the appellant did not want to register it and thereby the appellant had

defrauded the complainant is completely wrong. The said finding is

contrary to the evidence presented in the High Court. On the agreement

and understanding of both the appellant as well as the complainant, the

agreement was not registered.

It is to be noted that entering into an agreement which is not attested by

a notary is not illegal or legally prohibited. On the consent of both parties

to the agreement, they can enter into a written agreement between them

like an oral agreement for the future sale or purchase of any land without

Page 10 of 12

notarial execution. However, such a document has no legal enforceability.

When both parties who entered into the sales agreement did not want to

execute the same by a notary, there was no basis for the learned judge to

state that the wife of the appellant should know as a lawyer that this

agreement must be registered and that the appellants wife should have

arranged for the notary public who prepared the agreement to attest the

same. It is correct that as a lawyer the wife of the appellant should have

known that any contract or agreement for the future sale or purchase of

any land or other immovable property to be legally enforceable, it must be

attested by a notary and then registered. However, when the appellant as

well as the complainant informed that they wanted to sign an agreement

without notarial execution, the appellants wife could not force the notary

to execute the same and register. The learned judge is wrong in coming to

a conclusion that the accused-appellant had intentionally defrauded the

complainant because the wife of the appellant should have known the

necessity of registering this agreement (

.

.)

Fraudulent or dishonest intention of the appellant would be reflected if the

appellant fraudulently obtained the complainants signature implying that

the sale agreement would be executed by a notary public and it would be

registered. However, in the case at hand, the learned trial judge herself

observed, as stated previously, that the agreement was not registered with

the consent of both the appellant as well as the complainant. In addition,

the complainant admitted in his evidence that he has general knowledge

of reading the English language (page 92 of the appeal brief). Furthermore,

the complainant stated that he received a copy of the agreement signed by

both parties (page 108 of the appeal brief). So, in entering into the sales

Page 11 of 12

agreement, no fraudulent or dishonest intention of the appellant has been

established from the evidence.

According to the appellant, the property could not be transferred to the

complainant because he did not pay the balance of Rs.5 lakhs on or before

the date specified in the agreement. According to the complainant, he

attempted to pay the balance amount in time but the appellant avoided

accepting the balance payment asserting him to increase the agreed value

of the property. According to my view, there was no evidence in this case

to decide which version is correct. However, the learned trial judge

accepted the complainants version stating that he is a truthful witness

and his testimony could be reliable than the appellants dock statement.

Even if the learned judge acted on the said decision, the conclusion that

could be arrived at was that the appellant failed to transfer the property

as per the terms of the agreement to sell. It assigns only civil liability for

non-compliance with the agreement. No criminal liability could be

assigned to the appellant for the reasons explained above. The contention

that money was fraudulently taken from the complainant by preparing an

agreement which was not attested by a notary public has no validity

because entering into an agreement that is unenforceable in the eyes of

the law had been done with the consent of not only the appellant but also

the complainant. Therefore, I hold that the finding of the learned high

court that the appellants fraudulent or dishonest intention has been

established in this transaction is an erroneous finding.

The offence of criminal misappropriation under Section 386 of the Penal

Code reads as follows:

Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use any

movable property shall be punished with imprisonment of either description

for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both

Page 12 of 12

The accused-appellant in this case was always ready to return the money

that the complainant gave to him. Even at the stage of cross-examining

PW-1 (the complainant), the counsel who appeared in the high court for

the accused-appellant suggested to PW-1 to give him back the Rs. 22 lakhs

but PW-1 refused to accept (pages 137 and 138 of the appeal brief). Thus,

there is no evidence that the appellant had dishonestly misappropriated

the Rs. 22 lakhs that he obtained from the complainant. Hence, I hold that

it has not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused-

appellant had dishonestly misappropriated Rs.22 lakhs. I hold further that

convicting the appellant for the charge of misappropriation is bad in law.

Accordingly, I set aside the Judgment dated 30.08.2016, the conviction,

and the sentence imposed on the accused-appellant.

The appeal is allowed. The accused-appellant is acquitted of the charge of

misappropriation.

Appeal allowed.
