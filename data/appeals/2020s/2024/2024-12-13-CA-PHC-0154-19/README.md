C.A. (PHC) 0154-19

3

a) Set aside the Order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Central

Province Holden in Kandy in Revision Application No. 99/2019

dated 26th September 2019,

b) To set aside the Order of the Learned Magistrate Court Judge of

Teldeniya dated 06.09.2019 in case No. 49487,

c) To dismiss and or/ reject the said Action No. 49486 in the District

Court of Teldeniya,

d) To grant costs, and

e) Such other and further reliefs.

Facts of this case

3) The Petitioner had sought in the prayer of the petition to set aside

the Learned Magistrates Order dated 6th September 2019 and to set

aside the Learned High Court Judges Order dated 26th September

2019.

4) This action pertains to the recovery of possession of state land, filed by

the Competent Authority in the Magistrates Court of Teldeniya.

5) The Magistrate had reviewed the facts, documents and granted the

Respondent-Competent Authority permission to evict the Petitioner, her

occupants and dependents who were in possession of the state land

referred to in the notice to quit filed by the Respondent.

6) Aggrieved by the aforesaid Order, the Petitioner had filed a revision

application in the Provincial High Court of Kandy. The Learned High

Court Judge, having considered the relevant facts, had dismissed the

Petitioners revision application without issuing notice and had affirmed

the Order of the Learned Magistrate.

7) Aggrieved by the aforementioned High Court Order, the Petitioner had

filed this revision application to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of

this Court, on the grounds that the Respondent was not the

Competent Authority and the Learned High Court Judge had not

considered whether the Respondent had any right to initiate proceedings

at the Magistrates Court.

8) As per the Petitioner, the Learned Magistrate as well as the Learned

C.A. (PHC) 0154-19

4

High Court Judge had failed to consider that there was no proper and

valid affidavit filed by the Respondent before the Magistrates Court.

9) Further, the Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that there

was proper proof that the land claimed by the state is a part of the state

land.

10) In light of this, the Petitioner had sought the reliefs prayed for in the

petition and to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction to grant the Petitioners

reliefs.

Disputed facts

11) When this matter was taken up for argument on the 3rd of September

2024, both parties agreed to conclude the matter by way of filing written

submissions.

12) Considering the facts pertinent to this case, the written submissions

and in considering the documents, I am of the view that the following

disputed points should be examined to determine whether the

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court can be invoked;

I. Had the Learned Magistrate's Order considered the facts pertinent

to the dispute related to the instant application?

II. Has the Learned High Court Judge correctly evaluated the

Learned Magistrates Order considering the facts and documents

put forward by both parties?

III. If so, can the application filed by the Petitioner to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction be sustained?

I. Had the Learned Magistrate's Order considered the facts

pertinent to the dispute related to the instant application?

13) On perusal of the Learned Magistrates Order dated 6th September

2019, it was acknowledged that the Learned Magistrate had accepted

that the notice had been properly served to the Petitioner in the

Magistrates Court case, pursuant to Sections 4 and 5 of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act (No. 7 of 1979).

C.A. (PHC) 0154-19

14) Furthermore, the Learned Magistrate had correctly identified the

specific parcel of land from which the Petitioner had been required to

be evicted. Moreover, the Petitioner had failed to establish any lawful

right or permit, to have possessed the said State Land.

15) The next issue raised by the Petitioner is that the Plaintiff in the

Magistrates Court Case is not the Competent Authority. However,

this contention could not be raised before the Magistrate, as the

Magistrate did not possess the jurisdiction to ascertain the identity of

the competent authority in relation to an application of this nature.

16) In addition to these facts, the Petitioner in the Magistrates Court case

had claimed a prescriptive right. However, the Learned Magistrate

correctly determined that the provisions of the Prescription Ordinance

do not apply to state-owned properties.

17) Therefore, the Petitioners application challenging the Learned

Magistrate's Order is entirely devoid of merit.

II. Has the Learned High Court Judge correctly evaluated the

Learned Magistrates Order considering the facts and documents

put forward by both parties?

18) Upon reviewing the Learned High Court Judges Order dated 26th

September 2019, it was noted that on page 03 of the Order, the Learned

High Court Judge had articulated five disputed questions raised by the

Petitioner. With respect to the first, second, and third questions, the

Learned High Court Judge had evaluated the facts based on the

documents that had been submitted before the court.

19) When addressing the first disputed question, the Learned High Court

Judge had emphasized citing the authority of Farook vs

Goonawardena, Government Agent Amparai, 1980 2 SLR 243,

that the Magistrate has no jurisdiction under Section 3 (1) to decide on

the service of a quit notice, as claimed by the Petitioner, which was not

submitted by the Competent Authority.

20) Furthermore, the Learned High Court Judge contended in his Order

C.A. (PHC) 0154-19

6

that the position taken by the Petitioner regarding the affidavit,

specifically that it had not been properly produced by the Respondent

in the Magistrates Court, constituted a technical objection. The

Learned High Court Judge concluded that there was no valid reason to

reject the said affidavit under the provisions of the State Lands

Recovery of Possession Act.

21) Furthermore, the dispute raised by the Petitioner in this case,

asserting that the land described in the eviction notice forms part of a

larger parcel and that they have acquired prescriptive rights over the

said land, is unfounded. The Petitioner, however, failed to produce any

document to demonstrate that they possess a valid permit for the said

land, and there is no basis upon which the Petitioner can claim a

prescriptive right to state land.

22) On the said circumstances, the Learned High Court Judge had decided

that there is no reason to interfere with the Learned Magistrates Order

on the revision application filed by the Petitioner in this case.

23) When referring to the decided case of Divisional Secretary

Manikhinna v Jenudeen Buhurdeen1

The scope of the inquiry before the Magistrate is

circumscribed strictly to two matters, and he has no

jurisdiction to a beyond what has been mandated by the

Act. The Act particularly states that the Magistrate shall

not call for any evidence in support of the Application,

which shall be made in the Form prescribed by the Act.

Hence, in my view, it is unfair by the Magistrate, to set

aside by the Appellate Court the order of the Magistrate as

an erroneous one on totally different grounds. Then the Act

shall be amended to widen the scope of the inquiry before

the Magistrate. In my view, if the Respondent wants to

challenge the decision of the Petitioner (Competent

Authority), that shall be done in a properly constituted writ

application, and not by way of an appeal filed against the

1 CA (PHC) 140/2013

C.A. (PHC) 0154-19

7

decision of the Magistrate. Merely because the word

"inquiry" is used in those sections, it is clear by reading

those sections contextually that conducting a full trial was

never the intention of the legislature. If that was the

intention, as stated in section 8, the Magistrate cannot

proceed to hear and determine the matter forthwith. it is

not mandatory that the Magistrate shall fix the matter for

the inquiry for oral evidence to be led. What the Magistrate

shall do is to give the person summoned a fair opportunity

to satisfy the Court that he has a valid permit or other

written authority of the State granted in accordance with

any written law. The person so summoned cannot be

allowed to convert it into a full-fledged trial, which will

defeat the intention of the legislature.

It was determined that any party challenging the competent authority

must file a Writ application. Consequently, the position taken by the

Learned High Court Judge is correct, insofar as the Magistrate lacks

the jurisdiction to adjudicate on the merits of the rights of the

Competent Authority.

24) In the decided cases of Muhandiram v Chairman, No 111 Janatha

Estate Development Board 2 and M.C Magrate Perera v Divisional

Sectretary, Naula and another 3 it is decided that a party claiming

rights for a state land should possess a valid permit or a valid

document.

25) As per the aforementioned decided cases, it was determined that,

under Section 9 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7

of 1979, the scope of the inquiry before the Magistrate is

circumscribed by determining whether the person notified can

establish that they are not in unauthorized occupation. To establish

lawful possession, the individual must produce a valid permit or any

other written authorization granted by the State in accordance with

2 [1992] 1 SLR 110 3 CA/PHC/41/2010

C.A. (PHC) 0154-19

8

applicable law, provided that such permit or authorization is valid,

active, and has not been revoked or rendered void.

26) In these circumstances, the Learned High Court Judge correctly

concluded that there is no requirement for the Competent Authority to

establish its status as the legitimate authority before the Magistrate.

27) In considering the said Order, this being a state land, the Petitioner

had failed to show that she has a valid permit and/or right to possess

the land from which the Respondent had filed action to evict her.

III. If so, can the application made by the Petitioner to invoke

the revisionary jurisdiction be sustained?

28) In light of the foregoing facts and documents, I find no substantive

grounds put forward by the Petitioner to warrant the setting aside of the

Order made by the Learned High Court Judge, as a revision application

is a discretionary remedy. Furthermore, the Learned High Court Judge

has thoroughly addressed and examined the issues raised by the

Petitioner before the High Court.

29) At this juncture, I draw my attention to the decision of Divisional Secretary Kalutara v Kalupahana Mestrige Jayatissa 4;

It must be noted that the Respondents had invoked revisionary jurisdiction of this court, which is discretionary remedy. Thus, if relief to be granted, the party seeking the relief has to establish that, not only the impugned order is illegal, but also the nature of the illegality is such, that it shocks the conscience of the court

30) In the aforementioned decision, it was held that an impugned Order in

a revision application must not only be illegal but must also shock the

conscience of the court. In the present appeal, I do not find any

argument from the Petitioner addressing the grounds referenced in

the case of Divisional Secretary Kalutara v Kalupahana

4 SC Appeals 246,247,249,250/14

C.A. (PHC) 0154-19

9

Mestrige Jayatissa.

31) Upon careful review, it is evident that the Learned High Court Judge

did not contravene any legal provisions in rendering the decision. The

Judge had thoroughly considered all pertinent facts, including the

determination that the proper service of the quit notice by the

Competent Authority, the absence of prescriptive rights over state

lands, and the lack of necessity to reject the affidavit submitted by

the Respondent on account of a technical issue. In this regard, the

Judges decision appears sound and in full compliance with the law.

32) Given these findings, and after considering all relevant arguments

and legal precedents, I am of the view that the Petitioner's appeal is

devoid of merit. The Petitioner had failed to provide any valid grounds

to warrant interference with the decision of the Learned High

Court Judge.

33) Therefore, I do not consider that the Petitioner can seek any

reliefs prayed for in the petition of appeal dated 04th October 2024.

CONCLUSION

34) In view of the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the revision application

dated 4th October 2019 subject to payment of Rs. 25 000/- cost to

the Respondent.
