Facts of this case

3) The Appellant had sought in the prayer of the petition of appeal to

seek the reliefs prayed for in the revision application submitted to

the High Court.

4) This is an action based on a recovery of possession of a state land

filed by the Competent Authority at the Magistrates Court.

5) The Magistrate had considered the facts and the documents and

allowed the Respondent Competent Authority of the Plantation

Management Monitoring Division to eject the Appellant from the

land described in the plaint filed by the Respondent Competent

Authority.

6) Aggrieved by the said order, the Appellant had filed a revision

application in the Provincial High Court of Ratnapura. The

Learned High Court Judge after considering the facts pertinent to

this action had dismissed the Appellants revision application. On

that, the Appellant had filed this appeal against the said order

made by the Learned High Court Judge.

7) The contention of the Appellant is that he did not receive the quit

notice as the registered postal articles were not annexed to the

application submitted to the Magistrates Court.

8) Further, the Learned High Court Judge had not considered the

deeds executed in favour of the Appellant which were produced

and had failed to adhere to the provisions outlined in the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979.

9) Furthermore, the Appellant had contended the schedule produced

by the Competent Authority to eject the Appellant is vague.

10) The said grounds had not been considered by the Learned High

Court Judge at the revision application made by the Appellant in

the High Court of Ratnapura.

CA (PHC) 47-2019

11) On that, the Appellant had sought the reliefs prayed for in the

petition of appeal.

12) However, the Learned High Court Judge had dismissed the petition

and refused the Writ of Certiorari application made by the

Appellant.

Disputed facts

13) When this appeal was taken up for argument on 28th June 2024,

the parties agreed to conclude the case by way of filing written

submissions.

14) Considering the written submissions, documents and the orders

made by the Learned High Court Judge and Magistrate, to arrive at

the conclusion I am of the view the following disputed points

should be looked into.

i) Has the learned High Court Judge considered the facts

related by the Learned Magistrate in his order dated 26th

January 2018?

ii) If so, can the application made by the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Respondent be maintained?

iii) If not, can the Appellant seek the relief prayed for in his

petition of appeal dated 9th April 2019?

Has the learned High Court Judge considered the facts related by

the Learned Magistrate in his order dated 26th January 2018?

15) On perusal of the Learned High Court Judges order dated 28th

March 2019, it is evident that the Learned High Court Judge had

considered the facts pertinent to the Magistrates order in detail.

CA (PHC) 47-2019

16) The Appellant had filed the revision application against the order of

the Magistrate by way of a petition dated 15th February 2018. In

the said petition, paragraph 07 contains the relief sought by the

Appellant.

17) I reproduce the said paragraph as follows;

18) The reasons to sought the aforesaid reliefs in the revision

application were that the original copy of the notice to quit was not

filed on record and it was not received by the Appellant, the

Learned Magistrate had not considered the deeds submitted by the

Appellant for the disputed land, the Plaintiff Respondent had not

stated his title when instituting this action and not followed the

decided cases by the Apex Court. Further, action had been

instituted on a vague schedule.

19) The aforesaid grounds had been very carefully considered by the

Learned High Court Judge in his Order. He had specifically stated

on page No.07 that the Learned Magistrate had detailed the

reasons on which he had accepted that the notice to quit was

served.

CA (PHC) 47-2019

20) Further, on page No.08 paragraph 03, the Magistrate had stated

that a copy of the notice to quit was filed in the Magistrate Court

record and had considered the Provision related to Section 3(3) of

the State Land Recovery Act, which specifically states as follows;

A quit notice in respect of any State land shall be

deemed to have been served on the person in

possession or occupation thereof if such notice is

sent by registered post.

21) As per the aforesaid section there is no requirement for any

authority to produce a receipt to show the notice to quit receipt of

the registered postal article on which the said notice to quit was

served.

22) The next issue raised before the High Court Judge was that the

Learned Magistrate had not considered the deeds pertinent to the

disputed land. The Learned High Court Judge had considered the

said fact and decided that the Appellant had not proven his rights

for the land to be acquired before the Magistrate. And the Learned

Magistrate had correctly assessed the rights of the parties and

decided the land referred to in the schedule of the plaint is not the

same land, referred to in the Appellants deeds marked before the

Magistrates Court.

23) In view of the aforesaid facts, I do not have to consider further

proof of the Appellants rights for the land in question. It is a

matter for which the Appellant should take the necessary steps in

a different forum to prove that the specific area referred to in his

deeds is included in the schedule of the plaint filed by the

Respondent in the Magistrates Court application.

24) On the said grounds, my considered view is that the Learned High

Court Judge had thoroughly considered the facts pertinent to the

Order made by the Magistrates Court and decided that there are

CA (PHC) 47-2019

9

no exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction to entertain the revision application filed by

the Appellant before the High Court.

If so, can the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent maintain the

application made?

25) In considering the application made by the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Respondent I draw my attention to the following cases;

Muhandiram v Chairman, Janatha Estate Development Board1;

In an inquiry under the state lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, the onus is on the person summoned to establish his possession or occupation that it is possessed or occupied upon a valid permit or other written authority of the state granted according to any written law, if this burden is not discharged, the only option open to the Magistrate is to order ejectment.

Namunukula Plantations PLC V Nimal Punchihewa Chairman, land Reform Commission2;

"One of the matters required to be stated in the application is that the land described in the schedule to the application is in the opinion of the competent authority State land. This fact cannot be contested by the person summoned and the submission of the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner that whether the two lots of land which forms the subject matter of the Magistrates Court action are situated within Akuresso Estate or outside is a matter to be decided by a District Court in a land action must

1 [1992] 1 SLR 110 2 CA(PHC) 29/16 Page 7-8

CA (PHC) 47-2019

10

fail. Hence, a dispute on the identity of the land cannot arise for the consideration of the learned Magistrate. The identity of the land can arise for consideration only to the extent of examining whether the valid permit or other written authority produced by the party summoned is in relation to the state land described in the application. Where it is not, the Magistrate must issue an Order of eviction in terms of the Act."

26) In the aforesaid decisions, it is emphasized that there should be a

valid permit or any other written document on which the disputed

land is possessed by a party.

27) In the instant action, there is no duty cast upon the Magistrate as

per the State Lands Act to execute a plan to verify the boundaries

of the area occupied by the parties.

28) Based on prima facie evidence, the Magistrate could decide to allow

the application made by a Competent Authority. As I have

mentioned before, it is the duty of a party occupying a private land

to institute action in a different forum to certify that their land is

included.

29) Thus, I do not see any hindrance to the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Respondent to maintain the application made at the Magistrate

Court.

If not, can the Appellant seek the relief prayed for in his petition

of appeal dated 9th April 2019?

30) Considering the aforesaid facts and documents, I do not see any

pertinent fact raised by the Appellant to set aside the Order made

by the Learned High Court Judge as a revision application is a

discretionary remedy. And the Learned High Court Judge has

CA (PHC) 47-2019

11

thoroughly considered the disputes raised by the Appellant before

the High Court.

31) Further I draw my attention to the decision of Divisional

Secretary Kalutara v Kalupahana Mestrige Jayatissa3;

It must be noted that the Respondents had invoked revisionary jurisdiction of this court, which is discretionary remedy. Thus, if relief to be granted, the party seeking the relief has to establish that, not only the impugned Order is illegal, but also the nature of the illegality is such, that it shocks the conscience of the court

32) In the said decision, it had been decided that an impugned Order

made in a revision application must not only be illegal but should

also shock the conscience of the court.

33) In the instant appeal, I do not see whether the Appellant has

argued any point to the effect of the aforesaid grounds referred to

in the case of Divisional Secretary Kalutara v Kalupahana

Mestrige Jayatissa.

34) In the said circumstances, it is abundantly clear that the Appellant

had failed to produce any document or any fact indicating that the

disputed portion of the land is included in the Magistrates Court

Proceedings.

35) It is apparent, in a revisionary action this nature of facts cannot be

considered as the learned High Court Judge has not violated any

legal provision.

36) Therefore, I do not consider that the Appellant can seek any reliefs

prayed for in the petition of appeal dated 9th April 2019.
