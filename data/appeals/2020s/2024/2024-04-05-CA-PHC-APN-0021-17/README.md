JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Petitioner is the wife of Welaudan Methiyas Chandrapala alias Mervyn

who was the Accused in the following cases filed in the High Court of

Colombo.

1. HC Colombo Case No. 6131/2012

2. HC Colombo Case No. 5398/2010

CA(PHC)APN 21/2017

3 | P a g e

On 13.02.2012 the Accused Welaudan Metiyas Chandrapala alias Mervyn

was produced before the High Court of Colombo in the case No. HC

5398/2010 by the Prison Department. After the Court appearance, when he

was taken away by the officers of Prison Department, several unknown

armed persons who came in a white van had abducted him from prison

custody.

When this matter was brought to the notice of the High Court on 24.05.2012,

the Learned High Court Judge had ordered an investigation to be conducted

by the Prison Department. In the meantime, the Petitioner had filed a Habeas

Corpus Application bearing No. CA 02/2012 in the Court of Appeal.

After lapse of one year of the abduction, a death certificate was issued in

terms of Registration of Deaths and Missing Persons (Special Provisions) Act,

No. 19 of 2010 and the same was tendered to the High Court in case No. HC

5398/2010 on 04.04.2013. Accordingly, the proceeding in case No. HC

5398/2010 was terminated with the consent of the Hon. Attorney General

on 04.04.2013 by the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

In the High Case No. HC 6131/2012, the Accused Welaudan Methiyas

Chandrapala alias Mervyn was indicted under two counts.

1. The Accused bought a land worth of Rs. 55 lakhs from the money he

had earned from trafficking of Heroin and thereby committed an

offence punishable under Section 3(1) (a) of the Anti-Money

Loundering Act, No. 05 of 2006.

2. The Accused bought a land worth of Rs. 235 lakhs from the money he

had earned from trafficking of Heroin and thereby committed an

offence punishable under Section 3(1) (a) of the Anti-Money

Loundering Act, No. 05 of 2006.

When it was brought to the notice of the Learned High Court Judge that the

Accused in case No. 6131/2012 was abducted and presumed to be dead, the

Learned High Court Judge by his order dated 11.11.2013, ordered to take

CA(PHC)APN 21/2017

4 | P a g e

steps under Section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act N. 15 of 1979

to proceed the case in absentia of the Accused.

On a subsequent application, the Learned Counsel for the Accused had

brought to the notice of the Court that 241 inquiry cannot be conducted

under the CPC, as there is no evidence that the accused is alive and that he

was absconding wilfully. At this point it is very pertinent to note that the

prosecution had admitted the death certificate of the Accused, which was

filed in the case No. HC 5398/2010. Accordingly, the case No. HC 5398/2010

was abated.

A criminal case can be closed on the death of the accused under the provision

of "abatement ab initio," which means "from the beginning." This provision

states that when the accused dies before the completion of the trial, the case

is deemed to have never existed, and all charges against the accused are

dropped. This is based on the principle that a person cannot be convicted or

punished for a crime if they are no longer alive.

The Learned High Court Judge, after satisfying and applying the said

principle, abated the case when the death certificate of the Accused in case

No. HC 5398/2010 was filed in the High Court. The said death certificate

was admitted by the State Counsel before it was formally adopted to the case.

When the second case No. HC 6131/12 of the Accused was taken up for trial,

which is the subject matter of this revision application, the Counsel for the

Accused made an application to abate the case on the premise that the death

certificate of Accused was filed and accepted by the Court in case No. HC

5398/2010.

On 14.10.2013, the prosecution made an application before the High Court

to grant permission to lead evidence under Section 241(1) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. The Learned Counsel for the

prosecution argued that as the disappearance of the Accused does not fall

into the circumstances mentioned in the Registration of Deaths and Missing

CA(PHC)APN 21/2017

5 | P a g e

Persons (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 2010, and the death of the

Accused cannot be registered under the Registration of Deaths and Missing

Persons (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 2010. The Learned High Court

Judge who heard the submission of the prosecution, allowed the said

application, and granted permission to lead evidence under Section 241(1)

of the CPC.

But the HC 6131/2012 was called on a motion by the Counsel for the

Accused and made another submission highlighting the legal requirements

under the Registration of Deaths and Missing Persons (Special Provisions)

Act, No. 19 of 2010, invited the Court to make the same order made in case

No. HC 5398/2010. After listening to the submission of the State, the

Learned High Court Judge endorsed the order already pronounced by her

predecessor allowing the prosecution to lead evidence under Section 241(1)

of the CPC.

Section 2 of the Registration of Deaths and Missing Persons (Special

Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 2010 reads:

2.(1) Where any person is reported missing and he has not been heard

of for a period exceeding one year by those who would naturally have

heard of him, had he been alive and his disappearance is attributable

to any terrorist or subversive activity or civil commotion which has

taken place within Sri Lanka, a next of kin of such person if he verily

believes such person to be dead, may apply in the manner hereinafter

provided, to register the death of such person under the provisions of

the Births and Deaths Registration Act and to have issued to him, a

Certificate of Death in respect of such person.

(2) Every application under this section shall be substantially in the

Form specified in the Schedule to this Act and shall be forwarded to

the Registrar-General or the District Registrar of Births and Deaths of

CA(PHC)APN 21/2017

6 | P a g e

the District in which such missing person was last resident or had his

permanent residence.

When the Learned Counsel for the Accused in Case No. HC 5398/2010 made

the application to obtain the death certificate under the Registration of

Deaths and Missing Persons (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 2010 very

clearly submitted Section 2 of the Act. The Court after being satisfied with

the submissions by both parties, allowed the application made by the

Accuseds Counsel. Accordingly, the death certificate was issued and was

admitted by the prosecution. Once the prosecution admits the death

certificate of the Accused, they cannot take a different stand in the second

case filed against the Accused. The prosecution is estopped by making such

application in this case.

Section 241 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 states:

(1) Anything to the contrary in this Code notwithstanding the trial of

any person on indictment with or without a jury may commence and

proceed or continue in his absence if the court is satisfied

(a) that the indictment has been served on such person and that

(i) he is absconding or has left the Island; or

(ii) he is unable to attend or remain in court by reason of illness

and has consented to the commencement or continuance of the

trial in his absence; or

(iii) he is unable to attend or remain in court by reason of illness

and in the opinion of the Judge prejudice will not be caused to

him by the commencement or continuance of the trial in his

absence; or

(iv) by reason of his conduct in court, he is obstructing or

impeding the progress of the trial; or

CA(PHC)APN 21/2017

7 | P a g e

(b) that such person is absconding or has left the Island and it has not

been possible to serve indictment on him.

According to the above-mentioned Section, the Court should be first satisfied

that the Accused is absconding or has left the Island. In this case it was

already submitted that the Accused was abducted in the Courts premises

by unknown persons and nothing was heard about the Accused thereafter.

The investigations conducted by the police and prison authorities had failed

to trace the Accused to date. Further, the death certificate of the Accused

had been produced in Court which had been accepted by the prosecution.

Hence, it is presumed that the Accused is dead. Therefore, trial cannot

proceed in absentia of the Accused.

The demise of the Accused during a trial is a scenario where legal

proceedings conclude abruptly without a final judgment. The primary

objective of criminal proceedings is to impose punishment upon the

conviction of the Accused for any offense. However, if the Accused passes

away before the completion of the trial, the proceedings of the case are

required to be terminated.

Continuing trial proceedings following the death of the accused is deemed

futile and devoid of purpose. The Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 does

not contain specific provisions for the abatement of trial proceedings

following the death of the accused. However, this principle has been firmly

established through numerous judgments of the apex courts.

In Turk v R [2017] EWCA Crim 391 the Court of Appeal confirmed that:

Criminal prosecutions should not be pursued against those who have

died: when a defendant dies during criminal proceedings, the court

should take no further action in the proceedings and declare the

indictment of no further effect. The Court observed that critical to

criminal justice process is that trials are neither initiated nor pursued

against those who have died.

CA(PHC)APN 21/2017

8 | P a g e

While the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 does not include

explicit provisions for abating trial proceedings following the death of the

accused, it does contain express provisions for the abatement of appeals after

the death of the appellant under Section 358.

Taking into account the legal stipulations and the underlying rationale

behind trials in absentia, the initiation and continuation of the case after

presenting evidence under Section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act, following the death of the accused, is inconsistent with the law.

This is an exceptional ground which certainly favour the Petitioner.

Therefore, the orders dated 11.11.2013 and 19.02.2014 and the judgment

dated 10.06.2016 of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo are hereby

set-aside.

Therefore, this revision application is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo.
