However, the Petitioner states that the dispute concerning the retirement and the subsequent employment on a contract basis and the terms of such employment were permanently resolved by the collective agreement dated 01.02.2002 (P5) entered into between Ceylon Heavy Industries Company Ltd and Sri Lanka Nidhahas Sevaka Sangamaya on behalf of the employees who accepted the terms of the above collective Agreement by their own conduct.

Accordingly, the Petitioner seeks a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the award P20 made by the 1st Respondent Arbitrator.",
