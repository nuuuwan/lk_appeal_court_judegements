Petitioner has instituted this action to obtain the following reliefs prayed for in the prayer

of the Petition dated 26th July 2023,

(a) Issue notice on the Respondent above named;

(b) Grant an Interim Order staying the proceedings of Badulla High Court Case

bearing No. HC 3650/22,

(c) Call for and Inspect the records of Badulla High Court Case bearing no.44/2022

and Colombo High Court case bearing no. HC 3650/22,

(d) Issue mandates in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari to quash the Indictmnt dated

03-03-2022 of the Badulla High Court Case bearing no.44/2022 marked P1,

(e) Issue mandates in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition, prohibiting the Respondent

and his servants and agents not instituting any action based on the purported

confession marked P6 made by the Petitioner,

(f) Grant costs;

(g) Grant such other reliefs as to Your Lordships Court shall seem fit.

According to the Petition, Number of indictments were filed by the Hon. Attorney General

against the Petitioner in different High Courts namely Colombo, Gampaha and Badulla.

In the High Court of Gampaha, in case No HC 63/2014 the Court has rejected the

confession made by the Petitioner on the basis that, it was not voluntarily made by the

Petitioner. Subsequently he was acquitted from all charges. According to the Petition, the

Page 3 of 7

Respondent has filed another indictment under case bearing No. 44/2022 in the High

Court of Badulla based on the same confession which was marked as P6. The Petitioner

alleged that when the indictment was served to him by the High Court of Badulla, Counsel

for the Petitioner raised a preliminary objection stating that the said confession was

rejected by the High Court of Gampaha. Therefore, the prosecution could not proceed the

case against the Petitioner, as there was no other material evidence available against the

petitioner. The Learned High Court Judge overruled the objection and proceeded with

the trial. The Petitioner challenging the discretion of the Attorney General on the basis

that, without considering, the said confession which was rejected. Hon. Attorney General

proceeded to file the indictment on the same confession. According to the Petitioner,

decision to file the indictment at the High Court of Badulla is unreasonable. Section 393

of the Criminal procedure Code empowers the Attorney General to present the

indictments.

Referring to the above provisions Fernando J, in Victor Ivon v. Sarath N. Silva Attorney

General and Another 1998 (1)SLR 340 at page 342 held that;

It is clear that the Attorney-General has a statutory discretion, which involves several

aspects. He has to decide whether to give or refuse sanction; and whether to exclude a

summary trial, and, in that event, whether to order non-summary proceedings or to file

an indictment. The exercise of that discretion is neither legislative nor judicial action, but

constitutes "executive or administrative action".

The important question in this case is whether the Attorney-General's discretion in regard

to the institution of criminal proceedings is absolute, unfettered and unreviewable, in

which event leave to proceed must be refused without further ado.

Further held that,

In order to determine the nature of the discretion to file an indictment, and whether it is

reviewable, and if so, in what circumstances and to what extent, it is useful first to

examine the discretion to grant sanction: because it is difficult to see on what principle

the Attorney-General could conclude that a prosecution was not warranted and therefore

refuse to grant sanction, but nevertheless file an indictment. Let me begin with an

extreme hypothetical case. If a person complains that he was criminally defamed at a

public meeting, at which he was not present, and the only witness he has, as to the actual

Page 4 of 7

words spoken, is a person who is quite hard of hearing, could sanction be granted, without

any further investigation, and without the statement of the accused having been

recorded? A decision to prosecute in such circumstances would be, prima facie, arbitrary

and capricious, and so would the grant of sanction.

In Kaluhath Ananda Sarath de Abrew v. Chanaka Iddamalgoda an Others , S.C. F/R No.

424/2015, Decided On 11.01.2016, Priyantha Jayawardena, PC, J. held that;

The question therefore is whether the Attorney-General when exercising his statutory

powers abused the discretion conferred on him by acting in bad faith or with an ulterior

motive or whether he has reached a decision based on objective facts.

Further held that;

The aforesaid observation applies with equal force to this application as well. It clearly

explains that in order to secure proper administration of justice, the Attorney-General

must be left to exercise his discretion according to his own judgment, neither acting on

any rule of thumb nor taking into account any other consideration other than what is

provided by law and the public interest. Certainly, the Petitioners remedy is not to ask

this Court to question or review the exercise of the powers of the Attorney-General unless

the Attorney-General has exercised his powers in bad faith or with an ulterior motive or

in excess of his powers.

In Ganeshan Samson Roy v. M.M. Janaka Marasinghe and others, Case No. S.C (F/R)

405/ 2018 Decided On 20.09.2023, Aluwihare, PC, J held that;

Before indictments are filed, the Attorney General should consider if there are reasonable

grounds to suspect that the person to be indicted has committed the offence, or if further

evidence can be obtained to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, or if the seriousness

or the circumstances of the case justifies the making of an immediate decision to file

indictments or if it is in the public interest to file indictments against the suspect.

..

Although the discretion of the Attorney General regarding forwarding of indictments is

reviewable, the circumstances in which the Court will intervene are rare. Prosecutorial

powers are entrusted to identified officers and no other authority can exercise them or

make judgments;.

Before we consider the contention of the Petitioner that the Hon. Attorney General has

abused the discretion to file the indictment, it is prudent to consider the indictment which

was filed in the High Court of Badulla. As in the said indictment of Case No 44/2022 the

Petitioner is the 3rd accused. The said indictment contains 7 charges. Out of that, 1 and 3

are against the Petitioner. The 1st charge is allegation of conspiring to assassinate the

President by causing a bomb explosion, punishable under section 3 of the PTA.

We are mindful that the 1st Count comes under the Prevention of Terrorism Act

(Temporary Provisions) Act No 48 of 1979 as amended (the PTA). According to section 16

(1) (a) any person charged with the said act, make any statement to a police officer above

the rank of Assistant Superintend may be proved as against that Person. Further under

section 16 (3) of the said act, that statement may be proved against any other person

jointly with the person making the statement.

16(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, where any person is charged with

any officer under this Act, any statement made by such person at any time, whether

(a) It amounts to a confession or not;

(b) Made orally or reduced to writing

(c) Such person was or not in custody or presence of a policer officer;

(d) Made in the course of an investigation or not;

(e) It was or not whilly or partly in answer to any question,

may be proved as against such person if such statement is not irrelevant under section

24 of the Evidence Ordinance:

"Provided, however, that no such statement shall be proved as against such person if such

statement was made to a police officer below the rank of an Assistant Superintendent.

(2) The burden of proving that any statement referred to in subsection (1) is irrelevant

under section 24 of the Evidence Ordinance shall be on the person asserting it to be

irrelevant.

(3) Any statement admissible under subsection (1) may be proved as against any other

person charged jointly with the person making the statement, if, and only if, such

statement is corroborated in material particulars by evidence other than the statements

referred to in subsection (1).

In this context, apart from the Petitioner, other 3 Accused also made confessions. The

Petitioner has failed to prove that other 3 confessions were also rejected by any other

Court. There is no evidence to show that, the 1st count was born out from whose

confession whether the Petitioner or other Accused said to have made.

With regard to the 3rd count on the indictment is that the Petitioner transported

explosives in his official vehicle from Bellanvila to Badulla.

The indictment revealed that the Government Analyst by his report clearly confirms the

presence of RDX explosives found in the said official vehicle. It is Crystal clear that the

Respondent, formed an opinion to indict the Petitioner, not only the Petitioners confession

also the other evidence discovered in the cause of the investigation. We are mindful the

explosives was found on the official vehicle of the Petitioner. Our Courts are held that;

unless otherwise the Petitioner is able to prove that there is a mala fide on part of the

Attorney General to indict the Petitioner Courts are reluctant to intervene with the

decision of the Attorney General.

In the Case of Fakhir v. Attorney General 2021 (1) SLR 230 at Page 235,

Obeyesekere,J.P/CA held that;

It is significant to note that the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is not alleging

dishonesty or ma/a fides on the part of the Attorney General in indicting the Petitioner,

but, as I have already stated, is only complaining that there is no factual basis to sustain

the charge against the Petitioner.

For the above said reasons, We dismiss the application with Costs.
