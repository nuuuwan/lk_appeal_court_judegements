JUDGMENT

M.C.B.S. Morais J.

Notices were duly issued on the Respondent on two separate occasions via registered post

and or both occasions, the notices were not returned undelivered. Therefore, it is assumed

that the Respondent having duly received notice, does not wish to partake in this proceedings.

In light of this and there being no evidence to suggest the Respondent has not received the

notices, the court had no option but to proceed with hearing the Petitioner in absence of the

Respondent.

The Defendant-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) named

Abeydeera Arachchige Chalet Kamalawathie is praying for following reliefs from us in the

petition dated 28th of March 2024.

a. Issue notice on the Substituted Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent

b. Allow this application

c. Set-aside the Order dated 05.12.2023 of the action bearing No. 1446/L in the district

court of Nuwara Eliya

d. Invalidate the eviction of the Petitioner from the land more fully described in the first

schedule to this petition on 07.11/2023 by executing the writ in the action bearing No.

D.C.Nuwara Eliya

e. Restore the Petitioner of the possession of the land more fully described in the first

schedule to this petition

f. Grant costs, and;

g. Such other and further reliefs as your Lordships shall deem meet.

We heard the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner and duly considered the available

material. The Petitioner asserts that an individual named Hewawalpitage Medawattegedara

Appuhami (hereinafter referred to as the Appuhami) was the original owner of a parcel of

land known as 'Wataweltanna,' also referred to as 'Watawelakele,' which comprises an extent

of 24.06 perches, as more fully described in the First Schedule to this Petition. Appuhami

Page 4 of 8

subsequently conveyed an undivided portion of this land, measuring 40 feet in width and 40

feet in length, and as more fully detailed in the Second Schedule to this Petition, to

Abeydeera Arachchige John Sinno (hereinafter referred to as the John Sinno) by the deed

bearing No. 6275 dated 07th of May 1946, the father of the Petitioner.

The Petitioner avers that John Sinno had been in possession of the entire land described in the

First Schedule to the petition and had acquired title to it by prescription. Upon his death, John

Sinno's heirs succeeded to his interest in the property and later transferred the land in

question to the Petitioner by Deed bearing No. 0292 dated 30th of September 1980.

Subsequently, the Petitioner transferred/mortgaged the said land to the Plaintiff by Deed

bearing No. 3008, dated the 5th of May 2008.

According to the Petitioner, the Plaintiff claims in the complaint that the Petitioner has not

transferred possession of the property to the Plaintiff, but only mortgaged. In any event this

court will not venture into the legality of the judgment as it has finally been decided by the

Supreme Court.

According to the Petitioner, the present issue has arisen as the land on which she resides

contains an additional piece of land, apart from the portion of the property measuring forty

feet in length and forty feet in width, which is the subject matter of this action.

After trial, the learned Additional District Judge of Nuwara Eliya delivered judgment in favor

of the Plaintiff on the 31st of October 2013. Aggrieved by the judgment, the Petitioner lodged

an appeal before the Civil Appellate High Court of Kandy, which was dismissed. The

Petitioner then filed an application for leave to appeal against the judgment of the Civil

Appellate High Court, and while the Supreme Court granted leave to appeal, the appeal was

eventually dismissed.

While the appeal before the Supreme Court was pending, the Plaintiff passed away, and the

Substituted Plaintiff-Respondent was substituted in place of the deceased Plaintiff.

The Petitioner further asserts that she was born in the ancestral home situated on the said

land, where she resided for the entirety of her 80 years of life, until her eviction by writ

Page 5 of 8

execution in relation to the instant action, bearing No. 1446/L of the District Court of Nuwara

Eliya, on the 7th of November 2023.

The Petitioner avers that, by virtue of the impugned deed bearing No. 3308, she transferred

only a portion of the land detailed in the second schedule of the plaint. She further asserts that

both she and her father had been in possession of a larger parcel of land more fully described

in the first schedule. The land sought by the Plaintiff, as claimed, remained an undivided part

of the original land, and both the schedule to the plaint as well as the schedule to the

impugned deed No. 3008 clearly indicate that the northern boundary of the subject land

adjoins the remaining portion of the same larger land.

The Petitioner further states that on or about 07.11.2023, the Fiscal Officer of the District

Court of Walapane arrived at the premises described in the first schedule of this petition to

execute the writ pertaining to the case. Upon the officer's arrival, the Petitioner raised

objections to the execution of the writ, specifically opposing her ejectment from the entire

land described in the first schedule. Notwithstanding her objections, the writ was executed,

resulting in her eviction from the entirety of the larger land.

Aggrieved by what she contends was an unlawful eviction, the Petitioner subsequently sought

relief from the District Court of Nuwara Eliya. However, despite her application, the learned

District Judge refused to issue notice on the Respondent. The Petitioner, being dissatisfied

with the outcome, now seeks appropriate legal recourse to address the injustice caused to her

by the said wrongful eviction.

The Petitioner asserts that the writ was executed without the proper identification of the

subject matter in question. She further contends that no surveyor was present during the

execution of the writ, and no plan or survey was utilized to accurately identify the subject

land. This, she argues, has led to a wrongful and unlawful execution of the writ without

adequate verification of the boundaries or the specific area subject to the dispute.

Upon examination of the pleadings and the schedule of the plaint, it becomes evident that the

Plaintiff is claiming title to a portion of land described in Deed No. 3008, dated 05.05.2008,

which is as follows.

Page 6 of 8

Land called Watavelthennaya a part of TP Plan 168557 situated in Nidandahinna,

Walapane Yati Palatha Korale, Nuwara Eliya District, Central Province, in extent of forty

feet long and forty feet wide, or one thousand six hundred square feet (40x40 + 1600) or one

hundred and sixty square meters (160 sqm) bounded to the north by remaining part of the

same land, to the East by reserved land strip along the highway to the South by the land

belonging to Mr. DP Yapathilaka and to the Wesby land belonging to Palawatte Apphuhami.

While the Plaintiff relies on Deed No. 3008 to support her claim over the disputed land, it

must be emphasized that the deed in question describes a specific portion of the land

measuring forty feet in length and forty feet in widthamounting to a total of 1600 square

feet. Though the Petitioner also may have bought the land as for the same schedule, she has

been in possession of such for 30 years or more even as for the documents submitted by the

Plaintiff herself. As it is apparent the larger land which the Petitioner claims to be is an

adjoining land which has been enjoyed by the Petitioner on inheritance/prescription or some

other right. However, the Plaintiffs legal entitlement under the deed is thus confined to this

1600 square feet of land. This portion, as described in the deed, is valid insofar as it refers to

the specific area covered by the deed. However, while the deed grants ownership to the

Plaintiff over this defined plot of land, it cannot, by itself, invalidate any rights that may have

been acquired by the Petitioner through inheritance/prescriptive possession or in any other

manner.

Therefore, it is nothing but proper for the court to obtain the assistance of a qualified

surveyor to accurately identify and demarcate the Plaintiffs land as described in Deed No.

3008. The Plaintiffs claim is limited to a plot measuring 40 feet by 40 feet (1600 square

feet), and the surveyor must ensure that this portion tallies with the deeds boundaries as

much as possible. Given potential discrepancies between textual descriptions and physical

markers on the land, the surveyor's role is crucial in reconciling these differences. This

ensures that the Plaintiff's claim is properly enforced, while also respecting any right the

Petitioner may have acquired over the years. The surveyors findings will guide the court in

fairly resolving the dispute by safeguarding the legal rights of both parties.

Upon careful examination, it is evident that the execution of the writ by the lower court was

not in accordance with the applicable legal principles. Specifically, the writ failed to properly

Page 7 of 8

account for the Plaintiff's limited entitlement to the plot of land as described in Deed No.

3008, which measures 40 feet by 40 feet. The enforcement of the writ, in its current form,

risks overstepping the bounds of the Plaintiffs legal claim and infringing upon the rights of

the Petitioner, particularly in relation to any title she may have acquired, separately.

In light of these concerns, I hereby allow the Petitioners application and set aside the

enforcement of the writ as originally issued. The learned district judge is directed to re-

enforce the writ, but with the crucial modification of incorporating the assistance of a

surveyor. The surveyor will be tasked with accurately identifying and demarcating the

specific portion of land measuring 40 feet by 40 feet (1600 square feet) to which the Plaintiff

is entitled under the deed. The surveyor must also ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that

this portion aligns with the boundaries provided in the schedule. The Plaintiffs entitlement

should be limited to the so identified the plot of land measuring 1600 square feet and the

eviction of the Petitioner from the rest should be null and void.

As it is the Plaintiffs duty to properly identify the land described in the deed, it follows that

the cost of engaging the surveyor should be borne by the Plaintiff. However, as the Plaintiff-

Respondent is absent and unrepresented, the court should not rely on the Plaintiff for such.

Accordingly, the cost of the surveyor should be borne by the Petitioner which may be set off

against the ordered taxed costs payable by the Petitioner to the Plaintiff in the court below.

The matter that must be particularly emphasized here is that the subject of the appeal, which

has been rendered moot by the Supreme Court, and the issue addressed by the present

application are two distinct and separate matters. The appeal before the Supreme Court

addresses the merits of the impugned judgment while this application pertains to the

enforcement of such. These two issues concern different legal points and should not be

conflated or treated as identical. While the appeal has come to a final determination due to

the Supreme Court's ruling, the RII (present matter) continues to address a separate, relevant

issue in the case. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the distinction between these matters to

avoid any confusion or misinterpretation in the legal context.

Ultimately, I find that the original execution of the writ should be set aside, and the district

court should proceed with the re-enforcement of the writ in line with these terms. The

Page 8 of 8

surveyors findings will ensure that the Plaintiff receives possession of the specific plot

described in the deed, without exceeding the boundaries of her lawful claim.

Hence, I direct accordingly, and subject to the above limitations, this application is allowed.
