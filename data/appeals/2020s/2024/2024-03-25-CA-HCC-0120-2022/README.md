Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Mannar for committing the following offences.

1. That he abducted a minor girl child on or about 01-01-2013, at Pesalai

within the jurisdiction of the High Court of Mannar, and thereby

committed an offence punishable in terms of Section 354 of the Penal

Code.

2. At the same time and at the same transaction, inserted one of his

fingers into the vagina of the mentioned minor girl child, and thereby

committed the offence of grave sexual abuse on her, punishable in

terms of Section 365B(2)(b) of the Penal Code as amended by Penal

Code (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1995, 29 of 1998 and 16 of 2006.

The appellant has pleaded not guilty to the charge and after trial, he was found

guilty as charged by the learned High Court Judge of Mannar of the judgment

dated 29-06-2022.

After considering the mitigatory, as well as aggravating circumstances, the

learned High Court Judge has sentenced the appellant in the following manner.

1. On count 01-2 years rigorous imprisonment. In addition, Rs.10,000/-

fine, and in default, 6 months simple imprisonment.

2. On count 02-7 years rigorous imprisonment. In addition, Rs.10,000/-

fine, and in default, 6 months simple imprisonment.

The above two sentences have been ordered to run concurrently to each

other.

It has also been ordered that the appellant should pay Rs.100,000/- as

compensation to the victim child, and in default, he has been ordered

to serve 6 months simple imprisonment.

It is against this conviction and the sentence, the appellant has preferred this

appeal.

Facts in Brief

The victim child who was born on 09th June 2004, has given her evidence as PW-

01 before the High Court. When she gave evidence for the first time, she had

been a grade 11 student in her school.

Although she was unable to give the specific date of the incident, she has stated

that it occurred on either 11th or 13th of January 2013. She has stated that this

incident happened when she went with two other friends to drop off a Catholic

nun at the house of a relative of the appellant.

There had been a house warming ceremony at the next-door neighbours house

of PW-01, and the wedding of the appellants son had been held at the same time

at the appellants house. PW-01 and her mother had attended the house

warming function on that day, and it was from there she has gone with the

Catholic nun to drop her off at the relatives house.

The time was around 7.30 or 8.00 in the night and the two other girls who

accompanied the victim child has gone inside a house of one of them, namely

Richvini.

Page 4 of 17

At that point, she has met the appellant whom she referred to as grandpa. He

has asked her the reasons for not attending the wedding function at his house.

The victim has informed him that her mother said that they would be attending

the function tomorrow. Thereafter, the appellant has held the victim child on his

lap, talked to her, and had taken her in between two dolphin vans parked nearby.

There had been no light, and it was dark.

The evidence of the victim child clearly shows that she had been reluctant to

come out with what happened to her thereafter. She has stated that after taking

her there, the appellant started to touch her and lifted the dress she was wearing.

He has started touching her thighs and moved upwards and touched her

genitals. At that point, she had been able to take his hand off her body and had

run away. Upon questioning further, she has clearly stated that he kept on

touching her undergarment and touched her genitals.

After escaping the appellants grip, she has gone and informed the incident to

her grandmother, but it appears that the grandmother has not taken any notice

of what the victim child was stating to her.

She has been studying in grade 4 of her school at that time, and it appears that

the victim has been silently suffering because of this incident.

As a result of an awareness program conducted in the school, she has come out

as to what happened to her by informing the incident to one Osman Kulas, who

was the person who conducted that awareness program. This has resulted in

police being made aware of this incident and the resultant investigations had led

to the charges against the appellant.

The cross-examination of the victim child reveals that she has informed this

incident to the earlier mentioned person only in the year 2014, and the said

person was the Child welfare Service Officer attached to Assistant Government

Agent's office in the area. It has also been revealed that when the child informed

her grandmother, she has gone and scolded the appellant.

Page 5 of 17

The mother of the child has given evidence at the trial. She has come to know

about this incident one and a half years after it occurred, and only when the

police came and inquired about the incident.

She has come to know later that when this incident occurred, her daughter has

informed it to her mother, namely, the childs grandmother, but because the

grandmother has told the child not to inform anyone, her daughter has not

informed the incident to her.

The defence has admitted the Medico-Legal Report (MLR) relevant to the

examination of the PW-01 and accordingly, it has been marked as P-02 without

the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) being called to give evidence. Obviously, the

JMO has failed to observe any visible injuries on the victim child.

Apart from the above witnesses, the prosecution has only called police witnesses

who conducted investigations into the matter and has closed the case.

Once the appellant was called upon for his defence by the learned High Court

Judge, he has chosen to give evidence under oath. He has also called several

witnesses on his behalf.

Interestingly, although the prosecution has failed to call the grandmother of the

child to whom the victim child has narrated the incident soon after its

occurrence, and also the person who conducted the awareness programme at

her school to whom the child has narrated the incident for the second time, and

the JMO who examined the child, as prosecution witnesses, the appellant has

called them as defence witnesses, and several others, and in the process,

connecting the missing links of the prosecution case.

The appellant in his evidence has stated that he had a wedding reception at his

house on the 12th and 13th without specifying the month and the year. He has

stated that about 100-150 people attended the function on each day and in the

afternoon, he was engaged in activities connected to the function. He has stated

that the victim childs grandmother lives in the adjoining land to his house and

Page 6 of 17

since his family is a good family with educated children, all are jealous about his

family. He has also stated that, because he refused a marriage proposal to his

son made by the victim childs family, they are angry with him, and the whole

village is angry with him because he supported a candidate opposed by the

villages in an election.

He has also stated that the villagers are also jealous with him because his

children are educated. Although he has not stated anything specific about the

allegation against him in his evidence, it appears that his claim was that, a false

complaint was made against him due to jealousy.

Under cross-examination by the prosecution, he has stated that because he

purchased the land next to their land, which they wanted to purchase, there was

an enmity between them. He has failed to specify as to whom he referred to as

they in his evidence.

On behalf of the appellant, the grandmother of the victim child, Christina Kulas

has been called as a witness. She has confirmed that there was a marriage

celebration in relation to the appellants sons wedding, as well as a house

warming function in her village during the time relevant to this allegation against

the appellant.

She has confirmed that the child came and told her that the appellant touched

her inappropriately and put his hands inside her knickers and she ran away

subsequently. It had been her evidence that since no rape has been committed,

she did not take what was told to her by her granddaughter seriously, but she

met the appellant and warned him. She has not taken any steps to inform this

incident to the mother of the child thinking that it would lead to a problem, and

had also informed the child not to tell the incident to her mother. She has stated

that, nevertheless the incident has come to light one year later when the police

came and started investigations.

On behalf of the defence, the person to whom the child says that she informed

about the incident after the awareness program has also been called as a

Page 7 of 17

witness. He had been the Child Rights Welfare Officer attached to the relevant

Government Agents Office. He has confirmed that he conducted an awareness

seminar about child protection at the school where the victim child was studying,

and after the seminar, the child came and told him the incident.

The appellant had called the JMO who examined the child to give evidence on

behalf of him, and he has confirmed that it was he who prepared the Medical

Report dated 27-05-2014. He has not found any external injuries, and upon

examining her female genitals, he has found that she was a child who had not

attained puberty at that time. There had been no injuries to her vagina as well

as in her anal area. But the JMO has opined that sexual abuse cannot be

excluded.

The appellant has also called the friend mentioned by PW-01 in her evidence,

namely, Richvini with whom she has gone to drop off the Catholic nun near the

house of the appellant. The evidence does not reveal anything relevant to the

incident.

Although the appellant has several other witnesses to give evidence on behalf of

him, I find that none of the witnesses voiced anything relevant to the incident,

other than speaking about peripheral matters as questioned by the learned

Counsel on behalf of the appellant when they were giving evidence.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of the

appellant formulated the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the

Court.

1. In view of the belatedness of the complaint and the discrepancies of the

evidence of PW-01 taken with other witnesses, whether the conviction

could be sustained.

2. In the light of the specific act mentioned in the indictment, whether the

prosecution has failed to prove the charge of grave sexual abuse.

Page 8 of 17

3. The offence of kidnapping cannot be sustained in the light of the

evidence.

4. Whether the learned High Court Judge has failed to adequately

consider the defence, especially the evidence of the appellant.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

As the mentioned grounds of appeal are interrelated, I will now proceed to

consider the said grounds of appeal as a whole.

It is trite law that in a criminal case, the evidence placed before the Court has to

be considered as a whole, whether it was by the prosecution or by the defence,

in coming to a finding whether the prosecution has proved its case beyond

reasonable doubt and whether the evidence has created a reasonable doubt as

to the guilt of the accused, or at least has provided a reasonable explanation as

to the evidence placed before the Court against the accused. Any doubt that

arises out of the evidence has to be considered in favor of the accused, where he

should be granted the benefit of the doubt.

In the case of Pantis Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 148, it was held:

As the burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt and no such duty is cast on the accused and it is sufficient

for the accused to give an explanation which satisfies the Court or at least

is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.

In the Indian Supreme Court case of Narender Kumar Vs. State (NCT of Delhi),

AIR 2012 SC 2281 : (2012) Cri LJ 3033 : (2012) 3 JCC 1888 : (2012) 5 SCALE

657 : (2012) 7 SCC 171 : (2012) AIRSCW 3391 : (2012) 4 Supreme 59, it was

held:

Prosecution case has to stand on its own legs and cannot take support from

the weakness of the case of defence. However great the suspicion against

the accused and however strong the moral belief and conviction of the court,

unless the offence of the accused is established beyond reasonable doubt

Page 9 of 17

on the basis of legal evidence and material on the record, he cannot be

convicted for an offence. There is an initial presumption of innocence of the

accused and the prosecution has to bring home the offence against the

accused by reliable evidence. The accused is entitled to the benefit of every

reasonable doubt.

Prosecution has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and cannot take

support from the weakness of the case of defence. There must be proper

legal evidence and material on record to record the conviction of the accused.

Conviction can be based on sole testimony of the prosecutrix provided it

lends assurance of her testimony.

In this matter, although the prosecution has listed several witnesses, only the

victim child, namely PW-01, her mother (PW-02), and the police officer who

conducted the investigations had been called on behalf of the prosecution.

The fact that the victim child was a girl under 16 years of age at the time of this

alleged incident was an admitted fact, and since the appellant has admitted the

MLR, the JMO who has examined the child has also not been called to give

evidence.

However, when the accused was called upon on for his defence, apart from giving

evidence under oath, it is the appellant who has called the grandmother of the

child, the listed prosecution witness number 3, to whom the child states in her

evidence that she went and informed the incident soon after its occurrence. The

appellant has also called Jude Osman Kulas, the Child Rights Welfare Officer of

the relevant area who has conducted an awareness program at the school of the

victim child, where the victim child is said to have divulged this incident after

listening to the said program.

On behalf of the appellant, the friend of the victim child with whom she mentions

that she went near the house of the appellant before she faced this sexual abuse

has also been called. Apart from these witnesses, the JMO who examined the

child and issued the MLR marked P-02 has also been called, among other

Page 10 of 17

defence witnesses. I find that by this process, the appellant himself has

completed the vital missing links of the witnesses called on behalf of the

prosecution.

It is well settled law that it is the totality of the evidence that has to be considered

in a trial, be it for the prosecution or defence, rather than compartmentalizing

the evidence.

It was held in the case of James Silva Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2

SLR 167 that;

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider

all the matters adduced before the Court, whether by the prosecution or by

the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and, ask himself

whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he

believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty.

When it comes to the question whether this is a belated complaint, that fact has

to be considered in relevance to the facts and the circumstances that led to the

complaint. The evidence of the victim child is clear that the appellant was a

person well-known to her and a person she referred to as a grandpa, which

shows that he is an elderly person who had the respect of the child.

The child had been around 9 years of age at the time of the incident. Soon after

its happening, she has gone and narrated the incident to her grandmother. The

grandmother has confirmed in her evidence that, in fact, the child came and

informed the incident, but since no rape has been committed, she informed the

child not to divulge it to anyone.

However, the childs evidence clearly shows that this was an incident which she

could not forget and only when there was an awareness program of sexual abuse

and aspects relating to it by the Child Rights Welfare Officer of the area, she had

gained the courage to inform the incident to him. This was after about one and

a half years from the incident.

Page 11 of 17

The evidence of the mother of the child also has established the fact that as a

result of this information being provided to the police, the police have come in

search of them and initiated investigations which resulted in the indictment

against the appellant. I am of the view that, belatedness of the complaint was

not due to the complaint being a false one, but for the reasons as considered

above, which can be highly justified.

In the case of D. Tikiribanda Vs. Attorney-General CA 64/2003 decided 06-

10-2009 reported in the Bar Association Law Journal (2010) (B.L.R.) 92 it

was held:

If delay of making a statement is explainable the evidence of a witness

should not be rejected on that ground alone.

In the case of Gamage Prabhath Janaka Nayana Priyantha Perera Vs.

Attorney General [CA/107/2012] decided on 27.05.2016 at page 6, A.H.M.D

Nawaz, J. observed that

Why the witness did not reveal a dastardly act or otherwise is a fact for

him or her to explain and in fact if the explanation is plausible and credible

the Court must act on the testimony albeit belated. If the explanation of erred

for the delayed statement is plausible and acceptable and the Court accepts

the same as plausible, there is no reason to interfere with the conclusion

made by the trial court for accepting the belated testimony.

The other matter taken up by the learned Presidents Counsel was that due to

the discrepancies in the evidence of the PW-01 and other witnesses, it is not safe

to let the conviction stand. I am unable to find any justifications in that regard.

I do not find any material discrepancies in the evidence of PW-01, her mother,

her grandmother, and the relevant Child Rights Welfare Officer, as well as the

JMO, and the mentioned friend of PW-01, who are the relevant witnesses in this

matter.

Page 12 of 17

One has to be mindful that the child has given evidence more than 7 years after

the incident. Her evidence clearly shows that she had been silently suffering as

a result of this incident and this establishes that she has been trying to forget

about the whole incident and move on with her life. Being a child of tender age,

her ability to exactly remember and narrate an incident that happened several

years ago has to be considered. Besides that, the fact that the child was a grown-

up youth of about 17 years old when she was required to give evidence in Court

should also needs be taken into consideration in evaluating her evidence.

It was held in the Court of Appeal Case of D. Tikiribanda Vs. The Attorney

General (Supra) that;

Mostly the victims of sexual harassment prefer not to talk about the

harrowing experience and would like to forget about the incident as soon as

possible (withdrawal symptom). The offenders should not be allowed to

capitalize or take mean advantage of these natural inherent weaknesses of

small children.

A witness is not supposed to have a photographic memory of the events that took

place in a given scenario and the Court needs to be aware of such situations

when considering evidence.

At this stage, I find it appropriate to refer to the Indian case of Bhoginbhai

Hirjibhai Vs State of Gujarat (AIR 1983-SC 753 at pp 756-758) very often

cited in our Courts. It was held:

1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape

is replayed on the mental screen.

2) Ordinarily, so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness

could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element

of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to be

attuned to absorb the details.

Page 13 of 17

3) Ordinarily, a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence

of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short time span. A

witness is liable to get confused or mixed up when interrogated later on.

4) A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the court

atmosphere and the piercing cross-examination made by counsel and out

of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of events,

or fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment. The sub-

conscious mind of the witness sometime so operates on account of the

fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witnesses is giving

truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him perhaps

it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on the spur of

the moment.

It is also necessary to bear in mind any contradiction or omission has to be

material to the issue at hand.

It is well established law that for a contradiction to be relevant in a case, such

contradiction or contradictions should have the effect of shaking the core of the

case, and trivial contradictions should not be considered in such a manner when

considering the totality of the evidence.

In the case of Mahathun and Others Vs. The Attorney General (2015) 1 SLR

74 it was held:

(1) When faced with contradictions in a witness testimonial, the Court

must bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions,

viewed in light of the whole of the evidence given by the witness.

(2) Too great a significance cannot be attached to minor discrepancies, or

contradictions.

(3) What is important is whether the witness is telling the truth on the

material matters concerned with the event.

(4) Where evidence is generally reliable, much importance should not be

attached to the minor discrepancies and technical errors.

Page 14 of 17

(5) The Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial judge

with regard to the acceptance or rejection of the testimony of a witness

unless it is manifestly wrong.

For the reasons as considered above, I find that the evidence taken in its totality

had been cogent and trustworthy, which provides no basis for the considered

grounds of appeal.

The learned Presidents Counsel argued that in the 2nd count preferred against

the appellant, the act alleged to have been committed by the appellant which

amounts to grave sexual abuse was inserting a finger into the vagina of the victim

child. It was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel that since the

victim child has not stated specifically that the appellant inserted the finger into

her vagina, the prosecution has failed to prove the specific charge.

The definition of grave sexual abuse as stated in Section 365B of the Penal Code

refers to an act committed by any person who, for sexual gratification, does any

act, by the use of his genitals or any other part of the human body or any

instrument on any orifice or part of the body of any other person, being an act

which does not amount to rape in terms of Section 363 of the Penal Code on

circumstances falling under the categories mentioned in Section 365B (1) and

(2).

When scrutinizing the evidence of the child given before the trial Court, it is

quite apparent that the victim child has been a reluctant witness, for obvious

reasons. I find no basis to believe that her reluctance has been due to her saying

something that did not happen or due to her making a false statement. Her initial

evidence has been that the appellant touched her with his hand, touched her

thighs and started moving up, and at that point, she took his hands off and ran

away. When questioned further, she has been specific that the appellant lifted

her dress and touched her genitals, but has stated that she cannot say the

manner in which he touched her genitals.

Page 15 of 17

The grandmother to whom the child has gone and narrated the incident has

stated in her evidence that the child came and told her that the appellant

touched her stomach and tried to put his hands inside her undergarments, and

she ran away after that.

Although the child has been unable to say that the appellant inserted a finger

into her vagina as mentioned in the indictment in describing the act committed

by the appellant, she has been specific that the appellant touched her vagina,

but, unable to describe what he did to her vagina. As I have considered before,

if one considers her evidence as a whole, this was not due her narrating

something that did not happen, but due to the possible reasons considered as

above. I am of the view that the necessary ingredients of the offence have been

established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.

I do not find any basis to accept that the necessary ingredients of the offence of

kidnapping have not been established either. The evidence clearly provides that

the child was a minor under 16 years of age and a female. The evidence

establishes that when the child went near the house of the appellant, he has

taken the child between two parked vans and it had been without the consent of

the lawful guardian of the minor child. Since the grave sexual abuse incident

has occurred as a result of the child being taken to the place where the offence

was committed, I find that the offence of kidnapping from the lawful

guardianship has been established in this case.

The other matter that needs consideration is whether the learned High Court

Judge has failed to give adequate consideration to the defence taken up by the

appellant. When the victim child gave evidence, the position taken has been that

no such incident happened and the victim child is lying about it. It has been

suggested to her that because Osman Kulas, the Child Rights Welfare Officer,

who is a relative of the victim, it is he who instigated this false complaint to take

revenge from the appellants family.

Page 16 of 17

However, when called for a defence, his evidence has been to the effect that,

because his family and children are well educated, the villagers are jealous of

them, and it was the reason for this false complaint. Apart from that, he has

taken the position that because he supported a relative of him in the election

against the wishes of the people of the village, the villagers are against him.

I find that none of these positions had been suggested to the relevant witnesses

when they gave evidence. Even if it is to be assumed that the victim child, due

to her age, may not be able answer such a suggestion, at least that suggestion

should have been put to the mother of the victim child, which was not the case.

In fact, her mother has confirmed that she and her daughter attended the

wedding function that was held in the appellants house, which shows that there

had not been any enmity between them, which may be the very reason why no

such suggestion has been put to the mother of the victim child.

It is well-settled law that when an accused person takes up a particular line of

defence, that has to be put to the relevant witnesses when they come and give

evidence before the Court so that they can be confronted with the said stand.

Failure to do so will be a factor that has to be considered against the relevant

person.

In Sarwan Singh Vs State of Punjab 2002 AIR Supreme Court iii 3652 at

36755,3656, it was observed;

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to

avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross examination it must

follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted. This

case was cited with approval in the case of Boby Mathew Vs State of

Karnataka 2004 3 Cri. L. J.3003

Page 17 of 17

His Lordship Sisira de Abrew, J. stated in Pilippu Mandige Nalaka Krishantha

Kumara Thisera Vs A.G CA 87/2005 decided on 17-05-2007 that;

.I hold that whenever evidence given by a witness on a material point is

not challenged in cross examination, it has to be concluded that such

evidence is not disputed and is accepted by the opponent subject of course

to the qualification that the witness is a reliable witness.

This Court is very much mindful that the weaknesses of the defence case would

not be a reason to conclude against the accused person in a criminal trial.

However, I am of the view that irrespective of the weaknesses of the defence case,

the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt against the

appellant when considering the evidence as a whole.

Therefore, I find no reasons to interfere with the conviction and sentence by the

learned High Court Judge.

The appeal is dismissed due to want of any merit. The conviction and the

sentence affirmed.

Since the appellant is on bail pending appeal, the sentence against him shall

take effect from the date this judgment is pronounced upon the appellant by the

learned High Court Judge of Mannar.
