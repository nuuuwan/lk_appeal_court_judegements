Accordingly, it was argued that placing the burden on the Accused is against the general principles with regard to the defence of alibi. When a defence of alibi is taken, there is no burden of proof on the Accused. The defence evidence on alibi has to be merely weighed with the prosecution evidence. If the alibi is not believed it fails. If it is believed it succeeds. If it is neither believed nor disbelieved, but holds that it creates a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case, the 1st Accused is entitled to be acquitted.",

However, as per the communication from the Registrar of the Magistrates Court of Trincomalee, the prosecution had submitted six empty cartridges to the Magistrates Court. Notably, none of these productions were produced or identified by the witnesses. Moreover, the prosecutions failed to obtain a Government Analyst report concerning the pistol, bullets, and empty cartridges, which could have established whether they were discharged from the recovered pistol.",
