In the instant matter we observe that both the ID parades have been held well beyond a month but we note that prior to the parades the suspects have been in remand custody since 13th of February which is only a day away from the incident and prior to that they had been in police custody. Hence it would have been ideal if the parades were held with in close proximity of the incident. As such we find the evidence of the ID parades is subjected to certain infirmities but we observe that they are not grave enough to reject the evidence of the parades. Nevertheless, we are mindful of the fact that the evidence ata parade is not substantive evidence but is of only corroborative evidence.",

A Dock Identification is a valid form of identification. However, time and again court have been mindful of the dangers in convicting an accused solely based on a dock identification. At page 256 in Volume 1 The Law of Evidence by E.R.S.R.Coomaraswamy, in the context of dock identification, it is observed, This practice is undesirable and unsafe and should be avoided, if possible. Court of Appeal in Muniratne & Others v State, [2001] 2 SLR 382 observed the undesirability of conviction based on dock identification and in K.M. Premachandra &Others v Attorney General , C.A. 39-41/97, decided on 13.10.1996, set aside the conviction of one accused whose conviction was based on a dock identification. In Roshan v Attorney General , [2011] 1 SLR 364 at 377, held in the backdrop of an acknowledged disparity in the complexion and appearance of the accused at the trial stage, the assailant being a total stranger to the complainant who had a mere 04 hour visual contact with the assailant, the evidence of subsequent dock identification several years later would not eliminate the generation of a reasonable and justifiable doubt as to the veracity and genuiness of the identification, unlessthere are other supervening and compelling reasons to justify.",
