The Pythagorean comma is a small interval that results from the difference between twelve perfect fifths and seven octaves. It is also the difference between enharmonically equivalent notes, such as D and C , in Pythagorean tuning. It is said, that The Pythagorean comma demonstrates that our tonal system is not perfectly consistent but has a gap whose form and cause I will describe in this post. The comma is relevant in terms of both our Pythagorean comma musical practice, since it has very specific effects, and of philosophy and science, since it is typical of the problems that we observe in the interplay of our three worlds (according to Penrose). Thus it is a topic that is not solely relevant to musicians but also to people who are interested in the question as to how mathematics (ideal world), physics (physical world) and our experience (mental world) relate to each other. That is why law, physics and music resonate together.",
