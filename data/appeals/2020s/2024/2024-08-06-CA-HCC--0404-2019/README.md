JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Ratnapura for committing three counts of incest on his step daughter namely

Thavalangodage Nimeshi Saumya between 01/01/2007 to 31/12/2007 an

offence punishable under Section 364(3) of the Penal Code as amended.

After the trial the Appellant was convicted as charged on all three counts and

he was sentenced to 20 years rigorous imprisonment on each count with a

fine of Rs.30000/-. In default of which 01-year rigorous imprisonment was

imposed on each count. In addition, the Learned High Court Judge had

specified a sum of Rs.300000/- to be paid as compensation to the victim on

each count and in default of which a sentence of 01 years rigorous

imprisonment was imposed on each count.

Further, the Learned Trial Judge had ordered the sentence imposed on

1st,2nd and 3rd counts to run concurrently.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Counsel for the Appellant placed following grounds of appeal for

adjudication:

1. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to evaluate that the

prosecution failed to prove the alleged offence was committed during

the period stipulated in the indictment.

2. The Appellant was deprived a fair trial.

PW1, the prosecutrix who encountered this unpleasant incident was in grade

six. The Appellant was her step father who lived with her mother in the same

house.

On the day of the first incident, when she was at home with her elder sister,

the Appellant had first sent her sister out of the house to look whether any

one coming. After that he had taken the victim inside the house, put her on

a mat and committed rape on her. Although she divulged this incident to her

sister, but not told her mother who came home after work. This is due to the

threat extended on her by the Appellant. In two weeks gap the Appellant had

continued to rape her thrice in similar fashion. As it was unbearable pain

not only to her but also to her elder sister, both had gone to the police and

lodged a complaint against the Appellant. Although both had gone to

Pothupitiya Police Station first to lodge a complaint, but the proper

investigation was done by Rakwana Police station. The victim admitted that

she lodged her complaint on 05.06.2011. Due to fear of the Appellant, she

had waited 3 and half years to lodge her complaint.

PW4, Dr.Inoka Ratnayake had examined the victim and submitted the

Medico-Legal Report. In her report injuries were found on the victims hymen

in six oclock and seven oclock positions. The observations in the medical

report had revealed that the victim was subjected to repeated vaginal

intercourse.

After the conclusion of the prosecution case, the Learned High Court Judge

had called for the defence. The Appellant had made a dock statement and

closed the case for the defence.

Although the Appellant advanced three grounds of appeal, he did not proceed

to canvass the third ground of appeal at the hearing. Hence, this Appeal

commences with the consideration of the 1st and 2nd second grounds of

appeal.

In the first ground of appeal the Appellant contended that the Learned High

Court Judge had failed to evaluate that the prosecution failed to prove the

alleged offence was committed during the period stipulated in the

indictment.

According to the victim she was born on 09.10.1998 and the incident

happened according to her recollection, when she was in grade six. This is

only her recollection and not conclusion. Therefore, it cannot argue that the

allege offence cannot be taken place in 2007.

During the trial, this position was never put to the witness by the defence.

Further, the defence had admitted that the victim was under 16 years of age

at the time of committing the offence on her. This had been marked as an

admission under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of

1979.

In this case, the Appellant was represented by a Counsel at the trial. Through

his Counsel the Appellant had admitted that the victim was under 16 years

of age at the time of committing the offence. Therefore, he is estopped from

contesting the age of the victim during the period stipulated in the

indictment. Hence, this ground has no merit.

In the second ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellant contends that

the Appellant was deprived of a fair trial.

CA/HCC/0404/2019

The Counsel for the Appellant citing Section 165(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, contends that time is most important factor for an Accused

to build up his defence and when prosecution stipulates period of 01 year

that amounts to 365 days which is impossible for an Accused to come out

with the proper defence like alibi.

As correctly pointed out by Learned Deputy Solicitor General, three offences

which are of the same kind committed within the span of 12 months can be

included in the same indictment under Section 174(1) of the CPC, the

prosecution had framed three charges under Section 364(3) of the Penal

Code as amended in indictment. This has not caused any prejudice to the

Appellant, as prosecution had complied statutory provision of the CPC.

Therefore, he cannot argue that he was not awarded a fair trial. Hence, this

ground also sans any merit.

In this case the prosecutrix was consistent in her evidence about the

happenings of the incident. She had vividly explained how she was raped by

the Appellant on three occasions. She had given evidence before the High

Court for more than 12 years after the incident.

The learned High Court Judge in the judgment had considered all the

evidence adduced by the prosecution and the defence and had given reasons

as to why he acted on the evidence adduced by the prosecution. He has

accurately analysed all the evidence presented by both parties with correct

perspective and arrived at the correct finding.

In this case the Appellant is the step father of the victim. He is married to

the victims mother and has two daughters aged 15 and 10 years. The

defence had made mitigating submission highlighting the family situation of

the Appellant.

Under Section 364(3) of the Penal Code, the minimum sentence is 15 years

and the maximum sentence is 20 years. The minimum sentence is

CA/HCC/0404/2019

6 | P a g e

mandatory. As such, the sentence should start from 15 years and goes up to

20 years.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge had imposed maximum sentence

of 20 years on each count to be run concurrent to each other. I think

imposing maximum sentence is not warranting in this case. As such, I set

aside the 20 years rigorous imprisonment imposed on each count and

replace with 15 years rigorous imprisonment on each count to be run

concurrent to each other.

Secondly, I set aside the Rs.300,000/-compensation imposed on each count

and replace with Rs.100,000/- compensation on each count subject to 06

months default sentence on each count.

The fine and default sentence imposed on each count will remain same.

I further order the sentence imposed to be operative from the date of

conviction namely 20/11/2019.

The appeal is, therefore, dismissed subject to above variation of the sentence.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Ratnapura along with the original case record.
