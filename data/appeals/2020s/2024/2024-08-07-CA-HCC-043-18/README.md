ARGUED ON : 15.07.2024

DECIDED ON : 07.08.2024

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. Two accused in this case were indicted under Section 22(3) read with

Section 22(1) of the Firearms Ordinance as amended by Act No. 22 of

1996 for illegally possessing an automatic rifle and under Section 27(1)

(b) of the Explosives Act as amended by Act No. 18 of 2005 for illegally

possessing 30 live ammunitions by violating Section 9(2).

After trial, the 1st accused was convicted for both counts and the 2nd

accused was acquitted of both counts by the Judgment dated

28.05.2018 of the learned High Court Judge of Puttalam. Life

imprisonment was imposed against the 1st accused for the first count

and a fine of Rs. 2500/- which carries a default sentence of simple

imprisonment of three months were imposed on the 2nd count. The 1st

accused preferred this appeal against the said Judgment.

Prior to the hearing of the appeal, written submissions were filed on

behalf of both parties. However, apart from mentioning four grounds of

appeal, no facts or arguments relating to those grounds were mentioned

in the written submissions of the appellant. In consequence, in the

written submissions of the respondents also nothing has been

mentioned apart from the two charges, four grounds of appeal

mentioned by the appellant and the sentences imposed by the learned

Judge. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Counsel for the

appellant and the learned Senior State Counsel (SSC) for the

respondents made oral submissions.

The facts of the case, according to the prosecution, may be briefly

summarized as follows:

PW-1, was the Officer in Charge of the Traffic Division of the Police

Station of Anamaduwa at the time of the incident. On the day in

question, around 4.15 p.m., he had gone on petrol duties with Police

Constable Rathnayaka. They had toured about 9 kilometers in the

direction of Puttlam from Anamaduwa and met Police Constable Sumith

(PW-5) and Police Constable Samantha (PW-2) in Kottukatchchiya area.

The four Police Officers had put up road barriers near Kottukatchchiya

temple to search vehicles that commit motor traffic offences. While they

were on duty, a Dolphin model van bearing No. 253-4691 was moving

fast from Puttlam side and O.I.C. Ranbanda (PW-1) has signaled to stop

the van. The van stopped after moving little further passing the police

officers. Then, PW-1 had gone near the van and asked the driver his

driving license. At this instance, the diver had submitted only a photo

copy of the driving license and accordingly PW-1 had summoned the

other three police officers to the place where the van was stopped. The

driver of the van was seen to be in a frightened state. PW-1 has got on

to the driving seat and searched the vehicle. PW-1 had observed that

the carpet under the driving seat was protruded and upon search, he

observed a gun and two magazines below the carpet. According to

PW-1 one of the magazines was loaded with 30 live ammunitions while

Page 4 of 10

the other one was not loaded. Accordingly, the officers arrested the

driver of the van (the 1st accused) and the person who was sitting in the

left side front seat of the van (the 2nd accused) and brought them with

the van to the police station at 7.00 p.m.

Although, four grounds of appeal have been mentioned in the written

submissions tendered on behalf of the appellant, the learned Counsel

for the appellant based his arguments at the hearing on following three

grounds:

i. The learned High Court Judge is erred in law by rejecting the

defence evidence and the principle of presumption of

innocence has been reversed in evaluating the evidence.

ii. The learned High Court Judge has based his decision on

surmises and conjectures and the findings are not supported

by the evidence.

iii. The prosecution has not eliminated the involvement of a third

party.

As explained previously, the 1st accused-appellant was arrested by the

police officers who were engaged on traffic duty. They checked the

vehicle that the appellant and the 2nd accused was travelling and found

the automatic rifle and two magazines, one of which contained live

ammunitions. In a case where the charges are proved on circumstantial

evidence, the possibility of third persons involvement must be clearly

excluded. This is not a case proved on circumstantial evidence. The

learned Counsel for the appellant pointed out certain items of evidence

and contended that the appellant was driving a vehicle owned by

somebody else. The learned Counsel raised the issue of ownership of

the van to show that some other person could have kept this firearm

and the ammunitions without the knowledge of the appellant as this is

not a vehicle owned by the appellant. This argument fails because the

position taken up by the 1st accused-appellant was not that the firearm

and ammunitions were in the vehicle without his knowledge but no

Page 5 of 10

firearm, magazines or ammunitions were found in the van. According

to the statement made by the appellant from the dock, nothing was

found in the van that he was driving. Hence, there is no issue regarding

the possibility of a third persons involvement in this case.

The main contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant was that

the dock statement has not been considered in correct perspective. The

learned Counsel contended that the learned High Court Judge neither

rejected the defence version nor accepted the same. In the last

paragraph of page 8 of his Judgment, the learned High Court Judge

stated that no reasonable doubt is created as a result of the dock

statement. When a dock statement is evaluated, there are three aspects

to be considered.

i. If the dock statement cannot be believed, it must be rejected.

ii. If the court believes the dock statement, it must be acted

upon.

iii. If the dock statement raises a reasonable doubt in the mind of

the court about the prosecution case, the accused is entitled

for an acquittal.

If the learned Trial Judge acted upon either the 1st or the 2nd of the

aforesaid aspects, the learned Judge must state in analyzing the

defence version whether he accepted the defence version or rejected the

defence version. In this case, the learned High Court Judge has acted

upon the aforesaid 3rd aspect and stated that the dock statement does

not raise a reasonable doubt regarding the evidence of the prosecution

witnesses.

The learned High Court Judge has come to the said conclusion not only

for the reason that the prosecution has presented strong evidence that

can be accepted without a reasonable doubt. The learned Judge stated

in his Judgment that the 1st accused-appellant, as the driver of the van

should have observed that there is something under the carpet where

he was seated in the van. The learned Counsel for the appellant stated

Page 6 of 10

that this is a surmise of the learned Trial Judge. That is why he raised

the 2nd ground of appeal that the Judgment is based on surmises and

conjectures.

The learned Counsel for the appellant handed over a picture at the

hearing of this appeal that demonstrate the length of a firearm similar

to the firearm produced in this case. According to the said picture, the

length is about 99 centimeters. When such a big weapon was there

under the carpet below the driving seat, obviously, the appellant who

was seated in the driving seat should have noticed the same. According

to the Cambridge Dictionary, the meaning of surmise is to guess

something, without having much or any proof. It is certainly not a

surmise of the learned High Court Judge. It is an observation made by

the learned Judge based on the evidence of the case. The learned Judge

has stated in making the said observation that if PW-1 observed without

any difficulty that there was something under the carpet in searching

the van, the appellant who was driving this vehicle should have

definitely noticed this. I am also of the view that the learned Judges

said observation is perfectly correct.

At page 143 of the appeal brief, it is recorded that PW-1 had

demonstrated how he searched the van and the learned Trial Judge has

observed that the carpet under the driving seat has protruded when the

firearm that was recovered was there under the carpet. The learned

Judge has also observed when the firearm was under the carpet in that

way, there was no difficulty for the driver to drive the van. These

observations establish the probability of the prosecution case.

The learned Counsel for the appellant contended that when the police

officers signaled to stop the van, in a little distance, they had stopped

the van and if they possessed an illegal article, they could have fled

without stopping the van. The learned Counsel stated that since the

vehicle was empty, the appellant waited until the police officers came

Page 7 of 10

and searched the vehicle. The learned SSC for the respondents

contended that when there was a police team in the main road and if

they asked to stop a vehicle, no prudent person would try to escape. It

should be noted that the learned SSC's position is more rational since

if they tried to flee, the police officers would undoubtedly know that they

had been involved in some illegal activity, and the police officers on

traffic duty could have easily apprehended them. If they stopped the

vehicle obeying the direction given by the police officers, there was a

chance for them to escape, if the police officers had not noticed the

weapon hidden under the carpet.

The learned Counsel for the appellant also contended pointing out the

proviso to Section 22(3) of the Firearms Ordinance that the exclusive

possession of the 1st accused-appellant has not been established. The

learned Counsel contended further that the 2nd accused who was

travelling with the 1st accused sitting in the left front seat was acquitted

from the charges on the ground that he had no knowledge. The

contention of the learned Counsel was that if the 2nd accused had no

knowledge, the same yardstick could be applied to the 1st accused-

appellant as well.

Proviso to the Section 22(3) of the Firearms Ordinance states that

Provided that where the offence consists of having the custody or

possession of, or of using, an automatic gun or repeater shotgun, the

offender shall be punished with imprisonment for life.

Therefore, if the prosecution has proved that the appellant was in the

custody or possession of an automatic gun, the appellant is guilty for

the 1st charge. When considering whether the exclusive possession of

the 1st accused-appellant has been established, it must be noted that

an accused who has been charged for possessing an illegal substance

or article, can take up two positions in presenting his defence. Firstly,

the accused can take up the position that he was physically in

Page 8 of 10

possession of the prohibited substance or article, but was unaware of

the true nature. Secondly, the accused can deny the possession. In the

case at hand, the 1st accused-appellant had taken up the position that

there was no firearm or any weapon in the vehicle that he was driving.

Therefore, the learned High Court Judge had to consider whether the

accuseds version can be believed or the prosecution version that the

firearm and the ammunitions were found under the driving seat can be

believed. Considering the entirety of the evidence of the case, the

learned Judge has correctly found that the prosecution version is true

and believable and no reasonable doubt would be cast on the

prosecution case as a result of the dock statements made by the

accused.

In An Essay on Possession in Common Law [1888 Part III Chapter 1

page 119] by R.S. Wright [Pollock and Wright], it is stated that they

[the jury] must make the decision whether, in addition to physical control,

he has, or ought to have imputed to him the intention to possess or

knowledge that he does possess what is in fact a prohibited

substance. If he has this intention or knowledge, it is not additionally

necessary that he should know the nature of the substance. (Emphasis

added)

In the case at hand, there is no issue regarding the knowledge of the

appellant in respect of the firearm and the ammunitions because they

were under the carpet which was there under the driving seat. As shown

by the learned Counsel for the appellant, the firearm was about 99

centimeters in length and necessarily the appellant had the knowledge

about this weapon, as the person who was driving the van. Only the 1st

accused and the 2nd accused were in the van. Hence, the 1st accused is

guilty for possessing a firearm and ammunitions without a valid license

as his knowledge is well established. Therefore, the learned High Court

Judge is correct in convicting the 1st accused-appellant for the 1st and

2nd counts.

Page 9 of 10

The 2nd accused travelled in the van with the appellant. The appellant

was in the driving seat and the 2nd accused was in the left front seat.

The firearm and the ammunitions were under the carpet below the

driving seat where the 1st accused was seated and drove the vehicle.

Therefore, it has already been decided that the appellant had the

knowledge about the thing that was under the carpet. The 2nd accused

may have noticed that the carpet was protruded than normal or he may

have not noticed. There is a doubt about the knowledge of the 2nd

accused. The benefit of the doubt has to be given to the 2nd accused.

Therefore, the learned High Court Judge is correct in deciding that there

is no evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2nd accused

had the knowledge about the firearm or the ammunitions. Hence,

acquittal of the 2nd accused has no impact in deciding the 1st accused-

appellants case.

The other vital matter to be mentioned is that there was no reason for

these police officers to introduce a firearm and live ammunitions to the

appellant. As contended by the learned SSC, these police officers had

no animosity whatsoever with the appellant. Even in the dock statement

of the appellant, he had not stated about any animosity or any other

reason for these police officers to introduce a firearm and bring criminal

charges against the appellant. So, there was no reason for these police

officers who came for traffic duties to falsely imply criminal liability to

the appellant. Also, it is impossible for the police officers who were

engaged in traffic duties to introduce a weapon and ammunitions to the

appellant.

For the reasons stated above, I hold that the Judgment of the learned

High Court Judge is correct in law and this court has no reason to

interfere with the said Judgment.

Therefore, the Judgment dated 28.05.2018, the convictions and the

sentences imposed by the learned High Court Judge are affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
