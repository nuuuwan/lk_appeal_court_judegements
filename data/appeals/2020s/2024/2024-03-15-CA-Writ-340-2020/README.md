Facts of the Petitioners case

4) The Petitioner has contended that he is employed as a Lecturer (Grade III)

in the Sri Lanka Teacher Educator Service.

5) The 2nd Respondent is the Vice Chancellor of the 1st Respondent

University. The 3rd to 24th Respondents are the other members of the

Governing Council of the 1st Respondent University.

6) The Petitioner had referred to his education qualification in paragraph 8 of

the petition and submitted P1(a) P1(h) documents to support it.

7) The contention of the Petitioner is on 11th November 2018, the 1st

Respondent University called for applications for the post of Senior

Lecturer (Grade I) / (Grade II) and Lecturer (Probationary) in the

C.A. WRIT 340-2020

5

Department of Education and Child Care of the Faculty of Arts and

Culture of the 1st Respondent University.

8) The Petitioner had submitted an application for the post of Senior Lecturer

(Grade II). Later when the Petitioner inquired about his application, he

was informed by reliable sources, the Selection Committee had appointed

a Lecturer Probationary without calling him for an interview. However,

after having a discussion with the 2nd Respondent and submitting the P5

letter to the Vice Chancellor and the 28th Respondent, the Petitioner was

called for an interview on 24th August 2020.

9) After participating at the said interview, as per the facts stated in

paragraphs 14 to 28 with all the necessary qualifications, the University

Selection Committee had overlooked the Petitioner for the post he applied

for.

10) On the said grounds, the Petitioner had sought to invoke the Writ

Jurisdiction for the decision taken by the Respondents for having violated

the recruitment scheme, as his legitimate expectation of being appointed

for the post he applied for was not fulfilled.

Objections of the Respondents

11) The 1st to the 27th Respondents had contended that the Petitioner had filed

a Fundamental Rights application seeking a similar relief in the Supreme

Court in Case No. SCFR/287/2020. On that, multiplicity of litigation and

this application, amounts to an abuse of process.

12) Further the Petitioner is guilty of laches, as the Petitioner was aware of the

methodology adopted in selecting candidates for the post of Senior

Lecturer.

C.A. WRIT 340-2020

6

13) Upon the request of the candidates, the marking scheme was made

available for perusal from 25th May 2019. The said marking scheme had

been approved by the Governing Council of the 1st Respondent University.

14) The Petitioner has not availed alternative remedies before filing the petition

and also had not made an appeal to the Vice Chancellor or the Governing

Council to reconsider the merits pertinent to the eligibility criteria for the

post of Senior Lecturer (Grade II).

15) The academic qualifications of the Petitioner had not met the requirement

for the post of Senior Lecturer (Grade II). Therefore, the 1st Respondent

had not shortlisted the Petitioner for the interview. Further there had

been discrepancies in the dates of the Petitioners PhD and BA degree.

16) The suitability of the candidate had been decided by the Selection

Committee and the power is vested with them to select a suitable

candidate for the post in dispute. The marking scheme which was applied

to select the candidates had been approved by the Governing Council.

17) Therefore, the Respondents have complied with all circulars and

regulations relevant to the selection process. The Petitioner was not

selected as he had failed to earn the required marks referred to in the

marking scheme for the post of Senior Lecturer (Grade II)

18) On the said circumstances the Respondent has moved to dismiss the

application made by the Petitioner.

19) The 28th Respondent had filed a separate objection. However, the said

objections reiterate the same facts referred to by the 1st to the 27th

Respondents.

Disputed facts

20) This matter was taken up for argument on 1st February 2024 and both

parties concluded their oral submissions. The matter was fixed for

C.A. WRIT 340-2020

7

judgement on the said oral submissions, facts pertinent to the petition,

objections and the documents.

21) Considering the facts argued by the Counsels for the Petitioner and the

Respondents, I am of view the following disputed facts need to be

considered to arrive at my conclusion.

I. Has the 1st Respondent University called for application for the post of

Senior Lecturer (Grade I/Grade II)?

II. Has the Petitioner applied for the post of Senior Lecturer (Grade I/Grade

II) and participated in the interview?

III. Have the Respondents failed to select the Petitioner for the post of Senior

Lecturer (Grade I/Grade II)?

IV. If so, does the said decision violate the legitimate expectation of the

Petitioner?

I. Has the 1st Respondent University called for application for the

post of Senior Lecturer (Grade I/Grade II)?

22) There is no dispute that the 1st Respondent had called for applications by

P3 document for the post of Senior Lecturer (Grade I/Grade II). As this

fact is not challenged by P3 document it is assumed that the 1st

Respondent had called for applications for the post of Senior Lecturer

(Grade I/Grade II).

II. Has the Petitioner applied for the post of Senior Lecturer (Grade

I/Grade II) and participated in the interview?

23) The Petitioner had submitted an application for the aforesaid post by P4

document. As he was not called for an interview, he had come to know

that his application was incomplete. After submitting a fresh application

C.A. WRIT 340-2020

8

and communicating with the Vice Chancellor, the Petitioner was informed

by P5 document, and was called for an interview.

24) The Petitioner had participated in the interview before the Selection

Committee.

25) Thus, both parties have admitted that the Petitioner participated in the

interview before the Selection Committee of the 1st Respondent for the Post

of Senior lecturer (Grade I/Grade II).

III. Have the Respondents failed to select the Petitioner for the post

of Senior Lecturer (Grade I/Grade II)?

26) After participating in the interview for the post of Senior Lecturer (Grade

I/Grade II), the Petitioner was not selected for the post he had applied for

at the 1st Respondent University.

27) The main dispute raised by the Petitioner is, with all his qualifications

referred to in P1(a) to P1(h), he was not selected and overlooked by the

Selection Committee is ultra vires.

28) The State Counsel who appeared for the 1st to 27th Respondents had

denied the said position.

29) The phrase ultra vires is defined in the book of Principles of

Administrative Law in Sri lanka1;

Ultra vires and intra vires are two Latin phrases which

respectively mean beyond power and within power.

They are frequently used in discussing the nullity

question.

When an exercise of power is said to be ultra vires,

what it meant is that as the exercise of power is invalid

and a nullity.

30) Justice Arjuna Obeysekera in CA Writ Application No.66 of 2013

decided on 16th May 2020 stated;

CAA must act reasonably and rationally, with due

appreciation of the duties and responsibilities

conferred on it by the CAA Act. Thus, while the decision

reached at each of the stages must not be illegal or

ultra vires, and should be arrived at after adhering to

the applicable procedure, the decisions must not be

unreasonable in a Wednesbury sense.

31) In considering the definition of ultra vires and the facts pertinent to the

aforesaid decision the Respondents have not violated the applicable

procedure and/or they were not unreasonable.

32) Therefore, the Petitioners position that the Respondents acted in an ultra

vires manner, cannot be accepted.

33) However, non-selection of the Petitioner is admitted by both parties.

IV. If so, does the said decision violate the legitimate expectation of

the Petitioner?

34) The position taken by the Petitioner is, not selecting him after all his

qualifications is violating his legitimate expectation for the post that he

had applied for.

35) The legitimate expectation referred to by the Petitioner in the instant

action has to be considered following the decisions and the principles

decided presently.

C.A. WRIT 340-2020

10

36) The case of R (Association of British Civilian Internees: Far East

Region) v Secretary of State for Defense2 laid down a test to identify

when the expectation is legitimate ;

How on a fair reading of the promise it would have

been reasonably understood by those to whom it was

made?

37) In the book of Administrative Law3 it was stated;

Even no promise of a benefit has been made and

there is no established practice of granting that

benefit, the person concerned is, elementarily,

entitles to be treated fairly.

But he is not entitled to rely upon his expectation

of a benefit unless it is founded upon some

promise or established practice. To do this is to

confuse the protection of legitimate expectations

with the duty to act fairly.

38) Further, in the case of Desmond Perera v Karunaratne4 it was stated;

What is meant by legitimate expectation? A simple

definition that can be given is, a right or interest which

is looked forward by a person

39) In the said decisions it is obvious that a legitimate expectation is a right or

interest which a person looks forward to and also a Public Body will act

fairly to him. In the instant action, the Petitioner has faced an interview

and, in the interview, he cannot expect that he would be definitely selected

C.A. WRIT 340-2020

as the Selection Committee of the interview board will select people based

on how they present themselves during the interview.

40) The State Counsel Shamanthi Dunuwille, argued that the methodology for

selecting the post for which the Petitioner had applied for was known to

the Petitioner and the marking scheme was made available for the

candidates, on request.

41) The Petitioner failed to obtain the threshold of the required marks that

should have been obtained to be selected for the post of Senior Lecturer

(Grade I/Grade II).

42) The Selection Committee had acted impartially and given marks for the

Petitioner considering his qualifications. On perusal of R2 document part

1(a) requires a Basic Degree with a 1st Class or 2nd Upper or a 2nd Lower to

obtain the required marks referred to in the marking scheme.

43) As the Petitioner did not have a degree, in the required field, he had only

obtained 5 marks for the particular part 1(a).

44) For Part 1(b), the Petitioner had obtained 25 marks for his PhD. For Parts

2 to 5, the marks were given to the Petitioner by the Selection Board, after

considering how he performed before the interview board.

45) In considering the aforesaid facts, I do not see any ultra vires caused

related to the interview held for the Petitioner by the Selection Committee

of the 1st Respondent University.

46) The average of his marks summary sheet had been submitted by R9. On

perusal of the said average, the Petitioner had failed to obtain the

threshold mark of 60, which is referred to in the marking scheme out of

100.

47) The foremost question that arises is whether the Selection committee has

given these marks in accordance with the circulars issued by the UGC. As

per the facts and documents, the marking scheme had been approved by

the 1st Respondent Governing Council on 25th May 2019.

C.A. WRIT 340-2020

12

48) Thus, the Selection Committee cannot grant any marks outside the

marking scheme which is prevailing presently. To my knowledge the

Selection Committee has given the marks for the Petitioner for his

qualifications which was required for the post of Senior Lecturer (Grade

I/Grade II) and the marks given for parts 2 to 5 which already has been

mentioned is subject to his research publications relevant to the related

field interviewed by the Selection Committee, and as per the University

Grants Commission Circular No. 916 Section 3.2, 3.3 and 1.6.

49) The performance of the Petitioner cannot be considered in a Writ

Application as it should be decided by the Selection Committee as per the

Petitioners participation and how he had faced the interview.

50) On the said circumstances, I do not see any grounds to interfere with the

decision taken by the Selection Committee.

51) Beside these facts, it was brought to the notice of this court that the

Petitioner had instituted a Fundamental Rights case against the

Respondents on similar grounds. Both parties admitted in Court that the

Case had been dismissed.

52) It is reported in Kunanantham v University of Jaffna and Others5, as

follows;

The determination of qualification for different posts is

a matter for the UGC and it is not a matter for the

University.

The Appeal Board does not have the power to

investigate into the non- appointment of staff to the

Higher Education Institution.

5 [2004] 1 SLR 239.

C.A. WRIT 340-2020

13

53) In view of that I do not see any legitimate expectation for the Petitioner to

invoke the Writ Jurisdiction and or not proven that the Respondents have

acted ultra vires.

CONCLUSION

54) For the reasons spelt out above I dismiss the petition dated 17th

September 2020 against the 1st to 28th Respondents.

55) No cost ordered.
