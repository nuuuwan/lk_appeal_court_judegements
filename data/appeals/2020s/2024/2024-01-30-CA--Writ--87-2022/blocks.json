    "text": "during which such alleged unauthorized construction had been built in. Nevertheless, the Condominium Plan marked P15(g)/R8(a) prepared on 02.01.1983 establishes the existence of an impugned southern boundary wall in the Petitioners premises. Therefore, it could be presumed that the said gates have been in existence since 1983. Issuance of Stret Line Certification for the Condominium Plan R8/P15(e) supports the stance of the Petitioner that the impugned boundary wall is an authorized construction. The Respondents issued an undated notice P13 allegedly on 18.01.2022 directing the Petitioners to permanently close the gates after taking cognizance of such construction. If the CMC considered said constructions were unauthorized, they would have taken necessary action at the time the Street Line Certification was issued when the condominium plan was submitted for approval in 1983. It appears that the Respondents have not taken any steps for a considerable period of time upon the alleged illegal construction and no explanation is provided for such a failure. Under such circumstances, this court cannot exclude the fact that the immediate cause for the issuance of letter P13 was the institution of the action CA Writ Application no. 60/2020 against CMC by the Petitioners and the interim reliefs granted therein.",
