The deceased and Sarath had been talking outside and PW-01 had been cooking in the kitchen, when she had heard Sarath shouting Nandasena aiya assaulted. The witness had gone out to see the deceased fallen and the accused running away with a mammoty and Sarath had been standing nearby. The accused is the brother of the deceased, who had lived nearby and they had shared a well in the garden. Thereafter the deceased had been rushed to hospital, where he had succumbed to his injuries on the 23rd of April 2010. In the examination in chief, she had said that she made the first complaint on 16-04-2010, but in cross examination she had admitted that there was a statement made before the 16th, when the police had visited the house (pg 69). Therefore, there had been two statements made by the witness and the statement made on 16-04-2010 is not really the first statement. The prosecution has failed to provide this statement made prior to the 16th, to the defence and they have also failed to question the police witnesses regarding this matter. It is a well-accepted principle that the first information received by the police should always be made available to the defence to formulate their case. This has been dealt very lengthily in the decided case submitted by the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant, which is Wijepala v The Attorney General (2000) 1 Sri L. R. 46 at 51, decided by Justice Mark Fernando states that, The failure to disclose to an accused the existence and contents of the first information. May well result in a miscarriage of justice. Rule 52 of the Supreme Court rules 1988, requires an Attorney at law appearing for the prosecution to bring to the notice of court any matter, which if with held will lead to the miscarriage of justice. That is a professional obligation founded on a constitutional right to a fair trial. I hold that if Senarathna had made a statement at 9.30pm, that statement shouldve been brought to the notice of the court and the defence, and the failure to do so was a violation of article 13(3), by which all courts are bound.",

Furthermore, contradiction marked as V1 has been marked where she had said to the police that there was a dispute between the two brothers over the well (pg 74) however in court, she had not said so. This contradiction and omission, the trial judge has concluded, has not affected the truthfulness of the witness, which this court is surprised to observe because the statements have been made soon after the incident, therefore if she had been truthful it wouldve been the best opportunity for her to have implicated the accused. Therefore, there is a very serious omission with regard to the presence of the accused at the scene, which is only spoken to by the witness in the prosecution. It is shocking to observe that PW-01, being the only witness for the prosecution, speaks of the presence of another person named Sarath at the scene, who had not been called as a witness and neither a statement being recorded from him. If the prosecution was to rely on circumstantial evidence, as they have tried to, the presence of Sarath at the scene is an important and vital link to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was only the accused and none other, who committed the murder of the deceased. Therefore, the evidence of Sarath not being available in the case for the prosecution leaves a very obvious lacuna in the case for the prosecution and also leaves a great doubt regarding the culpability of the accused.",

This is the evidence of the sole lay witness for the prosecution, therefore it clearly shows a very serious doubt with regard to the recovery of this weapon. But the defence has challenged the recovery of the weapon vehemently. The learned trial judge, as alleged by the counsel for the appellant, has wrongfully considered the impact of Section 27 recovery and has gone on to comment on the exclusive possession of the weapon by the accused. It is fundamental that when a fact is discovered subsequent to a statement of an accused, that only the knowledge of the whereabouts of the said fact should be attributed to the accused and nothing else. It has been held so in the case of Etin Singho and another v The Queen 69 NLR 353.",

A judgment of a criminal trial Court which does not reflect that these functions have been carried out by the learned trial judge in a lawful and sufficient manner, cannot be relied upon to satisfy an appellate Court that the accused had received a fair trial, and that he had been found 'guilty' in a lawful manner. However, a determination of whether or not the accused has been deprived of the constitutional right (in terms of Article 13(3) of the Constitution) to a fair trial should be founded upon not only whether or not",
