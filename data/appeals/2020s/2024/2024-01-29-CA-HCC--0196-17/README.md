JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred

to as the Appellants) were indicted along with 4th ,5th ,6th , and 7th Accused

by the Attorney General for committing the offences as mentioned below.

1. On or about the 17th of November 2005, at Bandaragama, by being of

an unlawful assembly with common object of causing injuries to

Mohammed Maharoof Mohammed Izadeen the accused committed an

offence punishable under Section 140 of the Penal Code.

2. In the course of the same transaction, one or several of them caused

the death of said Mohammed Maharoof Mohammed Izadeeen, and said

death was caused in furtherance of the said common object or

knowingly that said death be caused, the Accused, by being members

of the said unlawful assembly, committed an offence punishable under

Section 296 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code.

3. In the course of the same transaction, by causing death of Mohammed

Maharoof Mohammed Izadeen committed an offence punishable under

Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Hambantota as the

Appellants and other accused opted for a non-jury trial. The prosecution had

led 08 witnesses and marked production P1 and closed the case.

CA/HCC/196/2017

At the conclusion of the prosecutions case, an application was made under

Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 on behalf

of 4th ,5th ,6th and 7th Accused.

The Learned High Court Judge having satisfied that evidence presented by

the prosecution warranted a case to answer, called for the defence and

explained the rights of the accused. All Accused had made dock statements

and closed their case after marking 1V2-1V7 and V6-V8.

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had convicted the Appellants on 3rd count only and sentenced

them to death on 12/07/2017. In the meantime, the Learned High Court

Judge had acquitted 4th ,5th ,6th,and 7th accused from all the charges.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the Appellants

had preferred this appeal to this court.

While the Appeal was pending, the 1st Appellant who was detained at the

Welikada Prison had died on 16.09.2021 at the Prison Hospital. Hence, now

this appeal is only considered in respect of 2nd and 3rd Appellants.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellants had given their consent to argue this matter in their absence due

to the Covid 19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellants were connected via

Zoom platform from prison.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

PW1, Mohammed Maharoof, father of the deceased is the only eye witness to

the incident in which his deceased son was allegedly killed by the Appellants.

On the day of the incident, 17.11.2005, the deceased had come to PW1s

house in the night to enquire into an incident which had sparked off with

the deceased 1st Appellant in the evening. After a discussion when the

deceased had left his house at about 9.30 pm, PW1 also accompanied and

they took a forested route to go to deceaseds wifes house. When they were

CA/HCC/196/2017

walking, the Appellants including the 1st Appellant suddenly appeared from

the forest and attacked deceased on his back and the deceased fell down as

a result. About 4 minutes later, four others also appeared and he could

identify them as the 4th,5th,6th, and 7th Accused by the torch light he carried

and along with the moon light. As the 5th Accused shouted hit hit PW1 had

ran from the scene shouting that his son was cut and fainted in the courtyard

and slept thereafter.

PW2, Azmul Shiffa, sister of the deceased stated that her deceased brother

had made a dying declaration implicating all three Appellants. The Learned

High Court Judge after evaluating the evidence of PW2 and the medical

evidence, excluded the evidence pertaining to the dying declaration of the

deceased as accepting said evidence would have prejudicial effect on the

Appellants.

Hence, the Learned High Court Judge had come to the conclusion that the

evidence given by PW1 is convincing and acted upon the said evidence under

Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance to convict the Appellants.

The 2nd Appellant had raised following grounds of appeal.

1. The evidence of sole eye witness fails the test of credibility and

probability.

2. The principle governing on common murderous intention is not

properly applied by the Learned High Court Judge.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the 2nd limb of

Section 293 of the Penal Code.

4. The Dock statement of the 2nd Appellant has been rejected on

unreasonable grounds.

CA/HCC/196/2017

The 3rd Appellant had raised following grounds of appeal.

1. Evidence of sole eye witness does not inspire the confidence of the

Court.

2. The Learned High Court Judge flawed in the evaluation of the evidence

by firstly evaluating the defence and rejecting same and thereafter

proceeding to evaluate the prosecution evidence.

3. The Learned High Court Judge flawed relating to the principles of

burden of proof.

4. Contradictory evidence between police evidence and PW1 creates a

serious doubt with regard to the veracity of the prosecution version as

narrated by PW1.

The Counsels appearing for the Appellants mainly argued that the evidence

of sole eye witness does not inspire the confidence of the Court as it fails the

test of credibility and probability. Hence, it is very important to consider the

evidence given by PW1 who had been the sole eye witness to this case.

The Learned High Court Judge in her judgment had come to the conclusion

that the evidence of PW1 is convincing and proved the charge beyond

reasonable doubt.

Eyewitness testimony is one of the most important kinds of criminal

evidence. In criminal cases, the judges regularly face the difficult but crucial

task of evaluating eyewitness testimony. This sometimes means checking

whether the witnesss story fits with other established facts of the case.

However, the veracity of such a story cannot always be verified or falsified

directly. In such cases judges will have to look at whether the statement

comes from a reliable source.

Further, an eyewitnesss testimony is probably the most persuasive form of

evidence presented in court, but in many cases, its accuracy is dubious.

There is also evidence that mistaken eyewitness evidence can lead to

CA/HCC/196/2017

7

wrongful convictionsending people to prison for years or decades, even to

death row, for crimes they did not commit.

In considering the evidence of an eye witness, the Court should look at the

demeanour of the witness, the inherent probability of the account, any

internal inconsistencies in the account, whether the account is consistent

with previous statements by the witness, whether the witness has any bias

against the accused or any family or group to which the accused belongs,

whether the evidence at the crime scene supports the account, and whether

the witnesss testimony is supported by the testimony of other witnesses.

These factors are very important as the burden of proof is on the prosecution

in all criminal cases.

In The Queen v. K.A. Santin Singho 65 NLR 447 the court held that:

It is fundamental that the burden is on the prosecution. Whether the

evidence the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the burden

is the same. This burden is not altered by the failure of the appellant to

give evidence and explain the circumstances.

PW1 is the father of the deceased. According to him when he was on his way

to deceaseds house with the deceased, 1st Appellant (dead),2nd Appellant and

3rd Appellant had come from the forest and attacked his son from behind

and his son had fallen down. Further, when he was shouting and in ten

minutes of the initial attack, more persons had appeared. He had come home

running shouting son was cut and fainted in the courtyards and slept

thereafter.

At his examination-in-chief, PW1 had stated that 5th Accused shouted hit

hit but at the cross examination stated that it was 3rd Appellant who

shouted hit hit. PW1 had omitted to mention this fact either in his

statement made to police or at the inquest held in the Magistrate Court of

Horana four days after the incident. This omission was brought to the

attention of the Court during the trial.

CA/HCC/196/2017

Although at the non-summary inquiry PW1 had said that Farooks son hit

his son on his head, but he had not mentioned it in his statement to the

police. This also brought to the attention as an omission.

PW1, in his statement to police had stated that his son was attacked by 1st

Appellant and one Nazim with swords and the others hit him when the

deceased fell down. At his cross examination PW1 had stated that he did not

see whether the others hit son. This contradiction was marked as 1V2.

Further, the evidence given by PW1 contradicts with the evidence given by

PW2, Shiffa, the sister of the deceased on material points. Contradictory to

PW1 that he fell in the courtyard, PW2 stated that PW1 had fell inside the

house. This contradiction was marked as 1V4. PW2 went on to say that she

did not know that her father fainted which is also contradictory to the

evidence of PW1.

PW3, Sameen, in his evidence stated that the deceased was resting on the

lap of his aunt till the vehicle arrived to take him to hospital but at the cross-

examination states that the deceased was resting on his sisters lap. This

contradiction was marked as V6.

In the contradiction marked V7, PW3 had stated that he was the only person

in the van when the deceased was taken to hospital. But his evidence he had

said that several people were in the van when the deceased was taken to the

Bandaragama Hospital. Further, he had contradicted his position that 4

people went in the ambulance that took the deceased to the Panadura

Hospital from the Bandaragama Hospital in cross examination by saying that

there were only 3 people including the driver, himself, and another person.

This contradiction was marked as V8.

The facts set out by the prosecution may not be accurate or even they can

be crooked, but in this background the tool of contradiction and omission

are very effective to shake or shatter the credibility of prosecution evidence.

Proof of contradiction and omissions though is very useful in criminal trials,

CA/HCC/196/2017

9

it has to be used with circumspection and within a legal framework. The

credibility of the witness does not stand impeached merely by proving

contradictions on record. It is required for the defence side to show that

prosecution witnesses may deliberately depose change or improve their

original statement in order to cause prejudice to the accused. Similarly,

minor omission or discrepancy in evidence is not enough to hold the accused

not guilty. Thus, by striking out balance and by evaluating evidence in proper

perspective justice can be done. The following cases are very important in

this regard.

1. State Rep. by Inspector of Police v. Saravanan AIR 2009 SC 152

2. Acharaparambath Pradeepan & Anr. v. State of Kerala 2006 13

SCC 643

3. Kehar Singh &amp; Ors v. State (Delhi Admn.) [3] AIR 1988 SC

1883

As the afore mentioned omissions and contradictions are very important

when considering the evidence given by PW1, PW2 and PW3, the Learned

High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration the said

contradictions and omissions when she assessed the evidence of PW1 with

the evidence of PW2 and PW3 as it affect the root of the case. Further, the

Learned High Court Judge erred in coming to the following conclusion.

The Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General who represented the

Honourable Attorney General conceded that fault in the judgment.

Due to afore said reasons, I do not think the evidence given by the PW1 could

be considered as convincing, reliable, and strong to act under Section 134 of

the Evidence Ordinance to convict the Appellants in this case.

As the evidence given by the sole eye witness contains serious doubt and

ambiguity over the prosecution version, this ground itself enough to succeed

the appeal in favour of the Appellants. As such, consideration of other

grounds raised by the Counsels are not necessary.

As the prosecution had failed on its duty to prove this case beyond

reasonable doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the

Learned High Court Judge of Panadura dated 12/07/2017 on the

Appellants. Therefore, they are acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Panadura along with the original case record.
