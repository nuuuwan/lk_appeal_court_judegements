B. Issue a writ of certiorari quashing decision of the 1st Respondent dated

The facts of this case are briefly as follows:

According to the petition, there was a Voluntary Retirement Scheme introduced to the

employees of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) in the year of 2016 by the Circular

dated 31.05.2016 marked as P2. Under the said scheme, the 2nd Respondent who was 59

years old made an application. There was another Circular issued dated 16.08.2016

(marked as P3) for the entitlement of gratuity.

The 2nd Respondent made an application to the Labour Commissioner on the basis that

the Petitioner had not properly calculated the gratuity and the compensation which was

due to him based on the said Circulars.

This matter was later referred to the Arbitrator who made an Award on 09.09.2024 which

is marked as X. According to the Arbitrator (the 1st Respondent), he has calculated the

compensation and gratuity on the basis that, on the retirement, the 2nd Respondent was

drawing a salary of Rs. 57, 726. Thereafter, on that basis, he has calculated and

determined the amounts to be paid by the Petitioner to the 2nd Respondent.

The main ground urged by the Petitioner is that the last drawn salary includes a RAT

allowance which is a special allowance temporarily paid to the employees. According to

the Petitioner, this is an incentive payment by the Chairman of SLTB. Therefore, the

Arbitrator had made a mistake by including the said amount in the last drawn salary

which is against the interpretation of wages and salary as mentioned in the Gratuity Act.

When we peruse the Circulars marked P2 and P3, it is clearly indicated that,

Page 4 of 8

a) The compensation should be calculated based on the last drawn salary

b) Gratuity should be calculated on the last drawn salary

According to the 2nd Respondent, he has voluntarily retired prematurely on the basis that,

he will get the benefits which have been described in the said Circulars. Further, the

Arbitrator has based his decision on these circulars.

For easy reference, relevant excerpts of these Circulars are reproduced below.

In the instant case, the Petitioner challenges the decision of the Arbitrator on the basis

that he has come to a conclusion by wrongly interpreting the last drawn salary.

Edition Volume II- Page 911- 912;

Availability of Certiorari and Prohibition

The circumstances in which certiorari and prohibition will be available have been

summed up by Lord Justice Atkin, an English judge, in the following famous words

which on numerous occasions have been cited and followed by our courts:

" Whenever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions

affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially, act in excess

of their legal authority they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of the King's

Bench Division exercised in these Writs."

This dictum has been analyzed as follows as laying down four conditions which

must be satisfied for certiorari or prohibition to issue:-

" Whenever any body of persons, (firstly) having legal authority, (secondly) to

determine questions affecting the rights of subjects, (thirdly) having the duty to

act judicially, (fourthly) act in excess of their legal authority, they are subject to

the controlling jurisdiction exercised by these writs."

Page 941- 942

Over the years the frontiers of Lord Atkins Formula in Electricity

Commissioners case have been advanced by judicial decisions. It is no longer the

duty to act judicially or quasi-judicially which attracts review [by certiorari] but

the 'duty to act fairly'". "The concept of a duty to act fairly irrespective of whether

the body is acting judicially or quasi-judicially or administratively has been

stressed in recent decisions of the Courts in England.. Over the years the

requirement of "having the duty to act judicially has lost its meaning as a separate

requirement for the availability of certiorari. Unlike the duty to act judicially

which arises when a determination of rights is involved, the duty to act fairly arises

whenever the party against whom a decision, determination or report is to be made

will suffer serious consequences by it. The content of the duty to act judicially is

the same as the content of the duty to act fairly.

In the instant case, the 2nd Respondent has applied for premature retirement on the basis

that, he will get the benefits from the Circulars marked as P2 and P3. There is no

Page 6 of 8

indication by the Petitioner that, the said Rs. 7500/- will not be included in the net salary

when they calculate the compensation and gratuity.

We are mindful that, when the Court deals with labour issues, decisions will be reached

justly and equitably.

When we peruse the decision of the Arbitrator, he has formed his opinion based on the

Circulars and has acted fairly. In this context, it is pertinent to reproduce an excerpt of

the Award given by the Arbitrator marked as X.

When we consider the above excerpt, we are of the view that the Award made by the

Arbitrator is in accordance with the law and he has made his opinion based on the

circulars issued by the Petitioner which bind both parties. Therefore, this Court sees no

reason to quash the decision.

considering the fact that the particular amount should have been paid in 2016.
