MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the judgment dated 06.08.2015

of the High Court of Trincomalee.

The accused-appellant (appellant) had been indicted under sections 354 and

364(2) of the Penal Code. The appellant had pleaded not guilty and the

3

prosecution had placed evidence against him. The appellant also had given

evidence and had called witnesses.

Upon the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial judge had convicted the

appellant for both counts in the indictment and had sentenced accordingly.

The instant appeal has been lodged against the said conviction and sentence.

The grounds of appeal raised by the counsel for the appellant are as follows,

1) The charge being defective,

2) The prosecution has not proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.

The charge being defective.

The counsel for the appellant stated that since the charges in the indictment

have been framed on the basis of a time period, it is against the legal basis set

out under section 165(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure where the details of

a charge has been defined.

The said section has specified that the particulars of the charge should include

the time and place of the offence, but the instant indictment has no specific

time but a time period.

The Counsel for the appellant went on to quote a few judgments, including one

of mine (CA-HCC-0007-2024 decided on 10.9.2024) where it has been held that

in a charge a specific date has to be mentioned.

But as I have very clearly dealt with the said issue in the judgment quoted

above, I do not wish to go in to the same issue.

The prosecution not proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

The story of the prosecution unfolds with the evidence of the victim, who had

been born in 1990 and at the time of the incident she had been between 15

and 16 years of age.

4

She had said at the very outset that the incident took place in 2006 but when

the state counsel suggested to her that it was in 2005, she had agreed and had

based her evidence to that year, during her evidence.

In cross-examination, she had said that she had complained to the police in

July of 2007 and to a suggestion made by the defense, she had said that it has

happened in 2006. Hence, her evidence with regard to the time period during

which the offence took place is subjected to doubt (pages 295 and 297 of the

brief).

According to her evidence, she had met the appellant while going to her extra

classes in school (page 445 of the brief) and she has started a love affair with

him and she alleges that on three occasions she has had sexual intercourse

with him but she had not told anyone (at pages 300-304, 306,309 and 310of

the brief).

The appellant had been working in the Pradeshiya Sabha in Trincomalee

during this time.

The third instance of sexual intercourse had been at her cousins place, who

had given evidence in the trial (pages 326 and 327 of the brief).

After the third time, she had missed her menstrual cycle twice and she had not

been feeling quite right. As such, she had told the appellant and then he had

given her some pills but that had not worked and she had continued to feel

sick (pages 331 and 333 of the brief).

Then he had suggested to her that they may get the fetus aborted to which she

had reluctantly agreed and she got it aborted with her cousins help (pages 77

and 78 of the brief). Her parents had not known but one day the cousin has

had an argument with the victims mother, and the cousin had told the parents

of the victim and then only the parents had got to know of the entire incident. (

page 436 and 447 of the brief ).

5

Thereafter, the parents had confronted the appellant and had tried to get him

to marry her whilst he had not done so.

Therefore, the instant complaint had been lodged on 03.07.2007. The cousin

and the parents of the victim had given evidence and they had corroborated the

victim (pages 337-391, 393 and 394, 422-424, 427, 433, 450 and 457 of the

brief).

The doctor who had examined the victim had done so in July, 2007 and the

victim, in the history given to the doctor, had said that she had a sexual

relationship with a person known to her and that she got an abortion done on

2006.06.26. She had not stated the name of the culprit to the doctor.

Hence, if that is so and on considering evidence with regard to her missing her

menstrual cycle twice and the date of her first complaint, a great doubt arises

with regard to the time period stated in the indictment.

Hence, it has to be concluded that there is a reasonable doubt with regard to

the date of the offence upon considering the case history by the victim to the

doctor, which the learned trial judge had not adverted his mind to at all.

Furthermore, the appellant has given evidence and had said that at the time of

the offence he had been working in the Pradeshiya Sabha in Trincomalee. He

had known the victims cousins husband and that he brought him a proposal

in 2006 and that he liked it at the beginning but later changed his mind

because he got to know that she was having a relationship with a person called

Nihal (pages 519-521 of the brief).

He had completely denied of having any kind of sexual act with the victim and

had said, in fact, that he was working on 26th and 27th of June in 2006 on

which days the victim had alleged that she went to get the abortion done with

the appellant and the cousin (page 523 of the brief).

Hence, when such evidence is given, the trial judge has to analyze whether it

creates a reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution.

6

Already the date of offence in the indictment has not been subject to doubt and

this is further so upon considering the details in the case history given to the

doctor victim. This is further aggravated by the stand taken up by the

appellant.

But the learned trial judge had merely rejected the position of the appellant on

the basis that the witnesses of the prosecution were not cross-examined on

those points. (pages 565-571 of the brief).

Therefore, upon considering the above mentioned matter on law and facts it is

abundantly clear that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond a reasonable

doubt the date on which the offence has taken place, there by violating one of

the fundamental requirements of criminal law.

It is the fundamental duty of the prosecution that they prove their case beyond

a reasonable doubt and the constituents in the charge have to be proved

beyond a reasonable doubt which includes the date of the offence.

In the instant case, the prosecution had not clearly done so and the trial judge

had been very nave to the said short comings in the case for the prosecution

case.

Furthermore, the Counsel for the appellant has raised in his written

submissions that although the charge in the indictment has referred to only

one act of rape and the prosecution leading the evidence pertaining to three

acts of rape whether it violates the provisions of section 54 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

At this point I wish to draw my attention to the explanation 1 of section 54 of

the Evidence Ordinance where it has been said that,

This section does not apply to cases in which the bad character of any

person is itself a fact in issue.

7

This has been discussed in The Law of Evidence in Sri Lanka by G.L. Peiris

at page 286 where the author has drawn some further clarifications which has

been introduced by the Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973, of

the National State Assembly;

(a) Where proceedings are taken against a person for having received stolen

goods knowing them to be stolen or for having in his possession stolen

property, evidence may be given that there was found in his possession

other property stolen within the proceeding period of twelve months, and

such evidence may be taken into consideration for the purpose of proving

that such person knew the property to be stolen which forms the subject

of the proceeding.

(b) Where proceedings are taken against a person for having received goods

knowing them to be stolen or for having in his possession stolen

property, and evidence has been given that the stolen property was found

in his possession, then if such person had within five years immediately

preceding been convicted of any offence involving fraud or dishonesty,

evidence of such previous conviction may be given and may be taken into

consideration for the purpose of proving that the person accused knew

the property which was proved to be in his possession to have been

stolen.

Therefore, in the instant matter, although the charge refers to only one single

act of rape, the evidence of the other two becomes relevant under section 54

explanation 1 of the Evidence Ordinance and also under section 14 explanation

2 of the Evidence Ordinance. At this point I wish to quote,

The Law of Evidence Volume1 E.R.S.R Coomaraswamy, page 687 where it

has been stated that;

It has also been shown that evidence that the accused committed acts

similar to that which form the subject matter of the charge is admissible

not to show that because he has committed one crime, he would

8

therefore be likely to commit another crime of the same nature, but to

prove intention, knowledge, good faith and other similar states of mind of

the accused with regard to the act or to rebut, even by anticipation, the

defence of accident or mistake or other similar defence and to show that

the act charged formed part of a series of occurrences.

As such, the prosecution leading the evidence of three acts of rape becomes

relevant under the above quoted sections of the Evidence Ordinance.

But it has to be stated that the trial judge had admitted the evidence of all

three instances of rape displaying no consideration for the above mentioned

principles in the Law of evidence.

As such, on consideration of the above mentioned facts and the principles of

law, it is the considered view of this Court that the trial judge had seriously

misdirected himself on several questions of law and fact, which makes it only

but fair to set aside the conviction and the sentence of the appellant and allow

the instant appeal.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

9

K. M. G. H. KULATUNGA, J.

1. I have had the advantage and the privilege of reading in draft the

judgement of my sister Justice Menaka Wijesundera. As for her proposed

conclusion, I am in agreement that the Appeal should be allowed as the

prosecution has failed to prove that the alleged act of rape was

committed within the period specified in the charge as well as the overall

unreliability of the evidence of the prosecutrix.

2. However as for the reasoning and the finding on the 1st ground of appeal

that, in a charge a specific date has to be mentioned and the

consequential views expressed on the validity of the charge, I am

respectfully unable to concur. So, I will now venture to consider the first

ground of appeal and state my own reasons. The sum total of the said

ground of appeal is that the charge is defective due to the failure to state

a specific and fixed date of the alleged offence.

3. In Baiya Dewayalage Sugathapala alias Sugathe Seeya v. Attorney

General [CA/HCC/0007/2024] Justice Wijesundera opined that, the

Accused-Appellant was never given a specific date/period of the offence as

per the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that the

Appellant did not have a charge to answer. The said finding is now

reiterated in the draft judgement. Arriving at the said conclusion in that

decision, reference is made to the following decisions:

a. Kumburawela Kankanamge Dayarathne v. Attorney General,

CA/188/2015, in which Justice Thurairaja (as he then was) has

opined that, in a criminal prosecution, the charge should include the

time and place, and the same should be clearly informed to the

Accused;

10

b. in R. H. M. S. Prematunga alias Ananda v. AttorneyGeneral,CA

01/2013, decided on 31/01/2014, Justice Sisira De Abrew

referring to Section 165 of the Criminal Procedure Act opined that

the charge must, inter alia, specify the time and place of the

offence. and held further, that . when a charge specifies that the

Accused committed the offence during a period and the evidence

shows that the offence was not committed during the said period the

Accused cannot be convicted. In such a situation it cannot be

contended that the Accused was not prejudiced because the idea

behind specifying the time and place of offence, as I pointed earlier,

is to give sufficient opportunity to the Accused to answer the charge

and to ensure a fair trial.;

c. then the Indian cases of A.N. Mukergi v. State [A.I.R 1969 All 489

at page 496] and Ram Asrey v. Stateof U.P. [1982 A.L.J. 1138]

which determined that, the charge to state the offence and contain

particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence and the

person against whom it was committed, is important.;

d. Sukhdev v. State M.P. [1995(2) Crimes 336 at 337] where it held

that, Time of the commission of offence is of great significance

counsel for the complainant fairly conceded that there is substantial

defect in the framing of the charge when the timing has been

misquoted.; and

e. in the case of Attorney General v. Viraj Aponso and Others, SC

24/2008, it was held that, It is clear that it is the responsibility of

the prosecution to inform the time, place and the offence clearly to

the person who is charged. It is fundamental for the Accused-

Appellant to formulate his defence If the accused wants to

take up the defence of alibi, he cannot do so because there is no due

date or time given.

11

4. Upon citing and referring to the above decisions, Justice Wijesundera in

Baiya Dewayalage Sugathapala alias Sugathe Seeya v. Attorney

General (supra) concludes thus; Therefore, in the instant matter the

Appellant has been charged for the period of 01-04-2014 to 16-10-2014 as

per 165(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is no specific time or a

date given by the prosecution for the Appellant to formulate his defence

which denies a fair trial. Therefore, considering all the proceedings during

the trial, the oral and written submissions of both parties, I find that the

Accused-Appellant was never given a specific date/period of the offence as

per the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Hence it is the

opinion of this court that the Appellant did not have a charge to answer.

5. Referring and relying on Baiya Dewayalage Sugathapalas case it is now

reiterated in the proposed draft judgement that, in a charge a specific

date has to be mentioned (emphasis added), which I am respectfully not

able to subscribe to and agree with for the following reasons.

6. As opposed to the decisions referred to above, I find that this Court has

in the following decisions held otherwise. They are;

a. Madawala Gedara Premadasa v. AttorneyGeneral,

CA/261/2009, decided on 26.05.2014, where Justice Anil

Gooneratne addressed the issue of vagueness regarding the date of

the incident, holding that the lack of specificity in the incident date

did not prejudice the Accused, as the alleged acts occurred on

multiple dates, indicating a pattern of repetition and continuation

rather than a single incident.

b. Justice Sampath B. Abayakoon in Madduma Ralalage Gunasena

v. Attorney General, CA/HCC/0082/2020, decided on

20.05.2022, held that the lack of specific dates in cases of repeated

abuse over a period does not hinder the prosecution if the time

period specified sufficiently informs the Accused about the time

12

frame of the allegations. The court cited precedents such as R v.

Dossi 13 Cr. App. R. 158 and Wright v. Nicholson 54 Cr. App. R. 38

affirming that precise dates are not mandatory unless they impact

the fairness of the trial.

c. In Keerawella Palliyaguruge Dinesh Indika v. Attorney General,

CA/88/2013, where the Appellant was informed of the time frame

(a months period from September 5, 2003, to October 5, 2003) and

denied entering the victims house during that period, Justice K. K.

Wickramasinghe held that this time range in the indictment was

adequate and did not prejudice the Appellants defense, affirming

that minor uncertainties about exact dates do not necessarily

undermine the fairness of a trial. The court acknowledged that the

victim, a young child, could not provide exact dates for the

repeated incidents of sexual abuse, but it found that this did not

prejudice the Appellant's defense.

d. In Jayawardana v. Attorney General, CA/HCC/0431/2019, the

timeframe of the offence spanned for a months period (between

December 1 and December 31, 2009). Justice Priyantha Fernando

found that, in cases involving sexual offences against children,

where it may be challenging for child victims to recall exact dates,

the given time frame did not harm the Appellants defense, and

rejected this ground of appeal, particularly because the Appellant

did not present an alibi or evidence that a specific date would have

changed his defense.

e. Siripala v. Attorney General, CA/HCC/0156/18, further states

that an indictment's date range (for three offences during a period

of one year from October 11, 2004, to October 10, 2005) is valid if

it does not mislead the Accused or affect the fairness of the trial.

The court found no error in the time frame given in the indictment,

as it was reasonably sufficient for the Appellant to understand the

charges and prepare a defense.

13

7. In the light of these divergent opinions, I will now endeavour to consider

this contentious issue. The charges preferred against the appellant in

this instance are kidnapping from lawful guardianship punishable under

Section 354 of the Penal Code and that of statutory rape punishable

under Section 364(2) (e) of the Penal Code as amended by Act No. 22 of

1995. The date of offence alleged and specified is not a fixed and a

determinate date but a time period namely, between 1st January 2005

and 31st December 2005.

8. The argument advanced on behalf of the Appellant is that, it is

mandatory under Section 165 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

to inter alia state in a charge, the time of the offence in the form of a

precise date. Simply the argument advanced is that a charge in which

the specific and determinate date of offence is not stated is not valid and

there is no charge for the Accused to answer. To consider this argument,

it is necessary comprehend the provisions of Sections 164 and 165 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act which read as follows;

CHAPTER XVI

OF THE CHARGE

Charge to state offence.

164.

(1) Every charge under this Code shall state the offence with which the accused is charged.

(2) If the law which creates the offence gives it any specific name, the offence may be described in the charge by that name only.

(3) If the law which creates the offence does not give it any specific name, so much of the definition of the offence must be stated as will give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged.

(4) The law and section of the law under which the offence said to have been committed is punishable

14

shall be mentioned in the charge.

(5) The fact that the charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every legal condition required by law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case.

(6) The charge shall when it is preferred, whether at the inquiry preliminary to committal for trial or at the trial, be read to the accused in a language which he understands.

Illustrations

(a) (d)

Particulars as to time-place person.

165.

(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence and as to the person (if any) against whom and as to the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged and to show that the offence is not prescribed.

(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or dishonest misappropriation of movable property, it shall be sufficient to specify the gross sum or, as the case may be, the gross quantity in respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and the dates between which the offence is alleged to have been committed without specifying particular items or exact dates, and the charge so framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of section 174:

Provided that the time included between the first and last of such dates shall not exceed one year.

When manner of

ommitting

ffence must be tated.

(3) When the nature of the case is such that the particularmentioned in section 164 and the preceding subsections othis section do not give the accused sufficient notice of thmatter with which he is charged, the charge shall alscontain such particulars of the manner in which the allegeoffence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose

Illustrations

(a)-(f).

15

9. Sections 164 and 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act together

specify the requisite elements of a charge. According to which a charge

basically consists of 2 parts namely, the statement of the offence and

the particulars of the offence. Section 164 requires that the statement

of offence or the law and the provision that is violated to be stated and

Section 165 requires that the particulars of the offence or the

description of the offending act or omission, the time and place, the

person against whom or the thing in respect of which the offence was

committed be stated. These two sections together lay down and

determine what should be stated and contained in a charge.

10. Section 165(1) requires the charge to contain particulars as to the

time and place of the alleged offence. It is significant and relevant that

the specific requirement is the time and not the date. However, in this

context, it appears that in certain legal literature, judicial writings and

amongst practitioners the words time and date have been used

interchangeably and in the alternative. So much so, the requirement of

time under Section 165 is misunderstood and often referred to as the

date of committing an offence. No doubt, in the normal course in most of

the charges a specific date is forthcoming and is so stated. However,

Section 165 as a matter of law does not require a specific and

determinate date but the time of the alleged offence.

11. So, in this context what does the word time mean? It is a matter of

interpretation. It is the literal rule of statutory interpretation that should

be resorted to and applied first. Under the literal rule, the words of the

statute are given their natural or ordinary meaning and applied without

the judge seeking to put a gloss on the words or seek to make sense of

the statute. The first and most elementary rule of construction is that it

16

is to be assumed that the words and phrases of technical statutes are

used in their technical sense if they have acquired one, and otherwise in

the ordinary meaning. Therefore, it is desirable to adhere to the words of

the Act of the Parliament giving to them the sense which is their natural

import in the order in which they are placed. It is the rule of literal

construction. If language is clear and explicit, the court must give effect

to it, for in that case the words of the statute speak the intention of the

Legislature. [vide-Maxwell 12th edition; R v. Inhabitants of

Ramsgate, (1827) 6 B&C as 712.; R v. Harris (1836) 7 C & P 446, R v

Maginnis (1987) AC 303, Fisher v. Bell (1961) 1 QB 394, Whitely v.

Chappel (1868) LR 4 QB 147].

12. As for the ordinary and natural meaning, the Blacks Law

Dictionary (9th Edition) defines the word time to mean, 1. A measure

of duration. 2. A point or period of duration at or during which something is

alleged to have occurred. Thus, the ordinary meaning of the word time

is simply a point or a duration which will certainly include minutes,

hours, days, weeks, or months.

13. The date as we know is a numbered day in a month of a year

being a 24 hour duration, which certainly will come within the meaning

of time. The legislature in formulating Section 165 has used the word

time and deliberately avoided the word date. The ordinary meaning of

time is clear and unambiguous. It is a measure of duration.

14. In my thinking the rationale for the legislator to require the time

of offence rather than the date is that, in certain circumstances, a

precise and specific date may not be ascertainable and available but a

time period may be. Classic examples that come to my mind are cases of

sexual offences perpetrated on very young children during prolonged

periods; in certain criminal conspiracies and offences of a continuing

17

nature; then in certain murders where the deceased is last seen with the

Accused as well as cases of Corpus Delicti (where the dead body is not

found); and then also where the prosecution endeavours to prove its case

wholly or mainly on circumstantial evidence and the investigation

commences late with the discovery of may be a decomposed body. In

such cases it would be futile and presumptuous to expect the charge to

specify and the prosecution to prove a precise and specific date of

offence. All that the prosecution will practically be able to do is to state

the period during which the offence must have been committed and

prove that it was committed on a day during that period. In the above

circumstances, the investigators and prosecutors practically will not

have evidence to establish a precise or a fixed date but a time period. In

such circumstances, specifying a time period becomes necessary.

15. It has often been argued that, specifying a time period is

specifically provided only for the offences of Criminal Breach of Trust and

dishonest misappropriation by Section 165(2) and not for other offences.

The said section provides that,

16(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or

dishonest misappropriation of movable property, it shall be sufficient to

specify the gross sum or, as the case may be, the gross quantity in respect

of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and the dates

between which the offence is alleged to have been committed without

specifying particular items or exact dates, and the charge so framed shall

be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of section

174:

Provided that the time included between the first and last of such dates

shall not exceed one year.

18

16. The argument is that, it is only for such offences under Section

165 (2) that the prosecution is not required to specify a precise date of

offence; and that it is only in respect of the offences of criminal breach of

trust or dishonest misappropriation to which the said sub-section

applies that a time period may be stated. It is thus argued that in all

other cases to which Section 165 (1) applies, the precise time (date) of the

alleged offence must be specifically stated in the charge.

17. Section 165(2) provides for lumping up of the gross quantity in

respect of several acts of criminal breach of trust or misappropriation

committed during a period of one year. The legal effect of which is to

consolidate the total amount misappropriated by several separate acts

into one charge and form an aggregate offence but for which each of such

acts of misappropriation or criminal breach of trust would be a separate

offence. Section 165(2) enables to lump up and consolidate and then it is

deemed to be a charge of one offence within the meaning of Section 174.

By this deeming provision, a single offence is created by a fiction of law,

but for which each act would be a separate offence. Therefore, Section

165(2) enables the lumping up of criminal proceeds of several separate

offences and by a legal fiction creates a legally valid single offence.

Section 165(2) provides for a unique means to consolidate several

offences in to a single charge of which the date of committing each such

offence is known. In my thinking, this contention is not well founded. It

is true that sub-section (2) specifically deals with two kinds of offences

and makes a provision in respect of them, but that is not to say that in

every other case, the time must be so specifically mentioned as to

indicate precisely the date and the time at which the offence was

committed.

18. Then it is also argued that specifying a time period may prejudice

the accused by denying the ability to take up the defence of alibi and the

19

accused will thus be denied a fair trial when a specific date is not so

stated. It is quite possible that in some cases stating a period may

deprive the accused person of the opportunity to setup an alibi. At first

blush this may seem to cause prejudice, but when the statute provides

and permits the framing of a charge in that form, prejudice so caused is

not invidious prejudice.

19. That being so, what strikes my mind is that in almost all the cases

the inability to ascertain and the non-availability of evidence as to the

precise date of the offending is caused by or is a direct consequence of

the criminal conduct which is attributable to the offender him/herself. To

put it differently, the cause of the non-availability of evidence as to the

precise date is the result of the criminal act of the perpetrator

him/herself. For instance; when an offender abuses children of tender

age, and by direct threats and other coercive means such children are

prevented from divulging and complaining promptly, such delay

naturally causes a loss of memory as to the specific date; similarly in

planned crimes committed in secrecy it is almost impossible to detect

immediately and collect evidence as to the precise date of committing

such crimes. Can a person accused of such a crime be heard to complain

of prejudice from circumstances created by the perpetrator him/herself

and then has any person a right to benefit or gain an advantage from

circumstances created by a criminal act? I think not, and it cannot be so.

Thus, of prejudice in such circumstances an accused cannot and has no

moral or legal right to complain. If not, this will enable and encourage

perpetrators of serious crime to destroy and obliterate evidence as to the

specific date of committing the crime and escape criminal liability and

get off scot-free of an offending of which otherwise there would be

sufficient evidence. If it is proved that an accused committed the alleged

criminal act (actus reus) with the requisite intent (mens rea) on a day

during the period specified in the charge, does the exact date matter? I

20

think not, unless the exact date is otherwise relevant or is a constituent

element of the offence.

20. Considering a similar issue the Canadian Supreme Court in the

decision of R. v. Douglas [1991 CanLII 81 (SCC), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 29

(S.C.C.)], held that the failure to state with exact precision the time when

an offence occurred is not fatal unless time is an essential part of the

offence charged and the accused is misled or prejudiced by any variation

in time that arises. It is generally the case that a charge may be proven if

the evidence discloses the commission of the offence within the time period

specified in the particular count of the indictment. The accused must be

apprised of the offence charged with reasonable and precise information

so as to ensure the ability to make full answer and defence.

21. No doubt the right to a fair trial requires that every person charged

with a criminal offence must be informed in a language which he or she

understands of the charges against him, with details being given as to

the facts and the law on which the charge is based. This information

must allow the accused person to effectively prepare his or her defence.

In the criminal justice context, the right to a fair trial, more often than

not exclusively, focuses on ensuring fairness to the accused. However,

courts in other jurisdictions have acknowledged that considering the

right to a fair trial court should also be mindful of the interests of the,

victims/witnesses and the community/public as well. This approach is

consistent with the conceptualisation of the right to a fair trial in

European and United Kingdom human rights jurisprudence as a

triangulation of interests.[ vide-Lord Steyn in Attorney Generals

Reference (No 3 of 1999) of Australia (2001) 2 AC 91, 118: 14

December 2000)].

22. It is now accepted that there must be fairness to all sides. In a

criminal case this requires the court to consider a triangulation of

interests. It involves taking into account the interests of the victim and

his or her family, and the public in considering and deciding the right to

a fair trial from the perspective of an accused. You must be mindful of

the interest of the society and ensure that the criminal justice system is

not made ineffective or that would make the prevention of a serious

social problem almost impossible.

23. Thus, to my mind the absence of a specific date of offence per se

does not cause a denial of a fair trial if it is in accordance with the

procedure established by law. I do not think it would be right to hold

that a charge is invalid solely for the reason that it does not specify a

particular date of the offence. However, where it is possible to specify

precisely the necessary particulars of the date of offence, the prosecution

ought to mention the said particulars in the charge, but where the said

particulars cannot be precisely specified in the charge having regard to

the nature of the information available to the prosecution, the failure to

mention such particulars will not invalidate the charge on that score

alone.

24. As to the issue of fair trial, prejudice or difficulty to prepare a

defence are all matters of fact to be presented to the trier of facts when

the evidence is tendered and to be determined at the end of the trial.

Accordingly, I hold that the provisions of Section 165 of the Criminal

Procedure Act provide and enable a period of duration to be stated in

the particulars of offence.

25. Subject to the aforesaid, I agree that the Appeal should be allowed

as the prosecution has failed to prove that the act of rape as alleged was

committed within the period specified in the charge and also the overall

22

unreliability of the evidence of the prosecutrix. I would allow the appeal

and make the order which my sister Justice Menaka Wijesundera

proposes.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
