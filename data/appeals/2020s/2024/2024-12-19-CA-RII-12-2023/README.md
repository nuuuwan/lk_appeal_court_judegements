The Petitioner states that the Petitioner and the late Upali Dassanayake entered matrimony on

the 2nd of January 1976. The Petitioner claims that through marriage they gave birth to a son

and a daughter on the 12th of November 1977 and the 28th of April 1981 respectively. The

Petitioner further claims that the late Upali Dassanayake engaged in numerous extramarital

affairs, including with the Respondent. Therefore, the Petitioner left the matrimonial house in

1995, yet had contact with the late husband for the sake of the children. However, the late

Upali Dassanayake passed away on the 5th of January 2021 due to decompensated cirrhosis.

Upon the death of the late Upali Dassanayake, the Petitioner has taken steps to exercise her

Page 4 of 5

legal right to claim his pension payment as the Member of Parliament from 1987-1993.upon

claiming the payment of Pension, the Petitioner was informed that the payment had already

been claimed by the Respondent who claimed to be the legal wife of the late Upali

Dassanayake. Subsequently, the Petitioner has become aware that the late Upali Dassanayake

had filed a divorce action against the Petitioner and had obtained a decree of vincula

matrimonii on the 24th of April 2014. The Petitioner states that she was unaware of the

divorce proceedings of the case bearing No. D/1555/2012 in the District Court of Nugegoda.

Further, the Petitioner mentions that the plaint of the above case, the late Upali Dassanayake

has deliberately misdirected the court to issue summons and decree nisi to an address where

the Petitioner had not resided.

It is apparent that Mr. Upali Mervin Senerath Dassanayake, has initiated a divorce claim

under the matrimonial Fault of Constructive malicious desertion against the Petitioner on 13th

of July 2012 in the District Court of Nugegoda. Accordingly, the respective summons was

issued to the Petitioner on the subsequent dates at the Address mentioned on the plaint. Given

that the Petitioner was not present in the court and not represented, the case was heard ex

parte, and a decree nisi was entered on the 4th of April 2013. After multiple failed attempts to

serve the decree nisi to the Petitioner by the Fiscal, on 04th October 2013, the learned District

Court Judge of Nugegoda ordered the decree nisi to be served through the Grama Niladari of

that division. However, the attorney-at-law for the late Upali Dassanayake has amended the

caption of the plaint with a new address for the Petitioner as No. 192/15 Horana Road,

Kottawa, Pannipitiya where the Petitioner has never resided. According to the report of the

Homagama Fiscal, the decree nisi was issued and served upon the Petitioner at the address of

No. 192/15, Horana Road, Kottawa, Pannipitiya on 19th of November 2013. Since there

were no objections made by the Petitioner the decree nisi was made absolute by the learned

District Court Judge on 24th of February 2014.

However, it is contested by the Petitioner that she was not aware of the Divorce claim filed

by her late Husband and she did not receive the summons or the Decree nisi issued upon.

Therefore, the Petitioner claims that the late Upali Dassanayake has fraudulently misdirected

the District Court by providing fraudulent affirmations and the summons thereon have been

served to an address where the Petitioner has not resided on the relevant dates.

In the case of Paulis V. Joseph and Others (2005) 3 Sri L R 162, it was held that,

Where one of the parties to the divorce action was dead, and if it is shown by

the surviving spouse that divorce was obtained fraudulently without service of

summons and by abuse and misuse of legal process the Court of Appeal has the power

to grant restitutio - in- intergrum as well as act in revision and set aside the divorce.

According to the submitted materials and submissions made by both parties, we are of the

view that the Petitioner has not received the summons and the decree nisi of the case bearing

No. D/1555/2012. Further, the Petitioner has not been aware of the decree absolute made on

24th February 2014.

Therefore, the Petitioner has pointed out exceptional circumstances to revise the order of the

learned District Court Judge of Nugegoda entered in Case No. D/1555/2012 dissolving the

marriage of the Petitioner to the late Upali Dassanayake. Hence, this Court declares the order

dated 24th of February 2014 of District Court of Nugegoda case No. D/1555/2012, null and

void.

Considering all the materials presented to this court, it is clear that the late Upali

Dassanayake has misdirected the court by providing false address of the Petitioner.

Therefore, it is my view that the decree of vincula matrimonii against the Petitioner has been

obtained fraudulently in case No. D/1555/2012.

Hence, we set aside the decree for divorce entered in case No. D/1555/2012 by the District

Court of Nugegoda. Further, as for Prayer "e," we restore the marital status of the Petitioner

as the widow of the late Upali Dassanayake and it shall remain unchanged by the proceedings

held in Case No. D/1555/2012 of the District Court of Nugegoda. No Cost ordered.
