WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The first and the second accused-appellants were indicted in the High

Court of Chilaw for committing the murder of one

Mihindukulasuriyalage Chaminda Saman Kumara on or about 15th

November 2011 in Dunkannawa, Naththandiya, an offence punishable

under Section 296 of the Penal Code. After trial, the learned High Court

Judge convicted both accused-appellants for the offence of murder and

imposed the death sentence on them. This appeal is preferred by the

accused-appellants against the said convictions and sentences.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions were filed on behalf of all

parties. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Counsel for the first

accused-appellant, the learned Counsel for the second accused-

appellant and the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the

respondent made oral submissions.

In brief, the prosecution case is as follows:

At the time of the incident, the deceased Chaminda Saman Kumara

resided in Dunkannawa village situated in Naththandiya. On the day of

the incident, PW-4, a resident of the same area and a three-wheeler

driver, was in the three-wheeler park at the time of the incident. He

stated in his testimony that he saw the 1st accused-appellant beating

the deceased while deceased was fallen down on the left side pavement

of the Naththandiya - Kuliyapitiya road. Accordingly, PW-4 has

witnessed the 1st accused beating the deceased using his hand (Page 67

of the appeal brief). Thereafter, PW-4 stated that he went behind and

held the appellant when he attempted to strike the deceased using an

iron rod (Page 69 of the appeal).

PW-3, was a businessman who was inside his shop at the time of the

incident. He has seen an unusual road traffic and come to the road to

enquire about it. Upon hearing about a quarrel, PW-3 rushed to the

place of the incident where large number of people were gathered. At

this moment, PW-3 has seen the 1st accused-appellant shouted saying

something like (Page 86 of the appeal brief)

while holding a pole and the 2nd accused-appellant trying to take the 1st

accused-appellant away from the incident, asking him to go.

PW-10, one Priyangika who was inside her husbands retail business

store which was situated in the other side of the road where the incident

occurred has also given evidence and stated that she has seen the

deceased and the two accused-appellants fighting near the petrol shed.

The two accused- appellants have been arrested by the police on 16th

November 2011 whilst they were hiding in a forest near a cemetery

situated in Maningala, Dunkannawa. Upon a statement made by the

1st accused-appellant to the police, an iron rod has been recovered by

the police on the same day in an adjoining land to the petrol shed of

Page 4 of 9

Dunkannawa which was situated close to the place of incident. The said

item of evidence has been produced in terms of Section 27 of the

Evidence Ordinance.

Prosecution has also led the evidence of a dying declaration made by

the deceased to PW-2, one Ravindra Lakmal who took the deceased to

the hospital in a three-wheeler.

After the prosecution case was closed and the defence was called, the

accused-appellants made dock statements. The 1st accused has taken

up the position that he and the 2nd accused- appellant went to the shed

to fuel up their vehicle and saw people gathered near the place. They

have seen a person who was beaten up and seemed dead. He stated

that when they went to look at the scene, people at the place tied them

with ropes. Thereafter, another group of people came and untied them

and let them go.

The 2nd accused-appellant has also stated in his dock statement that

both he and the 1st accused-appellant went to the shed to fuel up and

they saw people gathered near the place. However, according to the 2nd

accused-appellant, the 1st accused appellant has gone to beat a man

who seemed dead and fallen on the road. Then, he told the 1st accused

appellant to go away asking whether he is insane. At that moment, the

2nd accused-appellant also stated that several persons have beaten

them and tied them and thereafter, another set of persons have come

and untied them, allowing them to go.

At the hearing, the learned Counsel appearing for the 1st appellant and

the learned Counsel appearing for the 2nd appellant contended that the

learned Trial Judge has wrongly applied Section 159 (1) of the Evidence

Ordinance in admitting the dying declaration. The learned Senior DSG

conceded the fact that the application made under Section 159 (1) of

the Evidence Ordinance to lead the evidence regarding the dying

declaration is wrong.

When PW-2 was asked whether the deceased said something about the

person who assaulted him when the deceased was being taken to the

hospital, PW-2 stated that the deceased did not say anything. Then, the

learned State Counsel who prosecuted the High Court trial made an

application to allow PW-2 to refresh his memory by going through his

statement made to the police. The learned Defence Counsel objected to

the application but the learned Trial Judge allowed the application

(page 52 of the appeal brief).

Section 159 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows:

A witness may, while under examination, refresh his memory by

referring to any writing made by himself at the time of the

transaction concerning which he is questioned or so soon afterwards

that the court considers it likely that the transaction was at that time

fresh in his memory. (Emphasis added)

In terms of Section 159 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance, a witness can

refresh his or her memory by referring to any writing made by himself

or herself at the time of the relevant transaction. A police officer who

made notes regarding a raid carried out by them can refer to his own

notes and refresh his memory in giving evidence under Section 159 (1).

In addition, in terms of Section 159 (2) of the Evidence Ordinance, a

police officer can also refer to any such writing made by some other

police officer and refresh his memory in giving evidence, if he had read

the other persons notes within the relevant time and knew that the said

notes are correct. Not only a police officer but also any other witness

who had made his own notes can refer and refresh his memory in giving

evidence in accordance with Section 159 (1) and (2) of the Evidence

Ordinance. However, in the case at hand, the learned Trial Judge

erroneously allowed PW-2 to go through the statement made by him to

the police in order to refresh his memory and give evidence. The learned

Trial Judge could not realize that the statement given to the police is

not a writing made by PW-2. The statement that PW-2 was allowed to

Page 6 of 9

refer and refresh his memory is a statement recorded by a police officer

and not a writing made by PW-2. Therefore, allowing to go through the

statement made by PW-2 to the police is completely a wrong order which

is not permitted by law.

If PW-2 was not allowed to go through his statement made to the police,

PW-2s evidence was that the deceased did not say anything about the

person assaulted him. Therefore, the evidence of PW-2 regarding the

dying declaration cannot be accepted in determining this case. The

learned Senior DSG correctly conceded to the said fact.

The learned Senior DSG conceded to another fact that the 2nd accused-

appellant had no common intention with the 1st accused-appellant in

committing the murder. The contention of the learned Counsel for the

2nd appellant was that not only the 2nd appellant did not have common

intention to commit the murder but also he attempted to take the 1st

appellant away from the crime scene.

According to the testimony of PW-3, the 2nd appellant held the 1st

appellant and tried to take him away from the place of the incident

(pages 86 and 92 of the appeal brief). Hence, it is apparent that the 2nd

appellant had no participatory presence in the crime and the aforesaid

items of the evidence clearly demonstrate that the 2nd appellant had no

common intention with the 1st appellant to commit the murder.

Therefore, I hold that the learned High Court Judges decision to convict

the 2nd accused-appellant for the murder is bad in law. The 2nd accused-

appellant should be acquitted of the charge of murder.

Now, the only issue remained to be determined is whether the charge

of murder has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt against the 1st

accused-appellant. The learned Counsel for the 1st appellant contended

that PW-3, PW-4 and PW-10 had not properly identified the 1st accused-

appellant at the time of the incident and they identified him only by way

of a dock identification. He contended further that several people

Page 7 of 9

rushed to the place of the incident and there is a doubt regarding the

identification.

In addition, the learned Counsel for the 1st appellant contended that

there is no evidence against the 1st appellant apart from the evidence of

PW-10 and PW-3s evidence that the 1st appellant shouted holding an

iron rod. The learned Senior DSG pointed out that apart from the

evidence of the PW-3 and PW-10, PW-4 has clearly described at pages

66 and 67 of the appeal brief, as to how the 1st appellant assaulted the

deceased. In addition, the learned Senior DSG contended that the iron

rod that was used to assault and kill the deceased was recovered by the

police on the statement made by the 1st appellant. He contended further

that the subsequent conduct of the 1st appellant, hiding in a cemetery

after the incident, is also an important item of evidence that establishes

the guilt of the 1st accused-appellant.

PW-3, in his statement stated that no one came to the place of the

incident because of the fear but people came after he went there. Even

in such a situation, PW-10 has made a statement to the police the very

next day after the incident. According to the evidence of PW-10, she had

seen three people grappling. One she identified as the deceased. Other

two persons she identified as the 1st and 2nd appellants although she

did not know the names. At the time PW-10 saw the appellants, they

were not among the several other people who rushed to the place. When

the appellants were identified, only the appellants and the deceased

were at the place of the incident. Therefore, any other persons

involvement other than the appellants can be clearly excluded. Hence,

there was no room for misidentification and I regret that I am unable to

agree with the argument that the 1st accused-appellant could not be

identified properly as there were several people.

Apart from the evidence of PW-10 and PW-3, PW-4 has clearly stated as

pointed out by the learned Senior DSG that he saw the 1st accused-

Page 8 of 9

appellant striking the deceased. He stated that he saw the 1st appellant

assaulting the deceased by using his fist. But later, when he saw that

the 1st appellant tried to assault the deceased by using an iron rod,

PW-4 has held the 1st appellant. He identified the iron rod which was

marked as P-1 as the iron rod that the 1st appellant was holding and

which was recovered by the police on the statement made by the 1st

appellant. Corroborating the said items of evidence, PW-3 has also

stated in his testimony that he saw the 1st appellant shouted holding a

rod (page 85 of the appeal brief).

So, PW-4 has seen the 1st appellant assaulting the deceased. The

prosecution has established that the death of the deceased occurred as

a result of the said assault. When PW-4 was cross-examined, he stated

that he did not know how the deceased fell on the ground. However, it

is vital to note that no question was asked by the defence in cross-

examination and challenged the evidence given by PW-4 regarding the

way that the 1st appellant assaulted the deceased.

It was held in the case of Himachal Pradesh V. Thakur Dass (1983)

2 Cri. L.J. 1694 at 1701 V.D. Misra CJ held that, whenever a statement

of fact made by a witness is not challenged in cross-examination, it has

to be concluded that the fact in question is not disputed. Also, it was

held in Motilal V. State of Madhya Pradesh (1990) Criminal Law

Journal NOC 125 MP that Absence of cross-examination of

prosecution witness of certain facts, leads to inference of admission of

that fact.

In the circumstances, a dying declaration is not necessary to prove the

murder charge against the 1st accused-appellant because, mainly on

the evidence of PW-4 and on the evidence of other witnesses for the

prosecution, it is clearly established that the 1st accused-appellant

committed this murder with the murderous intention.

When considering whether the dock statement of the 1st accused-

appellant creates a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case, it is

apparent that the position taken up from the dock has never been put

to the prosecution witnesses. It was held in the Indian Judgment of

Sarvan Singh V. State of Punjab (2002 AIR SC (iii) 3652) pages 3655

and 3656 which was cited in the case of Ratnayake Mudiyanselage

Premachandra V. The Hon. Attorney General C.A. Case No.

79/2011, decided on 04.04.2017 that It is a rule of essential justice

that whenever the opponent has declined to avail himself of the

opportunity to put his case in cross-examination, it must follow that

the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted. Therefore,

the learned High Court Judge is correct in rejecting the dock statement

of the 1st appellant and deciding that the prosecution has proved the

charge against the 1st accused-appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.

Accordingly, the conviction and the sentence of the 1st accused-

appellant are affirmed.

The conviction and the sentence of the 2nd accused-appellant are set

aside. The 2nd accused-appellant is acquitted of the charge of murder.

The appeal of the 1st accused-appellant is dismissed.

The appeal of the 2nd accused-appellant is allowed.
