The tip received was that there was an individual who possessed heroin at the Modara bus halt. PW-01, at 3.35pm on the 21st of June, 2010, along with five other officers, including PW-02, dressed as civilians, had gone to the bus halt to apprehend the suspect. Upon information received by PW-02, they were able to identify the suspect and apprehend him, and on inspection had discovered 8 packets in a grocery bag, containing a substance they believed to be heroin, concealed in his right-side pocket of his trouser. The body search of the accused was also carried out by PW-01. Thereinafter, they arrested the suspect and had visited a jewellery shop by the name of Jeya Pushpa to weigh the substance alleged to be heroin. The arresting officers had done so accordingly, in the presence of the accused. Once the substance had been weighed, they had produced and recorded the evidence at the Galle Fort Police station. They then produced the accused at the Galle police station at 6.20pm. PW-02 also corroborated the evidence given by PW-01. At the conclusion of the evidence and cross examination endured by the official witnesses, the accused-appellant had absconded, and the trial had proceeded in his absence. Thereafter, the Government analyst had also given evidence.",

The defence had also failed to provide reasons as to why the accused-appellant was arrested for committing the offences of trafficking and possession of Heroin, if it is indeed a mistaken arrest.
