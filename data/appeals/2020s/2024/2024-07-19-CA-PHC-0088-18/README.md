Introduction

1) The Appellant has made this appeal against the order made by the

Learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala on 8th May 2018

dismissing the revision application made against the Magistrates

order dated 26th May 2016.

2) The dispute had arisen in the instant action under Section 66 of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979.

3) In the instant appeal the 1st party Petitioner Appellants had sought

the following reliefs prayed for in the prayer of the petition dated

22nd May 2018;

a) To accept this appeal;

b) To grant reliefs prayed for in the Revision application of the

Appellants;

PHC 088-18

c) Grant Costs and;

d) Grant such other and further reliefs.

Facts of this case

4) The Appellant had contended that proceedings were held between

the Appellant and the Respondents under Section 66 of Primary

Courts Procedure Act No 44 of 1979 before the Magistrate Court of

Polgahawela, after facts were reported by the officer in charge of

Alawwa.

5) The said matter had been instituted due to a dispute between the

Appellant and the Respondent over the possession of the subject

matter pertinent to the Magistrate Court Case No. 18776/66.

6) In the said matter, possession had been granted to the 2nd party,

1st and 2nd Respondents, in the Magistrate Court proceedings.

Aggrieved by the said order, the Appellant had preferred a revision

application in the Provincial High Court of Kurunegala and the

Learned High Court Judge in the said revision matter had

dismissed the application made by the Petitioner.

7) On the said grounds the Petitioner has made this appeal against

the said order.

8) Considering the facts pertinent to this case and the written

submissions, the following disputed facts need to be considered to

arrive at my conclusion.

(i) Has the High Court Judge erred when delivering the order

dated 8th May 2018 dismissing the Appellants revision

application?

(ii) Can the Appellant maintain this action as per the prayers

sought in the instant appeal?

PHC 088-18

I) Has the High Court Judge erred when delivering the order

dated 8th May 2018 dismissing the Appellants revision

application?

9) In the instant action, this appeal is preferred by the 1st party

Petitioners. Therefore, hereinafter the said 1st party Petitioners will

be referred to as Petitioners, the 2nd party Respondents as

Respondents, and the intervenient Respondent-Respondent as

intervenient Respondent.

10) The Petitioners have made this application by a petition dated 22nd

May 2018 against the order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Kurunegala dated 8th May 2018.

11) The High Court order had been made on a revision application

made by the Petitioners against the order of the Magistrate of

Polgahawela. In the said order, the Magistrate had discussed the

rights of the possession of the subject according to Section 66 and

68 of Primary Courts Procedure Act and granted possession to the

Respondents.

12) Aggrieved by the said order, the Appellants in the instant action

had preferred a revision application to the Provincial High Court of

Kurunegala to revise the said order.

13) To revise the Magistrates order under a revision application, the

Petitioners have to satisfy court that there are exceptional grounds,

illegality and procedural impropriety.

14) On perusal of the High Court Judges order, the Learned High

Court Judge had carefully considered the Magistrates order and

decided that there are no exceptional circumstances, illegality

and/or impropriety to revise the order given by the Magistrate.

15) When considering the High Court Judges order and the

Magistrates order the Learned Magistrate had written a well-

PHC 088-18

7

considered order considering the party who had possession for two

months prior to the dispute that had arisen between the parties.

16) Therefore, I do not see any merit in the instant application to

consider the appeal preferred against the order made by the

Learned High Court Judge.

II) Can the Appellant maintain this action as per the prayers

sought in the instant appeal?

17) It is interesting to note the prayers of the petition dated 22nd May

2018. In the said prayers the Petitioner had specifically requested

to grant all the reliefs in the revision application filed by the

Petitioner. However, the Petitioner has failed to inform the court

about the existence of the revision application filed against the

Respondents by the Petitioners and its current stage.

18) Furthermore, as per the Learned Magistrates order, since there is

a dispute between the parties for the title, the parties should

resolve their rights at the appropriate forum.

19) In the said circumstances, the Petitioners have not sought any

reliefs in the instant application for this court to grant.

20) In relation to that, I draw my attention to two judgements. In the

case of Surangi V Rodrigo1. As per Gamini Amarathunga, J;

The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted

that issues are not restricted to pleadings and

cited several cases in support. There is no

question about the correctness of this legal

position. What is material to consider is whether

the mere framing of an issue without amending 1 [2003] 3 SLR 35

PHC 088-18

8

the prayer would help the petitioner. Section 40(e)

of the Civil Procedure Code enacts that the plaint

shall contain a demand of the relief which the

plaintiff claims. This is the prayer. No court is

entitled or has jurisdiction to grant reliefs to a

party which are not prayed for in the prayer to

the plaint.

21) And in the case of Inaya and another V Fathima2 Andrew

Somawansa, J (P/CA) held;

It appears that in the absence of a prayer

seeking leave to appeal from a specific order

made by the original Court and without praying

to set aside that order one cannot seek a

declaration and for directions to be given to the

trial Judge as the Petitioner is seeking to do in the

instant application

22) Thus, as per the aforesaid judgments, if reliefs are not claimed in

the petition, an application cannot be maintained.

23) Further, considering the orders of the Learned Magistrate and High

Court Judge, I do not see any merit to set aside or to revise the

said orders.

CONCLUSION

24) In view of the aforesaid facts, I dismiss the petition dated 22nd May

2018 subject to payment of cost of Rs. 25 000/-
