Introduction

The 1st Petitioner is the Principal of Noorul Hudha Preliminary Arabic School,

while the 2nd Petitioner serves as the President and the 3rd Petitioner is the

Secretary of the Board of Trustees of the Jummah Grand Mosque, Pasarichenai

(Arugambay South), Pottuvil-19.

The 1st Respondent is the Commissioner General of Excise, and the 2nd to 5th

Respondents are his subordinate officers. The 6th Respondent is the Director

General of the Fiscal Policy Department of the Treasury, and the 7th

Respondent is the Divisional Secretary of Pottuvil. The 8th Respondent is

Arugambay Surfers Villa (Private) Limited.

The 1st to 3rd Petitioners, in their respective capacities, challenge the legality of

the liquor license issued to the 8th Respondent. The Petitioners allege that the

liquor license originally issued to Dr. Somasundaram Kethiswaran Pillai for

operating the New Kethees Beach Hotel was irregularly renewed under the

name of Arugambay Surfers Villa (Private) Limited, in violation of the distance

restrictions.

In their amended Petition dated 9th February 2021, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd

Petitioners, inter alia, sought writs of certiorari to quash letter No.

16/308/42/03993 dated 18th June 2020 (P171) and letter No. 16/308/42/03993

1 dated 18th June 2020 (P182). Additionally, the Petitioners sought a writ of

certiorari to nullify any licenses issued in terms of P17 and P183, as well as

a writ of certiorari to quash any subsequent renewals made under P17 and

P18. It is important to note that the Petitioners did not seek writs of

1 Prayer (c) of the Petition. 2 Prayer (e) of the Petition 3 Prayer (d) and (f) of the Petition.

5 CA/WRT/0346/2020

mandamus to prevent the issuance or renewal of licenses under P17 and

P18.

The Respondents resisted issuance of notices in this matter and accordingly, the

1st to 7th Respondents filed their limited objections. Due to a mix-up in marking

the documents within the limited objections, the issue was rectified in a copy

submitted on 23rd February 2023, along with a new set of documents which

will be taken into account in this judgment. After considering the limited

objections filed by the Respondents and the submissions made by the learned

Counsel for both the Petitioners and the Respondents, this Court directed the

Registrar to issue formal notices to the 1st to 8th Respondents on 22nd March

2023.

Following the issuance of notices, the learned State Counsel for the 1st to 7th

Respondents informed the Court that they would rely on the limited objections

previously filed and would not be filing any additional objections.

The 8th Respondent filed objections on 5th September 2023 under the heading

of limited objections and sought to have the Petition dismissed.

In response, the Petitioners filed a counter affidavit.

Analysis

In 2015, Dr. Kethiswaran Pillai applied for FL07 and FL08 liquor licenses for

the hotel named New Kethees Beach Hotel, located at Main Street, Arugambay

South, Pottuvil 05. According to Extraordinary Gazette No. 1544/17 dated 10th

April 2008 (1R59), FL07 licenses are granted to hotels approved by the

Tourist Board, while FL08 licenses are issued for a bar within a hotel situated

in a Municipal Council area4. The Assistant Commissioner of Excise for the

Eastern Province recommended the application on 16th October 20155.

Subsequently, the reports from the Divisional Secretary and the Police of

Pottuvil were called.

4 Page 3A. 5 1R1 and 1R1 (A).

6 CA/WRT/0346/2020

The Petitioners submitted two letters addressed to the Divisional Secretary of

Pottuvil, one from the President of the Sinna Ullai Jummah Mosque (P9a)

and the other from the Secretary of Masjithul Mafaza (P10a), which raised

concerns regarding the distance of the licensed premises from schools,

religious schools, mosques, and buddhist temples. However, since neither letter

includes a date indicating when they were sent, this Court is not inclined to

accept them as objections raised regarding the matter in issue during the

relevant period. Additionally, the Petitioners presented three letters sent to the

Divisional Secretary of Pottuvil: one from the Secretary of Noorul Hudha

Arabic College on 19th October 20156, one from the Secretary of the

Pasarichchanai Community Centre on 19th October 20157, and one from the

General Public of the area on 10th October 20158, all raising concerns about the

distance to the schools and mosques.

Accordingly, the Divisional Secretary, in his report dated 4th December 2015,

informed that there was public protest to the granting of the license9.

Although this issue was not explicitly raised, a related question might be

whether the prohibited institutions existed before the liquor licenses were

issued or if they were established afterward. According to the Petitioners,

Noorul Hudha Arabic College is depicted within Lot 3 of the plan marked

P26, which was made in 2003. This establishes that the Arabic College was

there even before the liquor licenses FL07 and FL08 were first issued to Dr.

Kethiswaran Pillai.

Based on the Divisional Secretarys report, on 10th February 2016, the

Commissioner General of Excise directed the Superintendent of Excise in

Batticaloa to conduct an inquiry into the public protests10.

6 P12a. 7 P13a. 8 P14a. 9 1R5. 10 1R6.

7 CA/WRT/0346/2020

Notably, no report from the Government Superintendent of Surveys, which is

required under such circumstances according to Clause 13(h) of Gazette

1R59, was requested.

However, after his previous letter dated 4th December 2015 (1R5), the

Divisional Secretary of Pottuvil recommended the issuance of the license in a

letter dated 14th January 201611. The Sri Lanka Tourist Board also

recommended granting the license in letters dated 26th January 2016, as the 8th

Respondent had subsequently complied with the specifications set by the

Tourist Board12.

Eventually, the Commissioner of Excise received a letter, copy sent to the Sri

Lanka Tourist Board13, from the Board of Trustees of the Mohideen Jummah

Grand Mosque of Pottuvil, stating that they had no objections to the granting of

the license.

Upon receiving the Divisional Secretarys recommendation, the Commissioner

of Excise requested further clarification on whether the public protest had

subsided or was still ongoing. The Divisional Secretary responded that the

protest had subsided14.

At this time, the Superintendent of Excise in Batticaloa also submitted his

report, prepared in response to the direction issued by the Commissioner of

Excise, stating that the liquor license could be issued15.

Consequently, two liquor licenses dated 9th March 2016 were issued to Dr.

Kethiswaran Pillai: FL/7 for the hotel (approved by the Tourist Board) and

FL/8 for the bar license within a municipal council limit, allowing operation at

New Kethees Beach Hotel, Main Street, Arugambay South, Pottuvil 05. These

licenses were valid from 9th March 2016 to 31st December 201616.

11 1R8. 12 1R9. 13 1R7 and 1R7 (A). 14 1R10 and 1R10 (A). 15 1R11. 16 1R12 and 1R12 (A).

8 CA/WRT/0346/2020

The documents and reports required to be submitted with a new application are

outlined in Clause 13 of Gazette 1R59. Among these requirements is a survey

plan from a licensed surveyor indicating the distance to nearest places of public

religious worship and to schools. If complaints regarding violations of the

prescribed distances are received, a survey plan from the Government

Superintendent of Surveys, as it applies to this instance, will be required17.

However, the objections filed by the 1st to 7th Respondents make no mention of

whether this requirement has been fulfilled. Furthermore, the 1st to 7th

Respondents did not provide any documentary evidence indicating that a

survey plan was requested or submitted prior to the issuance of the license in

2016. This indicates that even the initial license issued in 2016 was granted in

violation of Gazette 1R59.

Following the issuance of the liquor licenses, the Eastern Provincial Council

submitted its objections via letters dated 27th April 2016 and 11th May 2016,

stating that the licenses had been issued in contravention of the Excise Rules,

as a mosque and two schools are located within a 500-meter radius18. In

response, the Excise Department informed that the issuance of the liquor

licenses was recommended by the relevant authorities after an inquiry and,

therefore, was granted in accordance with the law19. Nevertheless, it remains a

fact that the Excise Department did not request a survey report in accordance

with Gazette 1R59.

By a letter dated 25th April 201620, the license holder, Dr. Kethiswaran Pillai,

requested the Commissioner General of Excise to transfer the liquor license to

Mr. Vethavanam Vasantham, as he had sold the hotel to him. However, he later

withdrew this request in a letter dated 21st June 201621.

The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority also requested the transfer of

the license to Arugambay Surfers Villa (Pvt) Ltd, the 8th Respondent, in a

17 Clause 13(g). 18 1R13 and 1R14. 19 1R15. 20 1R17. 21 1R18.

9 CA/WRT/0346/2020

letter dated 29th November 201622, citing a change in ownership. Subsequently,

Mr. V. Vasantham applied to transfer the licenses to the name of Arugambay

Surfers Villa in a letter dated 2nd October 201623. Along with this letter, an

affidavit sworn on 3rd October 2016 by the previous owner, Dr. Kethiswaran

Pillai, consenting to the issuance of the license in the name of Arugambay

Surfers Villa was also provided.

However, on 14th December 2016, Dr. Kethiswaran Pillai himself applied to

renew the license for the year 201724. In the meantime, the Coordinating

Committee of the Pottuvil Divisional Secretariat decided at their meeting to

oppose the issuance of the licenses, and this decision was communicated to the

Commissioner General of Excise by the Divisional Secretary of Pottuvil in a

letter dated 20th December 201625. Nevertheless, the liquor licenses for the

period from 1st January 2017 to 31st March 2017 was issued in the name of Dr.

Kethiswaran Pillai26 without requesting a report from the Government

Superintendent of Surveys to determine whether the distance rules had been

violated.

One might argue that since this was a renewal of the license by an existing

license holder, only the documents specified in Clauses 13(b), (c), (d), and (j)

are required, and the survey plan under Clause (g) is not necessary, particularly

given that complaints had been received after the issuance of the license valid

until 31st March 2017. However, under Clause 13(h) of Gazette '1R59,' there is

a provision to request a Government Superintendent of Surveys Plan if

complaints regarding violations of the prescribed distances are received. If the

distance rules have been violated, the license could be revoked. However, it is

important to note that there had been prior complaints27, yet no survey plan was

requested before the renewal of the license.

10 CA/WRT/0346/2020

Upon receiving further complaints regarding non-compliance with the

regulations concerning the prescribed distances to schools and religious places,

the Commissioner General of Excise directed the license holder to submit a

plan prepared by the Government Superintendent of Surveys, illustrating the

linear distance from the hotel to the schools and religious places28.

Subsequently, the license holder appealed to the Minister of Tourism to grant

the license without the Government Superintendent of Surveys plan29.

Afterwards, the new owner applied30 to extend the liquor license issued to the

8th Respondent, Arugambay Surfers Villa, until the end of 2017. However, the

extension was not granted, as the current license holder had placed objections

on record31. Subsequently, the Excise Department requested a report from the

Divisional Secretary32 and the Police of Pottuvil33 to assess whether the new

applicant was a suitable candidate for a license, and both authorities34 provided

favorable responses. Following this, Dr. Kethiswaran Pillai once again

requested the Excise Department to issue the license in his name35. In response,

the Excise Department informed him that no license would be issued for the

year 2018 due to the ongoing court proceedings concerning the premises

related to the license36.

According to the 1st to 7th Respondents, following the amicable resolution of

the legal proceedings, the 8th Respondent submitted applications for FL07 and

FL08 licenses37, which were subsequently recommended by the Deputy

Commissioner of Excise (Legal)38. Thereafter, the Commissioner General of

Excise informed the Divisional Secretary of Pottuvil by letter dated 19th

28 1R26. 29 1R27. 30 1R28. 31 1R29. 32 1R30. 33 1R31. 34 1R32 and 1R33. 35 1R34. 36 1R35. 37 1R36 and 1R36 (A). 38 1R37.

December 2019 to issue the licenses in the name of the 8th Respondent for the

premises of Arugambay Surfers Villa Hotel39.

According to the 1st to 7th Respondents, the 8th Respondent was subsequently

granted FL07 and FL08 licenses, valid from 1st January 2019 to 31st December

201940.

There is no statement in the objections filed by the 1st to 7th Respondents, nor

any evidence presented to indicate that the 8th Respondent submitted the

Government Superintendent of Surveys plan requested by the Commissioner

General of Excise, as stipulated in Clause 13(h), or at least a plan prepared by a

licensed surveyor, as required by Clause 13(g) of Gazette 1R59. It was a new

application that was submitted41 and not merely an application for the transfer

of a license. However, according to the 1st to 7th Respondents, it is argued that

this application should be considered a renewal due to the transfer of ownership

of the business42. Even if it were a transfer, Clause 28 of Gazette 1R59

mandates that all documents required for a new application must be submitted.

Following that, the 8th Respondent applied to renew the license for the year

202043, accompanied by a recommendation from the Sri Lanka Tourism

Development Authority44. Following the receipt of this application, the Deputy

Commissioner of Excise (Revenue) requested a report from the Assistant

Commissioner of Excise (Eastern Province) on 4th March 2020 regarding the

discrepancies in the boundaries stated in the license and the deed of transfer of

the property to the new owner45. In response, the Assistant Commissioner of

Excise (Eastern Province) recommended in a letter sent in June 2020 that the

liquor licenses be issued after obtaining a report from the Superintendent of

Surveys.

12 CA/WRT/0346/2020

The 1st to 7th Respondents state that the 8th Respondent subsequently submitted

a sketch; however, no such sketch has been produced in court. In letter 1R44,

the 8th Respondent acknowledged the discrepancies between the boundaries in

the application and the title deed. Furthermore, the 8th Respondent indicated

that the licensed premises would be relocated within the same land to comply

with the distance criteria46. However, relocating the licensed premises within

the land will not resolve the distance criteria as per Gazette 1R59; it is the

linear distances from boundary to boundary that must be considered47.

Additionally, the recommendation from the Assistant Commissioner of Excise

(Eastern Province)48 to obtain a Government Superintendent of Surveys plan

was not fulfilled by the 8th Respondent. The requirement for a Government

Superintendent of Surveys plan under Clause 13(h) of Gazette 1R59 cannot

be replaced by a sketch. According to the 1st to 7th Respondents, the Divisional

Secretary once again indicated that there was public protest to the issuance of

the license49; however, no inquiry was conducted as required under Clause 21

of the Gazette notification 1R59. Despite this, the Commissioner General of

Excise authorized the Divisional Secretary, Pottuvil, to issue the licenses50.

Consequently, on 18th June 2020, the FL07 and FL08 licenses were issued for

the year 2020, valid until 31st December 2020.

Accordingly, these licenses for the year 2020 were issued in direct violation of

the provisions in Gazette 1R59.

The Petitioners filed this application on 18th September 2020 and subsequently

amended the Petition on 9th February 2021. The 8th Respondent submitted a

request for the renewal of the FL07 and FL08 licenses for the year 2021 on

22nd December 202051.

Villa Hotel and submitted his report dated 8th October 2020 through the Deputy

Commissioner of Excise (Licenses) to the Commissioner General of Excise,

outlining his recommendations52. The Court notes that all his recommendations

pertained to alterations to the buildings and did not address the violations of the

distance regulations specified in Gazette 1R59.

However, on 20th October 202053, the Deputy Commissioner General of Excise

(Revenue) informed the Divisional Secretary of Pottuvil that the Commissioner

General had decided to request a surveyors report from a Government

Surveyor. This report was to detail the proximity of schools, temples, and

kovils to the licensed premises54, along with the boundary-to-boundary linear

distances. It is noteworthy that the 1st to 7th Respondents did not clarify whether

the Government Surveyor's report was received or if it complied with the

requirements outlined in Gazette 1R59. Moreover, no copy of the survey plan

was submitted to the Court. Despite this, the liquor licenses FL07 and FL08 for

the year 2021 were issued on 21st December 202055.

It is evident from the available documentation that the Divisional Secretary of

Pottuvil, in response to the Commissioner General of Excise's decision,

requested the Senior Superintendent of Surveys to submit a plan and report

only on 1st February 202256.

In light of the above facts, it is evident that the liquor license for the year 2021

was issued in violation of the conditions specified in Gazette 1R59, as it was

granted without obtaining the survey plan that the Commissioner General of

Excise had requested.

Subsequently, an application for the FL07 and FL08 liquor licenses for the year

202257 was submitted. The Commissioner General of Excise, in a letter dated

29th December 2021, authorized the Divisional Secretary of Pottuvil to issue

52 1R49. 53 1R50. 54 1R50. 55 1R51 and 1R52. 56 Vide the letter next to 1R50. 57 1R53 and 1R55.

14 CA/WRT/0346/2020

the licenses58. As a result, the licenses were granted without even requesting the

Government Superintendent of Surveys plan, which had been requested by the

Commissioner General of Excise in the previous year, 2021. It is important to

emphasize that, by this time, the Respondents were represented in this case in

court.

The learned State Counsel representing the 1st to 7th Respondents submitted a

plan and a report from the Survey Generals Department along with a motion

dated 11th May 2023. This plan provides the boundary-to-boundary distances in

accordance with Clause 20(c) of the Gazette 1R59. According to the plan, the

distances from the 8th Respondent, Arugambay Surfers Villa, to various

institutions are as follows: 20.08 meters to the Arabic College, 249.73 meters to

the Jummah Mosque, 190.98 meters to the Mafaza Mosque, and 338.7 meters

to the Sinhala Vidyalaya. Therefore, it is evident that all these distances fall

below the required 500-meter radius, with the Arabic College located within

100 meters. As a result, the issuance of both licenses FL07 and FL08

contravenes the distance criteria outlined in the Gazette 1R59.

The 8th Respondent submitted a plan prepared by a private surveyor on 11th

July 2023, marked as X10, along with its objections. Similar to the plan

provided by the Survey Generals Department, the distances in X10 are also

measured from boundary-to-boundary.

In the plan marked X10, the distances to the aforementioned institutions

significantly differ from those in the Survey General Departments plan. Be

that as it may, even according to X10, only the Periya Ullai School is located

beyond the 500-meter radius, while the Periya Ullai Mosque, Periya Ullai

Arabic College, and Sinhaputhra School are situated within the 500-meter

radius.

The 8th Respondent has submitted another plan, dated 11th July 2023, marked as

X11. According to this plan, only the Periya Ullai Arabic College falls within

the 500-meter radius, while the Periya Ullai School, Periya Ullai Mosque, and

58 1R55.

15 CA/WRT/0346/2020

Sinhaputhra School are shown as being beyond the 500-meter radius. However,

even to the naked eye, it is evident that the distances indicated in plan X11

cannot be accurate. This is because some locations that appear farther away are

shown with shorter distances than those that are closer.

Moreover, in plan X11, the distances are measured not from boundary to

boundary, but from the specific location where the 8th Respondent suggests the

liquor restaurant could be relocated. As a result, plan X11 does not comply

with Clause 20(c) of Gazette 1R59, which mandates that distances must be

measured from boundary to boundary from the location of the premises where

licenses are to be operated.

According to Clause 13(h) of the Gazette 1R59, when complaints are made

regarding the violation of distance requirements between licensed premises and

schools or religious institutions, a report from the Government Superintendent

of Surveys must be obtained. Therefore, the legally valid plan is the one

prepared by the Survey General's Department, not the private plan. As

previously mentioned, the Survey Generals plan shows that two mosques and

two schools are located within the 500-meter radius, with one of the schools

falling within the 100-meter radius. It should be 100-meter radius for the sale

of liquor off the premises and 500-meter radius for consumption within the

premises59.

It is important to note that on 3rd May 2023, the 8th Respondent informed the

Survey General that the Survey General's plan was not properly prepared60.

Subsequently, on 1st June 2023, the 8th Respondent requested the Divisional

Secretary to conduct a resurvey, citing discrepancies between the two plans61.

However, the 8th Respondent's request to measure distances from building to

building contradicts the provisions of Clause 20(c) of Gazette 1R59, which

stipulates that distances must be measured from boundary to boundary.

59 Clause 20(c) of the Gazette 1R59. 60 X13. 61 X12.

16 CA/WRT/0346/2020

Thus, it is evident that the liquor licenses granted to the 8th Respondent were

issued in contravention of Clause 20 (c) of the Gazette 1R59.

Preliminary Objections

The 1st to 7th Respondents, along with the 8th Respondent, raised preliminary

objections in relation to this writ application filed by the Petitioners.

Accordingly, this Court identifies the following key preliminary objections.

i. The Petitioners application is misconceived in law.

ii. The Petitioners have suppressed and misrepresented material facts.

iii. The Petitioners have failed to come before Court with clean hands

and lacks uberrima fidei.

iv. The Petitioners are guilty of laches.

v. The reliefs sought by the Petitioners is futile.

vi. No valid grounds urged by the petitioners for the issuance of writs.

As this Court views it, the first argument that the application is misconceived in

law and the last one that there are no valid grounds to issue writs are derived

from the various other grounds outlined in the objections which I have already

analyzed above. Therefore, I will address the other grounds.

The Respondents argue that the Petitioners have suppressed material facts,

specifically failing to disclose that the chief incumbent priest of the

Samudragiri Buddhist Temple, Pottuvil, and the principal of Sinhapura Sinhala

Vidyalaya had withdrawn their objections by letters dated 5th October 202062.

This argument is frivolous because the letter was sent after the date of filing

this application. Be that as it may, the core issue is not whether the individuals

in charge of the relevant institutions object to the issuance of the license, but

rather whether the location of those institutions violates the Regulations

outlined in Gazette 1R59, a matter determined by law, not by individual

objections. Furthermore, may be the Petitioners were unaware of the

withdrawal of objections by the chief incumbent and the school principal.

62 1R50and 1R51 respectively.

17 CA/WRT/0346/2020

Therefore, in my view, the non-disclosure of these facts does not amount to

suppression or misrepresentation of material facts. Consequently, it cannot be

alleged that the Petitioners have not come to Court with clean hands or that

they lack uberrima fides.

The next issue to address is whether the Petitioners are guilty of laches. The

first liquor licenses were issued in 2016 and renewed for 2017. No licenses

were issued for 2018, but from 2019 to 2022, licenses were continuously issued

in the name of the 8th Respondent. As previously mentioned, the Petitioners

filed this application on 18th September 2020. This indicates a delay of four

years since the initial issuance of the licenses in 2016. However, it is important

to note that the licenses continued to be renewed until 2022, even after the

Petitioners filed this application.

Given this context, I am not inclined to conclude that the Petitioners are guilty

of laches. Therefore, I find that there are valid grounds for the Petitioners to

pursue this Writ application.

The next significant question to consider is whether the Petitioners' application

has now become futile. A writ application should not be dismissed solely on the

grounds of futility63. Despite the objections raised by the public, the 1st to 7th

Respondents have arbitrarily proceeded to issue and renew the liquor licenses,

compelling the Petitioners to file this application. Moreover, the 1st to 7th

Respondents did the same without adhering to the conditions outlined in the

Gazette 1R59, while these proceedings were ongoing.

I am of the view that such actions are arbitrary, capricious, erroneous, contrary

to law, and ultra vires. If this Court does not issue an order regarding the

impugned actions of the 1st to 7th Respondents, they would likely continue their

unlawful conduct. Therefore, at the very least, to convey to the 1st to 7th

Respondents, who are public officers, that their actions are ultra vires and to

condemn those actions, this Court should grant the reliefs prayed for in the

Petition.

63 Sudakaran v. Bharathi, (S.C.) [1989]1 Sri L.R. 46; Nimalsiri v. Divisional Secretary, Galewela, (C.A.), [2003]3 Sri L.R. 88.

18 CA/WRT/0346/2020

At this juncture, it is important to note that the Proviso of Clause 20 (c) of the

Gazette 1R59 allows the Commissioner General of Excise to relax the

distance requirements specified in paragraph (c) if he is satisfied that there are

no specific objections from the public regarding the issuance of a license for

the premises.

i. Licenses approved by the Tourism Development Authority.

ii. Licenses which have been in continuous operation for 10 years or more

at the same location.

iii. Licenses remained in force prior to the establishment of such public

religious place of worship or school.

Consequently, this judgment should not hinder the Commissioner General of

Excise from exercising the powers granted to him under the Proviso of Clause

20 (c) of the Gazette 1R59.

Conclusion

In light of the analysis provided, I hereby issue the writ of certiorari prayed in

paragraph (c) of the Petition, quashing the letter No. 16/308/42/03993 dated

18th June 2020 (P17), as well as the writ of certiorari sought in paragraph (e)

of the Petition, quashing the letter No. 16/308/42/03993 1 dated 18th June

2020 (P18). Additionally, I also quash the subsequent renewals done without

complying with the distance criteria set forth in Gazette 1R59.

Each party shall bear their own costs.
