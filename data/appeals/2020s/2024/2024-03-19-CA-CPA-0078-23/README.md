Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application by the accused-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

petitioner) seeking to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction granted to this Court by

Article 138 of The Constitution.

After hearing the learned Counsel who supported this application for notice, and

having satisfied as to the relevant circumstances and the law in that regard, this

Court decided to issue notice on the complainant-respondent, namely, the Hon.

Attorney General. Accordingly, the complainant-respondent was allowed to file

objections in this regard, and the petitioner was also allowed to file counter

objections.

At the hearing of this application, this Court heard the submissions of the

learned Counsel for the petitioner in support of the application and the

submissions of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) on behalf of

the Hon. Attorney General.

This is a matter where the petitioner has been indicted before the High Court of

Colombo in Case Number HC/3937/2022 for knowingly engaging in the offence

of money laundering through the use of her bank account for a sum of Rs.

20,700,200/- between the period of 18-03-2010 and 24-11-2010, and thereby

committing an offence punishable in terms of Section 3(1) of the Prevention of

Page 3 of 12

Money Laundering Act No. 5 of 2006 as amended by Amendment Act No.40 of

2011.

After the indictment was served on the petitioner, the learned Counsel who

represented the petitioner before the High Court has raised a preliminary

objection as to the maintainability of the action against the petitioner, urging the

Court to reject the indictment and discharge the petitioner from the proceedings.

The essence of the objection had been that the charge was based on the

amendment brought to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act by Amendment

Act No. 40 of 2011, where any other person than an accused had also been

brought under the purview of section 3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering

Act No. 5 of 2006.

It had been the position of the learned Counsel that the relevant amendment has

not provided for any retrospective effect, and since the charges relating to a

period before the Amendment Act came into effect, the charges against the

petitioner cannot be maintained. It had been contended further that the

petitioner has been charged for an offence that was not in existence during the

time relevant for the charge.

After hearing the oral submissions in this connection, the learned High Court

Judge has allowed the learned Counsel for the petitioner as well as the

prosecuting State Counsel to file written submissions, and has pronounced his

order on 24-05-2023 overruling the objection taken and fixing the matter for the

pre-trial conference.

It is against this order the petitioner has sought to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of this Court.

It is trite law that the remedy of revision, which is an extraordinary discretionary

remedy can only be granted under exceptional circumstances.

Page 4 of 12

In the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Mercantile Hotels managements

Limited (1987) 1 SLR 5, it was held:

It is settled law that the exercise of revisionary powers of the appellate

Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist

warranting its intervention.

It was held in the case of Mariam BeeBee Vs. Seyed Mohamed 68 NLR 36 it

was determined that;

The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite independent

and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Its object is the due

administration of justice and the correction of errors, sometimes committed

by this Court itself, in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice.

In the case of Bank of Ceylon Vs. Kaleel, and others (2004) 1 SLR 284 it was

observed:

In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it; the order complained of is of such a nature which would

have shocked the conscience of Court.

In the case Sarath Wimalaweera Vs. The Attorney General (2015) 1 SLR 379

it was stated that;

The Court will exercise its revisionary powers if there are exceptional

circumstances such as something illegal about the order made or when the

application discloses circumstances which shock the conscience of the

Court. Revisionary jurisdiction is to remedy a miscarriage of justice. It means

that the Court will exercise revisionary powers if there are exceptional

circumstances, such as illegality in the order made.

Page 5 of 12

With the above legal requirements that should be established in order to exercise

the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court in mind, I will now proceed to consider

the impugned order by the learned High Court Judge to consider whether this

Court has a basis to intervene into the said order.

Making her submissions before the Court, the learned Counsel for the petitioner

contended that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the

amendment to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, under which the charge

against the petitioner has been formulated, has no retrospective effect as per the

amendment.

Submitting that she is not questioning the validity of the Amendment Act as well

as the main Act and she is agreeing with the sentiments expressed by the learned

High Court Judge in his order in that regard, it was her position that since there

was no mention either directly or impliedly that the amendment has

retrospective effect, the learned High Court Judge should have considered the

preliminary objection in that context, rather than the way the learned High Court

Judge has chosen to interpret the same.

She was of the view that the two judgments cited by the learned High Court

Judge, namely Mrs. Dorothy Silva Vs. Inspector Of Police, City Vise Squad

Pettah 78 NLR 553 and Maharaja Organization Limited Vs. Viacom

International Inc. and Another SC Appeal No: SC/CHC/Appeal/4/2002

decided on 20-06-2021 has no application to the matter at hand, and

contended that the other case cited by the learned High Court Judge, namely

Leechman and Company Ltd Vs. Rangalla Consolidated Limited (1981) 2

SLR 373 was in fact in favor of the petitioners preliminary objection, although

the learned High Court Judge has considered it against the preliminary objection

taken.

Submitting that by the amendment under which the charge has been preferred

against the petitioner, it was the substantive law that has been amended and if

there was no specific provision as to the retrospective effect, the said amendment

Page 6 of 12

should take effect from the date of the amendment. It was the position of the

learned Counsel that the indictment against the petitioner has been wrongly

presented and has no validity before the law.

It was the complaint of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the learned

High Court Judge has, in fact, correctly determined that it was the substantive

law that has been amended and not the procedural law, but has failed to

appreciate the relevant legal provisions in that regard in its correct perspective.

The learned Counsel moved for the reliefs as sought in the prayer of the petition.

It was the view of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSD) that by

amending the Prevention of Money Laundering Act No. 5 of 2006 by the

Amendment Act No. 40 of 2011, the section 3(1) and (3) of the original Act has

been amended among other amendments made to the Act. It was his position

that in amending section 3(3) by excluding the word accused, the legislature

by its wisdom has thought it fit to include any person who engages in the offence

described in section 3(1) to be brought under the purview of the said sub-section.

It was his view that the purpose of section 3(3) was for the avoidance of doubts,

and no miscarriage of justice or prejudice has been caused to the petitioner and

therefore, the learned High Court Judge has correctly overruled the preliminary

objection. He was of the view that the amendment has not changed the

substantive law in relation to the relevant section and this is a matter that cannot

be decided at this stage of the case, and it is matter that has to be decided after

hearing evidence.

There is no dispute that the petitioner has been indicted before the High Court

in terms of the Amendment Act No. 40 of 2011 made to the Prevention of Money

Laundering Act No. 5 of 2006, on the basis that the petitioner falls under the

provisions of section 3(3) of the Act, as amended.

The relevant Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Act No. 40 of 2011

has been certified by the Speaker of Parliament on 06-10-2011, and had come

Page 7 of 12

into effect from that day onwards. There is also no dispute that the indictment

relates to an alleged offence committed between the period of 18-03-2010 and

24-11-2010, which is a period before the relevant amendment to the Act came

into effect.

I am unable to find any specific or implied provision in the amendment Act to

the effect that the amendment should have retrospective effect.

Therefore, it becomes necessary to consider the rules of interpretation in order

to come to a finding whether the preliminary objection raised by the learned

Counsel for the petitioner before the learned High Court Judge of Colombo was

legally correct, or whether the order where the said preliminary objection was

overruled can be justified.

N.S. Bindra on Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edition at 238 discusses the

presumption against retrospectivity in the following manner;

As a general rule every statute is deemed to be prospective, unless by

express provision or necessary implication it is to have a retrospective effect.

Whether a statute is to have retrospective effect depends upon its

interpretation regard to well settled rules of construction. Retrospection is

not be presumed; but many statutes have been regarded as retrospective

without declaring so. Remedial statutes are always regarded as prospective

but declaratory statutes are retrospective in nature. The statute would

operate when the intent that it should so operate clearly appears from a

consideration of the act as a whole, or from the terms thereof, which

unqualifiedly give the statute a retrospective operation or imperatively

require such a construction, or negate the idea that it is to apply only to

future cases. If the Court is in doubt whether the statute was intended to

operate it should resolve the doubt against such operation.

Page 8 of 12

The Supreme Court of India in the case of Punjab Tin Supply Co. Vs. Central

Government AIR 1984 SC 87 observed as follows;

All laws which effect substantive rights generally operate prospectively

and there is a presumption against their retrospectivity if they affect vested

rights and obligations unless the legislative intent is clear and compulsive.

Such retrospective effect may be given where there are express words giving

retrospective effect or where the language used necessarily implies that

such retrospective effect is intended. Hence, the question whether a

statutory provision has retrospective effect or not depend primarily on the

language in which it is couched. If the language is clear and unambiguous

effect will have to be given to the provision in question in accordance with

its tenor. If the language is not clear, then the Court has to decide whether

in the light of the surrounding circumstances retrospective effect should be

given to it not.

Black, on Construction and Interpretation on Law, 2nd Edition page 385

sums up the rule in the following words;

Except in the case of remedial statutes and those which relate to procedure

in the Courts, it is a general rule that acts of legislature will not be so

construed as to make them operate retrospectively, unless the legislature

has explicitly declared its intention that they should so operate, or unless

such intention appears by necessary implication from the nature and the

words of the Act so clearly as to leave no room for a reasonable doubt on

the subject.

In the Prevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Act No. 40 of 2011, there

is no reference that the relevant amendment shall have retrospective effect.

Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether by implication it becomes so when

considering the words used in the amendment Act. I do not find any basis to

consider that such an implication is reflected in the words used in the Act to

suggest that the amended provisions should have retrospective effect.

Page 9 of 12

Therefore, it becomes necessary to consider whether the amendment had been

to the substantive law in that regard or to the procedural law. If it was in relation

to the substantive law as I have considered before, the amendment will not have

retrospective effect since the construction of the relevant amendments does not

by implication suggest that it has retrospective effect.

It is settled law that if an amendment was to the procedural law, such law will

have retrospective effect unless that procedural statute results in creation of new

disabilities or obligations or to impose new duties in respect of transactions

already accomplished.

Commenting on the retrospective effect of a statute made in relation to matters

of procedure, Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edition states as

follows;

Perhaps no rule of construction is more firmly established than thus

that a retrospective operation is not to be given to a statute so as

to impair an existing right or obligation, otherwise than as regards

matters of procedures, unless that effect cannot be avoided without

doing violence to the language of the enactment.

The Indian Supreme Court in the case of Hitendra Vishnu Thakur Vs. State of

Maharashtra 1994 AIR 2623 held;

1. A statute which affects substantive rights is presumed to be prospective

in operation unless made retrospective, either expressly or by necessary

intendment. Whereas, a statute which merely affects procedure unless such

a construction is textually impossible is presumed to be retrospective in its

application, should not be given an extended meaning and should be strictly

confined to its clearly defined limits.

2. Law relating to forum and limitation is procedural in nature, whereas law

relating to right of action and right of appeal even though remedial is

substantive in nature.

Page 10 of 12

3. Every litigant has a vested right in substantive law but no such right

exists in procedural law.

Needless to say, by enacting the Amendment Act No. 40 of 2011, a new group of

persons had been added to the provisions of section 3 that existed until then,

and thereby making them, which includes the petitioner of this matter, subjected

to be indicted before the High Court, which in my view is an amendment to the

substantive law in that regard.

I find that as pointed out correctly by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that

the two judgments cited by the learned High Court Judge in the order have no

relevance to the preliminary objection raised before the High Court.

In the case of Mrs. Dorothy Silva Vs. Inspector of Police, City Vise Squad

Pettah (supra), the matter considered was the construction given to the word

brothel in the Brothels Ordinance and not whether it has retrospective effect

or not. The matter considered in the case of Maharaja Organization Limited

Vs. Viacom International Inc. (supra) was in relation to the question whether

an appeal or leave to appeal that lie against an order of the District Court or the

Commercial High Court. The quotation cited from the said judgment by the

learned High Court Judge was in relation to that question, and not in relation to

a question whether a statute has retrospective effect or not.

I find that even the learned High Court Judge has come to a finding in his order

that the amendment in relation to the section under which the petitioner was

indicted has been to the substantive law in that regard.

For matters of clarity, I would like to reproduce the relevant portion of the order,

that appears on page 9, which reads thus;

,

.

Page 11 of 12

.

Having stated as above, the learned High Court Judge has determined that the

amendment to the Act has been made retrospectively without any legally tenable

basis to reach such a finding.

As pointed out correctly by the learned Counsel for the petitioner, the judgment

cited by the learned High Court Judge, namely Leechman and Company Ltd

Vs. Rangalla Consolidated Limited (supra) was not a matter that supports the

views expressed by the learned High Court Judge to dismiss the preliminary

objection but in fact, a judgment that supports the contention of the petitioner.

It was held that when the substantive law is altered during the pendency of an

action, the rights of the parties are decided according to the law as it existed

when the action was begun, unless the new statute shows a clear intention to

vary such rights.

I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge was completely misdirected

as to the relevant law when it was held that any amendment to the substantive

law should be operative retrospectively unless the legislature has ordered

otherwise. I find that this is completely against the rules of interpretation that

needs to be considered in interpreting a statute which has no express or implied

provisions as to the retrospective effect of it.

For the reasons considered as above, I am of the view that the petitioner has

been indicted before the High Court of Colombo in terms of the Amendment Act

No. 40 of 2011 made to the Prevention of Money Laundering Act No. 5 of 2006

without it having retrospective effect for an offence alleged to have been

committed before the Amendment Act came into effect.

I find that this is an order which had been reached without a valid basis and it

has occasioned a miscarriage of justice due to fundamental rules of

interpretation being disregarded. I am of the view that the order complained of

Page 12 of 12

is of such a nature which shocks the conscience of the Court. Therefore, I hold

that the petitioner has established sufficient exceptional circumstances which

necessitate the intervention of this Court by exercising the extraordinary

discretionary remedy of revision granted to this Court by the Constitution.

Hence, I set aside the order dated 24-05-2023 by the learned High Court Judge

of Colombo, as it cannot be allowed to stand.

I hold that the preliminary objection raised by the learned Counsel before the

High Court had been correctly raised and the indictment cannot be maintained

against the petitioner.

Accordingly, I allow the preliminary objection and dismiss the action filed against

the petitioner and discharge her from the proceedings against her before the High

Court of Colombo.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo for necessary compliance.
