The said Baby Nona had made the Petitioner the successor of said land on 26.09.2005. However, as per the Land Ledger marked P6, the said nomination of the Petitioner had been cancelled upon the request of the permit holder on 06.03.2006. The Petitioner states that the above cancellation had been affected without the knowledge of the Petitioner and the original permit holder Baby Nona. Upon an application made by the original permit holder, the Petitioner had been renominated as the successor of the subject land on 02.04.2008. Amidst such circumstances, the original permit holder Baby Nona passed away on 28.02.2009. Thereafter, the Petitioner had made an application to the 2nd Respondent to succeed as the permit holder. At such instance, the Petitioner had come to know that both the Petitioner and the 7th Respondent had been nominated as co-successors of the subject land, with specific portions, that is portion of one acre to the Petitioner and a portion of half an acre to the 7th Respondent, without cancelling the previous renomination of the Petitioner as successor. The Petitioner claims that such nomination of co-successors is a violation of Sections 81 and 83 of the Land Development Ordinance No. 19 of 1935.",

    "text": "It is observed that the nomination of co-successors was affected as a consequence of an inquiry held by the Divisional Secretary of Minipe while the permit holder was alive. The letter annexed with the Petition marked P12, written by the Additional District Secretary of Kandy addressed to the Petitioner refers that there had been an inquiry on17.12.2008 in respect of the dispute of the subject land where the permit holder Baby Nona and the Petitioner had signed the statement consenting to give effect to the nomination whereby one acre of the land to the Petitioner and the half of an acre of land to the 7th Respondent. In proof of such, the 1st to the 6th Respondents have submitted a copy of a document dated 17.12.2008 signed by the permit holder and the Petitioner before the Assistant Divisional Secretary of Minipe with a motion dated 24.07.2019 with the permission of the Court. It appears that the nomination of co-successors had been done on the Land Ledger P6 by making an endorsement dated 17.12.2008 by the",

    "text": "The Respondents have taken up a preliminary objection based on the delay of the Petitioner in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court. An application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filed within a reasonable time from the date of the impugned administrative which the applicant seeks to have quashed. What is reasonable time and what will constitute undue delay will depend upon the facts and circumstances of a particular case. In the instant application, the administrative decision complained of is unlawful and erroneous in law as I have concluded above. Hence the application cannot be simply rejected based on the preliminary objection of delay. In Biso Menika v Cyril de Alwis and others [1982] 1 SLR 368 Sharvananda J. held that when the Court has examined the record and is satisfied the Order complained of is manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction the Court would be loathed to allow the mischief of the Order to continue and reject the application simply on the ground of delay unless there are very extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection. Further, it is observed that there has been litigation between the Petitioner and the 7th Respondent in the District Court of Mahiyanganaya pertaining to the disputed land. It demonstrates that the Petitioner has been seeking relief elsewhere which could satisfactorily explain the delay. In the case of Biso Menika v Cyril de Alwis and others [supra] it was held that one satisfactory way to explain the delay is for the Petitioner to show that he has been seeking relief elsewhere in a manner provided by the Law. If the delay can be reasonably explained, the Court will not decline to interfere. Conclusion Based on the above circumstances and reasons given, this Court is unable to give legal effect or recognition to a procedure which is contrary and violative of the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance and effect the",
