(1) The proposition:

In CEYLON HOTELS CORPORATION LTD., vs. C. JAYATUNGE, argued on

24th, 26th, 30th June & 1st July 1969 and reasons delivered on 15th July 1969,

(The Ceylon Law Weekly, Volume 77 at page 5), Justice Albert Lionel Stanley

Sirimane1, at the commencement of the judgment said,

I am unable to uphold the preliminary objection taken by Mr.

Coomaraswamy that the defendant has no right of appeal against the order

of the learned trial Judge granting the plaintiff an interim injunction2

restraining the defendant from ejecting the plaintiff from the Kitulgala Rest

House. That was an inter partes order made after inquiry at which both

parties were heard. Such an order is an appealable one, and the right of

appeal is granted to the party dissatisfied by section 73 of the Courts

Ordinance, Chapter 6. Section 666 of the Civil Procedure Code does not

disallow that right of appeal, and that section would apply in cases where

the Court grants an interim injunction in the first instance before the other

1 Who was then the 3rd in seniority in the Supreme Court of Ceylon having 11 judges and a brother of Justice D. Q. M. Sirimane appointed to the Supreme Court in 1971.

party is heard; or where there are subsequent supervening circumstances

which could not have been foreseen, at the time the interim order was

made.

Mr. E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy was for the plaintiff respondent. At the hearing

of the appeal of the defendant appellant, the Ceylon Hotels Corporation Ltd., he

raised the preliminary objection, that, the defendant has no right of appeal

against the order granting the interim injunction.

What was referred to in the old Civil Procedure Code, was an injunction. When

the plaintiff asks for an injunction in the plaint, under section 86(a) of Courts

and Their Powers Ordinance (Courts Ordinance) No. 01 of 1889, an injunction

could be, under the law, granted straight away. Though there had been no

reference to an interim injunction, what was customarily granted was an interim

injunction. The jurisdiction to grant an interim injunction/injunction was

conferred by the Courts Ordinance. The procedure was regulated by the Civil

Procedure Code.

The relevant sections were as follows,

Courts Ordinance

86. In any action instituted in any District Court or Court of Requests

(a) where it appears from the plaint that the plaintiff demands and

is entitled to a judgment against the defendant restraining the

commission or continuance of an act or nuisance the commission

or continuance of which would produce injury to the plaintiff; or

(b)

(c) .. [(b) and (c) omitted]

it shall be lawful for such court, on its appearing by the affidavit of the

plaintiff or any other person that sufficient grounds exist therefor, to grant

an injunction restraining any such defendant from.

6 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

Civil Procedure Code (prior to 1978)

664. The court shall in all cases, except when it appears that the object of

granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay, before granting an

injunction cause the petition of application for the same together with the

accompanying affidavit to be served on the opposite party; and where the

application is made after the defendant has answered, the injunction shall

in no case be granted before such service. But the court may in its

discretion enjoin the defendant until the hearing and decision of the

application.

.

666. An order for an injunction made under this Chapter may be

discharged, or varied, or set aside by the court, on application made

thereto on petition by way of summary procedure by any party

dissatisfied with such order.

Therefore, if an injunction or interim injunction had been issued ex parte, any

party dissatisfied, can file petition and affidavit and move the district court to

either discharge, vary or set aside the same.

Summary procedure commenced in Part II of the Code at Chapter XXIV.

Its initial section, section 373 as well as sections 374 and 375 dealt with the

requisites of the application. Section 376 provided for affidavits and exhibits.

If the Court is satisfied either on a prima facie basis or is of opinion that on the

footing of these facts the petitioner is entitled to the remedy, or to the order in

his favour, for which the petition prays, or any part thereof,. Then the Court

will make an order either under section 377 (a) or (b).

On the other hand, if the court is of the view, under section 380, that the

petitioner has not established the facts averred or that the petitioner is not

entitled to the relief which he asks, the court was to refuse the petition.

7 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

Hence, when an injunction or interim injunction is granted ex parte, the

application to vacate it also could be made ex parte. If a court makes an order

under section 377, it was, either order nisi, conditioned to take effect in the event

of the respondent not showing cause under (a) or an interlocutory order

appointing a day for the determination of the matter of the petition, and intimating

that the respondent will be heard in opposition to the petition if he appears before

the court for that purpose on the day so appointed, under (b).

Hence,

(i) Injunction/interim injunction could have been granted ex parte

(ii) A party dissatisfied could have filed papers under section 666

(iii) Then, there was a hearing in terms of section 377(a) or (b)

In 1978 the Judicature Act No. 02 of 1978 was introduced.

Its section 54 says,

54.

(1) Where in any action instituted in a High Court, District Court, or a Family

Court, it appears-

(a) from the plaint that the plaintiff demands and is entitled to a

judgment against the defendant, restraining the commission

or continuance of an act or nuisance, the commission or

continuance of which would produce injury to the plaintiff;

or.

Hence section 54(1)(a) is basically the same as section 86(a) of the Courts

Ordinance.

8 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

However, the Civil Procedure Amendment Act No. 79 of 1988 certified on

18.12.1988 materially altered the section 664 of the Code. The amended section

664 reads as follows,

Section 664 of the principal enactment is hereby repealed and the following section substituted therefor:

for injunction. 664. (1) The court shall before granting an injunction cause the petition of

application for the same together with the accompanying affidavit to be served on

the opposite party.

(2) Where it appears to court that the object of granting an injunction would be

defeated by delay, it may until the hearing and decision of the application for an

injunction, enjoin the defendant for a period not exceeding fourteen days in the

first Instance, and the court may for good and sufficient reasons, which shall be

recorded, extend for periods not exceeding fourteen days at a time, the operation

of such order. An enjoining order made under these provisions, shall lapse upon

the hearing and decision of the application for the grant of an injunction.

(3) The court may, of its own motion, or on an application made by any party,

suspend the operation of an enjoining order issued under subsection (2), if it is

satisfied that such order was obtained by suppression, or misrepresentation, of any

material facts.".

Hence what was in the old section 664,

The court shall in all cases, except when it appears that the object of

granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay, before granting an

injunction cause the petition of application for the same together with the

accompanying affidavit to be served on the opposite party.,

which made it possible to grant an interim injunction ex parte was taken away.

Its place was taken over by an enjoining order under section 664(2).

9 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

An enjoining order can be granted only to be in operation for 14 days.

It could be extended, 14 days at a time, for good and sufficient reasons, which

shall be recorded.

The appearance to the court, that, the circumstances which prevailed at the time

of issuing the enjoining order ex parte still in existence, could be a good and

sufficient reason. A practice has also evolved where the defendant consents to

its extension.

Then there is the new section 664(3) from 18.12.1988. That says,

(3) The court may, of its own motion, or on an application made by any party, suspend the operation of an enjoining

order issued under subsection (2), if it is satisfied that such order was obtained by suppression, or misrepresentation,

of any material facts.".

Hence, either

(i) the court may suspend the operation of the enjoining order ex mero motu

or

(ii) do so on an application made by any party

There is no requirement of summary procedure as in section 666.

Hence the hearing of the affected party, often, the plaintiff is not mandatory.

An application under (ii) above can be dealt with ex parte.

Section 666 was also amended by 18.12.1988 amendment. This is what

happened.

Replacement of section

666 of the principal

enactment.

47. Section 666 of the principal enactment is hereby repealed and the following section

substituted therefor:

10 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

" How order

set aside or

varied.

666. An order for an injunction or enjoining order made under

this Chapter may be discharged, or varied or set aside by the

court, on application made thereto, by any party dissatisfied

with such order.".

Let us compare this with what was there prior to the amendment.

666. An order for an injunction made under this Chapter may be

discharged, or varied, or set aside by the court, on application made

thereto on petition by way of summary procedure by any party

dissatisfied with such order.

The missing words are on petition by way of summary procedure.

Hence, apart from the suspension of the enjoining order to be effected in terms

of section 664(3), an injunction [interim injunction] or enjoining order can be

discharged, varied or set aside, by any party dissatisfied with that order,

(i) on application made thereto

(a) no summary procedure

(b) no petition even necessary

(c) on application made

Section 91 of the Code says

91. Every application made to the court in the course of an action, incidental thereto, and not a

step in the regular procedure, shall be made by motion by the applicant in person or his counsel or

registered attorney, and a memorandum in writing of such motion shall be at the same time

delivered to the court.

So it appears, that, the suspension of the enjoining order, as well as, the

vacation, etc., of the enjoining order, interim injunction or injunction can be

done even by way of a motion.

11 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

That is in the same court.

There is a proposition, that, a party aggrieved or dissatisfied by an order issued

by it without hearing him, must go before it first.

It appears to this Court, even prior to the examination of authorities, except the

above opening remarks of Sirimane J., that, the above proposition is based, at

least, partly on considerations of policy; and partly on considerations of

principle.

The basis on which Sirimane J., said, that, his lordship is unable to uphold the

objection of the plaintiff respondent, that, the defendant has no right to appeal

against the order granting the interim injunction is that the district court had

made its order having heard both the parties.

His lordship said, that, the dissatisfied party has been granted a right of appeal

by section 73 of the Courts Ordinance.

That section reads thus,

73. Subject to the provisions in that behalf in the Criminal Procedure

Code or any enactment amending the same provided, any party who shall

be dissatisfied with any judgment, decree, or order pronounced by a

District Court may (excepting where such right is expressly disallowed)

appeal to the Supreme Court against any such judgment, decree, or order

from any error in law or in fact committed by such court, but no such

appeal shall have the effect of staying the execution of such judgment,

decree, or order unless the District Judge shall see fit to make an order to

that effect, in which case the party appellant shall enter into a bond, with

or without sureties as the District Judge shall consider necessary, to

appear when required and abide the judgment of the Supreme Court upon

the appeal.

12 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

At that time the District Court, one of the oldest courts established in this island

by the Charter of Justice of 1801 was administering some elements of criminal

justice too and hence the reference to the Criminal Procedure Code.

The material part of what Sirimane J., said was,

I am unable to uphold the preliminary objection taken by Mr.

Coomaraswamy that the defendant has no right of appeal against the order

of the learned trial Judge granting the plaintiff an interim injunction3

.That was an inter partes order made after inquiry at which both

parties were heard. Such an order is an appealable one, and the right of

appeal is granted to the party dissatisfied by section 73 of the Courts

Ordinance, Chapter 6.

So an appealable order was an inter partes order made after inquiry at which

both parties were heard.

Section 73 said,

.any party who shall be dissatisfied with any judgment, decree, or order

pronounced by a District Court may .appeal to the Supreme Court

against any such judgment, decree, or order.

It does not, subject to anything to the contrary which may have been said in the

Criminal Procedure Code or any enactment amending the same [section 73 is

subject to this condition] said that only inter partes orders were appealable; and

it does not seem, that, the question in regard to an interim injunction was dealt

with in the Criminal Procedure Code.

But, Sirimane J., did not uphold the above objection on the basis, that, the order

was an inter partes one, which makes it possible to assume, that, if the order

were an ex parte one, the objection, that, an appeal could not have been

13 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

preferred successfully, could have been upheld. This has been the cursus curiae

of the Supreme Court, in other words, the jurisprudence of that court.

That is why, it was said by this Court above, that, the proposition, that, a party

aggrieved or dissatisfied by an order made by a court without hearing him, must

go before that court first is based on considerations of policy and principle. The

cursus curiae of the Supreme Court, to that effect, pronounced in the above

judgment, is based on that policy of the law; and on principle.

(2) The cases:

The learned Presidents Counsel for the plaintiff respondents, at the oral hearing

conducted on 02.05.2024 as well as in the synopsis of oral submissions dated

03.05.2024 refer to the case of Gargial et al vs. Somasundaram Chetty 1905

09 NLR 26.

It was a case that came from the District Court of Kandy. On the day of the trial,

the defendants proctor appeared and moved for a postponement on the basis,

that, his client has gone out of Ceylon. The learned district judge refused to grant

a postponement. The defendants proctor refused to take part in the trial. The

court after hearing the plaintiff entered the judgment in his favour.

Chief Justice Layard said,

The whole of the argument in this case by the appellant's counsel was

based on the assumption that the judgment now under appeal was an ex

parte judgment, and that there was no appearance in the court below

either by the defendant or by his pleader (page 27). If Mr. Jonklaas,

according to our Code, did appear on that day, then he was, I think, in

exactly the same position as if the defendant himself had appeared on that

day, because he was the duly appointed proctor of the defendant, and was

authorized by his proxy to be present in court and to represent the

defendant in every stage in which the defendant himself could appear and

make an application (page 28). " Now, if this was an ex parte order, I

14 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

cannot understand how an appeal can be entertained by this court.

The ordinary principle is that, where parties are affected by an order

of which they have had no notice, and which had been made behind

their back, they must apply in the first instance to the court which

made the ex parte order to rescind the order, on the ground that it

was improperly passed against them (page 28). That point had been

dealt with by Bonser, C.J., in the case of Habibu Lebbe v. Punchi Etana,

reported in 3 C. L. R. 84. He there recognized the power of a judge of first

instance to open up a judgment given in the absence of one of the parties,

and he stated that it had long been the practice-and a practice which had

been expressly approved by this court -that in cases of that sort

application should be made in the first instance to the court which

pronounced the judgment, and that there should be an appeal to this court

only if the judge of the court of first instance refused to set it aside. There

is no doubt in my mind that that had been the practice of this court for

the last thirty years at least, and I believe that it existed prior to that date

(page 29). I agree with Bonser C.J. in thinking that that is the most

convenient course to pursue and that this court should always insist upon

its adoption, particularly because the Court of Appeal in England in the

case of Vint v. Hudspith ((1885) 29 Ch. D. 322), lays down, that although

the Court of Appeal in England may possibly have jurisdiction to hear an

appeal from a judgment given by default, yet that it is not desirable that

the court of appeal should encourage such appeals to be brought before

the application has been made to the court of original jurisdiction (page

29).

The above view which was expressed with the concurrence of Sir Alexander Wood

Renton, shows the truth of the position of this Court, that, the above proposition

is based not only on principle, but on policy too. That is why, the English Court

of Appeal in 1885 has said, that, although a judgment given, hearing only one

party can be appealed, it is not desirable to encourage such appeals.

15 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

The next case cited is Caldera vs. Santiagopillai 1920 22 NLR 155 which was

a case that came from the District Court of Kurunegala.

Chief Justice His Lordship Sir Anton Bertram said,

The order was made ex parte behind the back of the defendant, and in

accordance with the authorities cited in a very recent case (see S. C. No.

58, D. C. (Inty). Badulla, No. 3,358 1[S. C. Mins., Sept. 1, 1920.]). A person

seeking to set aside such an order must first apply to the Court which

made it, which is always competent to set aside an ex parte order of this

description. (page 158).

SCHNEIDER A.J agreed.

Then in Loku Menika vs. Selenduhamy 1947 48 NLR 353 which was a case

that came from the Court of Requests of Ratnapura Dias S. P. J., said,

It is clear that the learned Commissioner of Requests held this inquiry

under a rule of practice which has become deeply ingrained in our legal

system-namely, that if an ex parts order has been made behind the back

of any party, that party should first move the Court which made that ex

parte order in order to have it vacated, before moving the Supreme Court

or taking any other action in the matter. If authority is needed for this

proposition, it is to be found in the following cases: In Habibu Lebbe v.

Punchi Ettena 1[(1894) 3 C. L. R. at p. 85 and see Craig V. Kanssen (1943)

1 K, B. 256.] Bonser C.J. said "I am informed by my learned brother that

it has long been the practice, and a practice which has been expressly

approved by this Court, that in cases like the present one, application

should be made in the first instance to the Court which pronounced the

judgment; and if the Court which pronounced the judgment refuses to set

it aside, then, and then only, should there be an appeal from that refusal.

This course appears to me to be the most convenient one; and furthermore,

it is in accordance with the practice of the Appeal Court in England. It has

16 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

been laid down that although the Court of Appeal may have jurisdiction to

hear appeals from judgments given by default, yet, that it is not desirable

to exercise that power, and to encourage appeals to be brought before the

case had been tried .... Therefore, if the judgment was given in the absence

of one of the parties, I think that under the practice laid down by this

Court, it was competent for the District Judge to deal with the case, and

that the plaintiff adopted the proper course in applying first to the District

Judge before coming to this Court." In Gargial v. Somasundram Chetty

[(1905) 9 N. L. R. 26.] the case of- Habibu Lebbe v. Punchi Ettena (supra)

was followed. Layard C.J. said that the practice referred to had been in

existence for the last thirty years at least and " I believe that it existed prior

to that date". In the Badulla case which was cited, and which is reported

under the name of Weeraratne v. Secretary, D. C, Badulla [(1920) 2 C. L.

Rec. 180, 8 C. W. R, 95.] Bertram C J. followed the two earlier cases (page

354)

In Caldera v. Santiagopulle Bertram C,J. following Weeraratne v.

Secretary, D, C, Badulla (supra) said " The order was made ex parte behind

the back of the defendant, and in accordance with the authorities cited in

a very recent case .... a person seeking to set aside such an order must

first apply to the Court which made it, which is always competent to set

aside an ex parte order of this description. In Sayadoo Mohamadu v.

Mania Abubaker Jayewardene J. said : " An ex parte order under these

sections should, I think, be treated as any other ex parte order made by

the Court, and any party affected by it should be entitled to apply to vacate

it on notice to the party in whose favour it was made.(page 355).

Then in Ranjith Senanayake and others vs. Paul Peiris 1992 2 SLR 169, a

case that came from the District Court of Colombo Asoka de Z. Gunawardana J.,

quote from that judgment, exceeding the eight lines quoted for the plaintiff

respondents in their synopsis]

The learned Counsel for the Respondent raised a preliminary objection

to the said two Applications being entertained by this Court, viz., that the

Petitioners should have first moved the District Court under Section 213(3)

of the Companies Act, "for an Order of revocation or variation of the ex

parte order" dated 21 January, 1991, instead of coming direct to this

Court. He further submitted that the Petitioners have bypassed the said

procedure, by moving for Revision and asking for Leave to Appeal from the

said Order.

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that there are ample

exceptional circumstances warranting the grant of relief by way of

Revision. He added that, they have a right to maintain the Application for

Leave to Appeal as they have complied with all the necessary requirements

for maintaining the said Application (page 171)

The learned Counsel for the Respondent contended that the Petitioners

have, by moving for Revision of the said Order, disregarded a well-

established practice existing for over a hundred years, and cited the case

of Andradie v. Jayasekera Perera (1) where Siva Selliah, J. at page 209

stated that,

". . . the practice has grown and almost hardened into a rule that

where a decree has been entered ex parte in the District Court and

is sought to be set aside on any ground, application must in the first

instance be made to that very Court and that it is only where the

finding of the District Court on such application is not consistent

with reason or proper exercise of the Judge's discretion or where he

has misdirected himself on the facts or law will this Court grant

extraordinary relief by way of Revision or Restitutio in Integrum

which are extraordinary remedies."

In opposition to the said contention the learned Counsel for the Petitioners

cited the unreported case of Nadarajah Mahendran v. Chockalingam

Sinnadurai (2), where Court of Appeal had acted in revision, in spite of the

fact that, the petitioner in that case, had already moved the District Court

to set aside the interim injunction under the provision of Section 666 of

the Civil Procedure Code. It must however be pointed out that, the Court

of Appeal acted in revision in that case on the basis that exceptional

circumstances that existed in that case warranted the exercise of the

revisionary jurisdiction. The Court held that the petitioner in that case was

in peril of being charged for contempt of court, in respect of the interim

injunction issued by the District Court, if the petitioner in that case, acted

in pursuance of the Order made by the Primary Court. In that case, the

petitioner had obtained an Order from the Primary Court enabling him to

remain in possession of the premises in question on an application made

by him, under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Act. However, the

respondent in that case had, subsequent to the Order of the Primary

Court, obtained an interim injunction from the District Court restraining

the petitioner in that case, from occupying that part of the premises which

was occupied by the said petitioner. Thus the application in revision was

made in exceptional circumstances where either party may have been dealt

with for (page 172) contempt by either the Primary Court or the District

Court if both Orders were sought to be implemented. Furthermore, there

was also the question whether the District Court had, in the

circumstances, the jurisdiction to issue the interim injunction, in view of

the prior Order made by the Primary Court, having regard to decision in

Mylvaganam v. Kanagasabai (3), where it was held that,

"The mere fact that a suit is pending in a civil Court does not deprive

the Magistrate of jurisdiction to make an Order under Section 62 of

the Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973."

19 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

These difficulties could not have been resolved except by a Court having

appellate jurisdiction over both the lower Courts. It was in these

exceptional circumstances that the Court of Appeal acted in revision in the

said case (page 173).

Hence it appears, that, an appellate court or a court that has revisionary

powers interfered with such an order in extreme necessity.

However, this Court does not come to a conclusion on this question, the question

of the above proposition, which this Court said as based on policy and principle

both, without further examination of decisions.

The plaintiff respondents then cite Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd and another vs.

Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd., 1987 (1) SLR 5.

In this case consisting of the judgments of Sharvananda C. J., Justice E. A. D.

Atukorale and Justice H. A. G. de Silva, Justice Atukorale said,

The question then arises whether a court, in the absence of any specific

provision in the Code, has the power to set aside its own ex parte order on

the application of the party against whom it is made. There is in my view

ample authority to show that a court does have such power. In Loku

Menika v. Selenduhamy (19) a hypothecary decree was entered against the

first respondent who had been appointed legal representative in place of

the deceased mortgagors. It later transpired that the notices for the

appointment of a legal representative had not been served on any of the

respondents and that no summons in the mortgage action was served on

the first respondent. On an application by the respondents to have all the

proceedings in the case vacated the Commissioner of Requests held that

all proceedings culminating in the hypothecary decree and thereafter were

void and set them aside. In appeal Dias, J. following several earlier

decisions referred to by him in his Judgment, observed as follows

20 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

" It is clear that the learned Commissioner of Requests held this

inquiry under a rule of practice which has become deeply ingrained

in our legal system-namely, that if an ex parte order has been made

behind the back of any party, that party should first move the Court

(page 28) which made that ex parte order in order to have it vacated.

before moving the Supreme Court or taking any other action in the

matter (page 29).

The learned Judge further examining authorities in this regard said,

In Dingihamy v Don Bastian (23) the court without fixing a date for the

answer of the defendant fixed the case for ex parte trial on the basis that

the defendant was in default and entered decree nisi against her. She then

made an application to court to have the decree nisi set aside which was

refused on an appeal preferred by her. Tambiah, J. said:

"The defendant quite properly made an application to the learned

Commissioner of Requests to rectify an order, made ex parte,

without proper notice to her. Indeed, the ordinary principle is that,

where parties are affected by an order of which they have had no

notice, and which had been made behind their back, they must

apply in the first instance to the court which made the ex parte order

to rescind the order, on the ground that it was improperly passed

against them." (page 29)

In Bank of Ceylon v. Liverpool Marine & General Insurance Co., Ltd. (24)

the District Court, acting ex mero motu, made order abating the action

under s.402 of the Civil Procedure Code. The plaintiff then filed papers in

court to set aside the order of abatement which was refused by the District

Judge. On an appeal filed by the plaintiff it was contended on behalf of the

defendant that the only course open to the plaintiff was to have made

application under s. 403 to set aside the abatement order within -a

reasonable time. L-B. de Silva, J. (with H. N. G. Fernando agreeing) held

21 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

that although the order of abatement was entered by court ex mero motu,

yet it was entered without any notice to the plaintiff who had no

opportunity to show cause against it and that it was an ex parte order the

validity of which the plaintiff-could challenge in the same case at any time.

In Nagappan v. Lankabarana Estates Ltd. (25) Samarawickrame, J.

expressed his approval of the principle enunciated in Bank of Ceylon v.

Liverpool Marine & General Insurance Co., Ltd. (supra) (24) and in Loku

Menika v. Selenduhamy (supra) (19). These authorities therefore clearly

establish the principle that a court which makes an ex parte order without

notice to the party who is adversely affected by it is entitled to set it aside

on the application of such party in the same case. This power is derived

not from any express provision in the Code but, as stated above, from a

rule of practice which has become deeply ingrained in our legal system. I

am therefore of the view- that in the instant case it was legally competent

for the learned District Judge to vacate the enjoining order which was

made by him ex parte (page 30).

The above is a survey of some of the decided cases in this country, in respect of

any ex parte order made in general; and in respect of ex parte injunctions,

interim injunctions and enjoining orders in particular, on the above proposition,

which says, that, the remedy must be, or appropriately, one of its synonyms

being judiciously had in the same court that issued that order, which reflects

a profile of the cursus curiae of the superior courts, especially the Supreme Court

in this country.

(3) The text writers:

It is appropriate now, to examine, what does the text writers say about the

principles and procedure of vacation of ex parte orders; and in this case,

especially about ex parte injunctions, which term includes ex parte interim

injunctions and ex parte enjoining orders.

22 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

There are slight differences in procedure in respect of inunctions in England and

India. But the basic norms and principles are same.

Justice Joseph Francis Anton Soza, a distinguished career judge, who could

illuminate both the benches of the superior courts of this country, in his

lordships article Interim Injunction in Sri Lanka said, referring to Indian

procedure, that,

There could of course be exceptional situations or new supervening

circumstances for which provision could be made to discharge. vary or set

aside an injunction entered inter partes. We have not done it but India has

by her Civil Procedure Code Order 39 Rule 4 which corresponds to Section

496 of Act No. XIV of 1882 on which our own old Section 666 was based.

The Indian Rule 4 reads thus:

"R4. Any order for an injunction may be discharged. varied. or set aside by

the court. On application made thereto by any party dissatisfied with such

order:

Provided that if in an application for temporary injunction or in any

affidavit supporting such an application, a party has knowingly made a

false or misleading statement in relation 10 a material particular and the

injunction was granted without giving notice 10 the opposing party, the

court may vacate the injunction unless, for reasons 10 be recorded, it

considers that it is not necessary 10 do so in the interest of justice.

Provided further that where an order for injunction has been passed a/le

giving a party an opportunity o/being heard. the order shall not be

discharged, varied or set aside on the application of that party excepl

where such discharge, variation or selling aside has been necessitated by

a change in Ihe circumstances or unless Ihe court is satisfied lhal Ihe order

has caused undue hardship 10 the party :' (emphasis mine)

23 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

The second proviso was brought in by an amendment made in 1976 "that

where an injunction has been granted after giving to aparty the

opportunity of being heard, the order for injunction shall not be

discharged. varied or set aside on the application of that party except

where such discharge; variation or cancellation is necessitated by a change

in the circumstances or by reason of the hardship caused by it." (page 79

and 80, Judges Journal, the First issue).

The above was quoted here, not to discuss about the procedure of vacating inter

partes injunctions, but to show, that, the procedure is basically same despite

some differences.

The writer G. S. Gupta, on Law of Injunctions, 07th Edition, 2011 under

Vacation of ex parte injunction, says at page 1327 et seq., that,

6 Vacation of ex parte injunction. -In Rameshwar Dass v. Brij

Bhushan, AIR 1988 HP 31 at 32 (per P. D. Desai, C. J.),

it was observed as follows:-

The counsel for the respondents tried to sustain the order on the

ground that an express power is vested in the Court under Order

XXXIX Rule 4 to discharge or vary or set aside any order of

injunction on an application made thereto by any party dissatisfied

with such order and if in an application for temporary injunction or

in any affidavit supporting such application, a party has knowingly

made a false or misleading statement in relation to a material

particular and the injunction was granted without giving notice to

the opposite party, the Court has no option but to vacate the

injunction unless, for reasons to be recorded, it considers that it is

not necessary so to do in the interest of justice and that, therefore,

on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the trial Court

was within its powers to vacate the ad interim relief granted ex parte

24 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

without issuing a notice to the petitioner. The argument has been

stated merely to be rejected. The main part of order XXXIX, Rule 4

vests the Court with a discretionary power to discharge or vary or

set aside any order of injunction upon being moved in that behalf by

any aggrieved party. The discretion accordingly conferred has to be

exercised reasonably and in a judicial manner and in conformity

with the principles of fair play and justice. The requirements would

be satisfied if, and only if, the party likely to be affected by the

exercise of such discretion is, inter alia, given a reasonable

opportunity of being heard. The same requirement is implicit also

when the Court is called upon to vacate an ex parte injunction

in compliance of the duty cast upon it under the first proviso

to Order XXXIX, Rule 4 in a case where a party is alleged to

have knowingly made a false or misleading statement in

relation to a material particular in the application for temporary

injunction or in any affidavit supporting such application. In

fact, it is inconceivable how the power to be conferred can be

reasonably exercised by any Court without affording a reasonable

opportunity of correcting and controverting the allegations of such

nature to the party who has obtained the ex parte injunction and

without determining the correctness of such allegations on a just

appraisal of the materials placed before it by both the parties. The

rules of procedure to be followed in the Courts are essentially based

on the well-recognised rules of fair play and justice and it is

impossible to believe that Parliament could have intended to vest the

court with the power to vacate an ex parte injunction on the ground

of a false or misleading statement in relation to a material particular

having been knowingly made by the party obtaining the same

without even hearing such party."

The same writer also said at page 218 et seq.,

25 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

Vacation or variation of an injunction order.-Any order for an injunction

may be discharged, or varied, or set aside by the Court, on application

made thereto by any party dissatisfied with such order: Provided that if an

application for temporary injunction or in any affidavit supporting such

application, a party has knowingly made a false or misleading statement

in relation to a material particular and the injunction was granted without

giving notice to the opposite party, the Court shall vacate the injunction

unless for reasons to be recorded, it considers that it is not necessary so

to do in the interests of justice: Provided further that where an order for

injunction had been passed after giving to a party an opportunity of being

heard, the order shall not be discharged, varied or set aside on the

application of that party except where such discharge, variation or setting

aside has been necessitated by a change in the circumstances, or unless

the Court is satisfied that the order has caused undue hardship to that

party. Rule 4 of Order XXXIX was amended by the amending Act of 1976

with the object of providing for the vacation of an ex parte injunction on

the ground that a false or misleading statement has been made in the

application for injunction. A further proviso was added to the effect that

where an injunction has been granted after giving to a party an

opportunity of being heard, the order for injunction shall not be

discharged, varied or set aside on the application of that party except

where such discharge, variation or cancellation is necessitated by the

change in the circumstances or by reason of hardship caused by it. Change

in circumstances or undue hardship not established, varying or changing

of order by Court is illegal.

The temporary injunction that is granted under the provisions of Order

XXXIX can be broadly divided into two categories; one if the temporary

injunction that is granted until the disposal of the suit and the order is the

temporary injunction that is granted until further orders. This distinction

has to be kept in mind while exercising the judicial discretion under these

26 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

provisions including the provision for vacation of the ex parte temporary

injunction passed without notice to the otherside. In such case it is better

for a party against whom to file a petition under Rule 4 to discharge

the injunction so passed. It is better not to approach the appellate

court straight away to vacate that order. Cases may arise where though

the injunction was passed after enquiry owing to fresh circumstances or

hardship is caused to the party he may approach the Court to reconsider

its orders and pass fresh orders avoiding the undue hardship caused to

any party.

In the collection of cases compiled by Mahinda Ralapanawe, Attorney at Law on

Constitutional Injunctions; Sri Lankan cases and materials, 1992, the case

of Mallika Ratwatte vs. The Minister of Lands (The Hon. C. P. de Silva) S. C.

141/69 is referred to. On 11th April 1969, Samerawickrame J., started his

lordships judgment saying,

On the application of the petitioners, I made order on the 20th of March.

1969, ordering the issue of a temporary injunction restraining the

respondents in respect of the acquisition of certain lands and in my order,

I reserved the right to the respondents to apply, on good grounds

shown, to have the order vacated. The respondents have now applied to

have the order set aside and. In view of the imminence of the Court

Vacation and the possibility that this matter may not come up for hearing

during the term if they controverted the facts and thereby made it

necessary for the respondents to file counter affidavit, they have been

content with contending that upon the facts and circumstances disclosed

in the papers filed by the Petitioners, they were not entitled to the issue of

an injunction.

In Goyles Law of Injunctions second edition by Ajit K. Sengupta, 2002, it is

said, that,

27 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

The Madras High Court is of the view that the injuncted party must

first exhaust his remedy under r. 4 before filing the appeal. The

reasons given in support of this view are that Or. 43, r. 1(r) can be invoked

only in a case where the lower appellate court makes a decision after

hearing the affected party within the meaning of s2(9) and (14) of the Code

of Civil Procedure and expresses itself formally so that its reasoning and

grounds on which its decision is based could be scrutinized by the higher

court, and where an interim or ex parte order is not founded on any reason

and cannot reasonably be characterized as a formal expression of a

decision made by a judge and which decision in turn is not based upon

intelligible and acceptable grounds, the remedy available to a party

affected is under Or. 39, r. 4 and not by invoking the appellate provision

under Or. 43, r. 1(r). Of course, in a case where there is a reasoned

judgment after hearing the parties, and a decision based on various

grounds is made, one way or the other, by the trial court, then obviously,

that would be an appealable order. (Abdul Shukoor Sahib vs. Uma Chander

AIR 1976 Mad 350; Ramlingan Naicker vs. Chennakrishna Konar AIR 1983

Mad 347). The Karnataka High Court is also practically of the same view;

but it does not agree that the right of appeal is dependent upon the

distinction between a reasoned order and an unreasoned order. It is

true that a party can move an application under Or. 39, r. 4, CPC for

vacation or variation of the ex parte order of interim injunction, in case of

any concealment or willful misrepresentation. However, the pendency of

the matter before the single judge who passed the said order would

not preclude the right of a party to challenge an ex parte order in

appeal. Even if the matter is pending before the single judge, if the urgency

and circumstances so justified, such an appeal would be entertained. (B.

L. & Co., vs. Pfizer Products Inc. AIR 2001 NOC 87 (Del)). An unreasoned

order of rejection is, it is said, equally appealable. It has also been observed

that the right of appeal is available to a stranger also where he is affected

28 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

by the injunction. (Parijatha vs. Kamalaksha Nayak AIR 1982 Kant 105

(DB); M. G. Pai vs. Canara Bank Ltd., (1980) 1 Kant 256; Gurupadayya

Nagayya Horaginamath vs. Mahadu Arjun Nidoni AIR 1976 Kant 66). (page

143 to 144)

The learned writer observes at page 146 and 147, that,

The court also observed that the language of r. 1) of Or. 45 unhedged

and broad, and court should lean in favour of an interpretation which

expands rather than shrinks a remedial right. A remedial provision of

law is generally construed liberally. Rule 1(r) creates a remedial right of

appeal for protection of substantial and substantive rights (ibid at p. 376).

This case has been followed by the Himachal Pradesh High Court in Raj

Kumar Suri v Prem Lal Dhiman, by the Gujarat High Court in Patel Jasmat

Sangaji Padalia v Gujarat Electricity Board by the Bombay High Court in

S.K. Jusa v Ganpat Dagdu Giri and by the Jammu & Kashmir High Court

in Astral Traders v Haji Mohammad Shaban Dar.

The High Courts of Andhra Pradesh, Assam and Calcutta have also

reached the same conclusion: see E. Mangamma v A Muniswamy: Akmal

Ali v State of Assam; and In re, Sankar Kumar Ghosh.

It is, however, submitted that the observations made by MYFTI BAHA-UD-

TIN FAROOQUE, ACTG, CJ. in the J&K case above take a pragmatic view

and are to be preferred. He said,

"I am inclined to agree with the view expressed that an ex parte ad

interim injunction is as much appealable as an order of temporary

injunction passed after hearing both the parties. But in my opinion it

would be in the fitness of things, if, as a matter of practice, the

appellate court refuses to entertain an appeal directed against an ad

interim injunction so long as the aggrieved party has not approached

the trial court for its vacation. I say so on the twin grounds; firstly,

29 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

that an order passed after hearing the parties would naturally be

passed upon the material and data placed on the file by either party

and, secondly, because such order would provide the appellate court

the benefit of the views expressed by the trial court in the matter,

howsoever brief and cryptic such views might be. On the other hand,

if an appeal against an ex parte order of injunction is entertained, the

aggrieved party would necessarily demand that it should be allowed

to place on record the material that it seeks to rely upon and this

would naturally turn the appellate court into the trial court, and,

moreover, the appellate court would not be able to guess as to what

the opinion of the trial court would be, if such material were placed

before it." (Ibid, para. 14).

It is thus seen, with respect, that the Indian judiciary has addressed the

considerations of principle, based on the jurisprudential question, for the

validation of the above proposition, which this Court is compelled to note, that,

the Ceylonese counterpart appeared to have been wanting, which is noted here,

not as a remark of disparagement, but as an stimulant to think about the

underlying reason for a rule; which provides, it is submitted, a stepping stone,

to think ahead.

Despite not being written on this very proposition under consideration, I find

some illuminating passages from the book Law of Injunctions in Sri Lanka,

(An Analytical and Comparative Exposition), by Mr. Anura Bandara4, 2007,

which I reproduce here. His views expressed in the following passages, it is

submitted, add justification to the reference by this Court above, to Indian

authorities and texts.

On a historical research it is found that the concept of injunction which

had its origin in Rome was adopted by the English legal system which

4 I had the good fortune of experiencing the erudition of this writer, when I was the District Judge of Tangalla in 1998 and he was the Additional District Judge.

30 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

subsequently made a voluminous contribution for the development and

advancement of this concept as an equitable remedy and was applied in

numerous provinces of the law.

It cannot be denied that even the Indian legal system has adopted the

English principles in regard to injunctions. In fact Indian Courts have

followed the principles and practice of the Chancery Courts. Woodroffe's

injunctions 1964, p. 3 indicates that the best guides in the matter of

interference by way of injunction have been judicially stated to be the

principles which determine the action of a court of equity in England. In

Shamnugger Jute Factory Co., Vs. Ram Narain Chatterji, 14 Cal 189 (199,

200) court observed as follows:

"The granting of injunctions is now regulated by sections 54 and 55 of the

Specific Relief Act. But these sections had never been understood as

introducing new principles of law into India, but rather as an attempt to

express in general terms the rules acted upon by the Courts of Equity in

England, and long since introduced in this country, not because they were

English Law, but because they were in accordance with Equity and Good

Conscience."

In administering the law relating to injunctions in India, the Indian Courts

follow the law that prevails in England and English cases to interpret the

statutory provisions relating to injunctions contained in the Specific Relief

Act and Code of Civil Procedure. It was so decided in Ramadas Khatau and

Co, Vs. Atlas Mills Co, Ltd. 1931 Bomb 151: 55 Bomb 659,

Similarly, in the Sri Lankan legal system too in interpreting section 54 of

the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978 and the relevant sections in the Civil

Procedure Code (662 to 667) most of the Indian and English cases and the

concepts and principles introduced by them have been freely adopted.

(pages 07 and 08)

Hence, Mr. Bandara in his immaculate way has captured the Romono-Anglo

American flavour of interim in injunctions.

Hence, it appears that,

(i) The above proposition is based, partly on policy and partly on principle

(ii) The policy consideration is partly based on regard to that court which

issued the ex parte order and partly based on matters of convenience for

the appellate courts (A good part of most policy considerations rest on

the convenience of the system, not the people that come under its

purview)

(iii) The considerations on principle are based on the rule of natural justice

audi alteram partem

(a) The court that issued the ex parte order can now hear the other party

and thus make a complete order

(b) If the dissatisfied party comes to the appellate or higher court and

makes an ex parte application to vacate the order of the lower court

made ex parte, both the courts are not afforded with the benefit of the

rule audi alteram partem; court No. 01 will hear X; and court No. 02

will hear Y

(c) If the second court hears both parties, as in this case, although the

deficiency referred to in (b) is cured to a certain extent, as the last

quoted Indian text writer said, or in actuality he meant, the purported

views of the lower court on matters that would have been represented

before it for the dissatisfied party will be those that assumed by the

higher court to be the perspective of the lower court.

Therein lies the importance of the fuller adjudication (even limited to the question

at hand) by one and the same court, that, issued the ex parte injunction.

(4) The question of RII:

Intermediate to the transition of the thread of the argument in this order, is the

reference to Aussie Oats Milling (Private) Limited vs. Future Consumer

Limited and another C. A. RII 06 2022, the order dated 30.03.2022, written

by me. Intermediate, because what the 02nd defendant says through oral

submissions made in his behalf by the learned Presidents Counsel and the

synopsis filed, still dwell in the above proposition, referring to which this order

commenced; and then the learned Presidents Counsel refer to the purported

fetters on the jurisdiction of restitutio in integrum, the answer to which that will

be given by this Court will occupy the second part of this order.

Aussie Oats case, it must be said, marks a turning point on the availability of

the remedy of restitutio as this Court sees it. It appears, that, the sheer necessity

and the ingenuity of the learned President Counsel who appeared for the

petitioner in that case (Mr. Upul Jayasooriya P.C.) brought it before this Court,

which made me, for the first time, to expand the jurisdiction of restitutio, which

was up to then confined mostly to some partition actions coming from a few

district courts in certain provinces (especially the Southern); and several

petitioners who were then benefited from that expansion (subject to appeal)

should be grateful to the cleverness of the said learned counsel. The innovation,

was resisted by the somewhat conventional but also robust resistance of the

learned and much respected barrister, who is a senior Presidents Counsel and

appeared for the contesting respondent. The present President Counsel who

appears for the 2nd respondent experienced the drama and the spectacle of that

case first hand, for he appeared for another respondent in that case, who did not

have a contest with the petitioner. It is left to the posterity, if you know what I

mean, to preserve the splendor and elegance of that singular episode, now in

history, that marked a milestone of its own kind5.

5 One of the initial days of argument, unfortunately, became the last appearance in court of another respected Presidents Counsel who appeared as junior counsel, due to his untimely passing away, on that evening, in regard to which a reference was made by this Court on the next inquiry date: TRIBUTE to ANIL TITTAWELLA PC - News Features | Daily Mirror

33 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

In the synopsis filed on behalf of the 2nd defendant, the learned Presidents

Counsel describes the reason as to why this Court intervened in his own words,

as follows,

It is notable that in Aussie Oats Milling (Private) Limited v Future

Consumer Limited and Another, Your Lordship's Court allowed such

application in restitutio in integrum because the Petitioner therein had

made the requisite application in the Commercial High Court to set aside

the Orders complained of therein, and it is only because the Learned High

Court Judge had delayed the supporting of such application that Your

Lordships Court allowed the Petitioner in such matter to maintain the

same.

Looking back at my order in Aussie Oats case which was made two years one

month and seven days ago, I find, that, at a certain initial part in that order too,

as I did in this order, I have dealt with the thread of authorities commencing

from Habibu Lebbe vs. Punchi Etana 1894 03 CLR 85, the 130 year old case

about the above proposition. I have not departed from that proposition. But I

have said, that, there was no violation of it.

Some excerpts from pages 06 and 07 of my order would explain the

circumstances under which the learned President Counsel in that case brought

the petitioners case before me.

However, as evident by the few opening paragraphs of this order and paragraphs 41

(a) to (k) of the said written submissions, this court has been hearing the applications

of both parties, if it may say so, giving dates sooner than later as far as the

circumstances permitted6.

(1) The grievance of the petitioner:

6 At the last hearing on 09th March 2022, it intended to give only one week (07 days) for the parties to file written submissions, despite it being extended to 10 days on the application for the petitioner Aussee Oats Milling (Private) Limited.

34 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

The grievance of the petitioner for coming before this court, is the exact opposite, that

the Commercial High Court did not allow its application to be supported urgently.

In fairness to that court, however, it must be stated that the said court had taken the

case for hearing on the motion of the petitioner on 14th February 2022. However, the

learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner was then, (according to the affidavit of

Raghav Gupta of Aussee Oats Milling (Private) Limited dated 14th of February 2022),

before Court No. 404 of the Supreme Court appearing in SC/FR/123/16 and his junior

counsel sought permission of the Commercial High Court to take the matter later. The

said affidavit further states that since there were no other matters pending before that

court it ordered to mention the matter on 24th February 2022. It was stated from the

Bar that when this happened the time was 10.25 a.m. The said affidavit further states

that a motion was filed on 14th February 2022 itself in the said court requesting to call

the case on 15th February 2022 but that motion was not allowed. It was said from the

Bar that a matter concerning the same subject, case No. CHC 78/2021 CO was to be

heard on 15th February 2022.

As per the paragraph 02 of the aforesaid written submissions of the respondent, it

instituted the case No. CHC 02/2022/CO on 26th January 2022 and in terms of section

224 and 225 of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 read with section 520 obtained ex

parte interim orders. As per its paragraph 04, the petitioner has made an application

on 09th February 2022, under section 521(1) of Companies Act to set aside and or

revoke or vary the said orders.

It appears that this second application made by the petitioner Aussee Oats Milling

(Private) Limited was the one that came for support on 14th February 2022 and the

aforesaid incident narrated in the affidavit of Raghav Gupta took place.

The petitioner, Aussee Oats Milling (Private) Limited has further stated in its aforesaid

affidavit that in case No. CHC 78/2021 CO, the same learned High Court Judge has

granted certain interim orders against the respondent.

35 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

It must be said that in case No. CHC 78/2021 CO, the present 01st respondent

petitioner, Aussee Oats Milling (Private) Limited is the petitioner and the present

petitioner respondent, Future Consumer Limited is the 01st respondent.

The said affidavit further states that the Attorney at Law of the respondent has sent

letters, to the State Bank of India and Hatton National Bank PLC and others on 11th

February 2022 based on the interim orders dated 26th January 2022 and informed the

said banks to refrain from acting upon any instructions issued by the petitioner, in

effect freezing the accounts of the petitioner, upon the threat of legal action against

the said banks if they carry out any instructions of the petitioner.

The petitioner states in the said affidavit that this has brought the operations of the

petitioner into a grinding halt causing grave loss and damage to the petitioner, thereby

effectively destroying the petitioner and the livelihood of its over 200 employees and

their families.

The petitioner has also stated that certain interim orders granted by the

Commercial High Court on 26th January 2022 are contrary to interim

orders it granted earlier in case No. CHC 78/2021 CO.

So, in that case, the petitioner went before the same court. But, as it was

apparent, without a valid reason for having so to do, the Commercial High Court

delayed hearing him. The Banks were stayed from making transactions. The

operations have come into a grinding halt. Two hundred employees and an even

larger number of their families were being affected. Their livelihood was under

threat. So the Court had to intervene.

The following is how I dealt with the string of cases on the above proposition, in

Aussie Oats case,

The oldest case cited on the first ground is Habibu Lebbe vs. Punchi Etana

1894 03 CLR 85 decided by Sir Winfield Bonser C.J., in which case it was held,

that it has long been the expressly approved practice by the Supreme Court, if an

order or judgment has been made in the absence of a party, that party must first

apply to the court that pronounced the judgment for same to be set aside and it is

36 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

only if that court refuses to set it aside that there should be an appeal against

such refusal.

This principle was followed in the other cases cited for the respondent which are

Caldera vs. Santiagopillai 22 NLR 155, Loku Menika vs. Selenduhamy

48 NLR 353, Fernando vs. Dias and others 1980 (2) SLR 48 and Hotel

Galaxy (Private) Limited and others vs. Mercantile Hotels

Management (Private) Limited 1987 (1) SLR 5.

However, the petitioner has gone before the court which issued the ex parte order.

The letters sent to the Banks by the Attorney at Law of the respondent being on 11th

February 2022, by 14th February 2022 03 days have gone. When the matter was

postponed from 14th February 2022 to 24th February 2022 it will be further 10 days

and altogether about 14 days or two weeks the petitioner will not be able to

function. The court did not allow the application to call the case for support on 15th

February 2022, despite the existence of the other case also on that day. Thus it was

not going to change the date for 24th February 2022. Besides 24th February 2022

was also a mention date and there was a reasonable doubt (since the court

refused to give an audience despite a motion being filed) whether the matter will

be allowed to support on that date. It was in those circumstances the petitioner

came before this court. In most cases of revision and restitutio in integrum relief is

refused because parties come to the court of appeal after delay. Should the

petitioner be punished for being alive in the matter of safeguarding its rights?

(Aussie Oats pages 08 and 09)

The 2nd defendant, having transited to the domain of restitutio in integrum,

imposes fetters on it. As in respect of all legal concepts and institutions, restitutio

too is not and was never unfettered.

In C. A. RII 24 2024, in which case an order was delivered yesterday, i.e.,

06.05.2024, the learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for the petitioner;

and who appears for the petitioner in this case too, had submitted in written

submissions, that, this Court would not, limit the restitutio jurisdiction. It will

37 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

not. It reproduces, the following excerpt which had been employed elsewhere too

for the purpose of reiterating its commitment to uphold the usefulness of that

remedy.

The following is an examination of the case law on restitutio in integrum,

mostly on a chronological order, but departing from that rule on necessity.

(i) Perera vs. Ekanaike, 03 NLR 21

Withers J., decided, that,

A judgment obtained by fraud or passed under a mistake may be set

aside either by a regular action or, possibly, by application by way of

summary procedure as regulated by the Civil Procedure Code. It cannot

be done by mere motion supported by affidavits with notice to the decree-

holder.

It was also said, that,

This appears to us to be an attempt to set aside a judgment of consent

between the present plaintiff and the present defendant on the ground

either that the judgment was obtained by fraud-the fraud being that

plaintiff, well knowing the facts of the settlement on or after 1884,

concealed that fact from the Court, and so obtained a judgment which

otherwise she would never have obtained-or on the ground that these facts

through ignorance of the present parties had been kept back from the

Judge who passed the judgment under a mistake and in ignorance of facts

which had he known he would not have passed the judgment in question.

The words mistake or in ignorance of facts according to the above passage

emanated from the fraud practiced on court.

There was no direct mention of restitutio in integrum.

(ii) Buyzer vs. Eckert 13 NLR 371

38 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

In this case, Plaintiff's license to practise as surveyor was cancelled by the

District Court on proceedings instituted by the Surveyor-General on the petition

of the defendant. Plaintiff subsequently instituted the present action in the Court

of Requests, claiming damages against the defendant, on the ground that he had

maliciously placed false documentary evidence before the District Court, and

claiming also a declaration of the invalidity of the documentary evidence so

adduced.

Middleton J., said,

The proper course in such a case as this is laid down by this Court in

Gunaratne v. Dingiri Banda [1 (1898) 4 N. L. R. 249. ] and in Sinnetamby

v. Nallatamby,[ 2 (1904) 7 N. L. R. 139.] by proceedings by way of restitutio

in integrum, or even, as I said in my judgment in the latter case, an action

in the District Court might be brought on the ground of fraud to set aside

the judgment.

In Gunaratne v. Dingiri Banda [1 (1898) 4 N. L. R. 249.] it was a question of

fraud on a consent judgment. Sir Winfield Bonser, Chief Justice, said,

There seems to be some doubt as to what should be the proper

procedure in cases where a party wishes to get a decree set aside on the

ground of fraud. There is no doubt that, if a consent of the parties to a

judgment is obtained by fraud, there must be some remedy for the fraud.

This application was in substance an application for what is called

restitutio in integrum, -which is a well-known civil law remedy for setting

aside, a judgment which had been improperly obtained. It scorns to have

been the practice in Holland to apply for restitutio in integrum to the

highest Court of Appeal, which had delegated to it the powers of the

Sovereign in this respect.

Withers and Brown JJ., in their lordships judgments did not mention about

restitutio in integrum.

39 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

The words of Bonser C. J., there seems to be some doubt and what is called

restitutio in integrum, only shows the lack of knowledge, with respect, of this

remedy in 1898.

In Buyzer itself, there is a judgment of Wood Renton J., too. It said,

It would clearly have been open to the appellant to have applied to the

Supreme Court on an allegation that the decree against him in the special

case had been obtained by the fraudulent production of false evidence, for

an order of restitutio in integrum, and I am not prepared to say, on the

materials before me at present,. that an action to set aside the decree

directly might not perhaps have been brought in a Court whose

jurisdiction is concurrent with that of the Court which pronounced it.

As referred to in elsewhere in this judgment itself, in Buyzer, Middleton J., said,

On the ground that this action is brought for the purpose of setting aside a

judgment of a superior court, I would hold that the proceedings do not lie in

their present form, and would dismiss the action with costs, without prejudice

to any right the plaintiff may have to raise the question in the manner I have

indicated, either by substantive action in the District Court for fraud or by way

of restitutio in integrum.

(iii) Jayasuriya vs. Kotalawala et al 23 NLR 511

Sir Anton Bertram, Chief Justice said,

The fact that a man is deceived by fraudulent representations cannot be

construed as a misfortune preventing him from appearing to show cause.

His proper remedy is to apply either for restitutio in integrum or to seek

damages for the fraud. Mr. Jayawardene asks us to say that the Court has

an inherent power to set aside a decree issued ex parte.

Up to now, the cases referred to have considered on the aspect of fraud

practiced on court. Would that mean, that, fraud is the only situation in which

40 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

restutio is available? This Court says, that, reference only to fraud in these

cases at the end of the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th centuries shall not

say, that, fraud practiced on the decision maker is the only ground for

restitutio. In fact, the proponents of the theory that restitutio is an extra

ordinary remedy granted only on the grace of the court too accept, that, there

are other instances in which the remedy is applicable.

(iv) Sinnatamby vs. Nallathamby 07 NLR 139

This was a case in which it was alleged, that, the consent decree was entered

due to mistake.

Middleton J., said,

I think, therefore, that this Court has jurisdiction on application by

petition duly supported by affidavit to grant an order upon the Judge of

first instance in certain cases of alleged error upon judgment, to inquire

into and to ascertain, and then to correct if necessary and right so to do,

by restitutio in integrum.

Wendt., J., said,

Appellants' Counsel has questioned the soundness of the decision in

Gooneratne v. Dingiri Banda, and has sought to re-open the whole

question. Conceding that the Sovereign could even now grant restitutio in

integrum, he has denied that this Court stands in the place of the " Court

of Holland, " to which the Sovereign's powers had been specially delegated.

He has cited Van Leeuwen's description of the Court of Holland, and his

definition of the scope of the remedy of restitution (2 Kolze, pp. 428-4,31,

342-347), and has pointed out that in more than one of the cases

enumerated as falling within the scope of restitutio, the right to claim relief

by action is now recognized in Ceylon. But I think that the rule laid down

in the case I have already mentioned is a most wholesome one, and ought

to be adhered to. This Court there pointed out that some uncertainty had

41 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

previously existed as to the proper procedure to be followed in cases where

a party desired to be relieved of a decree which had been improperly

obtained against him, and it proceeded to consider the question with a

view to settling the point. It was very fully argued, and having been a

Counsel in the case I am able to say that not only were the opinions of

Voet and Groenewegen cited, but the several local authorities in Marshall's

Judgments, 2 S. C. C. 108, 6 S. C. C. 102, 3 C. L. R. 13, 3 N. L. R. 21 were

discussed, as well as the English cases. The Court consisting of Bonser,

C.J., and Withers, J., laid it down that the party complaining of the decree

should in the first instance apply ex parte on proper materials to the

Supreme Court, which if satisfied that a prima facie case was made out

would direct the Court which passed the decree to hear the application

and review its own decision, confirming it or setting it aside, according to

the proof laid before it. If the decree-holder have already taken steps to

enforce the decree, doubtless the Court so appointed would in a proper

case stay its hand pending the investigation. Considering how often in our

Courts litigants who have rushed into Court upon the impulse of some

grievance adjust their differences before the trial day or arrive at a friendly

compromise, and consent to a decree on terms agreed upon, I think there

would be a manifest danger in enabling a party who shortly repents of his

agreement to begin an action to have the decree set aside on the ground

that he was deceived into consenting, or consented under a mistake,

without any guarantee that there is a reasonable ground for the

complaint.

Grenier A. J., said,

I agree with the rest of the Court that this appeal must be dismissed

with costs. I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of my

brothers, and there is little that I can add to what they have held in regard

to the remedy of restitution as it is understood in the Roman-Dutch Law

42 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

and as it has been recognized by our Courts. It is a very wholesome rule,

and one that has been consistently followed, that the Supreme Court

should be first approached upon proper materials and a prima facie case

made out before any reference is made to the lower Court which passed

the decree complained of.

The policy of the Roman Dutch Law, as I have always understood it, never

encouraged a procedure of this kind, and that is the reason why the

remedy known as restitutio in integrum was made available to a litigant in

certain circumstances where the ordinary Courts were powerless to

relieve.

The above dicta also show, with respect, the doubts that existed on the very

nature and scope of the remedy in the early days of the last (20th) century. The

last two quotations amply demonstrate, it is submitted, that, the remedy was

understood as a power especially delegated by the sovereign to the court which

exercised it; and as Grenier A. J., specifically referred to, a policy of limiting

the remedy to one of last resort where the ordinary courts were powerless to

relive was mentioned. However, unfortunately, no authority was cited for this

alleged policy in Roman Dutch Law, except, that, it could have been taken for

granted, as an off shoot of the origin of the remedy on the authority of the

sovereign. So were English writs.

(v) Sabapathy vs. Dunlop 37 NLR 113

This case decided in 1935 referred to fear and surprise. As the perusal of this

judgment further would show, a learned writer had devoted a one whole chapter

for restitutio in integrum on fear or metus7.

Akbar S. P. J., held, that,

7 Hommage Berthold Kupisch, In Integrum Restitutio under Classical Roman Law, Particularly on the Ground of Metus, and Berthold Kupisch, Jeroen Chorus * Universit de Leiden

43 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

Where an action has been adjusted by agreement or compromise under

section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code, the Supreme Court has power to

set aside, by way of restitution or revision, a judgment entered in terms of

the section, on the ground of fear or mistake.

A threat from a Judge to dismiss a plaintiff's case unless he agreed to the

terms of settlement would amount to fear.

Hence it was, in that case, coercion allegedly exerted by a Judge.

Neither Akbar S. P. J., nor Koch A. J., (both of whom wrote separate judgments

in that case) did not find that there was coercion by the learned Judge. But Koch

A. J., in a word of caution said,

This case conspicuously manifests the danger of Judges participating in

the discussion of terms of settlement and taking too active a part in

seeking to bring about a compromise. The terms of settlement should be

left entirely to the parties and their legal advisers who know best, or else

there always will remain the possibility of remarks or observations coming

from the Judge in the course of the discussion being misunderstood and

wrong interpretations put thereon.

The basic duty of a judge is to hear and decide.

Although the remedy of restitutio was not granted, both the learned judges made

valuable observations in regard to the scope of the remedy as expressed by

learned Dutch text writers.

Akbar S. P. J., said,

The application to set aside the order of settlement has been made in

the alternative either by way of the revisionary powers of this Court or by

way of restitutio in integrum. In my opinion this Court has the power to

set aside the order either by way of restitution or revision, if good grounds

are shown for the interference of this Court.

In Voet, bk. IV., tit. 6, c l. 17 (Sampson's Trans, p. 105) there is the

following passage :-

" Further if a particular judgment has been consented to by the

parties to the suit, as it will not then be improper for the judge to

decide according to the wish of the parties, without further hearing,

so if the judgment is given by a Court of not supreme jurisdiction,

there is no reason why restitution should not be allowed against it,

if grave prejudice is shown to have been incurred by it. For if

restitution is applicable against mutual agreements because of

laesio enormis, and the authority of a matter decided by a judge of

not supreme jurisdiction is not so great as to put a stop to relief by

restitution should a just cause of restitution appear, even in cases

in which the judgment has been given after the fullest

consideration; it follows that, whether we regard the agreement

of the parties or the authority of a judgment, it cannot be said

that restitution would in that case be inequitable. And it

supports this, that appeals from such a judgment are nowadays

allowed."

His Lordship further said,

Mr. Perera quoted Voet, bk. IV., tit. 1, cl. 26, and argued that the only

just grounds for restitution were fear, fraud, minority, &c, enumerated in

the clause and that fear meant fear caused by present or future danger of

a substanial evil which would exclude all notion of consent and vitiate the

agreement ab. initio. He argued that if the fear was of a conditional nature,

i.e., some threatened harm, this did not exclude all notion of consent and

made the agreement only voidable. He further quoted Voet, bk. IV., tit. 2,

cl. 11-14, to show that the fear to be adequate must be of the first kind. I

cannot agree with him that unless the fear is of the first kind we have no

45 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

jurisdiction to entertain the application. For one thing there is the passage

I have quoted above from bk. IV., tit. 6, cl. 17, which states that if it can

be shown that grave prejudice had been incurred by a consent judgment

of a Court of not supreme jurisdiction, there is no reason why restitution

should not be allowed (see also 2 Kotze, p. 341). According to Voet, bk. IV.,

tit. 2, cl. 10, all that is required is that the fear should be caused by

something done illegally, even by a Magistrate. Supposing in this case it

was proved that the Judge directly threatened to dismiss plaintiff's claim

in 1,635 unless he signed the terms of settlement. Mr. Perera, further

urged that surprise was not a valid ground for an application by way

of restitution. Here too I cannot agree, for according to the passage

from Voet, bk. IV., tit. 6, cl. 17, if grave prejudice has been caused to

the applicant through any cause whatever8, there is no reason why

restitution should not be allowed. This point is, as pointed out by my

brother, covered by the obiter dictum of Bertram C.J. in Fernando v.

Singhoris Appu[1 26 N. L. R. 469], in which he mentions any equitable

ground such as mistake or surprise as being sufficient. The only

difference between that case and the one before us is that here the

petitioner alleged the conduct and act of the trial Judge himself as

constituting the surprise which would entitle him to a rescission of the

agreement.

Koch A. J., said,

Van Leeuwen in his Commentaries in vol. II (2nd ed.), p. 338, referring to

obligations, says that where fraud, bad faith or impropriety exists, the debitor

will have his remedy against it by restitution and will be restored, upon request

to the supreme authority, to his former position.

In this case decided in 1939 Soertsz J., held, that,

The Supreme Court has no power to revise or review a case decided by

itself.

Relief by way of restitution on the ground of Justus error will not be

granted to a party who has failed to place before the Court matter, which

was at his command, if reasonable diligence had been exercised.

In order to succeed in an application for restitution the petitioner must

show that the fact was not merely material but of such vital and essential

materiality that it must have altered the whole aspect of the case.

The learned Judge tracing the then recent history of the remedy said,

It is true that at one time the question was raised whether restitutio in

integrum could be properly held to form part of the law of Ceylon in the

absence from the Courts Ordinance and the Code of Civil Procedure of any

provision enabling the Supreme Court to grant relief by way of restitutio

in integrum, and in view of the power of revision enjoyed by the Supreme

Court. But in Abeyesekere v. Haramanis Appu [2 14 N. L. R. .353.] it was

held by Wood Renton and Grenier JJ. that the remedy of restitutio in

integrum is one which has taken deep root in the practice and procedure

of our Courts and that it is too late that this remedy ought no longer to be

recognized.

The learned Soertsz J., in an attempt to enumerate the instances in which the

remedy will be available (according to Johannes Voet) said,

I, therefore, address myself to the present petition only to consider the

application for restitutio in integrum. Now, in the words of Voet " resti-tutio

in integrum is extraordinarium remedium, not to be given, (a) where there

is some other remedy available to the person seeking restitutio. Sed nee

tune plerumque restitutioni locus datur, cum alind ordinarium aeque

pingue ad indemnitatem remedium a jure comparatum est; (b) It is not to

47 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

be given for the mere asking non tamen cuivis restitutionem petente,

causamque alleganti, ea promiscue concedenda est, sed causa demum

cognita, an nempe vera an justa, an satis gravis sit; (c) It is not to be given

unless it is sought within a certain period. Nee omni tempore ad

restitutionis remedium patet aditus ". In regard to (b) Voet goes on to say

that " causae justae restitutionis sunt, metus, dolus, minor, aetas, capitis,

diminutio, absentia, alienatio judicii mutandi causa, Justus error". In

addition to these, the discovery of fresh evidence, res noviter veniens ad

notitiam is recognized as a good ground for giving this relief provided, of

course, it is evidence which no reasonable diligence would have helped to

disclose earlier. (Voet IV. 1, passim.)

So far as the present application is concerned, Counsel for the respondent

takes no objection to it on the ground either that there is some other

remedy available to the petitioner or on the ground that the application is

not made within reasonable time. But, he contends that the mistake which

the petitioner relies on is not such a mistake as falls within the meaning

of Justus error. He says that the mistake referred to was a mistake which

would not have occurred if the petitioner had presented his case with due

care, and also that the petitioner is not in a position to show that but for

the mistake the Judge who heard the appeal could not but have reached

a conclusion in his favour.

In conclusion His lordship said,

But for the petitioners to succeed in an application for restitutio in integrum

they must show that the fact was not merely material but of such vital and

essential materiality that it must have altered the whole aspect of the case.

(vii) Perera vs. Don Simon 62 NLR 118

In this case decided in 1958, Sansoni J., (later Chief Justice) held, that,

48 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

An application for Restitutio in integrum cannot be made in a partition

action

Nor would Restitutio be granted where there has been negligence or delay

on the part of the petitioner.

But presently, in the Court of Appeal restitutio is granted in partition cases and

some years ago, in the recent past, it was so confined to partition actions, that

some would have taken for granted that it is available only in partition actions

but not in other actions before original courts, including commercial, civil and

criminal high courts. This also shows, together with the above discussion,

that, the enumerations attempted to say that restitutio is available for that

or no other are mere rules of practice as emanated from time to time,

which, if one considers the last 127 years (from 1898) was in a state of flux.

Although Soertsz J., said in the above case, that, The Supreme Court has no

power to revise or review a case decided by itself (in exercising restitutio) as it

would be seen below in detail, Dias S. P. J., in 1951 did the very same thing,

setting aside the judgment of the Supreme Court on exercising restitutio in

integrum.

In the case under consideration, Sansoni J., said,

Restitutio in integrum can be claimed on the ground of justus error,

which I understand to connote reasonable or excusable error.

In the realm of contract law, a justus error refers to a reasonable mistake

made by one of the parties involved in an agreement. In the South African

case of African Information Technology Bridge 1 (Pty) Ltd v. the MEC for

Infrastructure Development the case centered around tenders. The

Gauteng Department of Transport and Public Works entered into tenders

with a bidder. The bidder, African Information Technology Bridge 1 (Pty)

Ltd (formerly known as Crestwell Trading 9 (Pty) Ltd), had undergone a

name change. Despite the name change, certain company details

submitted with the bid were those of another relevant company, African

Bridge. The mistake in the identity of the contracting party was

fundamental and constituted a material and justus error, resulting in the

tenders being invalid and unenforceable9. It means a reasonable

mistake.

(viii) Menchinahamy vs. Muniweera 52 NLR 409

Now, this case, decided in 1950 by Dias S. P. J., was in regard to a partition

action from the District Court of Tangalla10. The reader will recall, that just 08

years later Sansoni J., would say that it is not available in partition cases, which

is, with the greatest of respect, (Chief Justice Melanie Claude Sansoni was once

the District Judge of Tangalla) not the case in several restitutio applications up

to the present.

Dias S. P. J., has also said, that, it is (i) an extraordinary remedy (as seen above

under (vi) based on Voet but Dias S. P. J., did not cite an authority for this

proposition). (ii) it is available only to a party to a contract (Perera v.

Wijewickreme 1[(1912) 15 N. L. R. at p. 413.] and Perera v. Simeon Appuhamy

2[ (1923) 2 T. L. R. at p. 119.] and (iii) the remedy must be sought with utmost

promptitude (based on Babun Appu v. Simeon Appu [ (1907) 11 N. L. R. at p.

45).

(ix) Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited vs. Shanmugam and another

1995 (1) SLR 55

In this case decided in the Court of Appeal in 1995, Dr. R. B. Ranaraja J., among

other things said, that,

Under Roman Law, the remedy of restitutio in integrum was the removal

of a disadvantage in law which had legally occurred. It was a protection

against injustice (as distinguished from an action against injustice)

9 ttps://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a9b444e7-05b4-4665-8656-3f9984157fb2 10 This Court was gazetted in 1834 as Tangalla not Tangalle

which was rendered necessary on account of practical impossibility

of taking legally, in advance, all the circumstances that in reality may

occur. The remedy was granted by the Praetor who himself conducted the

proceeding in which judicium rescindens might ultimately be granted.

Abeysekera v. Haramanis Appu (1). The remedy was received into Roman

Dutch Law in wider form, where restitutio in integrum was primarily

intended for relief from contracts on the ground of minority, error, fraud

and duress. Relief by way of restitutio in integrum was also granted from

the effect of an order in judicial proceedings. Phipps v. Bracegyrdle (2).

Vander Linden groups cases when relief could be obtained under two

heads. (a) Relief relating to the original matter itself (substantial relief);

relieving a party from any act or contract and replacing him in his former

situation on the ground of his having been induced through fear, fraud,

minority, error, absence or other sufficient reasons to do the act against

which he prays relief. (b) Relief relating merely-to some omission or error

in the process of pleading, (judicial relief).

His lordship further said,

In this country the remedy of restitutio in integrum was recognised as a

mode of relief as far back as the time of Sir Charles Marshall11, and has

taken deep root in the practice and procedure of our courts. (Abeysekera -

supra). At present, Article 138(1) of the Constitution has vested this court

11 Sir Charles Marshall (1788 5 February 1873) was the sixth Chief Justice of Ceylon. Marshall was the only son of Sergeant Marshall, a lawyer, and was educated at Westminster School. He matriculated at Jesus College, Cambridge in 1806, graduating B.A. in 1810, and M.A. in 1814. He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1815. Marshall was knighted in 1832 and appointed Chief Justice of Ceylon on 18 February 1833, succeeding Richard Ottley. In 1835 he fought a duel with Sir John Wilson, in command of British troops in Ceylon, which took place in the Cinnamon Gardens, Colombo, once a plantation. He held the position until his resignation on 3 March 1836, when he was succeeded by William Norris.

with sole and exclusive jurisdiction to grant relief by way of restitutio in

integrum.

To say that The power of this court to grant such relief is a matter of grace and

discretion, his lordship referred to Usoof v. Nadarajah Chettiar 61 NLR 173.

Usoof vs. Nadarajah Chettiar was a case decided in 1958 by H. N. G. Fernando

J., (later Chief Justice). In pronouncing that restitutio is a matter of grace, His

lordship referred to Burge, which Wood Renton J., cited in Abeysekera vs.

Haramanis Appu 1911. The court said,

Burge refers to the proceeding as an action to undo what legally had

been done but emphasizes that the granting of such relief could not be

claimed as a matter of right but was an act of grace in the exercise of

the Royal Prerogative Wood Renton, J. cites a number of earlier cases in

Ceylon and reaches the conclusion that in the then state of the law it was

too late for a bench of two Judges or probably even for the Full Court to

hold that the remedy of restitution ought no longer to be recognised, and

he laid down what seemed to him to be the appropriate procedure to be

followed in the case of an application to the Supreme Court for restitution.

Before the end of his lordships judgment, Fernando J., used the word grace

twice more, without the term Royal Prerogative. It is unfortunate, that, the

primary, secondary, tertiary and Quaternary references readily took the word

grace without the term Royal Prerogative. The remedy being in its origin and

for most part of its evolution being one of Royal Prerogative supports the

argument of this Court in due course, that, restitutio in integrum extends as a

remedy in public law.

The case of Abeysekera vs. Haramanis Appu 1911, 14 NLR 353 a decision

of Wood Renton J., was considered in the case referred to in (vi) above and

also in Usoof vs. Nadarajah Chettiar 1958 61 NLR 173 decided by H. N. G.

Fernando J.

52 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

It appears, to this Court, that, one of the most important cases in which

the history of the remedy of restitutio in integrum was considered was the

above case of Abeysekera vs. Haramanis Appu 1911. The decision in that case

would have been more complete, however, if the petitioner in the application that

arose from C. R. Nuwara Eliya, 4,703 was diligent in prosecuting his case. As

per the judgment in Haramanis even a Full Bench was established to hear and

decide three questions referred to in that case. But when the case was called

there was no appearance in support of the application and it was dismissed with

costs. Anyway Wood Renton J., in Haramanis set down those questions as

follows,

(1) Is it too late to raise the question as to whether or not restitutio in

integrum can properly be held to form part of the law of the Colony?

(2) If that question should be answered in the negative, can the Roman-

Dutch remedy of restitutio in integrum be regarded as part of the law of

Ceylon, in view of (a) the absence from the Courts Ordinance and the Code

of Civil Procedure of any provision enabling the Supreme Court to grant

relief by way of restitutio in integrum (b) the powers of revision enjoyed by

the Supreme Court; and further, (c) decisions to the effect that an action

to set aside a judgment on the ground of fraud or mistake can be brought

in the Court which pronounced that judgment?

(3) If the remedy of restitutio in integrum still survives in Ceylon, what

ought the practice to be in regard to (a) the bringing of applications for

such relief before the Court (i.e. whether ex parte or upon notice), and (b)

the nature of the reference by the Supreme Court to the court of first

instance, that is to say, ought the Supreme Court to leave the decision, on

the matters referred, to the court of first instance, or to require that any

decision at which that Court may arrive should be subject to its own

sanction?

53 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

However before considering those questions Wood Renton J., considered the

history of the remedy of restitution which is referred to in detail in Haramanis

case which is referred to below in point form.

(i) Under the civil law, where a person suffered a legal prejudice by the

operation of law, the prtor having personally inquired into the matter

(causae cognitio) in the exercise of his imperium, which enabled him to

consider all the actual facts of the case, might issue a decree re-

establishing the original legal position, that is to say, replacing the

person injured in his previous condition.

(ii) In Roman law restitutio in integrum was the removal of a disadvantage

in law which had legally occurred. It was a protection against justice (as

distinguished from an action against injustice), which was rendered

necessary on account of the practical impossibility of taking legally, in

advance, all the circumstances into consideration that in reality may

occur. (Sohm's Institutes of Roman Law, s. 56, 111, Burge, 2nd ed., vol.

4, chap. 1.)

(iii) The restitution thus granted by the praetor in jure was then followed by

the judicium rescissorium, that is, the trial and decision of the action

which had been thus restored. The judicium rescindens itself, i.e., the

proceeding which resulted in the restitution, was invariably conducted

and concluded by the praetor himself.

(iv) In Roman law restitutio in integrum was divided into two classes, (i)

restitutio minorum (under 25 years of age) and (ii) restitutio majorum

(25 years and upwards), in cases of absentia, metus, dolus, and error.

(v) The remedy was received into the Roman-Dutch law in a wider form.

(vi) Restitutio was not only granted to minors. It might be granted to any

one, either in toto, on the grounds of metus, dolus, absentia, and

minority, or partially, on the ground that the damage suffered exceeded

the value of what was obtained through the transaction by half (ob

laesionem enormem). Van der Linden gives as additional grounds for

54 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

partial restitution absence and error, and further, all such equitable

reasons as rendered it unjust that the act should remain in existence.

(vii) In 1562, by Octroy12 of Philip II13, the kinds of relief which might be

granted were classified into two, viz., relief granted against material

rights which had once been established (material relief), and relief by

undoing legal proceedings which had once become res judicata and

against which no further appeal lay (formal or processual relief). It was

at the same time provided that such formal relief should be granted by

the Judge of (or Court of Appeal) van Holland.

(viii) After the eighty years' war between Spain and the Northern Provinces of

the Netherlands had broken out, and the Council of Mechlin had ceased

to exercise jurisdiction in those Provinces, the States of Holland, by

resolution of May 8, 1573, granted the right to rescind contracts to the

same Hof van Holland, and after the creation of a Supreme Court (Hooge

Raad, 1582) to that high tribunal. In 1795, after the abolition of the

Supreme Court, it came back to the Hof van Holland.

(ix) Though the Supreme Court granted letters of relief, it did not investigate

cases. These were sent by a committimus to the ordinary judge of first

instance, who investigated them and granted or rejected the petition,

and his decision then received the sanction of the Supreme Court. [This

has the combined effect of certiorari bring the record to see and

procedendo proceed to judgment] [The term writ too originated in a

writing addressed to (often) an inferior court. Here the reference is to a

letter]

12 octroy (third-person singular simple present octroys, present participle octroying, simple past and past participle octroyed) To grant (a privilege etc, by a government etc). 13 Philip II[note 1] (21 May 1527 13 September 1598), also known as Philip the Prudent (Spanish: Felipe el Prudente), was King of Spain[note 2] from 1556, King of Portugal from 1580, and King of Naples and Sicily from 1554 until his death in 1598. He was also jure uxoris King of England and Ireland from his marriage to Queen Mary I in 1554 until her death in 1558.[1] He was also Duke of Milan from 1540.[2] From 1555, he was Lord of the Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands Deeply devout, Philip saw himself as the defender of Catholic Europe against the Ottoman Empire and the Protestant Reformation.

(x) In Ceylon, as far back as the time of Sir Charles Marshall, restitutio in

integrum was recognized as a mode of relief against fraud, and also as

a means of setting aside the process of parate execution by which

in certain specified cases, for example, the recovery by Fiscals of

the purchase money of sales in execution, or due to auctioneers,

the previous stages of an ordinary suit at law were dispensed with,

and the creditor was at once entitled to seize in execution the

person or property of his debtor in satisfaction of his debt.

(xi) There was considerable controversy at that time as to whether the power

of granting restitution was vested in the Supreme Court alone or in the

District Court. [During those early days, the only inferior court to the

Supreme Court of Ceylon, in civil litigation was the District Courts, first

established under the Charter of Justice of 1833 A. D.]

(xii) Here Wood Renton J., examined the following cases, to wit;

(a) D. C. Matale, 1,1742 ((1836) Morgan, Beling, Conderlaag, and Prins,

82.) it is indicated that restitutio in integrum is a remedy to be sought

through " the Sovereign in Council," which, I suppose, means the

Privy Council in England. [With respect to Wood Renton J., as it will

be explained below according to the article of Jerold Taitz the

Sovereign in Council was the Emperor [Imperato] of Rome who often

delegated this power of the Royal Prerogative to the Preator]

(b) In Obeysekere v. Gunasekera3 ((1884) 6 S. C. C. 102) it was held in

appeal by Clarence J. that the District Court had jursidiction to set

aside a judgment obtained by fraud, but that the application ought

to be made in a separate suit.

(c) In ex parte Gordon,4 ((1879) 2 S. C. C. 108) Phear CJ. and Stewart

and Dias JJ. held that error, res noviter veniens, or fraud can be

raised in revision.

(d) In Perera v. Ekanayake,5 ((1897) 3 N. L. R. 21) Withers J. and Browne

J. held that a judgment obtained by fraud or passed under mistake

might be set aside either by a regular action or possibly by way of

summary procedure as regulated by the Civil Procedure Code, and

that this cannot be done by mere motion supported by affidavits with

notice to the decree-holder.

(e) In Stork v. Orchard,6 ((1893) 2 S. C. R. 1) Mr. Justice Lawrie, then

Acting Chief Justice, held that the remedy of restitutio in integrum

was available in all cases where a contract can be shown to have

proceeded on total misconception.

(f) In Gunaratne v, Dingiri Banda,7 ((1898 & 1899) 4 N. L. R, 249,)Sir

John Bonser C.J., with whom Withers J. concurred, held that the

proper remedy, where the consent of a party to a case instituted in

the District Court was obtained by fraud and so judgment obtained,

was to apply to the Supreme Court for an order on the Court below

to review the impugned judgment and to confirm or rescind it.

(g) [The learned Judge referred to Sinnatamby vs. Nallatamby referred to

in (iv) above].

(h) In Silindu v. Akura,2 ((1904) 7. N. L.R. 296) Wendt J. and Middleton

J. held that on proper materials laid before the Supreme Court by a

party who desires to be relieved of a decree which had been

improperly obtained against hint, it will upon an ex parte application

by such party direct the Court which passed the decree to hear all

necessary parties and determine whether the petitioner is entitled to

be relieved from the said decree and be restored to his rights as

existing prior to the decree.

(i) In the case of Dodwell Carlill & Co., v. Rawter,3 ((1899) 1 Tam. 18) to

which Mr. Tambyah as amicus curiae has kindly called my attention

in the course of this judgment, it was held that, when any other

57 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

remedy is open to a party, the extraordinary one of restitutio in

integrum cannot be granted.

(j) My attention has also been called by Mr. Tambyah to the case of

Buyzer v. Eckcrt,4 ((1910) 13 N.L.R.371;2 Cur. L.R.200) decided by

my brother Middleton and myself, where we held that where fraud is

averred against a judgment, such judgment may be set aside by

restitutio in integrum, or by a suit in the Court which passed the

original decree. I may myself have acted on the law as laid down by

Sir John Bonser C.J. and Withers J. in Gunaratne v. Dingiri Banda

and by the Full Court in Sinnatamby v. Nallatamby, and in other

cases which have not been reported; It might well have been found

too late even for the Full Court, and it is certainly too late for a Bench

of two judges, in the slate of the law as I have outlined it above, to

hold that the remedy of restitutio in integrum ought no longer to be

recognized.

The judgment has the following addendum at the end,

The Supreme Court of Ceylon is indebted to the Registrar of the

Supreme Court of British Guiana14 for the following communication

regarding the practice prevailing in that Colony re applications for

restitutio in integrum: -

1. Restitutio in integrum, is still part of the law of British Guiana.

2. It depends on the common law and not on statute.

3. The remedy is sought by action, and not by application ex parte

or otherwise.

14 British Guiana was a British colony, part of the mainland British West Indies, which resides on the northern coast of South America. Since 1966 it has been known as the independent nation of Guyana.[2]

4. The court of trial is left to adjudicate on the claim, and any

adjudication at which it may arrive does not require the sanction of

the Supreme Court.

[In the presentation of points elucidated in Haramanis case, the

comments within square brackets [ ] were added in this judgment]

From and after 07th September 1978, the remedy is embodied in Article 138(1)

of the Constitution.

The jurisdiction under Article 138(1) of the Constitution:

The Constitution is the Grundnorm. In applying the law on the directions set by

the Preamble to the Constitution, which not only refers to JUSTICE but also to

the ingredients of Rule of Law, convenience must yield to justice. The words in

the Preamble makes it impossible for a Court to do the vice versa, that is, to give

in to convenience at the expense of justice. There are no fetters imposed on

restitutio in integrum by Article 138(1) of the Constitution. That Article

envisages,

(i) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution,

(ii) Subject to the provisions of any law

(iii) an appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law

and

(iv) sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio

in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and

things

There is no question, with respect, of the interpretation of this provision here.

There is no doubt whether it means A or B. There is no impediment in law in its

direct application. This Article describes the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

Despite the side note in the very next Article, Article 139(1) saying powers in

appeal, the body of the article refers to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the

Court of Appeal. Hence the exercise of the power of restitutio in integrum must

59 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

also be done according to law. The term law is defined in Article 170. There

is no statute on restitutio in integrum. There is a direct affinity between subject

toany law in Article 138(1) and according to law in Article 139(1). Hence, in

the above (i) to (iv), if (ii) subject to the provisions of any law, is not available,

then, what is applicable is (i), which is subject to the provisions of the

Constitution. Hence, restitutio in integrum must be applied under the

Constitution in its purest form. That is the power of Royal Prerogative

delegated by the Emperor to the Preator.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd defendant, apart from the above,

raised a novel position at the oral hearing.

He said, that, the remedy of restitutio is not there to correct injustice, but it is

available when the judgment, order, decision or even a contract itself is true and

correct; in other words, not when the judgment, etc., creates injustice, but when

it is just; but when it practically creates a disadvantageous situation.

He said that if the order is palpably wrong, as the petitioner alleges, then, the

remedy is not RII but an appeal. He called the present application an appeal

clothed in the garb of RII.

The answer to the above by this Court is as follows,

In the article Two unusual appellate remedies: revision and restitutio in

integrum in the law of Sri Lanka Jerold Taitz15 Senior Lecturer Faculty of

Law University of Cape Town and Attorney of the Supreme Court of South Africa

says that

Restitutio in Integrum originated in Roman law through the imperium

(supreme judicial powers) delegated to the praetors after the expulsion of the

kings. It has been described as the judicial termination of the inequitable

situation (created by the law per se) and the restoration of the status quo

15 https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA00104051_856

60 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

Restitutio in Integrum was used as a form of appeal against a valid

judgment or magisterial order made in terms of the law and which

caused inequitable loss or injury to a party. Cicero refers to the rescission

of a number of judgments originally granted by Verres as governor of Sicily.

The judgments were rescinded by his successor Metullus on account of

their having been founded initially on incorrect premises of law. A further

ground was that no proper trial had taken place as the court had not been

properly constituted. The following example of restitutio in integrum being

used as an appellate remedy is given by Engelsman. The praetor set aside a

decision on account of an error in the formula. It would appear that

although the formula was framed correctly in terms of the contentions

of the parties it contained an error which could have led only to a wrong

decision. [This is a question of jurisdiction or a jurisdictional question, a wrong

answer for which affects the jurisdiction of the Tribunal] An aggrieved party

had locus standi and could apply directly to the praetor for relief. The

intercession of an official was unnecessary in regard to restitutio in integrum.

The remedy was wide and could be invoked in a number of situations. For

example it could be granted to creditors who suffered loss resulting from the

debtor undergoing capitis diminutio minima. This form of legal disability

extinguished all the contractual debts of the affected party. By virtue of the

remedy the praetor restored the rights of action to creditors. The power to

grant restitutio in integrum was also held by the emperor. He used the

remedy inter alia to set aside administrative decisions [This is

administrative justice] eg. To pardon Roman citizens who had been

deported (deportio in insulam). As a result of the pardon the citizen was

restored to his patria potestas and was said to be restitutus in integrum.

[The parts within [ ] Square brackets added in this judgment]

Therefore at the commencement too it was a basic remedy that covers the public

as well as the private law including criminal law. It is the judicial termination

of the inequitable situation (created by the law per se). What are these

61 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

inequitable situations created by law per se have been analyzed by me

elsewhere. [in a published order].

(5) The Bold16 Facts:

The third and final part of this order will deal with the allegation of the petitioner,

that the order is palpably wrong, coupled with the further allegations made in

the synopsis, that, it is ex facie wrong, null and void, has inflicted a wrong on

the petitioner which warrants a remedy, detrimental to the interests of SLFP (Sri

Lanka Freedom Party) and to the public of Sri Lanka (particularly in an year

when elections are scheduled to be held) and the time taken to set aside the

enjoining order in the District Court is unreasonable.

This Court, in the first part of this order analysed the proposition that an affected

party by an order made behind his back must first go to the court that made the

order and dissected it to its underlying policy and principle with a touch of the

jurisprudential basis.

This Court is not exercising appellate jurisdiction. Hence it does not consider the

merits of that order as done in an appeal. But it is the decision of this Court,

that, it has jurisdiction to invoke the powers of restitutio in integrum and

revision, provided that, the order is so wrong, palpably wrong; and had created

a situation of blatant injustice.

There was such blatant injustice in Aussie Oats case two years ago, but there

too the petitioner went to the original court; he tried his best to tell that court

that its order of refixing the supporting of his motion for a date after about two

weeks creates such injustice. But the court again delayed hearing him. The

repercussions of that delay were referred to above. So he came to this Court.

16 The word used in the sense of decisive or paramount.

62 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

Actually he had no other remedy; in the sense of expeditious and effective remedy

than RII. This is not to limit, as certain past judgments had imposed fetters on

RII, or to say, that, RII is available when there is no remedy at all. No, RII is

available when it is the appropriate remedy and when justice demands that

its power be invoked. For this purpose; and to ascertain this, the factual

dispute will now be considered.

As the petitioner describes in the synopsis filed on his behalf, the following are

the facts,

FACTS IN BRIEF

16. Hon. Maithripala Sirisena functioned as the Chairman/Leader of the party

from January 2015 to 4th April 2024 without objection.

17. He functioned as the Chairman/Leader from January 2015 to November

2019 on the ground that he was the president of the country.

18. He functioned as Chairman/Leader of the party from November 2019 to April

2024 for the reason that he was elected by the "Vidhayake Sabhawa"

19. Maithripala Sirisena was restrained by an enjoining order from functioning

as the Chairman/Leader of the SLFP from 4.4.2024.

20. The Plaintiffs in the case has claimed that there was a meeting of the

"Deshapalana Mandalaya" on the 8.4.2024; vide paragraph 9.

21. They state that there were 6 members of the Deshapalana Mandalaya, that

is the three plaintiffs and Honourable Nimal Siripala de Silva, Faiser Mustapha

and Hon. Weerakumara Dissanavake [Reply -This is ex facie incorrect because

the Three Plaintiffs are not members of the Deshapalana Mandalaya]

22. Documents P4[1] to P4[14] set out the members of the Deshapalana

Mandalaya and their letters of appointment.

23. There are 14 because the 15th is ex officio the Chairman/Leader of the SLFP

63 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

24. The plaintiffs themselves have filed at page 67 of the documents filed by the

Plaintiff, the attendance sheet of the Deshapalana Mandalaya on 31.3.2024

25. This document is attached for the ready reference of court.

26. Clearly the 3 Plaintiffs were not members of the Deshapalana Mandalaya

even according to the plaintiffs.

27. Thus

(a) There was no meeting of the Deshapalana mandalaya on 7th April

(b) Only 3 members met, namely Hon. Nimal Sirilapala de Silva, Hon.

Weerakumara Dissanayaka and Faiszer Mustapha.

28. In the circumstances

a. There was no meeting of the Deshapalana Mandalaya

b. Only 3 persons participated.

29. On 19.4.2024 the secretary was requested to convene a meeting of the

Deshapalana Mandalaya by 10 members of the Deshapalana Mandalaya

30. The secretary convened a meeting of the Deshapalana Mandalaya on the

20.4.2024

31. 11 members of the Deshapalana Mandalaya were present.

32. The members absent were Hon. Maithripala Sirisena who had been

restrained by an enjoining order, Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva, Hon. Weerakumar

Dissanakaya and Faiszer Mustapha

33. The aforesaid 11 members of the Deshapalana Mandalaya unanimously

decided to request the secretary of the party to convene a meeting of the

Vidhayaka Sabhawa

34. In deference to the aforesaid decision the secretary convened a meeting of

the Vidhayaka Sabhawa on 21.4.2024.

64 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

35. Not one single member of the Vidhayaka Sabhawa have denied the receipt of

notice of the meeting (not even the plaintiffs or Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva]

36. There was a meeting of the Vidhayake Sabhawa on 21.4.2024

37. 119 members of the Vidhayaka Sabhawa were present in person [vide

Minutes P11]

38. Those 119 members unanimously decided that the Hon. Wijedasa Rajapakse

function as the acting Chairman.

39. Thereafter further 22 members have stated that they were unable to be

physically present at the meeting but have ratified the decision [P12(0]-P12[xxil)

40. In the aforesaid circumstances in brief

(i) 3 members of the politburo elected Hon. Nimal Siripala [de Silva]

(ii) No meeting was convened

(iii)10 members of the polit bureau requested the secretary to convene a

meeting of the Deshapalana Mandalaya

(iv)The secretary did so

(v) The meeting of the Deshapalana Mandalaya was held on 20.4.2020.

(vi) 11 members were present who unanimously requested the secretary to

convene a meeting of the Vidhayaka Sabhawa

(vii) The meeting of the Vidhayaka Sabhawa was held on 21.4.2024 and 119

members were physically present and unanimously decided that Hon.

Wijeyadasa Rajapakse function as the acting chairman.

(viii) Therefore 141 members of the Vidhayaka Sabhawa have approved the

appointment of Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakse

(ix) More members of the Vidhayaka Sabhawa have ratified this resolution

but due to lack of time these documents have not been filed.

65 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

(x) Therefore at least 141 out of 246 members of the Vidhayaka Sabhawa

have ratified the appointment of Hon. Wijeyadasa Rajapakse as the acting

Chairman/Leader of the SLFP.

At the commencement of oral submissions, the learned Presidents Counsel for

the petitioner referred the attention of this Court to,

(i) Clause 16 of the Constitution of SLFP Deshapalana Mandalaya and

to

(ii) Clauses 11 and 12 thereof Vidhayaka Sabhawa and its powers and

responsibilities

The learned Presidents Counsel submitted, that,

(a) The position of the plaintiffs in this case is that on 08.04.2024 a meeting of

the Deshapalana Mandalaya elected the 02nd defendant as the Acting

leader

(b) Deshapalana Mandalaya has no authority to elect acting leader or leader

The synopsis filed on behalf of the petitioner states, that,

(i) The Vidhayaka Sabhawa includes (a) all sitting members of the SLFP

(b) Organisers and (b) representatives of various committees

(ii) Thus the Vidhayaka Sabhawa is the core of the SLFP

(iii) Its powers are set out in clause 12

(iv) Clause 12(ii) sets out the way in which the Chairman/Leader has to be

elected

(v) Hence it is the Vidhayaka Sabhawa that can elect the Chairman/Leader

(vi) Therefore the acting Chairman/Leader must be elected by the Vidhayaka

Sabhawa

(vii) Deshapalana Mandalaya has no power to elect Chairman/Leader

(viii) Clause 16 sets out its powers

(ix) Clause 33 is casus ommisus

(x) Deshapalana Mandalaya can decide unforeseen situations

66 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

(xi) However the Deshapalana Mandalaya on 20.04.2024 at a meeting

convened by the secretary at which 11 members of the Deshapalana

Mandalaya decided to convene a meeting of the Vidhayaka Sabhawa to

elect an Acting Chairman/Leader (paragraph 56 of the synopsis).

(xii) Whatever wording is there in clause 16 of the Constitution it does not

and cannot take away the express power of the Vidhayaka Sabhawa set

out in clause 12[1](ii)(Ee [4th letter of Sinhala Alphabet] to elect the

leader. (paragraph 58 of the synopsis).

(xiii) The word[s] Uththareethara or Avasanathmaka.in clause 16[i] and

16[ii] cannot take away the express power of the Vidhayaka Sabhawa in

terms of 12[1](ii)( Ee [4th letter of Sinhala Alphabet]. (paragraph 59 of

the synopsis).

(xiv) Clause 16 only prescribes at most a particular status but does not give

a power to act contrary to the constitution

(xv) In any event, the Deshapalana Mandalaya itself requested the secretary

to convene a meeting of the Vidhayaka Sabhawa

(xvi) That is the decision of the Deshapalana Mandalaya

(xvii) It is submitted that the purported meeting of the Hon. Nimal Siripala

de Silva, Hon. Weerakumara Dissanayake and Faiser Musthapha and

the 3 plaintiffs cannot and do not constitute a meeting of the

Deshapalana Mandalaya. (paragraph 63 of the synopsis).

The gist of the petitioners submission, therefore, is, that,

(a) The Deshapalana Mandalaya has no power to elect a Chairman/Leader

or acting Chairman/Leader

(b) Its purported meeting on 08th April is not a valid meeting due to the

reasons enumerated above

(c) Hence the appointment of the 2nd defendant as acting Chaiman/Leader

is void

67 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

(d) In any event, the Deshapalana Mandalaya at its meeting on 20th April

decided to call a meeting of the Vidhayaka Sabhawa on 21st April which

was done

(e) At that meeting the petitioner was elected/appointed as the acting

Chairman/Leader

(f) That election/appointment is valid

In regard to this, the following is the position of the plaintiff respondents quoted

from the synopsis filed on their behalf,

2nd Defendant Respondents appointment as the Acting Chairman of the Party

(a) Hon. Maithripala Sirisena who was the Chairman of the Sri Lanka

Freedom Party (SLFP) was enjoined by the District Court after considering,

inter alia, his conduct including him being found guilty by the Supreme

Court at least in two instances for serious violations of Fundamental

Rights of the citizens.

(b) Thereafter, a long-standing member of the Party, Hon. Nimal Siripala de

Silva was appointed as the Acting Chairman of the SLFP at a

(politburo) meeting of the SLFP held on 08th April 2014. The said

decision or the meetings not been challenged by any member of the SLFP in

any Court of Law (or within the constitutional organisations of the SLFP) to-

date

(c) There is no express provision in the Constitution of the SLFP on appointing

an Acting Chairman in a situation where the chairman is not in a position to

act for whatever reason. The only provision stipulated in the Constitution is

for the appointment of a chairman (as opposed to an Acting Chairman) as per

Article 12 of the Constitution of the SLFP. Therefore, the casus ommissus

clause in the Constitution contained in Article 33 provides as follows:

68 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

.

(d) Therefore, it is respectfully submitted that the only manner in which the

Party can act in a situation where no provision is provided in the Constitution

is by invoking the provisions of Article 33 which is the manner in which the

2nd Defendant Respondent was appointed as the acting Chairman on 8th

April 2024 by a properly convened Politburo. It is reiterated that the said

appointment has not been challenged either within the party structure or in

any Court of Law

3.1 The purported Meeting held on 20th April 2024 purporting to be a Meeting

of the (Politburo)

a. The 1st Defendant Respondent has selectively informed several individuals

to participate at a meeting purporting to be a Politburo meeting on 20th April

2024 at Monarch Imperial. Even though the Plaintiffs - Respondents are

members of the Politburo of the SLFP, the 1st Defendant - Respondent has

failed and/or neglected to send any notice of the said meeting purporting to

be a meeting of the Politburo of the SLFP.

3.2. The Meeting Purporting to be an Executive Committee Meeting Held on

21 April 2004

4. At the said meeting purporting to be a meeting of the Politburo, a purported

decision has been taken to call for a meeting of the Executive Committee

( ), and accordingly has called for a meeting purporting to be an

Executive Committee Meeting on 21 April 2024.

69 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

b. At the said meeting purporting to be the Executive Committee Meeting, a

purported decision has been taken to appoint the Petitioner as the acting

chairman (.....) of the SLFP.

Since then, until the enjoining order was obtained, the Petitioner has

represented himself as the acting chairman of the SLFP

Synopsis of submissions

4. The Calling of the Meeting Purporting to be Politburo Meeting of the SLFP

by the 1 Defendant-Respondent is Bad in Law, inter alia, due to the following

reasons:

4.1 The 1 Defendant-Respondent could not have called for a meeting of the

Politburo of the SLFP inasmuch as:

a meeting of the Politburo of the SLFP can be called only by the Chairman or

on instructions of the Chairman of the Party when a Chairman and/or an

Acting Chairman is present.

xii ,

.

vide Article 16(xii) of the Constitution of the SLFP:

However, the 2nd Defendant Respondent who is the Acting Chairman of the

Party has never instructed the 1st Defendant-Respondent to call for a meeting

of the Politburo.

4.2 the 1st Defendant-Respondent could not have selectively invited members

of the Politburo and individuals who are not members of the Politburo to a

meeting purporting to be a Politburo meeting of the SLFP. The Plaintiffs

70 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

Respondents who are members of the Politburo the SLEP were never invited

to the said meeting.

5. The Calling of the Meeting Purporting to be an Executive Committee

Meeting of the SLFP held on 21 April 2024 is Bad in Law, inter alia, for the

following reasons

5.1 a special meeting of the Executive Committee can be called only in

accordance with Article 32(ii) of the Constitution of the SLPF which reads as

follows:

32 (ii)

(1/3) , . , .

5.2 The notice (13 to the Plant) of the so-called meeting purporting to be an

Executive Committee Meeting of the SLFP held on 21st April 2024 was not

called based on a request for a meeting made one month prior to the date

fixed for the meeting. Further the Notice did not contain any reason as to why

the meeting was held.

5.3 Since the so-called meeting purporting to be the Politburo Meeting held

on 20th April 2024 was bad in law and void ab-initio, the purported decision

to call the meeting dated 21st April 2024 is also bad in law. Thus, the meeting

purporting to be a meeting of the Politburo the SLFP held on 21st April 2024

is bad in law.

5.4 The 3rd Defendant - Petitioner and Several Others Who Were Not

Members of the Politburo or the Executive Committee of the SLFP, had

71 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

Participated in the Meetings Purporting to be Politburo Meetings or Executive

Committee Meetings of the SLFP and therefore, the said Meetings in Any

Event Cannot be Called Politburo or Executive Committee Meetings of the

SLFP.

The position of the 1st defendant, the secretary of the party is, in brief, as follows,

Therefore, now, as it appears to this Court, the following contentions are before

court,

The petitioner says,

(i) The Deshapalana Mandalaya (Politburo) has no power to appoint a

Chairman or an acting Chairman

(ii) The Politburo meeting on 08th April 2024 is void

(iii) Hence the appointment of the 2nd defendant as acting chairman is void

(iv) On 20th the Politburo decided to call the Executive Committee (Vidhayaka

Sabhawa) meeting on 21st April 2024

(v) It has the power to elect/appoint a chairman or acting chairman

(vi) It validly appointed the petitioner as the acting chairman

The plaintiff respondents say,

(i) Hon. Maithreepala Sirisena was enjoined by a court from functinong as

the chairman

(ii) On 08th April 2024 the Politburo appointed the 2nd defendant as the

acting chairman

(iii) There was no express power or authority under the constitution for this

(iv) Hence it came under casus ommissus in clause 33

(v) It is only a chairman that can call for a politburo meeting as per the

Clause 16(xii)

(vi) The 2nd defendant never asked the 1st defendant to call for a meeting of

the politburo on 20th April 2024

(vii) Hence the purported politburo meeting on 20th April 2024 is void

(paragraph 5.3 of the plaintiffs synopsis)

(viii) Hence the calling of the Executive Committee for 21st April 2024 is void

(paragraph 5.3 of plaintiffs synopsis)

(ix) Hence the appointment of the petitioner is void

The questions that arise for decision now are,

(a) Had the politburo meeting held on 08th April 2024 the power to appoint an

acting Chairman?

75 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

The Chairman Hon. Sirisena had been enjoined by a court.

It has to be considered, whether clause 33 validly appoints the 2nd

defendant.

(b) Could the 1st defendant validly call for a politburo meeting for 20th April

2024?

Clause 16(xii) has to be considered.

If it applies, then, there arises a further question, whether the 1st defendant

had the instructions (upades) of the 2nd defendant to call it.

What would have been the position, if, the 2nd defendants appointment

as acting chairman was not valid?

Then again it does not appear that the 2nd defendants appointment made

on 08th April 2024 was held by a court to be void, or at least, it was

challenged in a court of law.

This makes the way for, perhaps, the last question,

Even if the 2nd defendants appointment as the acting chairman was void,

can the petitioner be appointed as the acting chairman without first

obtaining a ruling that the 2nd defendants appointment is not valid; and

hence, there is no chairman or an acting chairman?

On what was discussed in the first part of this order, on the proposition and

also the legal position, that, it is the original court that has an unfettered

jurisdiction of deciding all questions of law as well as facts, this Court is of the

opinion, that,

76 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

(i) On considerations of principle and policy discussed above what is

appropriate in law is for the petitioner who is the 3rd defendant in the

case to take up these matters in the original court, and

(ii) On the basis of

(a) The inappropriateness in law of this Court deciding the above

questions, and

(b) The 03rd defendant petitioner having an equally effective

alternative remedy

this Court must not exercise its powers of restitutio in integrum or revision.

In Fernando vs. Dias and others, 1980 (2) SLR 49, Rodrigo J., in the Court of

Appeal said,

It is not open to the petitioner to invoke the jurisdiction of the Appellate

Court in the exercise of its revisionary powers without first having recourse

to the original Court which issued the injunction to have it set aside in

terms of section 666 of the Civil Procedure Code. It was not a sufficient

excuse to plead that delay will be involved in filing papers and waiting

for the District Court to fix a date of hearing and eventually dispose

of the application.

This Court does not agree with the first sentence of the above passage which is

underlined. In an appropriate case the higher court can do it. But this Court

agrees with the second sentence in bold print.

At present the statement in bold print becomes doubly valid, because, there

was not only section 666 but also section 664(3) although its scope is limited to

allegations of suppression, etc.

It appears, that, Edussuriya J., in Ajith vs. Ceylon Paper Sacks Ltd., 2000 (3)

SLR 64, queried, whether if the defendant fails to come into court after the

77 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

service of the petition and affidavit and notice of application come under section

666 without purging his default.

This Court is of the view, although it does not directly arise for question in this

case, but still has a bearing to the proposition referred to at the beginning of

this order, he can come. Because it is a fundamental precept of the Rule of

Law that when there is an order against a man issued without him being

heard he need not (i) wait until he is summoned to show cause and (ii) his

right to challenge the order does not vitiate due to the fact that he

purposely or otherwise disobeyed such summons.

This opens the door to consider another matter that was raised for the petitioner

at the hearing, that, he has not yet been served with notices or summons and

he came to know about the enjoining order from the press (media).

140 years ago, in United Telephone Company vs. Dale, 1884, 25 Chancery

Division 778, it was said, that,

In order to justify the committal of a defendant for breach of an

injunction it is not necessary that the order granting the injunction

should have been served upon him, if it is proved that he had notice of

the order aliunde17, and knew that the plaintiff intended to enforce it.

In Ratnayake vs. Wijesinghe 1987, 1989 (1) SLR 406, S. B. Goonewardene J.,

in the Court of Appeal decided, that,

proceedings upon an application to discharge an enjoining order are

distinct from proceedings in opposition to the grant of an interim

injunction.

17 from a source extrinsic to the matter, document or instrument under consideration Aliunde legal definition of aliunde (thefreedictionary.com)

78 | P a g e C . A . R I I 5 3 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n N o t i c e , e t c . , - J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 7 t h M a y 2 0 2 4 2 . 5 5 p . m .

This shows that the remedy under section 666 is a separate, independent

method of obtaining relief, and it has no connection with serving of the

notice of interim injunction.

In the case, which was already referred to above, Mallika Ratwatte vs. The

Minister of Lands 1969 Samerawickrame J., said, that,

.; it is quite sufficient if the Court finds a case which shows that there

is a substantial question to be investigated, and that matters ought to be

preserved in status quo until that question can be finally disposed of.

In my order in CA/RII/11/2023 dated 23.10.2023 Mohan de Silva, Member

of Capri Club and others Vs Anusha Elfi Gunasekara nee Corea and others

(ON INTERIM ORDER), from page 23 to 63, I have discussed the principles to

be followed in granting interim injunctions and or interim relief in the nature of

temporary restraining orders.

Hence, I see no reason to exercise the power of restitutio in integrum or revision

in this case. The application of the 03rd defendant petitioner is dismissed.

There is no order on costs.

As the parties were in agreement that this matter must be disposed of

expeditiously, they filed synopsizes by late afternoon on 03.05.2024. As this

Court is presently handling certain other urgent work too, this order was

pronounced, on the day and time stated in the footer. The Court is grateful to all

learned counsel for the unstinted corporation extended and their learned

contribution made to the development of jurisprudence. Due to constraints of

time, only about 1/3rd of the cases and text books provided by Ms. Ajantha

Widanapathirana of the Judges Library could be included. In conclusion, this

Court expresses its wish and hope, that her services will be retained in that

library as long as possible, in a post that suits her, since her services are a great

asset to those who use the Library.
