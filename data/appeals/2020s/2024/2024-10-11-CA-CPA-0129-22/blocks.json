It was therefore incumbent upon the Primary Court Judge to have initially satisfied himself as to whether there was a threat or likelihood of a breach of peace and whether he was justified in assuming such a special jurisdiction under the circumstances. The failure of the judge to satisfy himself initially in regard to the threat or likelihood of the breach of peace deprived him of the jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry and this vitiates the subsequent proceedings.
