R. Gurusinghe J.

The petitioner filed this application on 17-07-2017, seeking inter alia Writ of

Certiorari quashing the decisions of 1st respondent (Assistant Commissioner

of Agrarian Development) and 2nd respondent (Agrarian Development Officer)

made on 01-03-2012 marked P11, 02-03-2012 marked P12 (i), 16-03-2012

marked P12 (ii).

The 1st and 2nd respondents filed objections to the petitioners application

together. The 3rd respondent (Bulegod Arachchige Seetha) and the 4th

respondent (Land Reform Commission) filed their objections separately.

The petitioner states that the paddy land called Vidana Addara was

cultivated by her father and the petitioner became Ande cultivator of the

said paddy land after the demise of her father. The paddy land called

Thotupola Gawa Kelle was cultivated by her husband and the petitioner

became Ande cultivator of the said paddy land after the demise of her

husband.

The 3rd respondents position is that she is the owner of the abovementioned

two paddy lands, which were cultivated by the petitioner as Ande cultivator.

The 3rd respondent informed the petitioner that she had intended to sell

these two paddy lands, and in terms of the provisions of section 2 of the

Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the Act),

she offered it to the petitioner (the Ande cultivator). Then the petitioner

4

wrote to the 3rd respondent by her letter dated 08-12-2004, in terms of the

provisions of section 2(2), that the petitioner was willing to buy the said

paddy lands named Thotupola Gawa Kelle in extent of 1 rood and 10 perch

for Rs. 17,500.00, instead of Rs. 20,000/- as offered by the 3rd respondent.

A copy of that letter is produced marked 1R1 , (3R1 ), by the 3rd

respondent. The petitioner also wrote to the 3rd respondent by letter dated

08-12-2004 in terms of section 2 (2) of the Act, that she was willing to buy

the paddy land named Vidana Addara in extent of 1 acre 3 roods and 30

perches, for Rs. 93,000/- , instead of Rs. 124,000/- which was the price

quoted by the 3rd respondent. A copy of that letter is produced marked

1R1, (3R1 ), by the 3rd respondent.

Since the petitioner and the 3rd respondent did not agree on the prices,

there had been an inquiry under section 2 (3) (a) (b) of the Act, and the

prices were fixed at Rs. 19,000/- and Rs. 110,000/- for Thotupola Gawa

Kelle and Vidana Addara respectively by the Agrarian Development Council.

The petitioner was informed by the said Council to buy those two paddy

lands for the above-fixed prices on or before 30-06-2006. However, the

petitioner failed to buy the said paddy lands. The petitioner, by letter dated

07-07-2006, informed the Deputy Commissioner of Agrarian Development

Matara that two paddy lands referred to above were owned by the Land

Reform Commission and, therefore, she was not in a position to buy the

said lands from the 3rd respondent, stating that the 3rd respondent was not

the owner, but only a third party.

Thereafter, there had been an inquiry before the Agrarian Services

Commissioner, and the Commissioner decided that the petitioner (the

tenant cultivator) had violated the provisions of Section 2 (3) (b) and,

therefore, decided by the order dated 01-03-2012, to evict the petitioner

from the two lands referred to above under the provisions of Section 2 (4) of

the Act.

5

The Assistant Commissioner informed the petitioner of the above decision

by a letter dated 02-03-2012, which was marked P12 (1). The Commissioner

made a correction to the two schedules and sent the letter dated 16-03-

2012 to the petitioner informing the same.

The petitioner states that being aggrieved by the said decision of the

Commissioner, she filed an application for a Writ of Certiorari to the High

Court of Matara. This application was, however, rejected by the Learned

High Court Judge on the ground that the Provincial High Courts did not

have jurisdiction over the decisions of the Agrarian Development

Commissioner. Subsequently, the petitioner filed the instant application to

this court.

All four respondents have filed objections, including preliminary objections

to the petitioners application, and moved for a dismissal of the petitioners

application.

The petitioner is seeking to quash the decisions of the 1st and 2nd

respondents made on 01.03.2012 marked P11, decision dated 02.03.2012

marked P12 (I), and 16.03.2012 marked P12 (II) and decision contained in

P13 dated 30.04.2012. This application before this court was filed on

17.07.2017.

The explanation of the petitioner for the delay is that she had filed an

application before the Provincial High Court Matara, and that application

was rejected by the High Court on the basis that the High Court of the

Provinces has no jurisdiction to look into the issue in suit.

The 3rd respondent pointed out that the petitioner has suppressed the

Magistrates Court proceedings of Matara bearing no. 67017, instituted by

the 1st respondent against the petitioner under S.8(1) of the Act for eviction

of the petitioner from the paddy lands in issue.

6

It was argued that under S. 2 of the Act, the owner of the paddy field is the

only party eligible to make an application or complaint to the Commissioner.

The petitioner contends that the Land Reform Commission (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the LRC) is the owner of the paddy lands in issue,

and therefore, the Commissioners decision (P11) is ultra vires. If the

petitioners position was that the Land Reform Commission was the owner of

the paddy lands, she would have raised this issue prior to the

commencement of the proceedings outlined in S.2 of the Act. Instead, the

petitioner only raised this issue after agreeing to the price fixed by the

Agrarian Development Council. Allowing the tenant cultivator to challenge

the ownership of the land after agreeing to the price fixed by the Council,

particularly at the final stage of the statutory proceedings, would render

such proceedings ineffective and of no consequence. On the other hand, the

petitioners position was not substantiated. In the circumstances, the new

position taken up by the petitioner is merely an effort to oust the jurisdiction

of the Commissioner.

The documents produced as P1 and P1(a) copies of the Agricultural Lands

Register, which contains the petitioners name as tenant cultivator and the

3rd respondents name as the landlord and the owner of two paddy lands in

issue.

Section 53(6) of the Agrarian Development Act states as follows:

An entry in a register prepared or amended under the provisions of this

section and which is for the time being in force shall be admissible in evidence

and, shall be prime facie proof of the facts stated therein.

The petitioner has also produced copies of the amended Agricultural Lands

Register as P2 and P3, removing the name of the landlord and the owner of

the two paddy lands in issue. However, such an amendment was effected

long after the impugned decisions, on 01-09-2019. The petitioner has not

explained how that amendment was effected to the above-mentioned

documents. Furthermore, if the position of the petitioner is that the 4th

7

respondent the Land Reform Commission, is the owner of the two paddy

lands in question, in the above amendments, the Land Reform Commission

should have been named as the landlord and the owner of the paddy lands

in issue. Although the petitioner claimed that the paddy lands in issue were

vested in the Land Reform Commission, the petitioner failed to state who

the owners of the lands were before they were vested in the Commission.

Furthermore, by document 3R4, the Land Reform Commission informed the

Agrarian Development Council that Vidana Addara Kumbura, which had

been vested in the Land Reform Commission, was owned by the late William

Wijekoon and the petitioner was not the Ande cultivator under the Land

Reform Commission. The 3rd respondent pointed out that Vidana Addara

Kumbura is a large paddy field which consists of several lots owned by

different owners and cultivated by different cultivators. This fact is evident

from P1, P1A, P2A, and P5.

The 3rd respondent produced documents marked 1R1(), and 1R1(),

dated 08-12-2004 sent to the 3rd respondent by the petitioner, where the

petitioner stated her willingness to buy two paddy lands in issue from the

3rd respondent, under the provisions of Section 2 (2) of the Act. The 3rd

respondent has also produced a letter sent to her by the petitioner dated 21-

08-2000 marked 1R2, where the petitioner stated that the two paddy lands

in issue were earlier cultivated by her husband, K. A. Darilis. She also

informed the 3rd respondent that as her husband was now deceased, the

paddy lands were cultivated by the petitioner. Further, the petitioner had

informed the 3rd respondent that she was willing to buy those two paddy

lands for a price assessed by the Agrarian Services Committee. If the

petitioner had paid praveniya(rent) to LRC during the period between 2000

and 2004, the petitioner would not have agreed to buy the paddy lands from

the 3rd respondent by the above-mentioned letters marked1R1() and 1R1

() dated 08.12.2004

8

Documents P1 and P1 (A) show that the petitioner was the Ande cultivator,

and the 3rd respondent was the landlord and owner of the two paddy lands

in question. The documents marked 1R1 (), 1R1 (), and 1R2 clearly

manifest that the petitioner had admitted that the 3rd respondent was the

owner of the two paddy lands in question. The petitioner did not raise any

issue regarding the 3rd respondents title to the paddy lands in question. The

documents also show that the only issue between the petitioner and the 3rd

respondent at that time was the selling prices of the two paddy lands.

The Agrarian Development Council determined the selling price and

informed the same to the petitioner by P7 (1) and P7 (2). By the time when

P7 (1) and P7 (2) were issued to the petitioner by the Agrarian Development

Officer on 22-05-2006, there was no issue regarding the ownership of the

paddy land.

The Agricultural Committee asked the petitioner to buy the two paddy lands

for the prices set up by it on or before 06-06-2006. Upon the price being

fixed, the petitioner should have purchased the paddy lands in issue.

However, the petitioner failed to abide by the decision of the Agrarian

Development Council. Since the petitioner failed to buy the two paddy

lands, the 3rd respondent again complained to the Agrarian Development

Commissioner. As a result, an inquiry was made under S.2 (4) of the Act to

determine whether the petitioner should be evicted from the two paddy

lands due to her failure to comply with the decisions outlined in P7(1) and

P7(2). In response, the petitioner came up with a new position asserting that

the paddy lands in question were owned by the Land Reform Commission,

and not by the 3rd respondent. However, the Commissioner has observed

that neither the petitioner nor the Land Reform Commission produced any

documents to show that the two paddy lands in question had been vested in

the Land Reform Commission. The document marked P4 only refers to

areas up to 1990 Yala for Thotupola Gawa Kelle paddy land. The

boundaries or the extent of such lands cannot be ascertained by P4.

9

The petitioner did not produce any acceptable evidence to show that the

Land Reform Commission was the owner of the two paddy lands in issue.

The commissioner has no reason to believe that there was a real dispute

regarding ownership. Even the LRC had not produced any documents to the

effect that it was the owner of two paddy lands in issue. Therefore, the order

of the Commissioner of Agrarian Development is well within the law. We see

no reason to grant the reliefs sought by the petitioner. The application of the

petitioner is therefore, dismissed.
