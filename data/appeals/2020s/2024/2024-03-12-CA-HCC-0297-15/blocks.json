In such situations, adjudication of issues in the case becomes easier to courts. I am mindful of the principles laid down in Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance when I make the above observation. But however, courts should not fall into the trap of convicting an innocent person by strictly following the principles laid down in section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance. The incident that had taken place in the present case is a classic example that court should, in appropriate cases, relax the principles laid down in section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance. However, if a police officer who was not assisted by any other police officer searches a person on suspicions and finds contraband or any illegal items in the possession of the said person the situation discussed above may be different.",
