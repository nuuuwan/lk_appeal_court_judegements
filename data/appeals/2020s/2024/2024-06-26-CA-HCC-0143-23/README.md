The accused-appellant was indicted for two charges before the High

Court of Colombo, under Section 54A (b) and 54A (d) of the Poisons,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (as amended) for trafficking

and possession of 3.62 grams of heroin, on or about 27th of March 2016.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the accused-

appellant by his Judgment dated 28.04.2023 and sentenced him for life

imprisonment for both charges. The accused preferred this appeal

against the said convictions.

Prior to the hearing, written submission was filed only on behalf of the

appellant. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Counsel for the

appellant and the learned Senior State Counsel (SSC) for the

respondent made oral submission.

Briefly, the prosecution case is as follows:

An informant came to the Colombo Crimes Division and gave an

information regarding a woman who carries heroin to PW-1, the officer

in charge of the Colombo Crimes Division. Accordingly, he organized a

Page 3 of 11

raid consisting of eight other police officers. They left the Colombo

Crimes Division at 10.40 hours and reached the place called

Stacepura in the Grandpass police division. The informant did not go

with the team of police officers but giving an information for the second

time, he informed that the woman who carries the heroin wears a black

trouser and a purple blouse. PW-1 and some other police officers turned

right from the Stacepura road and walked nearly one Kilometer

(answering the very next question, PW-1 stated they walked about 500

meters). Then the police officers saw near a playground a woman

coming, they questioned her and PW-7, the Woman Police Constable

Deepika who went with the team, searched the woman and found a

parcel of heroin from her right side pocket in her trouser. Thereafter,

they went to search her house and found nothing. Then they went to

the Dedigama Pawning Centre, weighed the heroin, sealed, and came

back to the Colombo Crimes Division.

The grounds of appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant

are as follows:

1. The learned High Court Judge failed to notice, consider, and

evaluate that the information which is the source of present

matter has inherent discrepancies/infirmities.

2. The learned High Court Judge failed to take cognizance of the

improbability of the prosecution case.

3. The learned High Court Judge failed to consider and evaluate that

there is a reasonable doubt whether a Woman Police Constable

accompanied the raid team.

4. The prosecution had failed to act under Rule 52 of the Supreme

Court Rules (Conduct and Etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law) Rules

1988.

5. The learned High Court Judge failed to consider that there is no

sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the

charge of trafficking.

Page 4 of 11

6. The learned High Court Judge failed to consider whether the

prosecution has proved the possession of heroin beyond a

reasonable doubt.

7. The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself on the facts

and convicted the appellant.

8. The conviction and the sentence are bad in law.

I wish to deal first, the arguments in respect of improbability of the

prosecution case because if there is a reasonable doubt regarding the

probability of the prosecution case, there is no need to consider the

other grounds of appeal.

According to the prosecution, the raid was carried out on an

information received by PW-1, the officer in charge of Colombo Crimes

Division. PW-1 stated that the informant came to his office and

informed that a woman in the Grandpass Police Division carries heroin

and she can be arrested if you go immediately. In PW-1s own words,

the information is as follows:

: ?

: .

.

(page 48 of the appeal brief)

The contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant was that in this

information, the identity of the person who carries the heroin had not

been mentioned and the area where the woman is said to be coming

with heroin is not mentioned. However, she contended that the OIC

entered the information in the information book stating the identity of

the person who carries heroin as the wife of Niroshan and she resides

in Stacepura in the Grandpass police division (page 49 of the appeal

brief). The issue raised by the learned Counsel for the appellant was

Page 5 of 11

that when the informant did not inform the identity of the person who

was supposed to be carrying heroin and not informed about the area in

which she resides, according to the evidence of PW-1, how did PW-1

enter all these details in the information book.

In replying, the learned SSC drew the attention to page 55 of the appeal

brief and stated that the informant had given an information for the

second time and informed about her dress, therefore, the fact that there

were two informations must be taken into consideration. Hence, he

contended that there was no discrepancy in respect of the information

received.

It is to be noted that the learned SSC has not correctly realized the issue

raised by the learned Counsel for the appellant. It is correct that after

the police officers reached Stacepura, giving an information for the

second time, the informant had informed about the dress that she wore.

The second information has no relevancy to the argument advanced by

the learned Counsel for the appellant. Her argument was in respect of

the information given by the informant when he came to the Colombo

Crimes Division and which was recorded at 10.25 hours. According to

PW-1s evidence at page 48 of the appeal brief, identity of the woman

who carries heroin had not been mentioned by the informant and the

place where she resides or is coming from had also not been mentioned.

But when PW-1 entered notes in the information book regarding the

information that he received, he stated that the wife of the Niroshan

who is residing in Stacepura is about to leave her house with a parcel

of heroin. Hence, it is apparent that there is a vital infirmity with regard

to the information received by PW-1 and that was not explained by the

prosecution. Therefore, I agree with the contention of the learned

Counsel for the appellant that the said vital infirmity raises a

reasonable doubt on the prosecution case.

Page 6 of 11

Apart from that, the learned Counsel for the appellant pointed out

several improbabilities in the prosecution case. I wish to deal only with

the vital improbabilities that go to the root of the case. I am of the view

that the argument raised regarding the alleged timeframes in relation

to the various occasions of the raid affects the reliability of the entire

raid. According to PW-1, they left Colombo Crimes Division at 10.40

hours. The accused-appellant was arrested at 11.40 hours. The learned

Counsel for the appellant contended that none of the witnesses have

stated whether it is 10.40 in the morning or in the evening. However, in

considering all the circumstances, it is apparent that it is 10.40 in the

morning. Anyhow, what was stressed by the learned Counsel for the

appellant was that the second information they received was that the

woman is leaving her house, after receiving the said information the

police officers walked nearly one kilometer or 500 meters, so, the story

that they apprehended the woman (the appellant) after walking nearly

one Kilometer or 500 meters, is totally improbable. The reply of the

learned SSC to the said argument was that the woman may have been

hanging around there and that is why the police officers could

apprehend the woman even after walking a distance of nearly one

kilometer or 500 meters. I regret to hear such an argument from a

Senior State Counsel because no Counsel can raise arguments on his

own assumptions. There is no iota of evidence in this case that after

leaving the house, the said woman (the accused-appellant) hung

around that place. Therefore, the learned SSC advanced this argument

not on the evidence placed before the High Court but on his own

assumptions.

I agree with the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant

because even in the first occasion, the informant came to the Colombo

Crimes Division and informed that a woman carries heroin, she is

getting ready to leave the house and if you go immediately, she could

be arrested (page 48 of the appeal brief). Thereafter, when the police

officers went to the Stacepura and stopped their vehicle near

Page 7 of 11

Kamkarupura apartments, the informant informed that Niroshans

wife Theresa is coming out with a parcel of heroin. The said item of

evidence appear as follows:

.

. (page 55 of the appeal brief). After receiving that

information, according to PW-1, they walked nearly one kilometer or

500 meters and apprehended the accused-appellant.

PW-1 stated in his evidence that the distance between the place of the

arrest and the appellants house was 50 meters (page 65 of the appeal

brief). PW-1 stated in cross-examination and re-examination that the

said distance is about 10 or 20 meters (pages 102 and 111 of the appeal

brief). There is a discrepancy in the said items of evidence also. The

important matter to be mentioned is that the learned High Court Judge

has not realized that when the police officers walked nearly one

kilometer or 500 meters, the accused-appellant also could have walked

at least 500 meters and according to the evidence presented by the

prosecution, there was absolutely no possibility of apprehending her

within fifty meters of her house. Hence, the prosecution story regarding

the raid is totally improbable.

In addition, when the learned Counsel for the appellant pointed out the

discrepancies between the evidence of PW-1 and PW-7, the learned SSC

contended that there are no discrepancies between the evidence of

PW-1 and PW-7. However, the learned SSC failed to give any acceptable

reason to substantiate his contention. Also, when the learned Counsel

for the appellant pointed out that in compliance with the Section 1(V)

of the Police Departmental Order No. A16, no notes were made in

respect of searching the house of the appellant, the learned SSC

contended that making detailed notes is not necessary, as nothing was

found in the house. I agree with the contention of the learned Counsel

for the appellant because Section 1(V) of the Police Departmental Order

No. A. 16 states that entries must be made in the notebook on every

Page 8 of 11

matter arising in the course of ones official duties. The Police

Departmental Order No. A. 16 is reproduced below.

For the purpose of investigating crime or accidents a notebook is the

most important record kept by a Police Officer. Notebooks should be

regularly examined, initialled and dated, by Officer-in-Charge of

Stations, Districts, Divisions and Provinces. The following rules regarding

notebooks are to be strictly observed.

(I) All entries in a notebook will be in ink or indelible pencil.

(II) Notes relating to inquiries will be headed with the date, time

and place at which they are written. On completion each note

will be initialled and dated by the Officer making the entry.

(III) No blank space will be left.

(IV) Nothing will be rubbed out, altered, or interpolated. Every error

will be crossed through by a single line so that it is still legible

and will be enclosed in brackets.

(V) Entries will be made in the Notebook on every matter arising in

the course of ones official duties. Entries will also be made

when an Officer has by reason of sickness or other personal

reasons to deviate from orders given to him when he was sent

out on duty.

(VI) No leaves will be removed from the Notebook.

(VII) Notebooks will be examined, initialled, and dated by the

Reserve Constable or Sergeant every time an Officer reports for

or from duty. At every Instruction Class Notebooks will be

examined, initialled and dated by the Officer holding such

class.

(VIII) Officers when initialling and dating Notebooks will do so with a

different coloured ink or pencil when possible and in small

characters to save space.

(IX) Notebooks will always be carried when on duty, except on

parade unless specifically ordered to do so.

Page 9 of 11

(X) All Police Officers will when leaving the Service return any

unfinished Notebook and re-fill to the Officer-in-Charge of the

Station. Cost of any re-fill not returned will be recovered and

credited to revenue.

In addition, although nothing was found in the house of the appellant,

making notes about searching the house is important in a raid of this

nature to decide whether, in fact, they carried out a raid as they claim.

Another discrepancy that was shown is that according to PW-1, when

he asked the appellant whether she possessed with any illegal

substance, she kept silent (page 61 of the appeal brief). According to

PW-7, when PW-1 asked whether she possessed with any illegal

substances, the appellant had replied that she does not possess

anything. This is also a vital contradiction because in her dock

statement, the appellant stated that she was arrested when she was at

home. When there are discrepancies of this nature in respect of the

most important moment of the raid, a reasonable doubt arises as to

whether a raid was carried out as the prosecution witnesses claim or

whether the arrest of the appellant could happen in the way that she

described in her dock statement.

Another discrepancy is that PW-1 stated that his team searched the

house of the appellant from 11.50 to 12.30; that is, 40 minutes (page

66 of the appeal brief). PW-7 stated that the house was searched from

11.50 hours to 12 hours; that is, 10 minutes. Hence, there is a vital

discrepancy in the time duration of searching the house of the

appellant.

In addition to the aforesaid discrepancies, the learned Counsel for the

appellant pointed out some other discrepancies between the evidence

of PW-1 and PW-7. She has pointed out these discrepancies to

substantiate her argument that there is a reasonable doubt whether a

Woman Police Constable accompanied the raid team. As the learned

Page 10 of 11

Counsel contended, the learned High Court Judge has not considered

these discrepancies and focused his mind whether those discrepancies

cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution story.

Apart from that, the learned Counsel for the appellant pointed out that

the informant did not come with the team of police officers but without

any problem, PW-1 has identified the appellant whom he had never

seen before. Another matter pointed out by the learned Counsel was

that although PW-8 has done an important role in the raid, he has not

made any entries. His reason for not making entries was that he did not

take part in any act relating to the raid. (

page 191 of the appeal brief) However, the

learned Counsel pointed out that PW-1 has clearly stated that S.I.

Jayathilake and other officers who went for the raid, searched the house

of the appellant. Therefore, the learned Counsel pointed out that PW-8

had also searched the house of the appellant, although he stated giving

an explanation for not making notes that he did not take part in any

act relating to the raid.

The learned Counsel for the appellant also pointed out that one of the

reasons for rejecting the dock statement of the accused by the learned

High Court Judge is that the defence did not suggest to PW-1 in cross-

examination that they came to arrest the husband of the appellant

although the appellant stated so in her dock statement. However, the

said observation of the learned High Court Judge is wrong, as

contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant because at page 98

of the appeal brief, the said suggestion had been made to PW-1 in cross-

examination.

Therefore, as explained previously, there is a vital discrepancy about

the information received. The said discrepancy raises a reasonable

doubt on the prosecution case. In addition, a serious doubt casts about

Page 11 of 11

the way of carrying out the raid as explained previously in detail.

Therefore, I hold that the prosecution has not proved beyond a

reasonable doubt that a raid was carried out in the manner that the

prosecution witnesses described. The learned High Court Judge has

come to an erroneous conclusion without properly analyzing the

evidence of the case.

Accordingly, the Judgment dated 28.04.2023, the convictions and the

sentences imposed on the accused-appellant are set aside. The

accused-appellant is acquitted of both charges leveled against her.

The appeal is allowed.
