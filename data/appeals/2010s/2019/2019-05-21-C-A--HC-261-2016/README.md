ACHALA WENGAPPULI, T.

The appellant, who was indicted by the Hon. Attorney General

alleging that he committed grave sexual abuse on Yapa Bandaralage

Chandan a Upul Kumara, a person below the age of 18 years, on or about

23.10.2011 at Arantalawa, an offence punishable under Section 365 B (2)(b)

of the Penal Code as amended.

At the conclusion of the trial, the appellant was convicted by the

trial Court. He was sentenced to 10 years of R. I. and fined Rs.12,OOO.00

with a default term of imprisonment of 6 months.

2

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant

sought to set them aside on the basis that;

a. the trial Court failed to consider that there was no

corroboration of Upul Kumara's evidence either by medical

or by any other lay witness's evidence

b. the prosecution has failed to call" Akka" who is a witness

to the incident,

c. the trial Court erroneously acted on uncorroborated and

unreliable evidence of the said Upul Kumara in convicting

the appellant.

The prosecution case presented on the evidence of Upul Kumara, a

ten year old child, who lived with his father and his grandmother since the

death of his mother. In the afternoon of the day in question, he had a bath

from the well located near his house, after washing his clothes. After

finishing his bath, Kumara wiped himself dry with a towel. The appellant,

who is related to Kumara, came there. He held kumara from his waist and

having put Kumara on the cement floor after removing his trouser, inserted

his penis into the anus. Kumara raised cries but after about 10 minutes

only, an "Akka", who lived close to the well, arrived there with her

laundry. Kumara told" Akka" of the incident and was advised to complain

to his family.

Later Kumara has disclosed this incident to his close relations and

also to his grandmother Loku Menika. She was called by the prosecution as

3

a witness in support of its case. She, however, showed some reluctance to

identify the appellant at the dock, perhaps due to the blood relationship

that she had with the appellant, but came out with an important item of

evidence in relation to the subsequent conduct of the appellant. She clearly

said in her evidence that the appellant had expressed his regret over this

incident and sought forgiveness. The exact words used by the witness,

attributed to the appellant are /I @(3)~ oOl;ci go!DJ./1 The appellant did not

challenge this assertion by the witness during her cross examination and

only denied it in his evidence.

A police complaint was lodged by the child after few days since the

incident as his father, who was employed as a day labourer, showed some

reluctance to come forward and only when his uncle took the initiative to

take him to the police to lodge a complaint. There was also hesitation by

the witness "Akka", with whom the child had made the initial disclosure

of the incident, to make a statement.

The medical evidence indicates that the child had no external

injuries at the time of his medical examination. However, a dilated anal

orifice was noted by the medical officer, which is indicative of long term

abuse. During the medical officer's questioning, the child had admitted of

sexual abuse which commenced two years prior to the date of medical

examination but he did complain of this incident as well, being the latest.

4

Police investigations revealed that the well is located about 450

meters away from the child's house and another house was seen located

about 100 meters away from the said well.

Learned Counsel for the appellant, in support of his first ground of

appeal submitted that the medical evidence does not support the

allegation and no other evidence available in corroboration of the child's

evidence before the trial Court. He relied on the principles laid down on

the requirement of corroboration in the judgments of Premasiri v Attorney

General (2006) 3 Sri L.R. 106, Sana v Republic of Sri Lanka (2009) 1 Sri L.R.

48 and Ajit v Attorney General (2009) 1 Sri L.R. 23.

He relied particularly on the item of evidence where the child

victim stated that he was sexually abused few days prior to his physical

examination, but the medical evidence does not support such a claim

instead it rather supports a situation of continued abuse. There were no lay

witnesses who claimed to have seen the incident, except 11 Akka", but she

was not called by the prosecution. It was further submitted that the failure

to call 11 Akka" deprived the evidence of the victim of any corroboration

and the said failure of the prosecution gives rise to the presumption under

Section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance.

The appellant's challenge mounted against his conviction is based

primarily on the ground that there was no corroboration. It also founded

5

on the ground that "Akka" who may have been an eye witness was not

called by the prosecution as a witness and thereby starving its case of

corroborative material, in addition to give rise to the presumption under

Section 114(f).

Evidence of the child victim reveals that "Akka" resides In the

house that was located closer to the well,! He raised cries and then" Akka"

arrived ten minutes after with her laundry. The witness was emphatic at

that time only he was there near the well. Thus, it is clear that " Akka' s"

arrival at the well was not due to the call of distress by the child but

because she had some clothes to wash. It is also clear that she was totally

unaware as to what is said to have happened near the well before she

reached there, until the boy disclosed it to her. Clearly she is not a witness

to the incident, but at most a witness to his consistency. Therefore, it

appears that the appellant's contention that she is a witness to the incident

is based on a misconceived notion on evidence. Her evidence would not

have added anything to the prosecution's case in respect of its narration

except for the general behaviour of the child victim at that point of time

and the consistency of his version of events. In such a situation, the

presumption under Section 144(f) does not arise for consideration.

The question of corroboration in an allegation of sexual offences was

considered in the judgments of Premasiri v Attorney General, Sana v

Republic of Sri Lanka and Ajit v Attorney General (supra) all of which in

relation to sexual offences committed on women. The collective

6

jurisprudence that could be gathered from these judgments seemed to be

that the "", Courts in some cases of rape especially when the accused claims the

allegation to be a false one or when the accused claims that sexual intercourse was

performed with the consent of the woman, insist on corroboration of the testimony

of the prosecutrix,"

In the judgment of the Supreme Court in Gallage v Addaraarachchi

and another (2002) 1 Sri L.R. 307, Silva CJ held that:-

1/, " if the evidence of the victim does not suffer from

basic infirmity and the probability factor does not

render it unworthy of credence, as a general rule there

is no reason to insist on corroboration,"

Almost identical words are found in Mahalakotuwa v The Attorney

General - CA Appeal No, 176/2007 - decided on 22,06,2010, A similar

approach was adopted by this Court in Tikiribanda v Hon. Attorney

General 2010 fB,L.R.] 92 when it held that:-

1/ '" there is no impediment on the part of the Court in

acting solely on the evidence of the victim and it is

only when the evidence of the victim suffers from some

infirmity or where the Courts believe that it would not

be prudent to base a conviction, solely on that

evidence, the Court should look for corroboration,"

7

Returning to the instant appeal, we note that the evidence of Kumara

does not suffer from any of such infirmity which made the trial Court to

rule that 1/... it would not be prudent to base a conviction, solely on that

evidence". Therefore, mere absence of any corroboration does not render

his evidence untruthful and unreliable. The trial Court was mindful of the

contradictions and omissions that had been marked off his statement and

it has correctly ruled that those infirmities had no adverse effect on his

credibility as a witness, owing to triviality of the issues on which they were

marked. When the evidence of Kumara is considered in its totality we are

satisfied that his narration of the sequence of events in relation to the

incident is clearly a probable one. The evidence of the prosecution, viewed

against the admission made by the appellant to the witness Loku Menika on

his own volition after the incident and thereby seeking her forgiveness

after stating that he did some wrong, supports the conclusion reached by

the trial Court to accept of Kumara's evidence as a truthful and reliable

account of what took place that evening.

The trial Court after a careful evaluation of the evidence given by

the appellant under oath decided to reject his evidence, We agree with

the reasoning of the trial Court in rejecting his evidence.

We are of the opinion that there was credible and reliable evidence

that had been placed before the trial Court by the prosecution and it had

correctly found the appellant guilty to the charge of grave sexual abuse.

8

.

Therefore, we hold that the several grounds of appeal that has been urged

before us by the learned Counsel are without merit.

The conviction and sentence imposed on the appellant by the High

Court of Ampara is hereby affirmed and we accordingly make order to

dismiss his appeal.
