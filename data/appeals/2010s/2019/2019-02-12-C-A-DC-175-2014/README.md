ACHALA WENGAPPULI T.

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant")

has invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this Court seeking to set aside his

conviction for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder

and sentence of 20-year imprisonment.

In the indictment against the Appellant, he was accused of

committing the murder of Habakkala Kankanamalage Wijeratne on or about

21st December 2000. The Appellant is the eldest son of the deceased and

the witnesses for the prosecution included, among other witnesses, his

mother and two younger brothers.

It is revealed from the prosecution case that the deceased is an

alcoholic and w ould return home in the evening under the influence of

2

liquor on a daily basis. He would then start a quarrel with his wife and

sometimes involving the Appellant as well.

On the day of the incident the deceased had returned home at about

5.30 p.m. and was drunk as usual. He picked up an argument with his wife

Gunaseeli and was prevented from assaulting her by their sons who were

there at that time. Her two younger sons have thereafter left the house and

have played cards at one of their friend's place. The deceased had a fight

with the Appellant and when the deceased started pelting stones to the

house, Gunaseeli also left the house for the safety of her granddaughter.

When she returned, the deceased was fallen inside the house with bleeding

injuries on his head. The Appellant was seen outside of their house by his

mother Gunaseeli. He then left the scene of the incident. She had raised

cries and whilst on transit to a hospital, the deceased has succumbed to his

injuries.

Jayakanatha said he left their house when his father and the

Appellant started to fight. They played a game of cards. At about 6.00 p.m.

they heard their mother's call of distress and when rushed back, saw the

deceased lying in the house with bleeding injuries. He searched for the

Appellant but there was no trace of his whereabouts. His other brother

Tilakasiri was dead at the time of the trial before the High Court and his

evidence was led after the application of the prosecution under Section 33

of the Evidence Ordinance which was allowed by the trial Court. Tilakasiri

said in evidence at the preliminary inquiry that the Appellant did not

attend the deceased's funeral although they kept his body for two days.

3

The Police have arrested the Appellant about a 1/z kilometre away

from their house on 23rd December 2000 and during their investigations,

recovered a mamoty from the back garden of the house of the deceased,

upon information provided by the Appellant. Medical expert was of the

opinion that mamoty may have been used in the four long cut injuries that

were seen on the deceased's body and particularly injury No. I, which is a

12 cm long curved cut injury resulted in the fracture of his mandible while

damaging the left jugular vein and 3rd cervical vertebra, is sufficient in the

ordinary course of nature to cause death. The death of the deceased was

due to cardio respiratory failure following shock and haemorrhage due to

cut injury to left jugular vein and fracture of 3rd cervical vertebra.

The Appellant, in his statement from the dock claimed no

knowledge of the incident since he was elsewhere.

It is the contention of the Appellant in challenging the validity of the

conviction that there was no evidence that he had attacked the deceased.

Therefore, he contended that the actus reas has not been established by the

prosecution depriving the trial Court of a reasonable basis to arrive at the

finding of his guilt.

The prosecution presented a case against the Appellant based on

items of circumstantial evidence. It has been held consistently that 1/ in a

case of circumstantial evidence if an inference of guilt is to be drawn against the

accused such inference must be the one and only irresistible and inescapable

inference that the accused committed the crime" ( vide Samantha v Republic of

Sri Lanka (2010) 2 Sri L.R. 236). In view of the Appellant's contention this

4

Court must consider whether there were evidence before the trial Court to

reach the conclusion it did satisfying the above quoted criterion.

The prosecution evidence clearly establishes the facts that within the

30 minute period, the deceased was last seen alive fighting with the

Appellant. The Appellant was there at the scene where the deceased was

seen with bleeding injuries, when his mother returned home. His two

brothers were away playing cards. The Appellant had the knowledge of

the place where the mamoty which could well have used in the fatal

wounds on the deceased. His subsequent conduct of disappearing from

the scene leaving his mother and brothers to attend to the then fatally

injured deceased, coupled with the fact of not attending his father's funeral

although he was within 1/2 kilometres from their home, in our view are

sufficient to draw the /I one and only irresistible and inescapable inference that

the accused committed the crime".

In addition to his statement from the dock, the Appellant called a

consultant psychiatrist to give evidence on his behalf in support of the fact

that he was diagnosed of suffering from Schizophrenia. Dr. Neil Fernando,

in his report indicated that 1/ Reasoning and judgment would have been

impaired at the time of the alleged offence due to his mental disorder". However,

his brothers stated in evidence that the Appellant had no signs of any

mental abnormality during that period and the trial Court concluded that

he is not entitled to the defence of insanity since he did not establish it on

balance of probability.

The principle that the defence of insanity should be established by

the person who relies on that plea on a balance of probabilities was

5

reiterated by this Court in Chandra and Another v Attorney General (2012)

1 Sri L.R. 119. The trial Court, therefore applied the relevant principle of

law correctly.

However, it must be noted that the trial Court in determining lesser

culpability of the Appellant convicted him for the offence of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of sudden fight.

Upon full appreciation of the evidence that had been placed before

the trial Court, we are of the considered view that they disclose more of an

instance of grave and sudden provocation with a significant degree of

cumulative provocation 'rather than a sudden fight. The injuries suffered

by the deceased are suggestive of the fact that the Appellant had acted

rather cruelly in inflicting those injuries on the neck and head of his father

with a mamoty.

Although, the medical evidence regarding the mental state of the

Appellant did not help him in the defence of insanity, certainly it would

have a bearing on the general exception of grave and sudden provocation.

It is clearly stated by the consultant psychiatrist that the Appellant is prone

to provocation due to his mental condition.

Therefore, we alter the judgment of the trial Court to read that the

Appellant was convicted for the offence of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder on the basis of grave and sudden provocation.

The sentence of 20-year term of imprisonment, although legally

valid, could not be considered as an appropriate sentence in these

circumstances. The trial Court, though noted that he was in remand

pending trial for a long period, opted not to grant a concession on that

6

account. We consider a term of imprisonment for 15 years would meet the

ends of justice. We further make order that it should start to run from the

date of his conviction, which is 05.08.2014.

In these circumstances, the appeal of the Appellant is dismissed

subject to the variation on the basis of lesser culpability and sentence.
