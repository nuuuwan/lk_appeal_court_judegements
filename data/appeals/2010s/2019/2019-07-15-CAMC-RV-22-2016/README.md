Count (1) Cheating ~ 3 months RI ~ Rs. 575,000/~

Count (2) Criminal misappropriation ~ 3 months R.I

Count (3) Cheating with a cheque ~ 3months R.I

It has to be remembered that these offences for which the Petitioner was convicted and

sentenced in the Magistrate's Court of Moratuwa were for offences committed in June 2010.

As shown by the charge sheet in the case record in Magistrate's Court of Moratuwa Case

No.l7883, the Petitioner had been charged under 3 counts in respect of the offences of

cheating, criminal misappropriation and cheating by way of a cheque and the Petitioner

was sentenced to 9 months' rigorous imprisonment in the aggregate. As it is apparent

upon the warrant of commitment, marked as P6A and a copy of the proceedings marked

P6B, the Court had made an order reviving the suspended sentences imposed by the

Kesbewa Magistrate's Court in 3 cases, namely, M.C. Kesbewa 45517,45813 and 46617 on

25.01.2012 and 09.08.2012.

In the said 3 cases in the Kesbewa Magistrate's Court, the Magistrate has sentenced the

Petitioner to 3 years and 10 months' rigorous imprisonment and suspended the sentences

for 12 years.

This imposition of the sentences had taken place on 25.01.2012 and 09.08.2012. In each of

the said cases, the Petitioner was also ordered to pay Rs. 100,0001 ~ as compensation with

default sentences running up to 23 months. It has been brought to the notice of this Court

that as the Petitioner could not pay the compensation that had been ordered, he has been

serving default sentences since 25.01.2012. It would appear that the Petitioner did not

commit any offences after the imposition of the said suspended sentences. If at all, the

offences for which the Petitioner was convicted by the Magistrate's Court, Moratuwa were

committed in June 201O~which is a date long prior to the imposition of the suspended

sentences. Under Section 303(4)(6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.l5 of 1979

(the CPC), a suspended sentence becomes operative only where a person has committed

another offence during the operational period of the suspended sentence and is convicted

and sentenced to imprisonment for the subsequent offence. 4

The CPC Section 303( 4)~An offender sentenced to suspended imprisonment shall not

serve any part of the suspended imprisonment unless~

(a) During the operational period, the offender commits another offence the

statutory penalty for which is, or includes, imprisonment; and

(b) A court makes an order under subsection (13).

5) The operational period shall be calculated with effect from the date of the order

suspending the whole or part of the sentence.

6) If during the operational period an offender is sentenced to imprisonment for another

offence committed prior to the commencement of the operational period, the

operational period continues to elapse while the offender is serving the sentence. See

Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act No. 47 of 1999.

As I said before, the offence for which the Petitioner was convicted was committed in June

2010, long before he was imposed the suspended sentences in Kesbewa Magistrate's Court

in January 2012. It is quite clear that the Petitioner had committed this offence long before

the suspended sentence was imposed on him in the Kesbewa Magistrate's Court in January

2012. Therefore, the learned Magistrate in the Magistrate's Court of Moratuwa could not

have legally enforced the suspended sentences. In the circumstances, it is an illegality

which is liable to be set aside in the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court. The learned

Counsel for the Petitioner, Mr. Kalyananda Tiranagama also brought to the notice of this

Court, another erroneous order made by the Magistrate's Court of Moratuwa. The learned

Magistrate had erroneously re~imposed the sentences given by the Magistrate's Court,

Wattala in Case No.65392 and the Magistrate's Court, Kalutara in Case No.07972 treating

them as suspended sentences. The sentences imposed by the Magistrate's Court of Wattala

and Kalutara in the said 2 cases were not suspended sentences at all. The Petitioner was in

fact serving these sentences.

As a consequence of these erroneous orders, I find that the Petitioner has been compelled

to serve each of these sentences twice. It clearly appears from the letter of the

Superintendent of Kalutara Prison dated 02.02.2016 addressed to the Registrar, 5

,

Magistrate's Court, Moratuwa filed in the M.e. Moratuwa Case No.l7883 that the prison

authorities are in fact enforcing each of these sentences twice as orders made by the

Wattala and Kalutara Magistrate's Court and as orders made by Moratuwa Magistrate's

Court, on the basis that the sentences that have been activated are suspended sentences.

Nayomi Wikramasekara, Senior State Counsel appearing for the Attorney General

accepted this position that this is an illegality since the sentences that are activated are

not suspended sentences at all.

In the circumstances, I proceed to quash the erroneously made orders made by the

Magistrate's Court, Moratuwa in Case No.l7883. As a result, the orders made by the learned

Magistrate enforcing the sentences imposed in M.C. Kesbewa Cases Nos.45517, 45813 and

46617, M.C. Wattala Case No.65392 and M.e. Kalutara Case No.04972 are set aside and

they will be of no effect as far as this Petitioner is concerned. Accordingly, I allow the

revision application of the Petitioner.
