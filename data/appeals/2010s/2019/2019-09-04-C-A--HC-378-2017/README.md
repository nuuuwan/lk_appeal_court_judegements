The Accused-Appellant - On 05.07.2019 The Complainant-Respondent- On 08.08.2019

03.09.2019

The Accused-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the judgment of

the Learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura dated 12.12.2017 in case No. HC

162/2012.

Facts of the case:

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') was indicted in

the High Court of Anuradhapura on two counts as follows;

l. For committing Statutory Rape, an offence punishable under section 364(2)

of the Penal Code as amended by Act No. 22 of 1995

2. For committing house-trespass, an offence punishable under section 443 of

the Penal Code.

At the conclusion of the trial, he was convicted of both counts and sentenced as

follows;

Page 2 of 14

1. Count 01 - A tenn of 10 years ~gorous Imprisonment and a fine of

Rs. 500/= with a default tenn of 03 months simple imprisonment. A

compensation of Rs. 50,000/= to be paid to the victim with a default

tenn of 0 1 year Rigorous Imprisonment.

2. Count 02 - A tenn of 01 year Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of

Rs.500/= with a default tenn of 03 months simple imprisonment.

Further, the Learned High Court Judge ordered the tenns of imprisonment to run

concurrently and default sentences to run consecutively.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellant preferred this appeal.

Following grounds of appeal were settled as grounds of appeal on behalf of the

appellant at the argument;

1. Evidence of the prosecutrix creates a reasonable doubt as to whether

the appellant committed the offences

2. No reasonable explanation given regarding the belated complaint

3. The prosecution had failed to prove the date of offence

4. Dock statement of the accused appellant had been rejected on wrong

principles of law.

Summary of the incident as per the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as

follows;

The prosecution case was mainly based on the evidence of the victim (hereinafter

referred to as the 'PW 01' and/or 'the prosecutrix') who was less than 16 years of

age (at the time of the incident), her mother and father. According the PW 01, the

accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') is a known police

officer whom had come to their house to settle disputes. On the day of the incident,

the appellant had called the prosecutrix in the night and asked her to come out of

Page 3 of 14

the house. Accordingly, she had gone out 'lnd the appellant had taken her near a

well. Thereafter, the appellant had removed the t-shirt worn by the prosecutrix and

had asked her to lie down on a bunt near there. The appellant had sexual

intercourse with her. The prosecutrix had testified that although she resisted, she

could not get away (Page 58 & 59 of the appeal brief). After the incident, she had

run to the house and the appellant had followed her. The prosecutrix further

testified that her mother and father had tried to catch the appellant, but he had

pushed them away and run.

The mother of the prosecutrix (hereinafter referred to as' the 'PW 02') had testified

that, on the date of the incident, she was sleeping with her husband and son in one

room and the prosecutrix with sleeping with her younger sister in another room. In

the night, PW 02 had heard the door of the house being opened and she assumed

that it was the prosecutrix going out to urinate which was her usual beheviour. The

PW 02, after waiting for about 15 minutes anticipating for the daughter to call her,

had gone near the room of the prosecutrix. The prosecutrix had prevented PW 02

from entering the room. However, the PW 02 had forcibly entered the room and

seen a male person inside the said room. He was facing the wall and she had also

seen that the trouser of the said male had been lowered. Her position is that she did

not identify the person who was inside the room (Vide pages 133,137,139 and 140)

The PW 03 is the father of the victim. He too had testified and given a similar

version of evidence as the PW 02. The PW 03 testified that he failed to identify the

person who entered the house, on the date of the incident and he further testified

that the appellant was a known person to him. Both PW Oland PW 03 testified

that they tried to catch the appellant, but failed.

The JMO, who examined the prosecutrix had stated that at the time of examination

on 06.12.2011, there were observations consistent with penetration to the vagina.

Page 4 of 14

I observe that the prosecutrix had made s~veral statements with regard to the

incident. As per the evidence of PW 07 (who recorded two statements from the

prosecutrix), the first statement was made to the Police Station, Thambuttegama on

01.12.20 II , when mother of PW 0 I made a complaint to the Police Station about

the stubborn behavior of PW 01. The second statement was recorded at the

Headquarters of the Salvation Army, Colombo on 21.01.2012. As per the PW 04

(probation officer), the prosecutrix had made a statement to her on 02.12.2011.

As per the PW 08, the prosecutrix had made another statement to the PW 08, on

17.05.2012.

Now I wish to consider the grounds of appeal submitted on behalf of the appellant.

I will first consider the 3'd ground of appeal, in which the Learned Counsel for the

appellant contended that the indictment does not disclose a specific and precise

date of the alleged offence rather than referring to a massive period in between of

01 st of January 2011 to 30th November 2011.

In reply to the above contention, the Learned DSG for the complainant-respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the 'respondent') submitted that there is evidence to

establish that the offence was committed during the period given in the indictment.

The prosecutrix had stated that she was a grade 10 student when the incident

happened and was 15 years old when the complaint was made (Page 61 & 63 of

the appeal brief). Further, she had stated that this incident happened in 2011 (Page

71 of the appeal brief). The Learned DSG submitted that the Learned High Court

Judge had considered this aspect in page 13 of the judgment.

I observe that as per section 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979 as amended, it is mandatory to specify the date of offence in a charge, in

order to comply with the guidelines of a fair trial.

In the case of K.K. Dayarathne alias Chuti mama V. The Attorney General

[CAl188/2015 - decided on 22.09.2017), it was observed that,

" Page 5 of 14

"In the case of Attorney General fs. Viraj Aponso and Others S.c.

2412008, the Supreme court had given a guideline for a fair trial. Reading

the guidelines, it is clear that it is the responsibility of the prosecutor to

inform the time, place and the offence clearly to the person who is charged.

It is fundamental for the accused appellant to formulate his defence.

In this case if the accused wants to take up a defence of alibi he cannot do so

because there is no date or time given. That takes the prosecution for not

fulfilling the fundamental obligation namely fair trial. In R.H.M.S.

"-Premathunga alias Ananda Vs. Attorney General CA 0112013 decided on

3110112014 where Sis ira J de Abrew, J held,

" ... Is to give sufficient opportunity to the accused to answer the

charge and ensure afair trial" ... "

In light of above, it is understood that the prosecution has a responsibility to inform

an accused about particulars of the charge against him such as the date, place and

the offence which are material to the accused. However, I observe that the State

Counsel, in the instant case, had not put much effort to confirm about the date of

the offence. The State Counsel had asked about the date of birth of the PW 0 I and

the grade in which she was studying at the time of the incident. The other material

details mentioned by the Learned DSG, such as the year of the incident and the age

of the PW 01 at the time of the incident were elicited only during the cross-

examination by the defence' Counsel. I do not thiUk that the State Counsel can

evade the duty cast upon himlher to notify the accused about specific dates of

offence which is very material to formulate a defence. I think, at least the State

Counsel should have extracted the year of the incident from the prosecutrix.

There can be instances where sexual offences committed on small children

continuously where the child may not be able to mention the exact date of the

incident. Also, small children may not be able to remember the exact date of

Page 6 of 14

offence and in such instances, it is pennitte.d to mention a period of time in the

charge.

However, in the instant case, the prosecutrix was with her parents on the date of

offence and at least the parents should have been able to mention the exact time

period. In the absence of such evidence, I answer the contention of the Learned

Counsel for the appellant in affinnative.

I wish to consider 1 st and 2nd grounds of appeal at this juncture, which argues about

the credibility of prosecution evidence, especially PW 01. The Learned Counsel for

--. the appellant brought the attention of this Court to several contradictions in the

case for the prosecution.

One such question is, the prosecutrix testified that she ran to her home after getting

released from the appellant, after the rape incident near the well and the PW 02 and

PW 03 (mother and father of the prosecutrix) struggled with the appellant to catch

him (Page 60 - 62 of the brief). However, contrary to the above version of the

prosecutrix, the PW 02 testified that she went to the room of the prosecutrix and

saw the appellant being inside the room of the prosecutrix. Thereafter, the PW 02

struggled to catch the appellant after calling the PW 03 (Pages 132 - 141 brief).

Further, the PW 02 in her evidence testified that at the time when she was

struggling with the person who was in the room of the prosecutrix, she could not

see who that person was (Page 140 of the brief). Also in the pages 163,164,168 and

170 of the brief, PW 02 had' testified that she could not identify the person with

whom the prosecutrix was engaged in a sexual activity.

I am well aware that corroboration is not mandatory in sexual offences. However,

the Courts have held in numerous occasions that the Trial Judge can act on a sole

testimony of a prosecutrix only if her evidence is cogent, credible and consistent.

The Learned DSG for the respondent submitted several case law including the

following cases;

4. Karunasena V. The Republic of Sri Lanka [1975] 78 NLR 63

In the case of Yodhasinghegedara Chandrasoma V. Attorney General (CA

87/2008 - Decided On 15.07.2015), it was held that,

"Learned Counsel submitted that the evidence ,..of Dr. Gajanayake who

examined the victim and the evidence of Sumanawathi, mother of the victim

cannot be considered as corroboration and in the absence of any other

evidence to corroborate the victim, it is unsafe to act only on the

uncorroborated testimony of the victim.

In the case of Gurcharen Sing Vs. State of Haryana AIR (1972) SC 2661

Indian Supreme Court held thus; as a rule of prudence however, court

normally looks for some corroboration on her testimony so as to satisfY its

conscience that she is telling the truth and that the person accused of rape

on her has not been falsely implicated.

In contrary the 1ndian Supreme Court in Bhoginbhai Harjibhoie Vs. State

of Gujarat (1983) AIR SC 753 held "in the Indian setting, refusal to act on

the testimony of a vicdm of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as

a rule is adding insult to the injury. "

When there is strong uncontradicted evidence and in the absence of any

strong reason for falsely implicating the accused, in such a situation our

courts preferred to follow the later ... " (Emphasis added)

Page 8 of 14

In the case of Premasiri V. Attorney General (2006) 3 Sri L.R 106, Justice E . Basnayake observed that,

"The learned counsel complained that the accused was convicted on

uncorroborated evidence. There is no rule that there must in every case, be

corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand. (Gour on Penal

Law of India 11th Edition page 2657 quoting Raghobgr Singhe vs. State(2);

Rameshwar, Kalyan Singh vs. State of Rajasthan (3). It is well settled law

that a conviction for the offence of rape can be based on the sole testimony '. . of the prosecutrix if it is reliable, unimpeachable and there is no infirmity.

(Bhola Ram vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (4). If the evidence of the

prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon without seeking

corroboration of her statement in material particular. The testimony of the

prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and the

trial court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing

with cases involving sexual molestation. State of Punjab vs. Gurmit

Singhe(5).

The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a

conviction in a case of rape, but the necessity of corroboration as a matter

of prudence, except where the circumstances make it unsafe to dispense with

it, must be present to . the mind of the judge. (Schindra Nath Biswas vs.

State (6). In Sunil and another vs. the Attorney - General Dheeraratne J

with H A. G. De Silva and Ramanathan JJ agreeing held that "if the

evidence of the complainant is so convincing, they could act on that

evidence alone, even in the absence of her evidence being corroborated".

(Emphasis added)

Page 9 of 14

In the case of King V. Athukorala [50 NLR 756], it was held that,

"When an accused is charged with rape, corroboration of the story of the

prosecutrix must come from some independent quarter and not from the

prosecutrix herself. A complaint made by the prosecutrix to the Police in which

she implicated the accused cannot be regarded as corroboration of her

evidence ".

In the case ofRadhu V. State of Madya Pradesh [Case No: Appeal (crl.) 624 of

2005, Indian Supreme Court observed that,

"The court should, at the same time, bear in mind thatfalse charges of rape

are not uncommon. There have also been rare instances where a parent has

persuaded a gullible or obedient daughter to make a false charge of a rape

either to take revenge or extort money or to get rid of financial liability.

Whether there was rape or not would depend ultimately on the facts and

circumstances of each case".

In light of above, it is understood that the Court has to be extremely cautious in

determining whether the evidence of the prosecutrix is trustworthy and reliable. I

observe that, in the instant case, both the PW 02 and PW 03 had failed to identify

the appellant even being eye witnesses.

It is noteworthy that it was transpired in the cross examination of the PW 01, she

did not mention about the ' appellant when she was making a statement on

02.12.2011, while being in the probationary authority. The prosecutrix had

mentioned about some other persons i.e. Suranga, Rasika, Wasana and Samantha

and they were arrested by the Police. Accordingly, the Learned Counsel for the

appellant contended that, not even a single word about the instant appellant was

mentioned by the prosecutrix in the above said statement, when she got the

opportunity for the second time in making a statement.

Page 10 of 14

The Learned DSG for the respondent submjtted that the prosecutrix had given

reasons for her belated complaint. The PW 01 testified that she was told by a

police officer, that she would be given an opportunity to enter a higher school and

will be put in to probation, if she did not mention the name of the appellant when

her initial statement was recorded (Page 77 of the appeal brief).

Further, the procecutrix made a statement to the police for the third time on

21.01.2012, while being in the Salvation Army, and she again mentioned that fact

that she was sexually abused by the aforementioned four persons whose names

, were given in the first and the second statements to the police.

It is imperative to note that under cross -examination with regard to the above

same statement made on 2l.0l.2012, it was mentioned that the mother of the

prosecutrix intervened to the statement at the time of recording the same and

introduced about the appellant in that statement (Page 82 of the brief).

Further, I observe that, the PW 02 testified and accepted in her evidence that she

deliberately uttered falsehood in saying that it was the instant appellant who was in

the room of the prosecutrix as well as the appellant came to their house on the

alleged date of incident. This was marked a contradiction as 'V8' (Pages 171 - 173

of the brief).

I observe that the JMO testified that he examined the prosecutrix on 06.12.2011

after recording a short history. In the said short history she had not mentioned

about the appellant, but about the previously mentioned four names of male

persons. The JMO had testified that the prosecutrix gave the history of the alleged

incident to him freely and at ease without any threats and influences by the prison

officers who produced her as it was only the JMO and his nurse who were inside

the room while inspecting the prosecutrix.

Considering above, I am of the view that there are some serious doubts in the case

for the prosecution. Since PW 01 did not appear to be a credible witness, the Court

Page 11 of 14

must have look for corroboration from oth~r witnesses. Further, the prosecution

has failed to explain the belated complaint sufficiently. After perusing the

proceedings, I am convinced that the prosecution witnesses are not sufficiently

corroborated and therefore, I answer the grounds of appeal 01 and 02 in

affirmative.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the Learned High Court

Judge had failed to evaluate the dock statement and he had failed to give proper

reasons to reject the dock statement. The appellant in his dock statement admitted

, going to the house of prosecutrix to settle a dispute between her mother and

grandfather. He had given his telephone number to them. The appellant denied the

commission of alleged offence and took up the position that one ASP was trying to

frame him for a false allegation. I observe that the Learned High Court Judge was

of the view that the appellant could have called for telephone records and prove

that he did not take telephone calls to the prosecutrix on that particular day.

However, I think it was unreasonable to cast a burden on the appellant, especially

given that fact that the prosecution had failed to prove the exact date of offence and

therefore, the appellant is unable to call such records properly.

In the case of State of Uttar Pradesh V. M. K. Anthony [AIR 1985 SC 48;

(1985) Cri. L.J. 493], it was held that,

"While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring

of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the

court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the

deficiencies, draw-backs and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a

whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor

of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of

the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief Minor

Page 12 of 14

discrepancies on trivial matters not to.uching the core of the case, hyper-

technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or there

from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed

by the investigating officer not going to the : root of the matter would not

ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole ... "

After perusing the evidence of the trial, I am of the view that the evidence of the

prosecution lacks consistency and there are some serious short comings in the

evidence of the witnesses. Therefore, I do not think it is safe to act on such ,

evidence of the prosecution to convict the appellant. I set aside the convictions and

the sentences imposed on the appellant by the Learned High Court Judge of

Anuradhapura. I acquit the appellant from both counts.

The appeal is hereby allowed.
