The Registered owner-Petitioner-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set

aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of

Southern Province holden in Galle dated 14.02.2018 in Case No. REV 26112018

and seeking to set aside the confiscation order made by the Leamed Magistrate of

Galle dated 16.10.2017 in Case No. 51711116.

Facts of the Case:

The accused-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'accused') was charged in

the Magistrate's Court of Galle for transporting 5 Jack tree logs worth of Rs.

39859.34 on or about 20.03.2016, utilizing a lorry bearing No. 43-9223 and

thereby committed an offence punishable under section 25(2) of the Forest

Ordinance. The accused pleaded guilty on 28.03.2016 and the Learned Magistrate

convicted him accordingly and imposed a fine of Rupees 5000/=.

Page 3 of 11

Thereafter, a vehicle inquiry was held with regard to the lorry bearing number No.

43-9223 and the petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant')

claimed the vehicle in the said inquiry. After concluding the inquiry, the Learned

Magistrate had confiscated the vehicle by order dated 16.10.2017.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed a revision application in the

Provincial High Court of Southern Province holden in Galle bearing No. REV

237/2017. However, the appellant withdrew the same on 11.01.2018 due to a

defect in the prayer of the petition, reserving her right tQ file a fresh application.

Thereafter, the appellant filed a revision application bearing No. REV 26112018.

The Learned High Court Judge has dismissed the said application without issuing

notices on the respondents, holding that the Learned Magistrate had arrived at the

correct conclusion.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal the appellant preferred an appeal to this

Court.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that;

1. The Learned Magistrate did not consider all the evidence given in the

Magistrate's Court.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has dismissed the application without

glvmg any reason

3. The petitioner has been doing this transport for last 23 years without

any previous convictions and pending cases.

4. The petitioner has no knowledge of transport of illegal timber.

5. Timber was not transported on a public road, it was only loaded to

put to a comer of the same land.

Page 4 of 11

6. Previous Learned High Court. Judge had issued notices, but the

present Learned High Court Judge has not issued notices and

therefore, it is discrimination.

It is noted that in the petition of appeal and in the written submissions of the

appellant, she was referred to as the 'petitioner', by mistake. Since this is an

appeal, it must be corrected as 'the appellant'.

The incident in question is summarized as follows;

As per the evidence of the accused-driver and the appellant, the vehicle was used

to transport cinnamon leaves, on the date of the incident. The accused and the

appellant are husband and wife. On the date of incident, one chamin silva who was

the owner of the timber had stopped the lorry and asked the accused-driver to shift

some logs of Jack tree that were in front of his house to a comer of the same land.

It was revealed that the timber owner had obtained a permit to cut down the said

Jack tree which was in his land. While the accused and the owner of timber were

loading to the lorry, Police officers of the Hikkaduwa Police had come there and

taken the accused into custody along with the vehicle. The accused -driver had

pleaded guilty to the charge framed against him, namely transporting Jack timber

illegally on Katukoliya road. The appellant testified that she was unaware of the

incident in question and she had advised her husband not to do any illegal activity.

The timber owner testified that he did not have a permit to transport the timber

even though he obtained a permit to cut the Jack tree. The accused-driver testified

that the timber owner showed him a permit, but the accused did not check the said

permit.

I wish to consider grounds of appeal of 01 and 03 to 05 together. I observe that the

accused-driver and the timber owner took up the position that they were not

Page 5 of 11

planning to transport timber on main road, b~t simply were trying to put the timber

to a comer of the same land. However, the accused-driver had pleaded guilty to the

charge framed against him which clearly mentioned that the accused was

transporting timber on Katukoliya road (Page 103 of the brief). I think the fact that

the Lorry was not on a main road, but inside a private land should have been

challenged at the time of conviction and not subsequently at the vehicle inquiry or

the appeal. On this issue, the Learned Magistrate has observed that both the

appellant and the accused had taken up the position that the vehicle was not on the

main road. Accordingly, the Learned Magistrate was of the view that the accused

had contradicted himself and therefore not creditworthy. At the same time, I

observe that the Learned Magistrate had evaluated all the evidence placed before

her and therefore, the 01 st and 5th grounds of appeal should fail.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant had no

knowledge of transport of illegal timber and the appellant had no previous

convictions or pending cases regarding the vehicle in question.

The Learned SSC for the respondent-respondent submitted that an offence which

comes under the Forest Ordinance cannot be committed regularly since the

Legislature had enacted strict law and as a safe guard method, firm decisions have

been taken. It was argued by the Learned SSC that the Legislature does not provide

any offender to commit the same offence more than once.

As per section 40(1)(b), all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used

in committing an offence under the Forest Ordinance, shall in addition to any other

punishment specified for such offence, be confiscated by Order of the convicting

Magistrate. Therefore it is trite law that any vehicle involved in an offence under

the Forest Ordinance is subject to confiscation upon a valid conviction. It is

observed that the amendment made to section 40 of the Forest Ordinance in 2009,

Page 6 of 11

requires Court to look into the preventive lI}easures taken by the vehicle owner

whose vehicle is involved in an offence under Forest Ordinance.

In the case of The Finance Company PLC. V. Agampodi Mahapedige

Priyantha Chandana and 5 others [SC AppeaI10SAl2008], it was held that,

"On a consideration of the ratio decidendi of all . the aforementioned

decisions, it is abundantly clear that in terms of section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance, as amended, if the owner of the vehicle in question was a third

party, no order of confiscation shall be made if that owner had proved to

the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent

the use of the said vehicle for the commission of the offence. The ratio

decidendi of all the aforementioned decisions also show that the owner has

to establish the said matter on a balance of probability. " (Emphasis added)

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted the case of Atapattu

Mudiyanselage Sadi Banda V. OIC, Police Station, Norton Bridge rCA (PHC)

0312013], in which it was held that,

" ... 1 am of the view, before making the Order of confiscation learned

Magistrate should have taken into consideration, value of the timber

transported, no allegations prior to this incident that the lorry had been

used for any illegal purpose, that the appellant and or the accused are

habitual offenders in this nature and no previous convictions, and the

acceptance of the fact that the Appellant did not have any knowledge about

the transporting of timber without a permit. On these facts the Court is of

the view that the confiscation of the lorry is not justifiable ... "

However in the case of W. JaJathge Surasena V. O.I.C, Hikkaduwa and 3

others rCA (PHC) APN 100/2014], it was held that,

Page 7 of 11

" ... A mere denial by the of Registered pwner of the fact that he did not have

knowledge, of the alleged commission is not sufficient as per the principle

laid down in the line of authorities regarding the confiscation, of a vehicle

which had been used for a commission of an offence for an unauthorized

purpose ... "

As law stands today, it is mandatory to prove preventive measures taken by a

vehicle owner in question, on a balance of probability. Undoubtedly, such burden

would not be discharged merely because the owner i!1 question did not have

knowledge about an offence being committed or because the vehicle was not

involved in an offence previously. The Learned Magistrate had correctly analyzed

this question and came to the conclusion that the appellant was not monitoring the

vehicle and she was aware only about the things told by her husband (the accused-

driver). Therefore, the Learned Magistrate was of the view that the appellant failed

to satisfy the Court, that she had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the

vehicle for the commission of the offence (Page 70 & 71 of the brief). I am of the

view that, above conclusion of the Learned Magistrate is well within law and

therefore, the grounds of appeal of 03 and 04 should fail.

Now I wish to consider grounds of appeal 02 and 06, in which it was contended

that the Leamed High Court Judge has not given any reason to dismiss the petition

and he did not consider any grounds which the Learned Counsel stated before the

Learned High Court Judge.

Since the appellant filed an application for revision in the High Court, the appellant

was required to prove the existence of exceptional circumstances.

In the case of Dharmaratne and another V. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. and

others (2003) 3 Sri L.R 24, it was held that,

Page 8 of 11

"Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court

selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of

rectification should be adopted. If such a selection process is not there

revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of every

litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision application or to

make an appeal In situations where the legislature has not given a right of

appeal. .. " (Emphasis added)

In the case of Rasheed Ali V. Mohamed Ali and others (1981) 2 SLR 29, it was

'. held that,

"The powers of revision conferred on the Court of Appeal are very wide and

the Court has discretion to exercise them whether an appeal lies or not or

whether an appeal had been taken or not. However this discretionary

remedy can be invoked only where there are exceptional circumstances

warranting the intervention of the court ... "

In light of above, it is understood that, a party who wishes to invoke revisionary

jurisdiction is required to demonstrate the existence of exceptional circumstances.

The Leamed High Court Judge, in his order, has considered the contradictory

position taken on behalf of the appellant even after the accused pleading guilty to

the charge. The Learned High Court Judge was of the view that Learned

Magistrate came to the correct conclusion after ' considering the above said

contradictory positions. Accordingly, the Learned High Court Judge refused to

issue notices on the respondents since there were not sufficient grounds to issue

notices.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant further argued that previous Learned High

Court Judge has issued notices however present Learned High Court Judge has not

Page 9 of 11

issued notices and it is discrimination. I observe that it was the same High Court

Judge who had held inquiry in both revision applications filed by the appellant.

There could have been a possibility that the Learned High Court Judge was aware

of the facts of the case since he had already issued notices in the previous

application filed by the appellant. I observe that the Learned High Court Judge has

adequately given reasons to refuse the application and therefore, there had been no

injustice or irregularity.

Considering above, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the Learned High

Court Judge and the order of the Learned Magistrate. Therefore, I affirm both

orders.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
