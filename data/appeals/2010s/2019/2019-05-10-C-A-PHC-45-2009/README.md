This is an appeal against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the Western Province

holden in Colombo dated 02.02.2009.

The Complainant-Respondent-Respondent (Complainant) filed a certificate against Three Coins

Company (Pvt) Limited, who is the Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent Company)

under section 89 of the Financial Statute of the Western Province No. 06 of 1990 as amended

(Statute) for the recovery of turnover tax in the Magistrates Court of Colombo. The amount

Page 4 of 16

sought to be recovered as turnover tax was a sum of Rs. 3,069A18/= inclusive of penalty. The

Respondent Company was noticed to show cause.

The Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant) filed an affidavit in his official capacity as the Chairman of

the Respondent Company and took up several objections to the application. After due inquiry

the learned Magistrate held that the Respondent Company is liable to pay the amount set out in

the certificate and directed the Respondent-Company to deposit the said sum in Court. He made

further order that in the event the Respondent Company failed to do so, the said amount should

be recovered as a fine from the Appellant and imposed a default sentence of 12 months rigorous

imprisonment.

The Appellant filed a revision application in the High Court of the Western Province holden in

Colombo which was dismissed and hence this appeal.

The Appellant on the invitation of Court by motion dated 17.09.2018 set out the grounds raised

in appeal which reads:

(1) Was the Appellant cited as a defaulter in the certificate filed by the Commissioner in terms

of section 89 of the Statute?

(2) Can a fine be imposed on a person other than a defaulter cited in such certificate in terms

of section 89 of the Statute?

(3) Can a sentence in lieu of such fine be imposed on a person other than a defaulter cited in

such certificate in terms of section 89 of the Statute?

(4) Can a director of a company who has never been summoned by Court be imposed a fine

in terms of section 89 of the Statute?

(5) Can a director of a company who has never been summoned by Court be imposed a

sentence in lieu of such fine in terms of section 89 of the Statute?

(6) Is the imposition of a fine on a person who has never been summoned by Court in terms

of section 89 of the Statute a breach of the rules of natural justice?

(7) Can the director of a company who is not cited as a defaulter in such certificate be made

vicariously liable for the taxes in such certificate in terms of section 89 of the Statute?

Page 5 of 16

(8) Is section 89 of the Statute ultra vires the legislative power of the Western Provincial

Council?

Before proceeding to consider the issues raised by the Appellant, it is important to appreciate

the basis of the order made by the learned Magistrate. The order has two parts. Firstly, he held

that the Respondent Company is liable to pay the amount set out in the certificate and directed

the Respondent-Company to deposit the said sum in Court. Secondly, he further held that in the

event the Respondent Company failed to do so, the said amount should be recovered as a fine

from the Appellant, who appeared as the Chairman of the Respondent Company, and imposed a

default sentence of 12 months rigorous imprisonment. Hence the second part of the order

became effective if and only when the Respondent Company failed to deposit the money as

directed.

Although the Respondent Company did not seek to impugn the order of the learned Magistrate

it failed to deposit the said amount in court.

Was the Appellant cited as a defaulter in the Certificate?

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant relying on section 89(1) of the Statute

submitted that it requires a certificate filed thereunder to identify the "defaulter" which in this

case was the Respondent Company and as the Appellant was not cited as a defaulter there was

no legal basis to make order against the Appellant when the law permitted orders to be made

only against the "defaulter".

The learned DSG submitted in response that the provisions of the Statute require a purposive

interpretation and that in terms of the deeming provision in section 85(3) read with section 21(1)

of the Statute the term "defaulter" includes both the Respondent Company and the Appellant.

Page 6 of 16

The learned Presidents Counsel relied on the decisions in M.E. De Silva v. The Commissioner of

Income Tax (51 N.L.R. 280), Ranjit Wijemanne v. Commissioner of Income Tax [Reports of Ceylon

Tax Cases Vol. I page 437], Philip v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue [Sriskantha's Law Reports

Vol. I Part 10 page 133], Hamza v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue [(1988) 1 Sri.L.R. 312], Ramlin

v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue [(1988) 2 Sri.L.R. 259] and Dias v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue [(2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 15] in support of his contention.

In M.E. De Silva v. The Commissioner of Income Tax (supra) the Commissioner of Income Tax

instituted proceedings under Section 80 of the Income Tax Ordinance for the recovery of a sum

of Rs. 9,720 as the amount in default. However, the defaulter was a company carrying on business

under the name of The Ceylon Building Syndicate Limited whereas the party named as the

defaulter in the certificate was the Managing Director of the said Company namely one Mr. M.E.

De Silva. Gratiaen J. held that a defaulter for the purposes of Section 80 of the Income Tax

Ordinance is a person who having been duly assessed under Section 64 of the said Ordinance as

being "chargeable with tax", has omitted, in contravention of Section 70, to pay such tax on or

before the date specified in the notice of assessment served on him as the person so chargeable.

This decision is based on the fact that it was the Managing Director who was named as the

defaulter in the certificate and not the company which had defaulted in the payment of taxes.

Furthermore, it is also based on the fact that section 62 of the Income Tax Ordinance does not

make the principal officer of a company chargeable out of his personal assets with income tax

levied on the Company's assessable income.

In order to have a better appreciation of the legal regime considered by court in that case, a

consideration of Section 62 of the Income Tax Ordinance is necessary. It reads as follows:

"The secretary, manager or other principal officer of every company or body of persons

corporate or incorporate shall be answerable for doing all such acts, matters or things as

are required to be done under the provisions of this Ordinance by such company or body

of persons:

Provided that any person to whom a notice has been given under the provisions of this

Ordinance on behalf of a company or body of persons shall be deemed to be the principal

Page 7 of 16

officer thereof unless he proves that he has no connection with the company or body of

persons, or that some other person resident in Ceylon is the principal officer thereof".

(emphasis added)

Having considered the above provision Gratiaen J. held that it does not impose any vicarious

liability on a Managing Director to pay the tax in default of the company. Thus, the ratio of M .E.

De Silva v. The Commissioner of Income Tax (supra) in my view is that a Managing Director of a

defaulting company cannot be named in the certificate filed before the Magistrates Court under

Section 80 of the Income Tax Ordinance as a defaulter for the recovery of the amount in default

of the company from his personal assets.

In Ranjit Wijemanne v. Commissioner of Income Tax (supra) Nagalingam S.P.J. quoted with

approval the reasoning of Gratiaen J. in M.E. De Silva v. The Commissioner of Income Tax (supra)

in a case where a Managing Director of a company was named in a certificate issued under

section 80(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance.

In Philip v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra) a principal officer of a company was named

in the certificate filed in terms of section 111(1) of the Inland Revenue Act NO.4 of 1963 in

relation to tax in default of the company. Having regard to the judgment of Gratiaen J. in M.E. De

Silva v. The Commissioner of Income Tax (supra) G.P.S. De Silva J. (as he was then) held that there

is no provision in the said Act to make the petitioner personally liable for tax due from the

company.

In Hamza v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra) Ramanathan J. held that taxes assessed

against a person who dies thereafter can in default of payment be recovered by recovery

proceedings filed in the Magistrate's Court against the administrator of the estate of the

deceased. It was held that the defense that he was not the person assessed is not available to

the administrator when recovery proceedings are filed against him in the Magistrate's Court to

recover taxes due from the deceased person whose estate he is administering. Although this case

was cited by the Appellant in support of the proposition that proceedings can only be taken

against a defaulter, it in fact supports the opposite.

Page 8 of 16

However, the reasoning must be understood in the context of the specific provision in section 49

of the Inland Revenue Act No.4 of 1963 which reads as follows:

"An executor of a deceased person shall be liable, to do all such acts, matters and things

as such deceased person would be liable to do under this Act if he were alive, and shall

be chargeable with income tax, wealth tax or gifts tax with which such deceased person

would be chargeable if he were alive in respect of all periods prior to the date of the death

of stack person".

But, in Ramlin v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra) two judges of this court did not follow

the reasoning in Hamza v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra). There the certificates in

respect of unpaid taxes was filed under Section 111(1) of the Inland Revenue Act No.4 of 1963

on the basis that the petitioner had defaulted in the payment of the said sums payable as taxes

on behalf of her late husband. This court held that the executor of a deceased person's estate is

chargeable with tax with which such deceased person would be chargeable if he were alive; but

for such liability to arise the executor should be charged with tax qua executor. It was further

held that a defaulter is a person who having been duly assessed as being 'chargeable with tax'

has omitted to pay such tax on or before the due date. As the petitioner had not been assessed

she was not a defaulter and therefore not liable to pay her late husband's taxes. Here again, the

court followed the reasoning in M.E. De Silva v. The Commissioner of Income Tax (supra).

In Dias v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) the Deputy Commissioner of Inland

Revenue filed a certificate of tax in default in the name of the petitioner claiming a certain sum

of money. The tax defaulter was a Company and the petitioner was sued on the basis of vicarious

liability. The trial Court held that in terms of Section 166 (1) of Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000

no action could be instituted against the Managing Director to recover tax defaulted by the

Company.

Page 9 of 16

In appeal this court held that the imposition of vicarious liability under a statute is not lightly to

be presumed and such liability must necessarily be imposed in clear and unambiguous language

and that there is no provision in the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000 which makes the principal

officer liable for tax due from the company and that he is not liable to pay from his personal

assets. Hence this decision is also based on facts similar to the facts in M.E. De Silva v. The

Commissioner of Income Tax (supra).

The facts in the instant case is different to the cases relied on by the Appellant. Here the

Respondent Company who was assessed and had to pay the turnover tax was named as the

defaulter. As the learned DSG correctly pointed out in the cases relied on by the Appellant the

attention of court does not appear to have been drawn to section 81 of the Income Tax Ordinance

and section 106 of the Inland Revenue Act No.4 of 1963 which are similar to section 85(3) of the

Statue which reads:

"where the tax payable during every quarter ... under section 11 and 12 and under section

... is not paid on or before the date specified therein such tax together with a penalty of

10 per cent of the tax and 2 percent of the tax in default for every month of non-payment

shall be deemed to be in default and the person liable to pay the tax shall be deemed to

be a defaulter." (emphasis added)

The consequences of the use of the word "deemed" was explained by Ranasinghe J. (as he was

then) in Jinawathie and Others v. Ema/in [(1986) 2 SrLL.R. 121 at 130] as follows:

"In statutes the expression "deemed" is commonly used for the purpose of creating a

statutory function so that the meaning of the word is extended to a subject matter which

it properly does not designate. Thus where a person is "deemed to be something" it only

means that whereas he is not in reality that something the Act of Parliament requires him

to be treated as if he were. Where a thing is deemed to be something, it does not mean

that it is that which it is deemed to be, but rather an admission that it is not what it is

deemed to be, and that notwithstanding it is not that particular thing it is nevertheless

deemed to be that thing. Where a statute declares that a person or thing shall be deemed

Page 10 of 16

to be or shall be treated as something which in reality it is not, it shall have to be treated

as so during the entire course of the proceeding ... "

Section 85(3) of the Statute deems every person liable to pay the tax as a defaulter. In the case

of natural persons this will in most instances be the person assessed. However, in relation to

every company or body of persons corporate or unincorporated there is no natural person who

can be held liable to perform the acts that must be done for example by a company in terms of

the Statute which is a consequence of the artificial imputation of legal personality on a company

by law.

Section 21(1) of the Statute reads:

"The Secretary, Manager, Director or other Principal Officer of every company or body of

persons corporate or unincorporated, shall be liable to do all such acts, matters or things

as are required to be done under the provisions of this Statute by such company or body

of persons." (emphasis added)

This section seeks to make certain category of officers liable to perform such acts which are

required to be done under the Statute by a company or body of persons corporate or

unincorporate. This is because a company can only act through its employees, from the board of

directors down. As Lord Hoffman stated in Meridian Global Funds Management Asia Limited v.

The Securities Commission Respondent [(1995) 2 A.C. 500 at page 506]:

"Judges sometimes say that a company "as such" cannot do anything; it must act by

servants or agents. This may seem an unexceptionable, even banal remark. And of course,

the meaning is usually perfectly clear. But a reference to a company "as such" might

suggest that there is something out there called the company of which one can

meaningfully say that it can or cannot do something. There is in fact no such thing as the

company as such, no ding an sich, only the applicable rules. To say that a company cannot

do something means only that there is no one whose doing of that act would, under the

applicable rules of attribution, count as an act of the company."

Page 11 of 16

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant submitted that section 21(1) of the Statute is

similar to section 62 of the Income Tax Ordinance and section 90(1) of the Inland Revenue Act

No.4 of 1963 which were considered in M.E. De Silva v. The Commissioner of Income Tax (supra),

Ranjit Wijemanne v. Commissioner of Income Tax (supra), Philip v. Commissioner of Inland

Revenue (supra), Hamza v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra), Ramlin v. Commissioner of

Inland Revenue (supra) and Dias v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) which held

that these provisions were insufficient to impose vicarious liability on the directors. However, as

pointed out above, the attention of court in those cases does not appear to have been drawn to

section 81 of the Income Tax Ordinance and section 106 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 4 of 1963

which are similar to section 85(3) of the Statue.

Furthermore, as the learned DSG submitted there is a qualitative difference in the terminology

in that the provisions that the court considered in the above revenue law cases use the word

"answerable" whereas section 21(1) of the Statute uses the word "liable" while the Sinhala text,

which is the governing text, uses the word lIe)m=3e)~l!S)~" thereby imposing a higher obligation.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the word "defaulter" in section 89(1) of the Statute includes

the Respondent Company which was assessed and the Secretary, Manager, Director or other

Principal Officer of the Respondent Company on whom a statutory obligation to perform all acts

of the Company has been imposed by section 21(1) of the Statute.

The Appellant is a defaulter as firstly there is a default by the Respondent Company and secondly

in his affidavit filed in the Magistrate's Court [Appeal Brief Page 56] it is admitted that he is the

Chairman of the Respondent Company.

Can a fine be imposed on a person other than a defaulter?

For the reasons set out above, the Appellant is a defaulter. Furthermore, firstly, the learned

Magistrate held that the Respondent Company is liable to pay the amount set out in the

certificate and directed the Respondent-Company to deposit the said sum in Court and only

where it failed to do so did, he ordered the said amount to be recovered as a fine from the

Appellant.

Page 12 of 16

Can a sentence in lieu of such fine be imposed on a person other than a defaulter cited in such

certificate in terms of section 89 of the Statute?

This issue is raised on the basis that the Appellant is not a defaulter within the meaning of the

Statute. For the reasons set out above he is a defaulter.

Can a director of a company who has never been summoned by Court be imposed a fine in terms

of section 89 of the Statute?

Can a director of a company who has never been summoned by Court be imposed a sentence

in lieu of such fine in terms of section 89 of the Statute?

Is the imposition of a fine on a person who has never been summoned by Court in terms of

section 89 of the Statute a breach of the rules of natural justice?

All these issues are based on the alleged violation of the rules of natural justice as the Appellant

contends that he was never summoned under section 89(1) of the Statute and asked to show

cause.

There is no dispute that the Appellant filed an affidavit and was heard by the learned Magistrate.

He appeared before court voluntarily. He cannot now be heard to state that he was not given a

hearing. In considering this issue it is important to reiterate the order made by the learned

Magistrate.

Firstly, he held that the Respondent Company is liable to pay the amount set out in the certificate

and directed the Respondent-Company to deposit the said sum in Court. Secondly, he further

held that in the event the Respondent Company failed to do so, the said amount should be

recovered as a fine from the Appellant, who appeared as the Chairman of the Respondent

Company, and imposed a default sentence of 12 months rigorous imprisonment. Hence the

second part of the order became effective if and only when the Respondent Company failed to

deposit the money as directed.

Page 13 of 16

Thus, any implications on the Appellant from the said order arises only where the Respondent

Company failed to pay the outstanding tax which amount the Respondent Company has not

contested before a court of law.

Yet the Appellant has not given any reasons as to why the Respondent Company has still not paid

the outstanding tax. Such an explanation is most appropriate from the Appellant given that he is

the Chairman of the Respondent Company. Instead he has sought to raise legal arguments as to

why he should not be held liable.

This raises the issue of the conduct of the Appellant which the learned DSG did during the

argument. The Supreme Court in Seneviratne v. Abeykoon [(1986) 2 SrLL.R. 1] held that the

conduct of the plaintiff (failure to make full disclosure of the material facts in his application for

revision. delaying tactics when the defendant sought restoration of possession in the District

Court, forcibly evicting the tenant and leaving the island after installing another tenant in the

premises) disentitled him to revisionary relief.

Similarly, given that the Appellant is the Chairman of the Respondent Company and the fact that

the Respondent Company has not assailed the order of the learned Magistrate, and that the

Appellant has failed to explain as Chairman why the Respondent Company has not paid the

turnover tax is a ground by itself which entitled the learned High Court Judge to refuse any relief

to the Appellant in the revision application.

Can the director of a company who is not cited as a defaulter in such certificate be made

vicariously liable for the taxes in such certificate in terms of section 89 of the Statute?

No vicarious liability has been imposed on the Appellant. The first part of the order holds that

the Respondent Company is liable to pay the amount set out in the certificate and directs the

Respondent-Company to deposit the said sum in Court. In the event the Respondent Company

failed to do so, the said amount should be recovered as a fine from the Appellant, who appeared

as the Chairman of the Respondent Company, and imposed a default sentence of 12 months

rigorous imprisonment. Hence the second part of the order became effective if and only when

the Respondent Company failed to deposit the money as directed and is based on the provisions

contained in sections 85(3) and 21(1) of the Statue as explained above. In other words, the

Page 14 of 16

liability of the Appellant arises as he failed to do all such acts, matters or things as are required

to be done under the provisions of the Statute by the Respondent Company.

Is section 89 of the Statute ultra vires the legislative power of the Western Provincial Council?

This ground was never raised before any of the two lower courts. None of the parties submitted

that this issue involves an interpretation of the Constitution and therefore that the matter should

be referred to the Supreme Court.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant submitted that section 89(1} of the Statute

seeks to set out the power of the Magistrates Court whereas the Provincial Council does not have

power to legislate on power of Court. He relied on the Reserved List item which reads "Justice in

so for as in relates to the judiciary and the courts structure".

The learned DSG on the other hand submitted that the Provincial Council has power in terms of

the Provincial Council List to legislate on turnover taxes (item 36.1" fines imposed by Courts (item

36.8) and offences against statutes with respect of any of the matters specified in the list (item

32) which includes recovery proceedings on the principle that the greater power includes the

lesser.

I hold that on a plain reading of the relevant constitutional provisions the procedure set out in

section 89(1} of the Statute is recovery proceedings Simpliciter on the principle that the greater

power includes the lesser [Government Medical Officers Association and Another v. Senanayake

(2001) 3 SrLL.R. 377] and is not caught up within Reserved List item "Justice in so far as in relates

to the judiciary and the courts structure".

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court

Judge of the Western Province holden in Colombo dated 02.02.2009.
