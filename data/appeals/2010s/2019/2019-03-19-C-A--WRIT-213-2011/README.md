Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel for the

Petitioners informed this Court that he would only be pursuing the reliefs prayed

for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer to the petition, namely:

, 1

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the order dated 19th October 2010 delivered by

the University Services Appeals Board comprising of the 59th -61st

Respondents, annexed to the petition marked '?:.';

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the clarifications made in the letters annexed to

the petition marked 'P1S' and 'P1G' issued under the hand of the Secretary

/the Additional Secretary of the 1st Respondent, University Grants

Commission.

The primary issue that arises in this application is whether the decision of the

University Services Appeals Board (USAB) that held that Sub-Wardens attached to

Universities must complete 13 years of service as Sub-Wardens (Grade I) prior to

being eligible for promotion to Sub-Warden (Special Grade) is irrational and if so,

whether the said decision is liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

The facts of this case very briefly are as follows.

The 1st Petitioner is the 'Inter University Sub-Warden Union', a trade union

comprising of Sub-Wardens of all Universities. The 2nd Petitioner is the Secretary

8

w

of the 1

st Petitioner Union. The 2nd Petitioner had been appointed as a full time

Sub-Warden (Grade II) with effect from 16th December 1985 by the 9th

Respondent, University of Peradeniya and having functioned for 13 years as a

Sub-Warden (Grade I), the 2nd Petitioner had been promoted to Sub-Warden

(Special Grade) in 2008.

, 1

The Petitioners state that residential facilities were made available to students

from the inception of the University system with full time Wardens being

appointed to be in charge of the hostels. The Petitioners state further that even

though full time Sub- Wardens were appointed for the first time in 1973, a proper

scheme of recruitment of Sub-Wardens was implemented only after the 1st

Respondent, University Grants Commission (the UGC), was established in 1978

under the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978.

The first Scheme of Recruitment for Sub-Wardens was introduced in 1981, when

the UGC, acting in terms of the power vested in it by Section 18(2)(c) of the

Universities Ace issued Commission Circular No. 134, titled 'Schemes of

Recruitment - Administrative and Financial Officers Grades and Clerical and Allied

Grades.'2 The scheme of recruitment annexed thereto specified that the post of

Sub-Warden shall be full time, selection shall be by interview and that the

candidate should be a graduate from a recognised University who is no more than

40 years of age. It was also stated that preference would be given to those with

1 Section 18(2)(c) reads as follows: Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by subsection (1). the Commission may make Ordinances in respect of all or any of the following matters: the schemes of recruitment, and the procedures for appointment, to th e staff of the Commission and of the Higher E d u~ at i o nal Institutions;

2 A copy of the said Circular dated 22

nd June 1981 has been annexed to the petition, marked 'P3' . The specific scheme of recruitment has been annexed as 'P3a'.

experience in administration and management of Hostels. The said Circular did

not provide for any promotional path for the Sub-Wardens so appointed.

On 1st January 1985, the UGC, having considered the representations made by

certain Universities, created a promotional grade for the post of Sub-Warden by

in-troducing a new category known as Sub Warden (Grade I). This is reflected in

Circular No. 290 issued by the UGC, annexed to the Petition marked 'p4'.

According to the scheme of recruitment annexed to the said circular, the

promotional criteria for the post of Sub-Warden (Grade I) was as follows:

"A Sub-Warden Grade II, who has completed 10 years of satisfactory service

in that Grade may be considered for promotion to the post of Sub-Warden

Grade 1./1

Although the Petitioners have not submitted the salary scale at the time the post

of Sub-Warden (Grade I) was created, the Petitioners have annexed the salary

scale applicable to the post of Sub- Warden (Grade I) and (Grade II) that was

introduced by the UGC by way of Commission Circular No. 416 dated 29th January

1990, anne~ed to the petition marked 'P6'. The said Circular reads as follows:

"The University Grants Commission at its 283rd meeting held on 6th

December 1989 decided to revise the Salary Codes and Salary Scales of Sub-

Warden (Full time), Grade II and Grade I, with effect from 1st September

1989 as follows:-

10

(a) Sub-Warden (Full Time) Grade II

A-OS (a) Rs. 3050 - 10 x 75 - 3800 p.m.

(b) Sub- Warden (Full Time) Grade I

A - 04 (a) Rs. 3900 - 10 x 150 - 5 x 200 - 6400 p.m."

, 1 Thus, the salary scale set out in Circular 'P6' reflects the number of years that a

Sub-Warden is required to serve in Grade II prior to being promoted to Grade I.

Furthermore, in terms of the said Circular P6', it takes a Sub Warden (Grade I) a

minimum of 15 years in service in that Grade to reach the maximum salary scale.

By Circular No. 525 dated 30th June 1992 annexed to the petition marked 'pg', a

further promotional position was introduced by the UGC for the post of full time

Sub Warden by the introduction of a cadre position known as ((Sub-Warden

(Special Grade)". According to the said Circular, a person holding the post of Sub

Warden (Grade I), may be considered for promotion to the post of Sub Warden-

(Special Grade), in the following manner:

((A Sub-Warden, Grade I who has spent 1 year on the maximum of the

salary scale may be considered for promotion."

Thus, the cumulative effect of Circulars 'P4', 'P6' and 'pg' is that a Sub-Warden

belonging to Grade (II) was eligible for promotion to Sub-Warden (Grade I) after

10 years of service in Grade II. A Sub-Warden (Grade I) is entitled to fifteen salary

increments and would reach the highest salary scale only in the 16th year in

11

service in the post of Sub-Warden {Grade 1).3 It was only thereafter - that is after a

minimum of 16 years of service in Sub-Warden (Grade I) of which 1 year of service

has been on the maximum salary scale - that a Sub-Warden (Grade I) was eligible

to be promoted to Sub-Warden (Special Grade).

The minimuml. number of 10 years that was required in order to be promoted

from Grade II to Grade I was reduced to 7 years by the 1st Respondent in 1995

through UGC Circular No. 623 annexed to the petition marked 'pg'. According to

the amended scheme of recruitment annexed to the said Circular, the revised

criteria for promotion from Sub Warden Grade II to Grade I was as follows:

"A Sub-Warden, Grade II, who has completed 7 years of satisfactory service

in that Grade may be considered for promotion to the post of Sub-Warden

Grade I."

Thus, after the introduction of the Circular 'pg' in 1995, a person joining as Sub-

Warden (Grade II) was required to serve 7 years in that Grade prior to becoming

eligible to be promoted to Grade (I). Thereafter such person was required to serve

a minimum of another 16 years in Grade (I) including one year on the maximum

salary scale prior to becoming eligible to be promoted to Special Grade.

The issue that gives rise to the present application arose in 1998 with the issuance

by the UGC of the letter dated 1ih February 1998, annexed to the petition

marked 'P13'. The relevant portions of the said letter, which is titled

3 This is on the assumption that a Sub-Warden (Grade I) would earn each salary increment on the due date.

12

"Amendments of Scheme of Recruitment of Non- academic Grades carrying ADS -

Als salary scales" reads as follows:

"The University Grants Commission at its sD3 rd meeting held on 24th October

1997 granted approval for the reduction of periods of services required for

promotibns to next higher grades specified in the approved Schemes of

Recruitment and creation of new grades indicated in Annex I and II.

Please note that above amendments are valid until such time the Scheme of

Recruitment are formally revised by issuing a Commission circular in this

respect."

Annex I to the said letter has been produced with (P13'. The said annexure is

titled, (Reduction of period of service required for promotion to next higher

grades specified in the scheme of recruitment' and sets out 85 categories that are

sought to be amended by (P13'. Category 84 is relevant to this application and is

re-produced below:

Post and Grade No. of years of service No. of years of service

salary code required for promotion in required for promotion in

terms of existing SOR terms of existing SOR

84 Sub Grade 1 year on the maximum of 13 years

Warden I the sa lary scale

(Full time)

(A-4b)

13

The Petitioners state that the said Circular 'p13' created 'an ambiguity' in respect

of the period of service that a Sub Warden needs to serve in order to be eligible

to be promoted to the Special Grade. The 'ambiguity', according to the Petitioners

was whether the 13 years introduced by 'P13' should be the total period of

service as a S'Jb Warden- fn both Grade I and Grade II, or whether the 13 years is

only in respect of the years of service as Sub Warden (Grade I).

The Petitioners state that subsequent to 'P13' coming into effect, several

Universities proceeded to promote their Sub Wardens to the post of Sub Warden

(Special Grade) on the basis of a total of 13 years of service in Grades I and 114,

while other Universities such as the 9th Respondent University, refrained from

calling for applications for promotion of Sub Wardens (Grade I) to the next grade

of Sub Warden (Special Grade) unless they had completed 13 years of service in

Sub-Warden (Grade I).

The Petitioners state that due to the said ambiguity, they made a submission to

the 9th Respondent University to request the UGC to intervene and resolve the

said matter. In response to the request made by the Registrar of the 9th

Respondent University to the Secretary of the UGC, the Secretary of the UGC had

issued the following two letters to the Registrar of the 9th Respondent clarifying

the alleged ambiguity:

~he Petitioners have annexed to the petition, marked P14A, B, C and 0, notices issued by the Assistant Registrar of the University of Moratuwa, calling for applications for promotion to Sub Warden (Special Grade). These notices specify that the required period of service to be promoted to Sub Warden (Special Grade) was 13 years of service

as a Sub Warden or 1 year of service in the maximum salary scale. This Court observes that both requirements violate the provisions of 'P13'.

The contents of 'P15' and 'P16' very clearly specify that the service requirement

, 1 stated in 'P13' is not the total period of service as a Sub-Warden (Grade I and

Grade II), but only the period of service of 13 years as Sub-Warden (Grade 1).The

said letters clarify further that the number of years of service for promotion to

Sub-Warden (Special Grade) from Sub-Warden (Grade I) was initially 16 years, and

it is this period which has been reduced by 3 years to 13 years by 'P13'.

The Petitioners, being aggrieved by the said clarification in 'P15' and 'P16' and

acting in terms of Section 86 of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978, as amended,

filed an appeal with the USAB praying inter alia for the following relief:s

i. To grant an order that the letter issued by the UGC dated 23rd

September 2008 (P16), is null and void;

ii. To grant an order to promote and appoint all members of the Inter

University Sub Warden Union who have already completed 13 years of

service in the post of Sub-Warden to the post of Sub Warden (Special

Grade) and to pay their unpaid wages.

5 The petition of appeal has been annexed to the petition, marked '~' .

16

The USAB, having heard the parties as well as having afforded the parties an

opportunity of filing written submissions, by its order dated 19th October 2010,

annexed to the petition marked IZ/, dismissed the appeal of the Petitioners.

The Petitioners thereafter filed this application, seeking a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the said Order '?:,' as well as the two letters 'P1S' and 'P16'. The primary

grievance of the Petitioners is in relation to the decision of the USAB in relation to

the alleged ambiguity contained in Ip13/, on the basis that the said decision is

irrationat not supported by evidence and is unreasonable.

Prior to considering what was sought to be effected by 'P13', this Court would like

to reiterate the scheme of recruitment and promotion for Sub-Wardens in terms

of the Circulars that existed at the time 'P13' was issued. The first step was

recruitment to the post of Sub-Warden of persons who possessed the required

qualifications. The second step in the ladder was that a Sub-Warden belonging to

Grade (II) was eligible for promotion to Sub-Warden (Grade I) after 7 years of

service in Grade II. Once appointed as a Sub-Warden (Grade I), which was a post

that provided for 15 salary increments, a person was required to earn the said

fifteen salary increments and serve one year in the highest salary scale. On the

assumption that a Sub-Warden (Grade I) earns each salary increment on the due

date, a Sub -Warden (Grade I) would need to serve 16 years in the post of Sub-

Warden (Grade I). It was only thereafter - that is after a minimum of 16 years of

service in Sub-Warden (Grade I) of which 1 year of service has been on the

maximum salary scale - that a Sub-Warden (Grade I) was eligible to be prc:>moted

to Sub-Warden (Special Grade).

17

This Court will now consider the disputed document in this application, 'P13' and

what it sought to do.

Paragraph 1 of 'P13' reads as follows:

, )

"The University Grants Commission at its S03rd meeting held on 24th October

1997 granted approval for the reduction of periods of services required for

promotions to next higher grades specified in the approved Schemes of

Recruitment and creation of new grades indicated in Annex I and II"

~@~ &sS~~~)@ =8)o)~el) @!mJ@e ~)~ ef~Q) !mo efl:Q)."

Thus, it is clear that what was sought to be effected by 'P13' was to reduce the

number of years required to be promoted from the existing grade to the next

higher grade, as indicated in Annex I and II.

Annex 1 is titled 'Reduction of period of service required for promotion to the

next higher grades specified in the approved scheme of recruitment.' Category 84

of Annex I sets out that the amendment is being done to the scheme of

recruitment for the post of "Sub-Warden (Special Grade)". The words, 'next

higher grade' means from 'Grade I' to 'Special Grade'. This is confirmed when one

considers that Column 4 of Annex I itself sets out the 'number of years of service

18

that is required for promotion in terms of the existing scheme of recruitmenf as

being '1 year on the maximum of the salary scale'. In terms of Circular 'pg', it is

only a "Sub-Warden (Grade I) who has spent 1 year on the maximum of the

salary scale" who is considered for promotion to the Special Grade. The question

of Sub-Warden (Grade II) spending "one year on the maximum salary scale" is not

provided for lin the circular relating to the promotion of Sub-Warden (Grade II)

and therefore the reference to "1 year on the maximum of the salary scale" must

mean a reference to Sub-Warden Grade I. Thus, it is clear that the Circular 'P13'

only reduced the number of years that a person was required to serve in Grade I

from a minimum of 16 years to 13 years. 'P13' does not interfere with the 7 years

of service that a person must serve in Grade II before being promoted to Grade I.

This Court is therefore of the view that a person who joins the service as a Sub-

Warden (Grade II) is required to serve 7 years in Grade II and once promoted to

Grade I, a further 13 years in Grade I before becoming eligible to be promoted to

the Special Grade. To hold otherwise would amount to a violation of the simple

and clear language used in 'P13'. In these circumstances, this Court takes the view

that there was no ambiguity in the language of 'P13' that required clarification by

the UGc.

This is the conclusion that was reached by the USAB. For the reasons set out in

this judgment, this Court does not see any illegality or irrationality with the said

conclusion of the USAB. The said decision is reasonable and is a decision which

any sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided

19

would have arrived at6. Thus, this Court does not see any merit in the primary

argument of the Petitioners.

The Petitioners have also taken up the position that the letters marked 'P1S' and

'P16' seek to amend the scheme of recruitment set out in 'P13'. The Petitioners

state further] that-as the Commission members have not authorised the Secretary

to the UGC to issue the said letters, the Secretary to the UGC does not have

power to issue the said letters and hence, 'P15' and 'P16' are illegal.

This Court must observe at the outset that the Circulars 'P3', 'P4', 'P6', 'P7', 'PS', -- ------ --

'pg', 'P10' and 'Pll' have all been signed by the Secretary or on behalf of the

Secretary of the UGC and thus, there is nothing abnormal in the letters 'P1S' and

'P16' being sent under the hand of the Secretary of the UGc. This Court has

examined the contents of the said two letters 'P1S' and 'P16' and is of the view ------

that the said letters do not seek in any manner to amend 'P13'. It is only a

reiteration of the position set out in 'P13' or as the Petitioners themselves cla im,

what was provided was only a c1arification

7 This Court is therefore of the view

that the approval of the Commission was not required to issue the said letters as

no determination different to what was set out in 'P13' was being made. In other

words, nothing turns on 'P1S' and 'P16' as the Petitioners were still entitled to

challenge their entitlement to promotions which they in fact did before the USAB.

6 Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service [1985 AC 374] - "By 'irrationality' I

mean what can now be succinctly referred to as 'Wednesbury unreasonableness'. It applies to a decisioQ which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it."

The contention of the Petitioners that the Chairman of the UGC is required to

obtain authority from the Commission in order to function in terms of the

provisions of Section 7(3) read with Section 18(2)(c) of the Act and that such

powers cannot be delegated are not relevant for the simple reason that the

Secretary, by issuing the said letters 'PIS' and 'P16' have not sought to amend the

scheme of reeruitment set out in 'P13', This Court cannot hold that the approval

of the Commission is required to issue a simple letter such as 'PIS' or 'P16', In any

event, no prejudice has been caused to the Petitioners in view of this Court

holding that the only interpretation that can be given to 'P13' is that the

reference to 13 years is the number of years that a Sub-Warden is required to

serve in Grade I and that there is no ambiguity in that regard in 'P13',

The Petitioners have cited the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of

University of Ruhuna vs. Dharshana Wickramasinghe and others8, where it was

held by the Supreme Court that as the Council of the University of Ruhuna was

the disciplinary authority in terms of the Universities Act, a charge sheet not

approved by the Council was a nullity as it had been issued without proper

authority, In the present case, the decision relating to the amendment to the

scheme of recruitment reflected in 'P13' has been taken by the Commission and

hence, 'P13' is not illegal. This Court reiterates that the letters 'PIS' and 'P16' did

not seek to impose any additional conditions to the scheme of recruitment

applicable to the Petitioners and hence, did not require the approval of the

Commission,

In these circumstances, this Court is in agreement with the conclusion reached by

the USAB that "the Secretary has not either changed or altered or amended the

ruling by the UGCJJ and therefore this Court does not see any merit in the second

argument of the Petitioners.

For the reasons set out in this judgment, this Court sees no legal basis to issue the

Writs of Certiorari prayed for. This application is accordingly dismissed, without

costs.
