This refers to an appeal from the judgment of the Learned District Judge

of Puttalam in respect of a Land action bearing case Number 478/L.

The Plaintiffs Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiffs)

instituted this action seeking for an injunction restraining the Defendant-

Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Defendants) and all those

people who claim through and under them or on their behalf, from using

the right of way and access and declaration of title to the property

described in the schedules A and B absolutely.

The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiffs wrongfully and unlawfully

obstructed the right of way and they are entitled to the right of way by

necessity.

The Learned District Judge of Puttalam who heard the evidence and in

his judgment delivered on 14th December 1998 urged that, the

Defendants has acquired prescriptive title to the landmarked Z shown

in the plan No. 447 and the right of way and that they entitled to have

access through A, B, C shown in Plan No. 447 from 3rd Cross Street.

Finally he dismissed the case.

The Plaintiffs being aggrieved with the judgment of the Learned District

Judge appealed and prayed to set aside the judgment dated 14.12.1998.

The Plaintiffs contented that according to Deed of Gifts bearing No. 2992

dated 02.03.1962 attested by H.S. Ismail Notary Public of Puttalam and

No. 5786 dated 11.09.1980 attested by Sinna Meerapillai Mohamed

Ibunu Notary Public of Puttalam that the 1st Plaintiff is entitled to the

premises described in the Schedule A to the plaint and the 2nd Plaintiff is

entitled to the schedule B to the plaint.

Further, the Plaintiffs contented that according to the survey Plan No.

447 lot X and Lot Y belongs to the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs respectfully and

lot Z belongs to the Defendants. In order to enter the Lot X and Y the

right of way starts from the point A and then to B and in order to enter

Lot Z which belongs to the Defendants there is another point E to D.

Further, the Plaintiffs admitted that they had made a clear fence

between the land in front of Lot X, Y, and Z is a zinc fence along to the

point C.

The Defendants pleaded that the 3rd Defendant who is the father of the

1st and 2nd Defendants purchased the Lot Z upon the Deed Nos. 9559 and

4

9560 dated 12/02/1983 attested by S.M. Aboothahir Notary Public of

Puttalam in high regard of the 1st and 2nd Defendants and he divided the

house in to two blocks and given the southern block to the 1st defendant

and the Northern block to the 2nd defendant. According to deed No.

9559 the access to the Northern block the Western boundary is shown

as pathway being the common means of access.

The Defendants further submitted that the Plaintiffs on or about 14th

March 1983 wrongfully and unlawfully obstructed the said right of way

and the Defendants and their predecessors were in use of the same right

of way over 50 years and claimed the prescriptive title to the right of

way.

It is noted that the Defendants purchased the premises according to

Deeds Nos 9559 and 9560 dated 12.02.1983 and the schedule of the

deeds provided the pathway for common means of access and then the

Plaintiffs had made the fence to obstruct the right of way of the

Defendants on or after 14.03.1983. It is clear though the Defendant had

the common means of access granted by way of Deed No 9559 but it is

intentionally restrained by the conduct of the Plaintiffs.

It is observed that the plaintiffs pleaded that the conducts of the

Defendants had caused loss and damages to them, but the Plaintiffs had

failed prove the alleged loss and damages suffered by them before the

trial Court.

It is important to consider that there was a complaint lodged at the

Police Station of Puttalam by the Defendants and transferred to the

5

respective Primary Court under case No. 7122/P upon the unlawful

obstruction by the plaintiffs to use the common pathway. The primary

court had ordered in favour of the Defendants.

I agree with the same view of the Learned District Judge of Puttalam that

the Defendant had prescribed the said right of way and they are entitled

to the right of way as it exists now.

I am of the firm view, that the Learned District Judge has delivered his

judgment after due consideration of all relevant and attended material

facts thereto. Therefore, I see there is no justifiable reason to interfere

with the judgment of the Learned District Judge of Puttalam.

For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the appeal of the Plaintiffs

Appellants with cost.

Appeal dismissed
