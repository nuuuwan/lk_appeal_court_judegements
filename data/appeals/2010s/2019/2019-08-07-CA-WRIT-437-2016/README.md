Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner filed this application against the Respondents who

are the Minister of Lands and the Divisional Secretary of

Aranayake seeking to quash Section 2 Notice issued under the

Land Acquisition Act by the latter on the direction of the former

by way of writ of certiorari.

The Petitioner does not have paper title to the land. He seems to

have been in possession of this land with several others.

In the said Section 2 Notice the public purpose for which the

land was to be acquired had clearly been stated. That is to

resettle the victims of massive earth slip in Aranayake in the

year 2016. The Petitioner does not dispute it.

If that is not disputed, the Petitioner cannot seek to quash

Section 2 Notice as there was no determination for this Court to

quash by way of writ.

In terms of section 2 of the Act, that is a Notice to be exhibited

in some conspicuous places in that area where the land is

situated in order to investigate the suitability of the land for the

intended public purpose. Such investigation may or may not

ultimately result in acquisition.

The Petitioners application as presented before Court was

therefore premature and not ripe for review. Vide Dayaratne v.

Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Lands [2006] 1 Sri LR 7 at 18-21,

Ranawickrema v. Minister of Agriculture [2006] 1 Sri LR 42.

On that ground alone, this application should have been

dismissed in limine.

3

The Respondents filed objections stating inter alia that the land

had already been acquired and vested in the State by virtue of

proviso (a) to section 38 of the said Act and therefore the action

is futile. A copy of the Gazette was tendered marked 2R1.

The Petitioner was unmoved even after such revelations. He did

not make any attempt to amend papers.

According to proviso (a) to section 38 of the Act, in case of

urgency, the Minister can make a Vesting Order, at any time

after Section 2 Notice, without following the normal procedure

set out in the Act.

I see no merit in the application of the Petitioner.

Application is dismissed but without costs.
