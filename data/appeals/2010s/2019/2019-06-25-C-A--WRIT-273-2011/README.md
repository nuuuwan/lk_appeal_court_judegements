Tendered on behalf of the Respondents on 29th January

3rd June 2019

The issues that arise for determination in this application are twofold. The first

is whether the decision by the 1st Respondent, Commissioner General of

Labour that the Petitioner must pay its employees who were engaged in

providing services in terms of the agreement annexed to the petition marked

'P2', wages in accordance with the Wages Board for the "Dock, Harbour and

Port Transport" category is illegal and/or unreasonable. The second issue is

whether there has been any procedural impropriety on the part of the 1st

Respondent in arriving at the said decision.

The background facts relating to the dispute that led to the above decision are

briefly as follows.

2

..

The Petitioner states that it carries on inter alia the business of operating a

category of vehicles commonly known as IIPrime Movers" which are used for

the purpose of transporting containers. The Petitioner states further that as

part of its operations, it uses its Prime Mover vehicles to transport laden or

unladen containers within the premises of the South Asia Gateway Terminal

(SAGT) situated inside the Colombo Port. The Petitioner states that the above

operation is limited to the transporting of the containers from the shipside to

the designated container stacks or vice versa and that the said operation does

not include any aspect of loading or unloading the containers, or any other

affiliated service.

The Petitioner states that in or about 2002, it was appOinted by SAGT as its

exclusive Inter Terminal Vehicle operator. Although proof has not been

submitted of any written arrangement entered into in 2002, the Petitioner has

annexed to the petition marked Ip2', an agreement it entered into with SAGT

in 2007. The preamble to Ip2' reads as follows: IIWhereas SAGT is desirous of

obtaining the services of a suitable organisation to operate its fleet of

container transport vehicles within the container terminal SAGT". The said

vehicles have been referred to in the agreement as IIITVs", which the

Petitioner claims stand for IIlnter-Terminal Vehicle".

It is not in dispute that the Petitioner was the sole provider of the said service

to the SAGT; that the said vehicles were operated only within the SAGT

terminal;l that the services provided in terms of the agreement Ip2' did not

require the Petitioner to transport any container on a public road; and that the

said agreement was valid for a period of three years.

1 Vide paragraph 7 of Annexure 'A' of 'Pl'.

3

According to Clause 2.1 of the said agreement 'P2', the Petitioner was required

to provide operators to operate SAGT's fleet of ITVs, and was responsible for

the operation of the said fleet of ITVs on a 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year

basis subject to prescribed operational procedures laid down by SAGT. Clause

3.7 of 'P2' provided that the Petitioner shall be responsible for the statutory

and all other dues arising from the employer/employee relationship between

the Petitioner company and the operators provided to SAGT under 'P2'.

This Court must observe that in the body of the agreement 'P2', the persons

employed by the Petitioner to carry out the said service are referred to as

'operators'. 'P2' does not contain any reference to the term 'Prime Mover

Drivers' as referred to by the Petitioner company/ nor does 'P2' refer to the

vehicles that are used as 'Prime Movers'. Clause 3.3(a) of 'P2' however

specifies that the operators are required to possess a valid driving license to

drive heavy vehicles and have experience in driving container haulage vehicles.

The Petitioner has annexed to the petition marked 'P7c', a standard form of

the contract of employment offered to its employees. This Court has examined

'P7c' and notes that the post is identified as 'Prime Mover Driver' and the duty

entrusted to an employee was to transport containers. While the place of

posting was the registered address of the Petitioner, paragraph 12 of 'P7c'

provided that an employee must obtain a special pass from the Sri Lanka Ports

Authority "in the event you are required to be employed at the port premises".

It is therefore clear to this Court that although employment had been offered

as drivers of Prime Mover vehicles, the Petitioner had reserved its right to

assign them to work within the Port, which shows that the employees were

2 Paragraph 2 of Annexure 'A' of 'P2' does refer to the operator as a driver.

4

not selected solely to perform services under and in terms of the agreement

'P2',

This brings this Court to the issue of wages payable to the employees who

were carrying out duties in terms of 'P2', The Petitioner states that since the

inception of its operations in 2002, the Petitioner had paid wages to the said

employees according to the scale of wages prescribed from time to time in

terms of Section 29(3)3 of the Wages Board Ordinance, under the classification

of the "Motor Transport Trade",4

The Petitioner states that in July 2010, the employees of the Petitioner struck

work and refused to carry out their duties unless twelve of their demands

contained in the letter annexed to the petition marked 'P12' were met, By

letter dated 30th July 2010, annexed to the petition marked 'P13/, the National

Union of Seafarers, Sri Lanka informed the 1st Respondent inter alia that the

'Container Truck Drivers' have stopped working due to a dispute in the

payment of their wages by the Petitioner company and have requested the 1st

Respondent to intervene and resolve the said dispute, The Petitioner states

that the aforementioned dispute caused severe disruption to the ability of the

Petitioner to carry out its services in terms of 'P2/. The Petitioner states

further that pursuant to the involvement of the 1st Respondent, 71 employees

reported back to work and recommenced their duties, and that the contracts

3Section 29(3) of the Wages Board Ordinance reads as follows: (3) No decision transmitted to the Minister under subsection (1) or returned to him under subsection (2) shall have effect unless it has been approved by the Minister. Every decision which has been approved by the Minister shall, together with a notification of such approval, be published in the Gazette and in one Sinhala, one Tamil and one English newspaper.

4 The categories of workers and the wages payable have been published by way of notifications in Gazette Extraordinary No.1494/14 dated 25th April 2007, marked 'P8'; Gazette Extraordinary No.1556/4 dated 30th

June 2008, marked 'P9'; Gazette Extraordinary No. 1660/35 dated 30th June 2010, marked 'PlO'.

of employment of 189 employees who did not return to work were

terminated.5

The employees thus complained to the Department of Labour that the

Petitioner did not make payments in accordance with the Notifications issued

from time to time by the Wages Board for the {(Dock, Harbour and Port

Transport Trade". The investigations commenced by the Department of Labour

into the said complaint, culminated in the 2nd Respondent, the Assistant

Commissioner of Labour issuing the Petitioner with the letter dated 28th

January 2011, annexed to the petition marked 'PIS'.

Aggrieved by the said decision in 'PIS' that the wages of the employees must

be paid in terms of the Wages Board for the "Dock, Harbour and Port

Transport Trade", the Petitioner filed this application, seeking a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision contained in 'PIS'. At the hearing of this

application, the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that

he is challenging 'PIS' on the following three grounds:

a) The Petitioner was not afforded a hearing;

b) The Respondents have failed to provide reasons for its decision; and

c) The classification of the employees as 'riggers' is wrong and

unreasonable.

In reviewing 'PIS', this Court would strictly limit itself to considering whether

'PIS' is illegal, irrational or whether there was any procedural impropriety in

SThe Petitioner states that these 189 employees have filed applications at the Labour Tribunal for unfair termination of employment and that the Petitioner company is resisting these applications before the Labour Tribunal.

6

arriving at the said decision in 'PIS'. In doing so, this Court would bear in mind

the following paragraph of Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions vs

Minister for the Civil Service6, when considering this application:

"Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without

reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come

about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds upon

which administrative action is subject to control by judiCial review. The

first ground I would call "illegality", the second "irrationality" and the

third "procedural impropriety".

This Court will now proceed to consider each of the three grounds urged by

the learned President's Counsel, in the light of the discussions that took place

between the Petitioner and the officers of the Department of Labour since the

first complaint was made in July 2011, and the correspondence that was

exchanged between the parties thereafter.

The Respondents have submitted that the employees of the Petitioner, having

resorted to industrial action on 30th July 2010, had submitted a letter on the

same date, produced by the Respondents marked 'Rl' stating that they have

not been paid wages in terms of the applicable Wages Board for the Harbour

and Port Trade7 set up under the Wages Board Ordinance.

The Respondents state that it invited the Petitioner as well as the employees

for a discussion on 30th July 2010 in order to discuss a resolution of the

industrial dispute that had arisen, in an expeditious manner. Accordingly, the

Petitioner and the representatives of the employees had attended a meeting

with the 2nd Respondent on 3rd August 2010. A copy of the minutes of the

meeting has been produced by the Respondents marked 'R3'. This Court

observes that the Human Resources Manager and the Director (Operations) of

the Petitioner Company had attended the said meeting. According to the

Respondents, the representative of the National Union of Seafarers had

handed over a letter stating that the said employees were not being paid in

accordance with the Wages Board Ordinance. A copy of the said letter has

been produced marked 'R2'.

The Respondents submit further that the dispute between the Petitioner and

its employees had not been resolved at the said meeting and therefore, two

further meetings were held with the representatives of the Petitioner and the

employees. According to the minutes of the meeting held on 5th August 2010

marked 'RS' and the minutes of the meeting held on 1 th August 2010, marked

'R6', this Court observes that the Managing Director of the Petitioner Company

had participated at the said meetings along with the Human Resources

Manager. The Respondents, while conceding that 71 of the employees who

resorted to industrial action, had been reinstated, states that the Department

of Labour proceeded to inquire into the complaint that the Petitioner did not

make payment of wages in accordance with the Wages Board relating to the

"Dock, Harbour and Port Transport Trade".

8

The fact that three meetings were held with the Senior Management of the

Petitioner demonstrates that the Petitioner was aware of the scope of the

investigations that were being carried out by the Department of Labour and

that it involved a consideration of the correct Wages Board in terms of which

the employees should be paid their wages. The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor

General has in fact drawn the attention of this Court to the final paragraph of

'RS' which reads as follows:

II ....... m~t;" eesJ~) mC)>1: em>go@~@~ C)3) e>o~ ge:>>eool tmd~tOO) OJ@e>

It is his position that the Senior Management of the Petitioner was put on

notice that the Respondents would inquire into whether the applicable Wages

Board was the "Dock, Habour and Port Transport Trade", and that there was

no objection by the Petitioner to such an investigation. The Respondents state

further that Officers of the Department of Labour had accordingly investigated

whether the said employees should be paid according to the notifications of

the Wages Board for the ({Dock, Harbour and Port Transport Trade" and in the

course of the said investigation, visited the office of the Petitioner in order to

seek relevant material and information. It is admitted by the Petitioner that

subsequent to the termination of employment of the said 189 persons,

Officers of the Department of Labour visited the office premises of the

Petitioner from time to time, on five separate occasions and carried out

inspections and gathered information and material in respect of the said

persons whose employment had been terminated. This too points out to the

9

fact that the Petitioner was aware of the scope of the investigation that was

being carried out by the Department of Labour.

Having recorded statements from some of the employees who had worked at

the SAGT, the 2nd Respondent had submitted an internal letter dated 1 ih

September 2010, marked 'RS' to the relevant Commissioner in the Department

of Labour, seeking an opinion on the correct classification that should be

applied to the said employees.

'RS' reads as follows:

8 'R9' is dated 5th October 2010.

11

According to 'R9', the applicable Wages Board for the said employees was the

Wages Board established in respect of the "Dock, Harbour and Port Transport

Trade", taking into consideration the fact that the said employees were

engaged in employment only within the Port and that their duties were limited

to transporting containers to and from the ship and the storage area.

Thereafter, by letter dated ih January 2011 marked 'P16', the 2nd Respondent

had communicated the preliminary findings of the said investigation to the

Petitioner company.

'p16' reads as follows:

12

It is the view of this Court that 'Pl6' makes it clear to the Petitioner the basis

on which the Respondents had determined that wages of the employees must

be paid in accordance with the Wages Board for the "Dock, Harbour and Port

Transport Trade". Thus, 'P16' contained the reasons for the said decision,

which incidentally is not being challenged in these proceedings.

What is more important however is that by 'Pl6', the 2nd Respondent invited

the Petitioner to meet him personally on 26th January 2011 at 2p.m., if the

Petitioner was desirous of making further representations on the said issue. It

is the view of this Court that the Petitioner had been provided with a golden

opportunity of clarifying matters, and/or making further representations

and/or contesting the facts in 'P16', in the event the Petitioner was desirous of

doing so.

By letter dated 18th January 2011 annexed to the petition marked 'Pl7', the

Petitioner responded to 'Pl6' as follows:

U(we) would like to seek your clarification to the contents in para 3 of

your letter, specifically to the decision of the Wages Board as to which

category in English Translation of the Gazette notification that these

workmen are assigned to."

At this stage, this Court must advert to the fact that even though the

classification adopted by the Respondents was "e5)l;e) ~ ei>gC~''', the

English translation thereof was 'riggers'. It is the position of the Petitioner that

the word 'rigger', denotes a person who actually and physically handles cargo.

13

The Petitioner states that it made representations at the office of the 1st and

2nd Respondents on 26th January 2011 in support of the position that the said

employees should not be classified as 'riggers' and that they ought to continue

to be classified as 'Drivers under the Motor Transport Trade'. This position of

the Petitioner is refuted by the Respondents who argue that the Petitioner did

not make any such representations, nor did they make any objections to the

position contained in the letter 'P16'. The Petitioner has not stated anywhere

in the petition, the material that it made available to the Respondents at the

said discussion or the representations that it made to the Respondents. While

it is not the function of this Court to inquire into the authenticity of both

claims, what is important and what is agreed by both parties is that an

opportunity was afforded to the Petitioner to contest the findings contained in

'P16' and make representations to the contrary, if required.

Be that as it may, the 2nd Respondent, by letter dated 28th January 2011,

annexed to the petition marked 'PiS' informed the Petitioner as follows:

9 The English term for 'I'.S)~ Q)~ ~' has been given as 'riggers'.

14

It is the view of this Court that 'PIS' is only a reiteration of the decision in 'P16'

and that 'PIS' should be read together with 'PI6'. The Petitioner has not

replied 'PIS', nor has the Petitioner informed the Respondents that 'PIS' had

been issued without taking into consideration the representations that the

Petitioner claims it made on 26th January 2011.

Thereafter, by notice dated 8th February 2011 annexed to the petition marked

'Pig', issued under Section 3(2)10 of the Wages Board Ordinance, the 2nd

Respondent requested the Petitioner to provide details of the salaries paid to

all employees in its employment from July 2008 to July 2010, before 28th

February 2011. This Court observes that the Petitioner has not challenged the

authority of the Respondents to request such information.

By its letter dated 25th February 2011 annexed to the petition marked 'P20',

the Petitioner requested a period of 3 months to submit the said information.

In response to the said letter, the 2nd Respondent by letter dated 10th March

2011 marked 'P21', informed the Petitioner that adequate time had been

provided and that if the Petitioner fails to provide the requested information

by 31st March 2011, all further action that will be taken by the Petitioner will

be on the basis of records previously provided. Instead of complying with the

request for information, the Petitioner filed this application seeking to quash

the document 'PIS'.

lOSection 3(2) reads as follows: Every person who as an employer maintains or has maintained under subsection (1) a wage record in respect of any wage period shall preserve such record for four years commencing on the last day of such period, and shall, when required to do so by the Commissioner of Labour or any prescribed officer, produce such record for inspection and furnish a true copy of such record or of any part of such record or permit such a copy to be made.

15

Our Courts have consistently held that prior to a decision affecting the rights of

an individual are taken, such person must be afforded a right to respond. Some

laws contain specific provisions with regard to the procedure that should be

followed in affording a hearing. The Wages Board Ordinance however is silent

as to the kind of hearing that should be afforded to an employer, before

determining the correct Wages Board that should be applicable to a particular

employee. Therefore, what is important in the view of this Court is that the

employer concerned or the Petitioner in this case, must be made aware of the

nature or scope of the investigation that is being carried out, must be told the

reasons why a particular classification is being made and must be given an

opportunity to respond and clarify matters, thus enabling the Respondents to

arrive at a decision which is reasonable by both parties.

It is appropriate at this stage to quote the following passage from the

judgment of the Supreme Court in Karunadasa vs Unique Gem Stones Limited

and othersll:

liTo say that Natural Justice entitles a party to a hearing does not mean

merely that his evidence and submissions must be heard and recorded; it

necessarily means that he is entitled to a reasoned consideration of the

case which he presents."

It is the view of this Court that in ensuring procedural fairness and the

adherence with the principles of natural justice, Courts must not impose

requirements that make it impossible for administrative bodies to arrive at

11 (1997) 1 Sri L.R. 256 at page 263.

16

decisions in an expeditious manner or impose unnecessary shackles on their

ability to take decisions.

This Court has already set out the sequence of events that transpired from the

date of the strike right until 'PiS' was issued. As observed earlier, the

Petitioner was made aware right at the commencement in July 2010, the scope

of the investigation that was being carried out. Thus, the Petitioners cannot,

and is in fact not pretending to be ignorant of that fact.

It is clear from letter 'PiG' that the 2nd Respondent, whilst communicating the

findings of the investigation and the reasons for its decision, had provided the

Petitioner with an opportunity to make representations to the Respondents

with regard to the findings contained therein. It is the position of the

Respondents that the Petitioner did not contest the findings of the

Respondents contained in 'P16' and 'PiS', nor did it respond to 'PiS'. It is the

view of this Court, that if 'PiS' had been issued without taking into

consideration the Petitioner's response, that fact could have been stated when

details of employees were called for by 'Pig'. As referred to earlier, even the

letter 'P20' sent by the Petitioner subsequent to being issued a notice under

Section 3(2) of the Wages Board Ordinance12, only requested the Respondents

to provide the Petitioner with further time to submit the required information,

but did not challenge the decision either in 'PiG' or in 'PiS'.

Taking into consideration all of the above, this Court is satisfied that the

Petitioner has been afforded an opportunity of explaining its position and that

the Respondents have in fact given reasons for its decision in 'PiS'. This Court

12 Pig.

17

..

is satisfied that the principles of natural justice have been complied with and

therefore, does not see any merit in the argument of the Petitioner.

The next argument advanced by the learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner is that the decision in 'P18' is unreasonable or irrational, in that the

said employees were in fact drivers who therefore should be brought under

the Wages Board for the IiMotor Transport Trade" as opposed to the Wages

Board for the IiDock, Harbour and Port Transport Trade."

In considering the said argument of the Petitioner, this Court must be mindful

that in this application, this Court is exercising its Writ jurisdiction as opposed

to its Appellate jurisdiction. This distinction has been referred to in

Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth13 in the following manner:

"The system of judicial review is radically different from the system of

appeals. When hearing an appeal the court is concerned with the merits

of a decision: is it correct? When subjecting some administrative act or

order to judicial review, the court is concerned with its legality: is it within

the limits of the powers granted? On an appeal the question is 'right or

wrong?' On review the question is 'lawful or unlawful,?,,14

This Court is mindful that the function of this Court when considering an

application for a writ is to look at the legality of the decision and not whether it

is right or wrong. As Lord Brightman stated in the House of Lords in Chief

13 11th Edition; at page 26.

14 Eleventh Edition at page 26.

18

"

Constable of North Wales Police v Evans15, applications for judicial review are

often misconceived:

"Judicial review is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision

making process. Unless that restriction on the power of the court is

observed, the court will in my view, under the guise of preventing the

abuse of power, be itself guilty of usurping power ..... Judicial review, as

the words imply, is not an appeal from a decision, but a review of the

manner in which the decision was made . ."

In fact, Lord Diplock16, having laid out the grounds on which a Writ would lie,

went onto explain in the following manner what is meant by "irrationality":

"By "irrationality" I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as

'Wednesbury unreasonableness,17. It applies to a decision which is so

outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no

sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided

could have arrived at it."

This Court must state that it is not in a position, nor is it its function to

determine which Wages Board the said employees should come under, but will

only determine if all the relevant factors were considered by the Respondents

in making their decision in 'P16' and 'PiS', and whether the said decision is

reasonable as opposed to being "outrageous in its defiance of logic."

It is admitted between the parties that there is a Wages Board for the "Motor

Transport Trade" made under Section 30 of the Wages Board Ordinance. The

notification made by the Minister of Labour in terms of Section 29(3) of the

Wages Board Ordinance for the "Motor Transport Trade" with effect from 1st

May 2007 has been annexed to the petition marked 'PS'.

This Court has examined 'PS' and observes that the schedule to the said

notification sets out the amendments that were made to the existing

notification. 'PS' has introduced two amendments, the first with regard to the

category of workers and the second, with regard to the minimum wages

payable for a month. It is the contention of the Petitioner that the employees

of the Petitioner are essentially drivers driving a long vehicle to which a trailer

has been attached and therefore, the Wages Board that is applicable to them

should be the Wages Board for the "Motor Transport Trade". The Petitioner

has submitted further that its employees should be classified under Class 0,

namely, 'drivers of tractors with trailers used for transport purpose, drivers of

lorries with trailers (including those of the Scammel Horse type).' This class of

workers for the "Motor Transport Trade" has been repeated in 'pg' to cover

'drivers of tractors with trailers used for transport purpose, drivers of lorries

with trailers.' This Court does not see any objection to the position of the

Petitioner that a driver employed by the Petitioner to drive its Prime Mover

vehicles with a trailer can be classified under the Wages Board for the "Motor

Transport Trade", subject of course to the qualification that such transport

must take place on a public road.

Similarly, it is also not in dispute that there is a Wages Board for the "Dock,

Harbour and Port Transport Trade" made under Section 30 of the Wages Board

20

..

Ordinance. The notification published under Section 29(3) of the Wages Board

Ordinance, effective from 1st July 2008 in respect of the "Dock, Harbour and

Port Transport Trade" has been annexed to the Petition marked (pg,.18 Part II

thereof sets out the minimum monthly wages payable to the categories of

workers referred to therein. It is the contention of the Petitioner that the said

notification does not have a category for (drivers' and therefore the employees

in question cannot be classified under the Wages Board for the "Dock, Harbour

and Port Transport Trade". It is in fact significant to note, as submitted by the

learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General, that the Petitioners are not contesting

that the said employees cannot be brought under the Wages Board for the

"Dock, Harbour and Port Transport Trade" but are only claiming that there is

no category in the Wages Board for the "Dock, Harbour and Port Transport

Trade" under which the said employees can be classified and therefore, they

should be brought under the Wages Board for the "Motor Transport Trade".

It is not in dispute that the Wages Board for the "Dock Harbour and Port

Transport Trade" was established in 1941. The Order establishing the said

Wages Board published in the Ceylon Government Gazette No. 9863 dated 14th

May 1948 has been produced by the Respondents marked (R13'. The reverse

page of (R13', contains a notification published in the Ceylon Government

Gazette No. 9790 dated 24th October 1947. The Order contained in the

schedule to the said Notification reads as follows:

"The provisions of Part II of the Wages Board Ordinance, No. 27 of 1941,

shall apply to the following trade:

18 Page 30A of 'P9'. The said notification has been produced by the Respondents marked 'R15'.

21

The dock, harbour and port transport trade consisting of the following

types of work carried on within the limits of the Ports of Colombo, Galle

and Trincomalee as defined under the Customs Ordinance:

(a) Loading or unloading of goods, livestock, oil or coal to or from any

ship or vessel;

(b) Conveyance of goods, livestock, oil or coal to or from any ship or

vessel."

The Respondents have submitted marked (R14' an extract relating to the

"Dock, Harbour and Port Transport Trade" taken from the (Consolidated orders

relating to the description of the trades for which Wages Boards have been

established and consolidated decisions of such boards' published in 1962.19 It is

submitted by the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General that the decision of

the Wages Board setting out the activities/ types of employment within the

"Dock, Harbour and Port Transport Trade" listed in 'R13' is reiterated in IR14'

in the following manner: "em;~ 0ei>J C)~>e>tmD Q)~, QOJ6i, 0tl>@ 0ei)J erf5JCl:

The notification under Section 29(3) for the "Dock, Harbour and Port Transport

Trade" made in 2008 has been produced by the Respondents marked IRIS'.

The Schedule thereto reads as follows:

"The decisions made by the Wages Board for the Dock, Harbour and Port

Transport Trade, set out in the Schedule to the Notification published in

f

Gazette number 9790 of 24th October 1947 as varied from time to time

and last varied by the schedule to the Notification published in Gazette

number 11463 of 31st July 1958, shall be further varied by the substitution

of the following new part for Part II of that schedule."

Part II of 'R1S,2o specifies that, "the minimum monthly wages and annual

increments payable to workers specified in Column I shall be the

corresponding rates set out in Column II." Column I contains a category of

workers known as "em;e) Q)~ (5)~oe>enoo", which is the category under which the

Respondents state the employees of the Petitioner should be classified.21

It is the position of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General that all

functions of the employees employed in terms of the agreement 'P2' are

carried out in the course of transporting containers from the ship to the

storage yard or vice versa within the Port of Colombo. This Court is in

agreement with the said position that the existence of a Wages Board for the

"Dock Harbour and Port Transport Trade" which deals expressly with the Port

Transport Trade should be sufficient by itself to support the argument that

where the employment involves any kind of transport within the Port, it should

fall within the Wages Board for the "Dock Harbour and Port Transport Trade".

Furthermore, the work performed by the said employees falls under the

description of "eDl;e) Q)~ ~~eneDen", thereby bringing the said employees under

the Wages Board for the "Dock Harbour and Port Transport Trade".

In this background, this Court will now review (P1G', the relevant parts of

which, for convenience, are re-produced below:

(( em!) mCf;l), <;Q~o@~ (0(5) e>o)C.')6J eB Q~ &S>dJeSk",

Are the above reasons given by the Respondents unreasonable or irrational?

This Court does not think so. It is not in dispute (a) that the employees who

were the subject matter of the investigation were all employees who had been

employed under the agreement (P2'; (b) that the said employees worked

exclusively within the Port of Colombo; and (c) that their work involved

transporting of containers from the ship side to the storage yard and vice

versa. It is admitted that the said employees could not drive the ITVs on a main

road and that they could only drive within the Port. Thus, their primary

function was to transport containers within the Port. It is the view of this Court

that to bring such employees within the Wages Board for the ((Dock Harbour

and Port Transport Trade" is certainly reasonable. It would in fact have been

unreasonable and irrational had the Respondents brought such employees

under the Wages Board for the ((Motor Transport Trade" when a Wages Board

specially for the Port Transport Trade was available, and where the said

employees did not carry out any duties outside the Port, including driving the

Prime Movers on a public road.

24

:

Having brought the said employees under the Wages Board for the "Dock

Harbour and Port Transport Trade", is it unreasonable to bring them under the

classification of "6)Z;e Q)~ C5>goe>eD6)eD"? This Court does not think so, for the

simple reason that this is the exact function that such employees were carrying

out. In the above circumstances, this Court cannot agree with the submission

of the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner that the decision in ip18',

or for that matter ip16', is unreasonable or irrational.

The Petitioner has also complained to this Court that the decision contained in

'P18' was mala fide and done with an ulterior motive. The Petitioner has

however failed to demonstrate the basis on which it claims the said decision

was mala fide and has also failed to illustrate what the alleged ulterior motives

of the Respondents were. If the Petitioner was seeking to prove bad faith on

the part of the Respondents, such allegations ought to have been

substantiated with evidence and facts.

The Respondents in their written submissions have submitted that the

Petitioner has not challenged, either in its petition or counter affidavit, the

power of the Respondents to categorise workmen. The Petitioner in its reply

written submissions has attempted to refute this position of the Respondents

by alleging that the Respondents have in fact issued 'P18' in excess of their

power, as they have failed to show that they are authorized persons to carry

out functions under the Wages Board Ordinance under Section 53 and that in

any case, the Respondents do not have the authority to "categorise workers",

an argument which was presented for the first time in the reply written

submissions.

25

,.

This Court is of the view that a Petitioner cannot present a case which has not

been pleaded in its petition. This Court is under no obligation to consider the

said argument due to the Petitioner's delay in presenting it and considering the

fact that the Respondents weren't given an opportunity to respond to the

same. In any event, it is the view of this Court that this argument has no merit

as the Commissioner General of Labour is empowered in terms of Sections 14

and 21 of the Wages Board Ordinance to take the decision set out in 'P1G' and

'P1S' directing the Petitioner to pay wages in accordance with the Wages

Board for the "Dock, Harbour and Port Transport".22

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue the

relief prayed for. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

22 Section 14 of the Wages Board Ordinance reads as follows: "If any doubt arises or any question is raised as to which of two or more Wages Boards is entitled or required to exercise and perform in any matter the powers, duties and functions of a Wages Board under this Ordinance, the Commissioner shall decide such question and his decision thereon shall be final."
