The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant Co-operative Society titled

"Diyatalawa Taj Regional Development Co-operative Society limited"

(hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant") has sought intervention of this

Court, invoking . its appellate jurisdiction to set aside an order of the

Provincial High Court of the Uva Province holden in Badulla by which its

application for revision of an order of demolition made by the Magistrate's

Court of Bandarawela, under Section 28A(5) of the Urban Development

Authority Act No. 41 of 1978 as amended, was dismissed.

In his application before the Magistrate's Court (Case No. 42518), the

Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

"Respondent") sought an order of Court seeking demolition of the

2

unauthorised structures erected by the Appellant and also to recover the

expenses he would incur in carrying out the demolition. It was stated by

the Respondent in the said application that the Appellant has caused

illegal construction as shown in the sketch annexed to it. Th~ Appellant

claimed that it has a valid building plan, approved by the Chairman of the

Haputale Pradeshiya Sabha before it commenced any development activity.

After an inquiry, the Magistrate's Court made its order authorising

the demolition of the unauthorised construction and sanctioned the

Respondent's entitlement to the recovery of expenses of demolition.

Thereafter the Appellant sought to challenge the said order by

invoking revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court in case No.

PHC Badulla 12/2013. The Provincial High Court, in its impugned order

has considered the claim of the Appellant that it had an approved plan for

development activity and the validity of the conclusion reached by

Magistrate's Court as to its genuineness. Having satisfied that there were

no exceptional circumstances warranting its intervention, the Provincial

High Court then decided to dismiss the application of the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said ord~rs, the Appellant seeks intervention

of this Court to set them aside on the grounds of that the Provincial High

Court misdirected itself in refusing its application upon an erroneous

conclusion reached in relation to the acceptability of the approval that had

been granted by the Chairman of the Haputale Pradeshiya Sabha on

03.01.2011.

It was con tended by the Appellant that " ... if the Respondent alleges

that the signature to the plan was taken at the residence of the President of the

3

Pradeshiya Sabha the burden lies on the Respondent to prove such fact under

Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance. But not an iota of evidence was placed

before the Court by the Respondent to prove the same." In these circumstances,

the Appellant states that" ... it is very clear that the learned High ~ourt Judge

has misdirected himself by holding that no approval was given to construct the

building. "

It appears from the above quoted passage that the Appellant now

seeks to reagitate before this Court, the question whether there was an

approved plan for the development activity in respect of which an order of

demolition was issued or ... not.

In the application invoking revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial

High Court, the Appellant stated that the approved plan that had been

tendered before the Magistrate's Court marked as "Annex 4", bears the

signature and official seal of the Chairman of the Haputale Pradeshiya

Sabha and is dated 03.01.2011. Therefore, the Appellant states that prima

facie it is an authentic document and therefore, it was up to the

Respondent to substantiate his allegation that it is a "forged and a fraudulent

document".

The Respondent sought to counter this claim by stating in his

objections that the Appellant has failed to pay the required fee to consider

any plan for approval and the signature of the Chairman depicting the

plan was obtained by deceitful means.

In dealing with this issue as to the validity of the plan relied upon by

the Appellant to justify its development activity, the Provincial High Court

has considered contents of a letter addressed to Provincial Secretary dated

4

27.09.2012. It is stated in the said letter the circumstances under which the

Chairman of Haputale Pradeshiya Sabha has placed his signature and seal.

The relevant portion is reproduced below;

Section 14(1) of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act No.1 of 1987 states that

"all matters or questions authorised by this Act or by any other written ,

law to be decided by a Pradeshiya Sabha shall be decided upon the

majority of members present at any meeting .. ,," and Section 15 makes it

mandatory for a Pradeshiya Sabha to maintain minutes of all proceedings,

5

decisions, orders and acts of such Sabha. The effect of these provisions is

the decisions of a Pradeshiya Sabha must be taken by the majority of the

people's representatives and should have a traceable record of the

decision-making process.

When the Appellant Society itself described the circumstances under

which the seal of approval was obtained for its proposed commercial

building from the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha, the Provincial High

Court ought to take note of them. The Respondent's claim that the said

"approved plan" is a fraudulent document receives legitimacy when the

Appellant Society itself admitted that the plan was approved by the then

Chairman on the verge of an election at a " @)o G~~z~(3) ~C))tDz~" upon

the understanding that the members of the Appellant society supports him

at the next election. It is relevant to note the significance of his direction

that the Appellant should commence construction only after the

forthcoming elections, during the decision-making process in granting

"approval" of the building plan. When the fact that it is the same

Pradeshiya Sabha that now states that there was no prior approval granted

by it for the construction undertaken by the Appellant society is

considered by the Provincial High Court, it leads to the reasonable

inference that the "seal of approval" given by the then Chairman on

03.01.2011 was not a decision of the Haputale Pradeshiya Sabha.

Considered under the backdrop of these attendant circumstances, it is clear

that the Appellant society had no valid approval for its plan in respect of

the construction it had undertaken. Therefore the order issued by the

Magistrate's Court under Section 28A(3) of the Urban Development

Authority Act is in accordance with the applicable law. The Provincial

6

High Court has correctly held that the demolition order of the Magistrate's

Court is'legally valid.

It is our considered view that the appeal of the Appellant is devoid

of any merit and ought to be dismissed upon that basis.

The order of dismissal made by the Provincial High Court is

accordingly affirmed by this Court along with the order of the Magistrate's

Court made under Section 28A(3) of the said Act.

The appeal of the Appellant society is dismissed with costs fixed at

Rs.50,000.00.
