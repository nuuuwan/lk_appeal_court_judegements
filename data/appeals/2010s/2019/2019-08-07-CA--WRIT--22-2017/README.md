Respondent.

Decided on: 05.08.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner (Agro Consolidated Private Limited) filed this

application on 23.01.2017 against the Consumer Affairs

Authority and the 13th Respondent Consumer (L.C. Ekanayake)

seeking to set aside the decision of the Consumer Affairs

Authority reflected in P8 and P9 whereby the Petitioner was

directed to pay a sum of Rs. 4,850,000/=, which is the purchase

price of the Paddy Harvesting Machine, to the consumer.

According to page 2 of P7, which contains the statement made

by the consumer at the inquiry before the Consumer Affairs

Authority, the date of purchase of the machine is 02.03.2008.

It is the position of the consumer that the machine did not

function properly from the very inception.

There are four similar cases filed by the Petitioner where facts

are different. The date of purchase of the machine, the reliefs

granted by the Consumer Affairs Authority after the inquiry, the

date of filing the action etc. are all different. They are

CA/WRIT/446/2015 filed on 12.11.2015, CA/WRIT/236/2016

filed on 25.07.2016, CA/WRIT/55/2017 filed on 21.02.2017 and

3

CA/WRIT/442/2016 filed on 27.12.2016. Hence Judgment will

be delivered in each case separately having made use of the

material tendered particularly in CA/WRIT/446/2015 and in

CA/WRIT/236/2016.

The State has filed objections on behalf of the Consumer Affairs

Authority only in CA/WRIT/446/2015. Insofar as the five

consumers in the said cases including this one are concerned,

objections have been filed only by the consumer in

CA/WRIT/236/2016.

Written submission on behalf of the Petitioner has been filed

only in CA/WRIT/446/2015 covering all five cases. Out of the

consumers, only the consumer in CA/WRIT/236/2016 has filed

written submission. It is significant to note that no written

submission has been filed on behalf of the Consumer Affairs

Authority.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner has taken up

several positions to convince this Court that the decision of the

Consumer Affairs Authority is unsustainable.

The pivotal argument of the learned Presidents Counsel is that

the complaint of the consumer was prescribed when he

complained to the Consumer Affairs Authority.

Section 13(1) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, No. 9 of

2003, reads as follows:

The Authority may inquire into complaints regarding

a) the production, manufacture, supply, storage,

transportation or sale of any goods and to the supply

of any services which does not conform to the

4

standards and specifications determined under

section 12; and

b) the manufacture or sale of any goods which does not

conform to the warranty or guarantee given by

implication or otherwise, by the manufacturer or

trader.

Section 13(2) is the one which is directly relevant to the issue at

hand. It reads as follows:

A complaint under subsection (1) which relates to the sale

of any goods or to the provision of any service shall be

made to the Authority in writing within three months of the

sale of such goods or the provisions of such service, as the

case may be.

There is no dispute that there was a warranty period of six

months given to the machine from the date of purchase. Hence

as held in Acua Technologies (Pvt) Ltd v. Consumer Affairs

Authority [2012] 1 Sri LR 358 the consumer could, without

offending section 13(2) of the Act, complain to the Consumer

Affairs Authority during the warranty period notwithstanding it

exceeds more than three months. It was held in that case that

the time limit of three months stipulated in section 13(2) of the

said Act will not apply to a complaint made under section

13(1)(b).

Accordingly, the general rule is that the consumer shall

complain to the Consumer Affairs Authority within three months

from the date of purchase of the good or service provided.

Nevertheless, if there is a warranty or guarantee to the good sold

or service provided, the consumer can complain to the

5

Consumer Affairs Authority during the course of the warranty or

guarantee, despite such period extends more than three months.

The argument of the learned Presidents Counsel is that the

consumer in this case complained to the Consumer Affairs

Authority several years after the date of the purchase of the

machine and several years after the expiration of the warranty

period.

In terms of section 13(2) of the Act, the complaint shall be in

writing. The crucial document is P6, which is the written

complaint of the consumer to the Consumer Affairs Authority.

The impugned decision of the Consumer Affairs Authority was

taken on this complaint. According to the date stamp of the

Consumer Affairs Authority, the Authority has received it on

25.06.2012. However, P6 is dated 29.09.2008.

If the written complaint was in fact received by the Consumer

Affairs Authority on 25.06.2012, there is no dispute that the

complaint is clearly prescribed.

If it has been received on 29.09.2008, still the complaint is

prescribed as the complaint has been made beyond the warranty

period of six months from the date of purchase (in that the date

of purchase, according to the consumer as stated at page 2 of P7

is 02.03.2008).

Hence it is clear that the complaint is prescribed and there is no

jurisdiction for the Consumer Affairs Authority to entertain such

a complaint as it is obnoxious to section 13(2) of the Act.

6

In this view of the matter, there is no necessity to deal with the

other arguments taken up by the learned Presidents Counsel for

the Petitioner.

The decision of the Consumer Affairs Authority contained in P8

and P9 is quashed by way of writ of certiorari.

Application is allowed. No costs.
