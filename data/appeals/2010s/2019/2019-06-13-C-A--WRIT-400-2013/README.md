Written Submissions: Tendered by the Petitioner on 19th December 2018

Tendered by the Respondents on 20th December 2018

Decided on: 7th June 2019

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up for argument on 26th July 2018, the learned

Counsel for all parties moved that this Court pronounce its judgment on the

written submissions that would be tendered by the parties.

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the vesting of the land described in the

Schedule to the petition;

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Respondents to evict the

Petitioner from the land described in the Schedule to the petitioni

3

c) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to divest and/or re-transfer

the land described in the Schedule to the petition.

It is admitted between the parties that the land that is the subject matter of this

application has been acquired by the State in terms of the Land Acquisition Act in

1984. Th is appticattonhasbeenfited by the--Peti-tioner after the 3f9 Respondent,

the Urban Development Authority filed action against the Petitioner and one

other in the Magistrate's Court of Colombo under the provisions of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979, as amended, seeking to eject

the Petitioner from a land identified as parts of Lot Nos. 9 and 11 in Preliminary

Plan No. 62541 in extent of 1A OR 1.51, which land is part of the land acquired by

the State in 1984.

The Petitioner states that his father, JUliyanage Nawaliyas Silva purchased from

Magalage Richard Perera in September 1951, by Deed of Transfer No. 1517,

annexed to the petition marked 'P4a', the land described therein. This Court

observes that according to the schedule to the said Deed, the extent of the land

was 1A OR OP 'according to Plan No. 7600 dated 17th September 1951 made by

M. B. De Silva, Licensed Surveyor'. 2 The Petitioner states further that his father

'purchased' from Magalage Catherine Perera, two blocks of land adjacent to the

land purchased by 'P4a' which is set out in Plan No. 152 marked 'P4c' as Lot B

containing in extent 2R 25P, and Lot C containing in extent 1A OR 36P. As proof of

the said transaction, the Petitioner has annexed to the petition a copy of an

1 A copy of Plan No. 6254 has been annexed to the petition marked 'P1a'.

2 This land has subsequently been identified as Lot A in Plan No. 152.

4

Agreement to Sell dated 4th August 1954, marked 'P4b' but claims that the said

Agreement to Sell is in fact a transfer of the said lots of land.

The Petitioner has annexed to the petition, Deed of Declaration No. 3676

executed on 5th November 1982 marked_ 'P4e' and Deed of Declar_ation No. 588

executedonlg!h-September 1985 marked'P4d',~e)(eEuted by his father-}nres-pet

of Lots Band C of Plan No. 152. This Court observes that while the Petitioner's

father had claimed prescriptive title to the said two lots of land by 'P4e', no

reference has been made in the said Deed of Declaration 'P4e' to the 'Agreement

to Sell' marked 'P4b', which is the document by which the Petitioner claims that

his father purchased the said lots in 1954. The Petitioner states that in February

2001, long after the State had acquired the said property, his father executed a

deed of gift in favour of the Petitioner in respect of Lots Band C of Plan No. 152

annexed to the petition marked 'P4f'. This Court has examined 'P4f' and observes

that although reference has been made therein to the Deed of Declaration 'P4e',

no reference has been made to the Agreement to Sell 'P4b'.

The Respondents have disputed the title of the Petitioner to the land that is the

subject matter of this application and states that even though the Petitioner's

father had title to Lot No. 10 in Plan No. 6254 annexed to the petition marked

'Pla', which admittedly is almost identical to Lot A of Plan No. 152 and which land

had been divested to the Petitioner in the year 2000, occupation of the lots of

land adjacent to Lot No. 10 - i.e. Lots Band C of Plan No. 152- is unlawful. This

Court must observe that several complaints have in fact been made against the

Petitioner's father as far back as in 1992 that he is engaged in the illegal filling of

5

land.3 It has been consistently held by this Court that it cannot go into disputed

questions of fact including issues relating to title where such title is disputed by

the parties. Hence, this Court cannot determine in these proceedings if the

Petitioner or his father had title to the said land from which the Petitioner is

sought to be ejected, prior to its acquisition in 1984, even if called upon to do so.

Be that as it may, this Court would consider the relief sought by the Petitioner on

the assumption that the Petitioner has title to the land in question.

This Court will start with the Writ of Mandamus seeking a divesting of the land

that the Petitioner claims belongs to him.

The first section in the Land Acquisition Act that this Court needs to consider is

Section 39 which deals with the revocation of a vesting order by which a land has

been acquired by the State.

Section 39 reads as follows:

"Notwithstanding that by virtue of an Order under section 38 (hereinafter in

this section referred to as a "vesting order") any land has vested absolutely

in the State, the Minister may, if possession of the land has not actually

been taken for and on behalf of the State in pursuance of that Order, by

subsequent Order published in the Gazette revoke the vesting order."

3 Vide documents marked 'R4' - 'R9' annexed to 'P7a(ii)'.

6

In D.O. Gnanawathi Ranasinghe vs. P.H.K Oharmasiri Ranasinghe4 the Supreme

Court, having considered the situations in which Section 39 could be applied, held

as follows:

"The governing part of the above sectionj- in my view, is the following phrase:

"if possessronoftn-e-tan-cthas notactua-Itv been taken for and- onbeh-a~f-of

the State in pursuance of that order."

In my view if the possession of the land has not been taken for and on behalf

of the State, the Minister has the power to make an order under Section

39(1) of the Act. But if the possession of the land has been taken over for

and on behalf of the State, the Minister has no power to make an order

under Section 39(1) of the Act.

The Supreme Court, having considered the affidavit of the respondent that

possession of the land has been taken over by the Urban Development Authority

on 2nd October 1980 and the fact that 44 people had been p'aid compensation for

the acquisition of the land in question, came to the conclusion that the possession

of the land has been taken over by the State, and held as follows:

"Therefore, the Minister (the 1st Respondent) cannot revoke the vesting

order in terms of Section 39(1) of the Act. Therefore, the court cannot issue

a writ of mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to revoke, in terms of

Section 39(1) of the Act, the vesting order. For the above reasons, I hold that

4 SC Appeal 87A/2006; SC Minutes of 13th September 2017.

7

the Court of Appeal was correct when it refused to issue a writ of mandamus

directing the 1st Respondent to revoke, in terms of section 39(1) of the Act,

the vesting order."

It is the position of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General that possession

__ ha_sJ~_~e_n taken over on- beha~f of the State. The Petitioner has annexed to-the

petition marked 'P7.a(i)' the petition filed by his father in CA (Writ) Application No.

737/96, seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash the notice published in

terms of the proviso (a) to Section 38. In the said petition, a specific allegation had

been made that possession of the said land had not been taken over by the

acquiring officer. This Court has examined the Statement of Objections filed by

the Respondents in that case in 1997, which have been annexed to the petition

marked 'P7aOi)' and find that the respondents have taken up the following

position with regard to the taking of possession:

(a) Possession of the land was taken over by the acquiring officer, the then

Assistant Government Agent Nugegoda, S.M.P. Samarakoon on 12th

November 1984;

(b) Legal possession has been handed over by the said Assistant Government

Agent to the Urban Development Authority, with the occupants thereon, on

12th November 1984, and possession had been accepted by D.R.1.

Beneragama on behalf of the Urban Development Authority on the same

date.

8

A copy of the gazette notification issued under proviso (a) to Section 38 directing

the Acquiring Officer to take possession of the entire land referred to therein, has

been annexed to the said statement of objections marked 'Rl'. The certificate of

handing over of the legal possession to the Urban Development Authority has

been annexed to the said statement of objections marked 'R2,.5 By a letter dated

4th Ju_ne 1985,the Urban Develepment Authority has informed- the Divrsronat -

Secretary, Colombo that possession of the land was taken over on 12th November

1984.6 Thus, this Court is satisfied that possession of the land that was acquired in

1984 had been taken over by the State soon after the acquisition.

In any event, the settlement in CA (Writ) Application No. 737/96 pursuant to

which Lot No. 10 in Plan No. 6254 was divested, was effected not by a revocation

of the vesting order as provided by Section 39 but by the publication of a

divesting order under and in terms of Section 39A(1). This is borne out by the

Gazette Notification relating to the said divesting, marked 'P7d', which confirms

that the said Order has been made under Section 39A(1) of the Land Acquisition

Act, which in turn confirms the position of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor

General that possession of the entire land had been taken over by the State.

6 This document has been submitted by the Urban Development Authority in CA (Writ) Application No. 2529/2004, marked '3Rl' and is annexed to 'P14c'. The said action had been filed by the Petitioner seeking the identical relief as in this application.

9

In the said circumstances, as possession has been taken over by the State, the

vesting order cannot be revoked and therefore the provisions of Section 39 would

not apply to this application.

However, where possession has been taken over, a divesting order can be made

in terrns of S~ction 39A, which reads as follows:

(1) "Notwithstanding that by virtue of an Order under section 38 (hereafter

in this section referred to as a "vesting Order") any land has vested

absolutely in the State and actual possession of such land has been

taken for or on behalf of the State under the provisions of paragraph (a)

of section 40, the Minister may, subject to subsection (2), by

subsequent Order published in the Gazette (hereafter in this section

referred to as a "divesting Order") divest the State of the land so vested

by the aforesaid vesting Order.

(2) The Minister shall prior to making a divesting Order under subsection

(1) satisfy himself that-

(a) no compensation has been paid under this Act to any person or

persons interested in the land in relation to which the said

divesting Order is to be made;

10

(b) the said land has not been used for a public purpose after

possession of such land has been taken by the State under the

provisions of paragraph (a) of section 40 ;

(c) no improvements to the said land have been effected after the

Order for possession under paragraph (a) of section 40 had been

made; and

(d) the person or persons interested in the said land have consented

in writing to take possession of such land immediately after the

divesting Order is published in the Gazette.

Thus, the divesting of a land where possession has been taken over can only be

effected if the aforementioned four conditions set out in Section 39A(2) have

been satisfied.7

This Court will now consider if the requirements of Section 39A(2)(a) have been

satisfied.

It is the position of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General that the acquiring

officer acting in terms of Section 7(1) of the Act, had published a notice in

Extraordinary Gazette No. 366/13 dated 11th September 1985, annexed to the

petition marked 'P2c' calling for claims for compensation in respect of Lots 2- 21

7 D.F.A. Kapugeekiyana v'). Janaka Bandara Tennakoon, Minister of Lands [S.c. Appeal No. 161/2010; SCMinutes; 18th November 2013J - "It is the assessment of this Court that to grant a divesting order on behalf of the Petitioner

as per Section 39A of the Act, the four conditions set out in Section 39 A (2) must be satisfied."

of Plan No. 6254. Details of the lots referred to in 'P2c' which are relevant to this

application are re-produced below:

The Respondents have taken up the position that the Petitioner's father had

made a lawful claim as the title holder only in respect of Lot No. 10 of Plan No.

6254 and that the Petitioner's father did not make a claim in respect of any other

lot in Plan No. 6254. The fact that persons other than the Petitioner's father were

claiming title to Lot Nos. 6, 7, 9 and 11 in Plan No. 6254 is borne out by the above

table.

After a notice under Section 7 is published in respect of the land that is sought to

be acquired, the acquiring officer shall, by way of a notice published under

Section 9(1) of the Act, direct the persons interested in that land to appear before

him to hold an inquiry into-

(a) the market value of that land which is to be acquired;

13

(b) such claims for compensation as may have been notified to him within the

time allowed therefor;

(c) the respective interests of the persons claiming compensation; and

(d) any other matter which needs investigation for the purpose of making an

award under section 17.

It is the position of the Respondents that the inquiry into the payment of

compensation proceeded on the basis of the claims that they had received in

response to the Section 7 notice 'P2c' in respect of each Lot in Plan No. 6254.

There is no dispute that the Petitioner's father made a claim in respect of Lot No.

10. However, as there had been another claimant to Lot No. 10, the matter had

been referred to the District Court of Colombo for adjudication,8 as required by

Section 10 of the Act. This is the Lot that was subsequently divested to the

Petitioner's father by virtue of the settlement reached in CA (Writ) Application

No. 737/96, as reflected in the Order 'P7d'.

The Respondents have stated further that the claims and ownership with regard

to Lot Nos. 6, 7, 9 and 11 in Plan No. 6254, for which the Respondents claim the

Petitioner's father did not make a claim but which forms part of the land which

the Petitioner is claiming in this application, had been adjudicated and that

compensation has already been paid to those who made valid claims to the

8 Case No. 4148/LA.

14

acquiring officer. The Respondents have submitted with their Statement of

Objections marked '4Ra' - '4Rd', the awards made under Section 17 of the Land

Acquisition Act in respect of the said Lot Nos. 6, 7, 9 and 11. The endorsements

made on the said documents confirm that compensation has been paid to the

persons referred to therein. This Court is of the view that once compensation has

been paid for a particular land, the question of divesting the said land does not

arise.

This issue was considered in D D Gnanawathi Ranasinghe vs. PHK Dharmasiri

Ranasinghe9 in the following manner:

"What happens if compensation has been paid to the claimants? Then the

Minister is not empowered to make a divesting order in terms of Section 39A

of the Act because in such a situation condition No.1 in Section 39A (2) has

not been fu Ifilled."

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner has failed

to satisfy the provisions of Section 39A(2)(a) of the Act, and therefore, a divesting

order cannot be made in terms of Section 39A(1).

This Court will now consider if the provisions of Section 39A(2)(b) have been

satisfied, even though such a course of action is not required in view of the

conclusion reached by this Court that the requirement of Section 39A{2}{a) has

not been satisfied.

9 Supra.

15

The survey plan that was prepared for the purpose of calling for claims under

Section 7 is Plan No. 6254 dated 16th May 1985. As already noted, it is admitted

between the parties that Lot No. 10 of Plan No. 6254 belonged to the Petitioner's

father and that pursuant to a settlement reached in CA (Writ) Application No.

737/96, the State had divested the said land as well as lands belonging to other

persons which were not required for a public purpose.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the lands that have

not been divested out of the said Plan No. 6254 are being used for public

purposes, which comes within the Sri Jayawardenapura -Kotte Development

Plan. Elaborating on the specific purposes for which the lands have been put to

use, the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General has submitted that part of the

land has been used to construct a road linking Sri Jayawardenapura Mawatha

with Buthgamuwa Road, while another part of the land is being utilized for a

playground for Ananda College. He has stated further that the rest of the land,

which consists largely of marshy land is being used for water retention purposes.

This Court must observe that the acquisition of marshy lands for water retention

purpose can be classified as a public purpose especially given the close proximity

that the land that is the subject matter of this application has to the Diyawanna

Lake and the fact that the lands situated in the said area is prone to flooding

during rainy periods.

In these circumstances, this Court is satisfied that the acquired land is ~n fact

being used for a public purpose and therefore cannot agree with the submission

16

of the Petitioner that the said land has not been used for a public purpose. This

Court therefore takes the view that the Petitioner has failed to satisfy the

requirement of Section 39A(2)(b) of the Act, as well.

The third requirement that must be satisfied in terms of Section 39A(2) is that no

improvements should have been effected to the land that has been acquired. The

fact that the land which the Petitioner claims is now being used for a link road as

well as a playground demonstrate that improvements have been made to the

land after possession of the said land was taken over. Thus, the requirements of

Section 39A(2)(c) of the Act too has not been satisfied by the Petitioner.

In the above factual circumstances, this Court is of the view that the pre-

conditions that must be satisfied for the Minister to consider making a divesting

order in terms of Section 39A have not been satisfied. Assuming that the

conditions for divesting have been satisfied, this Court would still have to consider

whether a Writ of Mandamus can be issued, in view of the several judgments of

this Court as well as the Supreme Court that have held that a Writ of Mandamus

would not issue to compel the Minister to make an order under Section 39A(1).10

Be that as it may, this Court does not have to engage in that discussion as the pre-

conditions set out in Section 39A(2) have not been satisfied.

17

This Court will now consider the application for the Writ of Certiorari seeking to

quash the vesting that took place in 1984. It is observed at the outset that the

Petitioner is not seeking to quash a particular document relating to the

acquisition process, although it has pleaded in the petition the notices published

in terms of Sections 2 and 7; and proviso (a) to Section 38, of the Land Acquisition

Act.

The basis on which the vesting has been challenged is twofold - the first is that

the notice under Section 4 had not been published; the second is that there was

no urgency that necessitated the issuing of an order under proviso (a) to Section

38. The Petitioner and his father were aware of the acquisition process from its

beginning but do not appear to have pursued these objections, inspite of having

filed Writ applications on at least two occasions. In any event, this Court is of the

view that the provisions of Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act are rendered

nugatory once an order is made under proviso (a) to Section 38. Furthermore, the

position of the Petitioner that there was no urgency that required possession to

be taken over, does not have any merit in view of the development purposes for

which the land has been made use of. This Court is of the view that when

considering whether there infact was an urgency to take possession of a land, one

must bear in mind that the commencement and execution of a development

project can take a long period of time from the time it is proposed and that a

development project cannot even be planned unless the land required for the

execution of the said project is available from the outset.

18

The Petitioner is also seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the

Respondents to eject the Petitioner from the land referred to in the schedule to

the quit notices annexed to the petition marked 'P19a(i)' and 'P19b(i)'. While

observing once again that the Petitioner is not seeking to quash a particular

document, this Court notes that the Respondents are entitled to proceed under

the provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act in view of the fact

that the said land is State land.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue the

Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus prayed for by the Petitioner. This application is

accordingly dismissed, without costs.
