Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 3rd defendant-appellant filed this appeal against the

Judgment of the Additional District Judge of Pugoda dated

04.09.2000 pronounced in Partition Case No. 194/P.

The learned counsel for the 3rd defendant during the course of

argument sought to set aside the said Judgment mainly on three

grounds. They are (a) failure to identify the corpus (b) failure to

consider the pedigree unfolded by the 3rd defendant and (c)

exclusion of Lot 3 of the Preliminary Plan in favour of the 10th

defendant.

The learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the plaintiffs,

supported by the learned counsel for the 8th defendant and the

learned counsel for the 10th defendant, did not make serious

submissions at the argument, on the basis that no document

tendered at the trial were marked subject to proof and the

Judgment was entered as a consent Judgment and therefore

this is a frivolous appeal. I am unable to agree.

By going through the Appeal Brief it is clear that the impugned

Judgment was not at all a consent Judgment. The defendants

have filed statements of claim, 24 issues have been raised at the

trial, evidence has been led and the Judgment has supposedly

been delivered on the evidence led.

Although the learned counsel for the 3rd defendant now says

that the corpus has not been properly identified, and therefore

action cannot be maintained, the 3rd defendant at the trial has

not raised a specific issue on that important question, if he was

3

serious on that matter.1 Nor has he at least moved to mark the

Preliminary Plan subject to proof notwithstanding the Court

Commissioner in his Report has stated that what he depicted in

the Preliminary Plan is the land to be partitioned.2 From this

Report it is further established that the 3rd defendant was also

present at the preliminary survey and assisted the Court

Commissioner to identify the land. 3 In addition, whilst

answering the questions put during the cross-examination by

the Attorney-at-Law for the plaintiff, the 3rd defendant has

accepted that what is depicted in the Preliminary Plan is the

land to be partitioned.4 Hence it is too late in the day for the 3rd

defendant to raise a corpus dispute for the first time in appeal.

The second and third arguments of the learned counsel for the

3rd defendant are, in my view, valid.

When I read the Judgment with the evidence led at the trial, it is

clear to me that the learned Judge has palpably misdirected

herself on several fundamental matters.

The learned Judge has repeated evidence in the Judgment

without proper analysis and thereafter reproduced the schedule

of shares tendered by the Attorney-at-Law for the plaintiff at the

end of the trial5 without explaining how the share calculation

was done.

1 Vide the 3rd defendants issues at pages 95-96 of the Brief. 2 Vide page 74 of the Brief. 3 Vide paragraphs (v), (vi) and (vii) of the Report at page 74 of the Brief. 4 Vide page 117 of the Brief. 5 Vide page 140 of the Brief.

This is a bad practice not permitted by law. How can the Judge

ask the plaintiffs Attorney-at-Law to prepare the schedule of

shares 6 in a contested trial for the Judge to mechanically

incorporate it in the Judgment? In a partition case, generally,

the whole Judgment rests on the calculation of shares upon the

deeds produced at the trial. Calculation of shares is a judicial

function, which cannot be delegated by the Judge to a lawyer.

Lawyers can with their written submissions tender proposed

schedule of shares to Court, but it is up to the Judge to

ultimately come to an independent conclusion on that vital

matter. This has not happened in this case.

In the instant case, the 3rd defendant has apparently tendered a

pedigree different from the one unfolded by the plaintiff, and

raised issues No.7-12 and 14 at the trial. There is no issue No.

13 although the learned Judge in the Judgment without quoting

the issues has answered issue No.13 in the affirmative! The

learned Judge has not answered the 7-11 (pedigree) issues

stating that as the plaintiffs issues were answered in the

affirmative, there is no necessity to answer them. However in

the Judgment the learned Judge has not stated why she cannot

accept the pedigree of the 3rd defendant and how it differs or

tallies with that of the plaintiffs! That is a fundamental error in

the Judgment.

Although those issues have not been answered in favour of the

3rd defendant, the learned Judge has answered issue Nos.12 and

14 raised by the 3rd defendant in the affirmative. Interestingly,

the issue No.14 is: If the aforesaid issues (Nos.7-12) are

6 Vide JE Nos.56-58 appearing at pages 38-40 of the Brief.

5

answered in the affirmative, is the 3rd defendant entitled to the

reliefs as prayed for? The affirmative answer to issue No.14 in

my view is contradictory to the earlier position taken by the

Judge!

By going through the evidence of the 3rd defendant it is seen that

he has produced two Deeds marked as 3D1 and 3D2.7 However

only Deed marked 3D1 has been tendered to Court after the

conclusion of the trial.8 Deed marked 3D2 has neither been

tendered nor has the Judge referred to it in the Judgment. It is

the peremptory duty of the trial Judge trying a partition action

to investigate title to the land quite independently of what the

parties may or may not tell the Judge. The aforesaid incident

itself proves that the Judge has shirked that responsibility.

On the date the Judgment was due to be pronounced, all of a

sudden, the 10A defendant has been called to give evidence.9 He

has produced 4 Deeds marked 10D1-10D4. I carefully read the

evidence of the 10A defendant to learn that he in his evidence

has not specifically stated that Lot 3 of the Preliminary Plan

shall be excluded from the corpus on the basis that he has

acquired that portion by prescriptive possession

notwithstanding such an issue has been raised. No cogent

evidence to that effect was led at the trial. The learned Judge at

page 10 of the Judgment has expressed that there is no positive

evidence to conclude that the entirety of Lot 3 shall go to the 3rd

defendant, but later decided to exclude the entirety of Lot 3 in

favour of the 10th defendant stating that it is the most

convenient solution to the problem! 10 In a partition action,

portions of the corpus cannot be so excluded in favour of one co-

owner for convenience of Court unless there is cogent evidence

and compelling reasons to do so. It appears to me that the

learned Judge has found that convenient method as the

plaintiffs Attorney-at-Law has not given any share to the 10th

defendant in his schedule of shares tendered to Court!

The learned Judge at page 11 of the Judgment has stated that

the 8th defendant is entitled to Lot 2 of the Preliminary Plan!11

This has not even been asked by the 8th defendant! The 8th

defendant has produced only one Deed marked 8D1. Although

that Deed speaks of undivided rights and later a land in extent

of 2 roods and 23 perches has been identified, the Court shall

satisfy that the vendor of that Deed had rights to convey such

rights to the 8th defendant. Whilst first stating that the 8th

defendant is entitled to Lot 2 of the Preliminary Plan, at the end

of the Judgment, by reproducing the schedule of shares of the

plaintiffs Attorney-at-Law, the learned Judge has again stated

that the 8th defendant is entitled to 12/48 shares of the corpus!

This is irreconcilable.

According to the Preliminary Plan, the land has been divided

into only 4 Lots. Out of these 4 Lots, Lot 4 is a road. Out of the

remaining 3 Lots, Lots 2 and 3 have been excluded! The

remaining Lot is only Lot 1, which, according to the Judgment,

to be divided among the 3 plaintiffs, and the 3rd-7th defendants!

Due to the above glaring shortcomings, it is my considered view

that the Judgment cannot be allowed to stand. Hence I set

aside the Judgment directing the incumbent Judge to deliver the

Judgment afresh on the evidence already led after allowing the

parties to tender written submissions with all the documents

marked at the trial. In that written submission, to assist Court,

if necessary, they can incorporate schedule of shares for

consideration of the Court.

Judgment of the District Court is set aside and the appeal is

allowed.

Let the parties bear their own costs of appeal.
