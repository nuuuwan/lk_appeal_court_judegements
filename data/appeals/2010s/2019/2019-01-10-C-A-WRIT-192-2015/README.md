Samayawardhena, J.

The petitionerthe Methodist Trust Association of Ceylonfiled

this application seeking to issue a writ of mandamus directing

the respondents to make a divesting order of the Maitipe

Methodist Mixed School, Galle, which was vested in the Crown

by the Gazette marked P3 in 1963.

Only the 2nd, 4th, 9th and 10th respondents filed objections to this

application. These respondents do not dispute that the said

school has ceased to function as a school since 2003. According

to 2R1 dated 30.10.2015, the 2nd respondent admits that the

said school is now closed. Therefore, there is no necessity to

scrutinize the large number of documents tendered by the

petitioner together with the petition to prove the said fact.

The letter P16 issued by the 1st respondent and the photographs

P10(a)-(e) alone are more than sufficient to understand the

present status of the buildings of the school. They are in a

shocking state of dilapidation as a result of nearly one and a half

decades of disuse!

Once the petitioner has come to know that the school is closed

and abandoned, the petitioner has made repeated fervent

written requests to divest the school to the original ownerthe

Methodist Church of Sri Lanka.1 These requests have either

been put into the waste paper basket or turned down by giving

1 Vide P4 dated 12.03.2008, P8(a) dated 15.05.2008, P10 dated 06.08.2008, P13(a) dated 30.09.2008, P14(a) dated 21.02.2012, P14(b) dated 14.05.2012, P17(a) dated 08.07.2013, P17(b) dated 08.07.2013, P17(c) dated 22.08.2013, P17(d) dated 16.09.2013, P17(e) dated 27.01.2014, P18 dated 26.05.2014, P19 dated 19.06.2014.

5

various, in my view, false reasons. For instance, by P7 dated

25.04.2008, the 9th respondent has turned down the request

merely stating that the 3rd respondent does not recommend that

request whereas such a recommendation is not required in law

for that purpose. Then by P12 dated 16.09.2008, the 9th

respondent has refused the request stating that, according to

the 3rd respondent, the buildings of the school were being used

to run primary section of some other school, namely,

G/Aththiligoda Sudarshi School and the land was being used to

conduct practical tests of the agriculture subject of the said

school. This is undoubtedly a falsehood as seen from a large

number of documents tendered by the petitioner including P16

dated 05.03.2013 whereby the 1st respondent has candidly

admitted that the school was closed and abandoned for several

years. Then by P15 dated 05.02.2013, the 3rd respondent has

informed the 9th respondent that the said premises were needed

to commence a Teacher Training Center. The 9th and 10th

respondents, in paragraph 7 of their statement of objections,

admit that the proposal to construct a Teacher Training Centre

did not get off the ground. The petitioner in paragraphs 30 and

31 of the petition states that thereafter the authorities attempted

to hand over the premises to the Medical Faculty of the Ruhuna

University and then the petitioner wrote P18 dated 26.05.2014

to the 2nd respondent protesting that move and insisting on

divesting. This has not been disputed by the respondents as

falsehood. It is in this backdrop, the petitioner filed this

application on 29.04.2015.

6

It is interesting to note that the respondents in their objections

tendered nearly one year after the filing of this application,2

came out with a new idea to deny divesting. That is, the

respondents have now (after the filing of this application)

identified the premises in question to the project Langama

Pasala Hondama Pasala initiated by the 10th respondent, which

was to commence in 2016. However, it appears to me that,

apart from proposals and recommendations, nothing has

happened in that regard either, and the school is still

abandoned and neglected.

Section 10(1)(a) of the Assisted Schools and Training Colleges

(Supplementary Provisions) Act, No. 8 of 1961, which is the

immediately relevant section in this regard, reads as follows:

Notwithstanding that any property used for the purpose of

any school to which this Act applies has vested in the

Crown by virtue of a Vesting Order, the Minister, by

subsequent Order published in the Gazette (in this Act

referred to as a Divesting Order), shall, if such property

ceases to be used, or is not needed for the purpose of a

school conducted and maintained by the Director for and on

behalf of the Crown, revoke that Vesting Order insofar as it

relates to such property with effect from the date on which

such property so ceased to be used or was not so needed;

As I stated earlier, there does not seem to be a dispute that the

property has ceased to be used as a school since around 2003,

but the argument of the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

2 The petitioner filed this application in April 2015 and the statement of objections was filed by the respondents in February 2016.

7

respondents is that since the premises in question have

presently been identified for the purpose of a school, the 10th

respondent cannot be compelled in law to make an order

divesting the property to the petitioner.

Firstly, in my view, this new proposal found after the institution

of this action is yet another similar reason or subterfuge not to

accede to the petitioners lawful demand.

Secondly, rights of the parties shall be determined at the time of

the institution of the action. (Talagune v. De Livera3, Kalamazoo

Industries Ltd v. Minister of Labour and Vocational Training4,

Lalwani v. Indian Overseas Bank5)

In the application for writ of mandamus, in Abayadeera v. Dr.

Stanley Wijesundara, Vice Chancellor, University of Colombo6, it

was held that:

The petition in this case was filed on 30.6.83. The

Emergency (Universities) Regulations No. 1 of 1983, cited

by learned counsel for the petitioners, and on which he

founded an argument, were made on 21.7.83. In our view

these regulations have no application, for, rights of parties

are their rights at the date the petitioners application was

made (Jamal Mohideen & Co. v. Meera Saibo 22 NLR 268,

272, Silva v. Fernando 15 NLR 499, 500) and must be

decided according to the law as it existed when the

8

application was made (10 NLR 44 at 51); Ponnamma v.

Arumugam 8 NLR 223, 226.

In Kalamazoo Industries Ltd v. Minister of Labour & Vocational

Training7, the petitioners sought to quash the arbitral award by

certiorari and prohibition. Dismissing that application,

Jayasuriya J. inter alia stated:

It is trite law that a court or tribunal must determine and

ascertain the rights of parties as at the date of the

institution of the action or as at the date of the making of

the reference for arbitration. Commencement of the action is

the time at which the rights of the parties are to be

ascertained. Vide Silva v. Fernando 15 NLR 499 (PC),

Mohamed v. Meera Saibo 22 NLR 268, Bartleet v. Marikkar

40 NLR 350. The claim and demand on behalf of the

workers who were members of the fourth respondent trade

union had been made on 12th of March, 1988. The

reference by the Minister of Labour for settlement by

arbitration had been made on the 24th of November, 1989

and the statement of the matter in dispute has been framed

by the Commissioner of Labour and specified on the 24th of

November, 1989. In the circumstances, the arbitrator had

jurisdiction, authority and right to decree the grant of a

salary increase of Rs. 250 with effect from 24.11.89.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, until the new idea

was conceived after the institution of the action, the property

was not needed for the purpose of a school. It was, if at all,

7 [1998] 1 Sri LR 235 at 248

9

needed for other purposes such as Teacher Training Center,

Medical Faculty etc. The idea contained in P12 was a false one.

The 9th and 10th respondents in their objections have admitted

that in terms of the applicable law the said premises can only be

used for the purpose of a school.

Hence, it is my considered view that the property has ceased to

be used for the purpose of a school and was also not needed for

the purpose of a school at the time of the institution of the

action, and therefore mandamus shall be issued against the 10th

respondent compelling him to make the divesting order in terms

of section 10(1)(a) of the Assisted Schools and Training Colleges

(Supplementary Provisions) Act.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondents has,

for the first time, taken up two preliminary objections to the

maintainability of this application in the written submissions

filed in lieu of oral submissions.

Before I deal with these two preliminary objections, I must make

the following general observation. Disposing of cases on

technical grounds is easy and speedy. But that is not what the

aggrieved party expects from Court. The aggrieved party wants

case to be disposed of on merits rather than on technical

grounds. It is generally the wrongdoer who cannot meet the case

on merits, tries to cling on technical objections to defeat justice.

We must understand that we are working in Courts of Law and

not in Academies of Law8 and therefore, in my view, we must, as

8 Vellupillai v. The Chairman, Urban District Council (1936) 39 NLR 464 at 465, W.M. Mendis & Co. v. Excise Commissioner [1999] 1 Sri LR 351 at 354-

10

much as possible, try to dispose of cases on merits rather than

on high technical grounds. I fully endorse the following

observations made by Justice Wigneswaran in Senanayake v.

Siriwardene.9

Courts are fast making use of technical grounds and

traversing of procedural guidelines to dispose of cases

without reaching out to the core of the matters in issue and

ascertain the truth to bring justice to the litigants. This

tendency is most unfortunate. It could boomerang on the

judiciary as well as the existing judicial system.

The first objection is that The petitioner has failed to identify the

particular respondent who it seeks to compel to divest. In terms

of section 10 of the Act it is the Minister of Education who can be

compelled to make a divesting order. Accordingly, the relief

prayed for should have been specifically pleaded against the

respondent. The petitioner in the prayer to the petition (may be

out of abundance of caution) has sought mandamus against the

Respondents including the 10th respondent-the Minister of

Education, who, according to the learned Deputy Solicitor

General, can be compelled to make a divesting order. It is up to

the petitioner to seek all the reliefs against all the respondents,

and it is up to the Court to finally decide which relief or reliefs

shall be granted against which respondent or respondents.

(Adlin Fernando v. Lionel Fernando10) It is naive to argue that the

petitioners application shall be dismissed in limine as the

355, Edirisinghe v. Wimalawardena [2002] 3 Sri LR 343, Perera v. Geekiyana [2007] 1 Sri LR 202 9 [2001] 2 Sri LR 371 at 375

10 [1995] 2 Sri LR 25 at 29.

11

petitioner has not sought mandamus only against the 10th

respondent but against all the respondents including the 10th

respondent. I reject that objection unhesitatingly.

The other objection is that a writ of mandamus will only lie

against a natural person and since the 10th respondent has not

been referred to (in the caption) by name (but only by

designation), a writ of mandamus as prayed for cannot issue and

the application of the petitioner should be dismissed in limine.

On what basis is this popular objectionthat mandamus can

only be issued against natural persons who hold public

officetaken to secure dismissal of writ applications in limine?

That is on the basis of the decision in Haniffa v. The Chairman,

Urban Council, Nawalapitiya.11 This decision has mechanically

been followed by a number of later decisions of this Court.12

Sometimes I wonder whether Haniffas case is being so blindly

followed by this Court because it was a Supreme Court decision.

However, we must understand that when Haniffas case was

decided in 1963, the Supreme Court was not the apex Court and

the Court of final appeal was the Judicial Committee of the Privy

Council of the United Kingdom. The Supreme Court at that time

was akin to the present Court of Appeal. Final appeal to the

12

Privy Council was abolished only in 1972 on Sri Lanka becoming

a Republic.

Is the Judgment in Haniffas case a well-considered Judgment?

This is a nagging question for me. This is the full Judgment

delivered by Tambiah J. (with the agreement of Sri Skanda

Rajah J.) in Haniffas case.

In this application the petitioner has made the Chairman,

Urban Council, Nawalapitiya, the respondent. The petitioner

should have named the person against whom a Writ of

Mandamus can be issued. The Chairman, Urban Council,

Nawalapitiya, is not a juristic person. The Privy Council has

pointed out that the juristic person must be created

specially by statute (62 NLR 169, 174, and at 182-183; 65

NLR 253). Even if the Chairman, Urban Council,

Nawalapitiya, was a juristic person I fail to see how we can

issue a Mandamus on a juristic person. A Mandamus can

only issue against a natural person, who holds a public

office. If such a person fails to perform a duty after he has

been ordered by Court, he can be punished for contempt of

Court. Therefore the contention of Counsel for respondent

must prevail. The application is dismissed with costs fixed

at Rs. 157.50.

On what basis was it decided in Haniffas case that mandamus

can only be issued against a natural person who holds a public

office? That is on the basis that If such a [natural] person fails

to perform a duty after he has been ordered by Court, he can be

punished for contempt of Court.

13

In the first place, why we are so pessimistic that the orders of

this Court will not be obeyed by juristic persons and public

officers cited only by official designation? Is that a good ground

to refuse mandamus? In my view, it is not. Can a Court, for

example, refuse to enter a money decree in a recovery matter on

the ground that the defendant has no assets?

We shall give solutions to the existing problems. We shall not

refuse to give solutions to the existing problems upon imaginary

or hypothetical problems.13

The observation in Haniffas case that If such a person fails to

perform a duty after he has been ordered by Court, he can be

punished for contempt of Court presupposes the position that if

mandamus is issued against a juristic person as opposed to a

natural person, in case of a violation, the juristic person cannot

be dealt with for contempt of Court. This is not correct. When a

writ of mandamus is issued against a juristic person the parties

who must obey it are those in control of the affairs of the juristic

person, and in case of a violation, they can be dealt with for

contempt. In Regent International Hotels Ltd v. Cyril Gardiner14,

Samarakoon C.J. (with Ismail and Wanasundera JJ agreeing)

held:

When an injunction is obtained against a juristic person the

parties who must obey it are those in control of the affairs

of the juristic person. In this case the injunction must

necessarily be honoured primarily by the Directors of the

13 Vide Thiagarajah v. Karthigesu (1966) 69 NLR 73 at 78, Somapala v. Wanasundara [2011] BLR 80 at 82 14 [1978-79-80] 1 Sri LR 278 at 290

14

Company. They are the persons whom the plaintiff sought

to bind. There was no requirement in law that they must

also be directed. The section requires only a direction on the

Corporation and then the officers of the Corporation whose

duty it is to do or refrain from doing the acts set out in the

order are the persons who are automatically bound by the

Enjoining Order. If they fail, they are guilty of contempt and

they are the persons to be charged.

I do not think that public officers will disobey orders of this

Court made upon the decisions which they or their predecessors

have taken in the discharge of their official duties. They have no

personal interest in those decisions. In fact, in practical terms,

in almost all the cases where mandamus is sought and allowed,

mandamus is ultimately issued not against the public officer

who made the decision, but against the incumbent public officer

who holds the office. Moreover, in most of the cases, the case

itself is instituted against the successor in office as the public

officer who made the impugned decision has ceased to hold

office by that time. This goes to show the illogicality and fallacy

of the argument that when mandamus is sought the public

officer shall be cited by name and not by designation only.

When mandamus is sought, public officers are made

respondents by their names and designations for otherwise their

applications are destined to be dismissed in limine on the

Judgment of Haniffas case. Quite often, holders of the public

office are changed, and whenever there is such a change,

substitution is made and caption is changed adding the

successor in office by his name, and notice is then issued upon

15

the successor. This is a never-ending process until the

Judgment is delivered. If the holder of the public office is

changed even after the delivery of the Judgment but before

giving effect to it, still the successor needs to be substituted as

the former has been cited by name.

One of the main causes for laws delays in writ applications, in

my view, is this unfounded and irrational objection. Arguments

are postponed due to constant changes of holders of the public

office. During the period (26.10.2018-13.12.2018) where there

was an uncertainty about holders of public office including the

ministers and their secretaries, I believe, no application for

mandamus could be taken up for argument or issued because of

the need to change the caption to fall in line with the dicta in

Haniffas case!

Even though in Haniffas case it was decided that A Mandamus

can only issue against a natural person, who holds a public

office, in Abayadeera v. Dr. Stanley Wijesundara, Vice

Chancellor, University of Colombo15, this Court did not agree with

it and took the view that mandamus can be issued against any

person, corporation, tribunal and public body. Atukorala J. as

the President of the Court of Appeal (with Thambiah and

Monemalle JJ. concurring) had this to say:16

A Mandamus can be directed to a Corporation.

The Order of Mandamus is of a most extensive remedial

nature, and is, in form, a command issuing from the High

Court of Justice, directed to any person, corporation, or

15 [1983] 2 Sri LR 267 16 At page 279-280

16

inferior tribunal, requiring him or them to do some particular

thing therein specified which appertains to his or their office

and is in the nature of a public duty.

(Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edn. Vol. 1, p. 111, para.

89).

In Pathirana v. Goonesekera 66 NLR 464, 467,

Weerasooriya, S.P.J. observed

Where officials having a public duty to perform, refuse to

perform it, mandamus will lie on the application of a person

interested to compel them to do so. The rule would also

apply where a public body fails to perform a public duty

with which it is charged.

In Abayadeeras case the petitioners sought mandamus against

the Vice Chancellor and the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of

the University of Colombo. Whilst dismissing the application on

non-joinder of necessary parties, the Court, inter alia, held

that:17

In our view the proper body to be directed by a Mandamus,

assuring that a writ can go, is the University of Colombo

and not the respondents to this application. The University

of Colombo therefore is a necessary party and ought to

have been made a party to these proceedings. The failure to

do so is fatal to the petitioners' application.

17 At page 281

In the recently decided Suriyarachchi v. Sri Lanka Medical

Council, popularly known as the SAITM case18, Malalgoda J. as

the President of the Court of Appeal (with Thurairaja J. agreeing)

rejected the argument of the respondentSri Lanka Medical

Council that mandamus sought against the said Council cannot

be issued as it is not a natural person. In that Judgment the

Court referred to the aforementioned Abaydeeras case (supra)

and two other unreported Judgments of this Court19 to conclude

that the archaic argument that the mandamus can only be

issued against a natural person is no more valid. This is what

Malalgoda J. stated:

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st respondent

whilst relying on the case of Haniffa v. The Chairman

Urban Council Nawalapitiya 66 NLR 48 argued that a

Mandamus cannot lie against the Sri Lanka Medical Council

as it is a juristic person and not a natural person.

However in this regard this court is mindful of the decision

in Abayadeera and 162 others v. Dr. Stanley Wijesundara,

Vice Chancellor, University of Colombo and another [1983] 2

Sri LR 267 where Atukorale J (P/CA) whilst referring to the

decision in the Haniffas case had observed that;

The law has been stated as follows in paragraph 112, page

127, Vol. 1, of Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edition.

18 CA/WRIT/187/2016 decided on 31.01.2017 19 Government Registered Medical Officers Association v. Hon. John Seneviratne, Minister of Health, CA/WRIT/1498/2000 decided on 24.02.2004; Ekanayake v. Attorney-General, CA/WRIT/58/2012 decided on 25.04.2016

18

The Order of Mandamus will not be granted against one

who is an inferior or ministerial officer bound to obey the

orders of a competent authority to compel him to do

something which is part of his duty in that capacity.

The Vice Chancellor and the Dean of the Faculty of

Medicine are officers of the University. The Council is the

executive body and governing authority of the University

and can exercise and discharge the powers and functions

of the University, including the power to hold examinations.

The Senate has control and general direction of, inter alia,

education and examinations. The Vice Chancellor is subject

to the directions issued by the Council and it is his duty to

give effect to the decisions of the Council and the Senate.

The Dean is the Head of a Faculty, and the Faculty which

has powers over matters relating to examinations, is

subject to the control of the Senate. It seems to us that the

respondents are officers within the intendment of the above

quotation from Halsbury.

In terms of s. 29 (b) of the Universities Act, the University

has the sole power to hold examinations, including the 2nd

MBBS examination. The power is reposed in the University.

In their own petition, the petitioners state that they are

entitled to require the University that it holds the 2nd MBBS

examinations for them and others of their batch and those

repeating the said examination, and that the University has

the obligation to provide such an examination. The

petitioners want this obligation of the University enforced

through its officers or agents. It appears to us, assuming

that the Writ of Mandamus can issue, it must be directed to

19

someone in whom is lodged the power to do the act ordered

to be done. What if the University of Colombo takes up the

position that it has not been made a party to the application

and has not been heard and therefore not bound in any

way by these proceedings? In Jayalingam v. The University

of Colombo CA application No 415/81, we find that the

petitioner in that case, who was an external student, asked

for a Writ of Mandamus on the University of Colombo to

accept his application and permit him to sit the Final

Examination In Laws, on the basis that it was the

University that had the power to conduct external

examinations for enabling those who are not students of the

University, to obtain degrees of the University.

Learned Counsel for the petitioners relied on the decision in

Haniffa v. The Chairman, U.C., Nawalapitiya (supra). In

this case, the petitioner made the Chairman, U.C.,

Nawalapitiya, the respondent to his petition. He was not

named. Tambiah, J. pointed out that the Chairman was not

a juristic person; that even if the Chairman was a juristic

person, since disobedience to Writs of Mandamus is

punishable as contempt of Court, a person who asks for a

Mandamus to compel a public officer to perform a duty

should name the public officer who holds the office. It is in

this context, that Tambiah, J. said, I fail to see how we can

issue a Mandamus on a juristic person.

In Pathirana v. Goonesekera 66 NLR 464, 467,

Weerasooriya, S.P.J. observed,

20

Where officials having a public duty to perform, refuse to

perform it, mandamus will lie on the application of a person

interested to compel them to do so. The rule would also

apply where a public body fails to perform a public duty

with which it is charged.

Apart from this, the petitioners presented their petition on

the basis that the respondents are the persons who are

entrusted with the duty of carrying out the obligation which

was reposed in the University, to hold the 2nd MBBS

examination for them only. At the time they were made

respondents, the 1st respondent held the office of Vice

Chancellor by virtue of an appointment made by the

Chancellor, and the 2nd respondent held the office of Dean

of the Faculty of Medicine, by virtue of her election by the

Faculty (Sections 34 (1) and 49 (1) of the University Act).

Under the Emergency Regulation, they cease to hold their

respective office. The 1st respondent now holds the office of

Vice Chancellor on an appointment made by the Minister

(Reg. 3(2); the 2nd respondent now holds office as Dean on

an appointment made by the Vice Chancellor. It is now

sought to compel the 1st respondent to perform a duty on

the basis that he has, by reason of Regulation 4 (a),

absorbed in himself all the powers and duties of the

University. Would not all these result in a change in the

character of the petition and in the conversion of the original

petition into a petition of another kind? What if the

regulations are withdrawn tomorrow? Then the argument of

learned Counsel for the petitioners, based on the

Emergency Regulations, loses its validity.

21

In our view the proper body to be directed by a Mandamus,

assuring that a writ can go, is the University of Colombo

and not the respondents to this application. The University

of Colombo therefore is a necessary party and ought to

have been made a party to these proceedings. The failure to

do so is fatal to the petitioners' application..

Association and another v. Hon. John Seveviratne Minister

of Health and four others CA Application 1498/2000 CA

Recently in the case of Ekanayake v. Attorney General and

two others CA Application 58/2012 (CA minute dated

25.04.2016) this court reaffirm the position taken in the

Abeydeeras case referred to above and observed that the

law seems to have moved away. Today a juristic person, no

less than a natural person, can be commanded to carry out

its public duty and rejected the argument that Mandamus

cannot lie against a public body such as the Sri Lanka Ports

Authority.

When considering the decisions referred to above I see no

merit in the said argument raised by the 1st respondent.

In appeal, on behalf of the Supreme Court, Prasanna

Jayawardena J. (with Nalin Perera J. (as His Lordship the

22

present Chief Justice then was) and Wanasundera J.

concurring) upheld the Judgment of the Court of Appeal.20

There is one other point which goes to the root of the matter,

which has escaped the attention of the Court in the above cases

(except Dayaratne v. Rajitha Senaratne,21 which I will refer to

later). That is, Rule 5 of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules of 1990, which is directly relevant to the

matter under consideration, i.e., how a public officer, when he is

made a respondent for acts or omissions done in his official

capacity, shall be identified or cited in a writ application.

The Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules of 1990 have

been made by the Chief Justice together with three Judges of

the Supreme Court in accordance with Article 136 of the

Constitution of the Republic and published in the Government

Gazette (Extraordinary) No. 645/4 dated 15.01.1991. By the

time these Rules were made, the Supreme Court is the highest

and final superior Court of the Republic.

It is noteworthy that when Haniffas case was decided in 1963,

the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules of 1990 were

non-existent. Hence, after the said Rules came into force22, the

Rules shall invariably take precedence and thereafter there is no

room to rely on Haniffas case to summarily dismiss the

applications for mandamus on the purported ground that the

20 Sri Lanka Medical Council v. Suriyarachchi, SC Appeal No. 184/2017, SC SPL LA No. 41/2017 decided on 21.09.2018 21 [2006] 1 Sri LR 7 22 According to the Gazette No. 697 of 10.01.1992 inter alia Rule 5 came into force from 27.04.1992, and Rule 5(5) in particular came into force from 31.12.1991.

23

party against whom mandamus is sought has not been made a

respondent by name.

Rule 5 of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules of

1990 reads as follows:

(1) This rule shall apply to applications under Articles 140

and 141 of the Constitution, in which a public officer has

been made a respondent in his official capacity, (whether

on account of an act or omission in such official capacity, or

to obtain relief against him in such capacity, or otherwise).

(2) A public officer may be made a respondent to any such

application by reference to his official designation only (and

not by name), and it shall accordingly be sufficient to

describe such public officer in the caption by reference to

his official designation or the office held by him, omitting

reference to his name. If a respondent cannot be sufficiently

identified in the manner, it shall be sufficient if his name is

disclosed in the averments in the petition.

(3) No such application shall be dismissed on account of

any omission, defect or irregularity in regard to the name

designation, description, or address of such respondent, if

the Court is satisfied that such respondent has been

sufficiently identified and described, and has not been

misled or prejudiced by such omission, defect or

irregularity. The Court may make such order as it thinks fit

in the interest of justice, for amendment of pleadings, fresh

or further notice, costs, or otherwise, in respect of any such

omission, defect or irregularity.

24

(4) (a) In respect of an act or omission done in official

capacity by a public officer who has thereafter ceased to

hold such office, such application may be made and

proceeded with against his successor, for the time being in

such office, such successor being made a respondent by

reference to his official designation only, in terms of sub-

rule (2)

(b) If such an application has been made against a public

officer, who has been made a respondent by reference to

his official designation (and not by name) in respect of an

act or omission in his official capacity, and such public

officer ceases to hold such office, during the pendency of

such application, such application may be proceeded with

against his successor, for the time being, in such office,

without any addition or substitution of respondent afresh,

proxy or the issue of any notice, unless the Court considers

such addition, substitution, proxy or notice to be necessary

in the interest of justice. Such successor will be bound, in

his official capacity, by any order made, or direction given,

by the Court against, or in respect of, such

original respondent.

(c) Where such an application has been made against a

public officer, who has been made a respondent by

references to his official designation (and not by name), and

such public officer ceases to hold such office after the final

determination of such application, but before complying

with the order made or direction given therein, his

25

successor, for the time being in such office will be bound by

and shall comply with, such order or direction.

(5) The provisions of sub-rules (4)(b) and (4)(c) shall apply to

an application under Article 140 and 141 filed before such

date as may be specified by the Chief Justice by direction,

against a public officer, in respect of an act or omission in

his official capacity, even if such public officer is described

in the caption both by name and by reference to his official

designation.

(6) Nothing in this rule shall be construed as imposing any

personal liability upon a public officer in respect of the act

or omission of any predecessor in office.

(7) In this rule, ceases to hold office means dies, or

retires or resigns from, or in any other manner ceases to

hold, office.

According to Rule 5(1), Rule 5 applies to all the writ applications

made under Articles 140 and 141 of the Constitution of 1978, as

amended, across the board.

Article 140 says that the Court of Appeal has the power inter alia

to issue orders in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against the judge of

any Court of First Instance or tribunal or other institution or any

other person; and Article 141 inter alia says that the Court of

Appeal has power to issue orders in the nature of writs of

habeas corpus.

26

Article 140 does not make a distinction between mandamus and

other prerogative writs, and nowhere in that Article does it state

that mandamus can only be issued against a natural person.

According to Article 140, mandamus, like any other prerogative

writ, can be issued against the judge of any Court of First

Instance or tribunal or other institution or any other person.

Similarly, Rule 5 does not make a distinction between

mandamus and other writs, and does not state that mandamus

can only be issued against a natural person.

In summary, what Rule 5(2) says is that in the caption of such a

writ application the public officer can be cited by official

designation only and not by name; and if necessary, for clarity,

his name can be disclosed in the body of the petition. 5(3) says

that no application shall be dismissed due to misdescription of

such public officerit is a curable defect. 5(4) says that if such a

public officer has ceased to hold office (a) at the time of filing the

application, (b) during the pendency of such application and (c)

after the delivery of the order but before complying with it, the

same can be filed and proceeded with against his successor by

official designation.

Dayaratne v. Rajitha Senaratne23 may be the first case Rule 5

was referred to in an application for writ of mandamus. In that

case, it is important to understand that, both the respondents

against whom mandamus was sought had been cited both by

names and official designations. Pending determination of the

case both of them ceased to hold office. Nonetheless, even at the

time of argument, the petitioner had not taken steps to add or

23 [2006] 1 Sri LR 7

27

substitute the successors in office in order to proceed with the

application. When this matter was inter alia raised as a

preliminary objection, the petitioner relied on Rule 5(4)(b) read

with 5(5) to argue that the application can be proceeded with

against their successors for the time being in office without

addition or substitution. This argument was rightly rejected by

Marsoof J. as the President of the Court of Appeal (with Sri

Skandarajah J. agreeing) on the basis that Rule 5(4)(b) read with

5(5) was inapplicable in this instance as this was a case filed

against the public officers both by name and designation, and as

such, for the said Rules to be applicable, the case should have

been filed before the specified date nominated by the Chief

Justice, which, in this instance, was 31.12.199124, but this case

had been filed long after the said specified date. That finding is

in complete consonance with Rule 5. Rule 5 applies in

applications where a public officer is made a respondent in his

official designations only and not by name. The only exception

is Rule 5(5) which is applicable only in respect of applications

filed before 31.12.1991. The reference to Haniffas case by

Marsoof J.25 is clearly obiter dicta. This Judgment of Marsoof J.

is not an authority to say that writ of mandamus is an exception

to Rule 5.

It is a myth that mandamus can only be issued against natural

persons. Mandamus, like any other prerogative writ, can be

issued against natural, juristic or non-juristic persons including

tribunals, corporations, public bodies, public officials identified

24 Vide Gazette No.697 of 10.01.1992 25 At page 17

28

by their official designations provided the other requirements to

issue mandamus are fulfilled.

I issue the writ of mandamus against the 10th respondent

compelling him to make the divesting order as prayed for in

paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition. The 3rd respondent

shall pay a sum of Rs. 100,000/= as costs of the action to the

petitioner.

Before I part with this Judgment, I might remind that, in terms

of Rule 5(3):

No (writ) application shall be dismissed on account of any

omission, defect or irregularity in regard to the name

designation, description, or address of such respondent, if

the Court is satisfied that such respondent has been

sufficiently identified and described, and has not been

misled or prejudiced by such omission, defect or

irregularity. The Court may make such order as it thinks fit

in the interest of justice, for amendment of pleadings, fresh

or further notice, costs, or otherwise, in respect of any such

omission, defect or irregularity.

Hence, to minimize laws delays, in the pending mandamus

applications where respondent public officers have been cited

both by name and official designation, with the consent of the

counsel for the opposite party, amended captions can be filed

citing the said respondents by official designations only. If it is

not done, the successors in office shall be substituted when the

respondents cited both by names and designations cease to hold

office.
