the Petitioner.

Respondent.

Decided on: 02.05.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application for restitutio in integrum

seeking restoration of her rights to Lot 2 in the Preliminary Plan

by way of amending the Judgment dated 09.08.1989 and the

Interlocutory Decree entered thereon and to permit her to file a

statement of claim and proceed with the case.

The plaintiff filed the action in the District Court to partition the

land known as Kosgahawatta among the plaintiff and the 1st-5th

defendants. At the preliminary survey, the mother of the

petitioner, Pinhamy, claimed before the surveyor. Notices have

been issued on Pinhamy, but could not be served. However, as

seen from the Journal Entry No.35 dated 22.06.1987, the

learned District Judge in his own handwriting has written that

Pinhamy was present in Court on that day and on being

inquired she said that she was unable to appear in the case.

The petitioner in paragraph 21(iv) of the petition and the

corresponding paragraph of the affidavit states that the journal

entry on 22.06.1987 to the effect that Pinhamy was present in

court and had disclaimed any right to the corpus is erroneous.

3

A party cannot in appeal dispute what the Judge has written in

his own handwriting in a case record unless he has first taken

up that matter before the lower Court. Here, the petitioner is

not even a party to the case. On the other hand, Pinhamy did

not make such an allegation against the Judge. People who

have interests in the land to be partitioned can come before the

District Court without formal notice being served.

In Andradie v. Jayasekera Perera [1985] 2 Sri LR 204 at 208 Siva

Selliah J. held:

It has been held in the cases Orathinahamy v. Romanis

(1900) 1 Browne's Rep. 188, 189 and Gunawardene v

Kelaart (1947) 48 NLR 522, 524 that the record maintained

by the judge cannot be impeached by allegations or

affidavits and that the prospect is an appalling one if in

every appeal it is open to the appellant to contest the

correctness of the record. Gunawardena v. Kelaart (supra)

Thus in the face of what appears on the record it is not

possible for this court to controvert the record of the District

Court unless in the first instance material has been

provided before the District Court itself.

In Chaminda v. Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 Sri LR 144 at 148

Sisira de Abrew J. held:

In my view a litigant can't make a convenient statement in

court and contradict a judicial record. In this regard I am

guided by the following judicial decisions. OlC Ampara

police Station Vs. Bamunusinghe Arachchige Jayasinghe

CA 37/98 HC (PHC) APN 38/98 CAM 8.9.98 Jayasuriya J

remarked: A litigant is not entitled to impugn a judicial

4

record by making a convenient statement before the Court

of Appeal. In Gunawardane v. Kelart 48 NLR 52 Supreme

Court held: The Supreme Court will not admit affidavits

which seek to contradict the record kept by the Magistrate.

In Vannakar v. Urhumalebbe [1996] 2 Sri LR 73 at 75-76

Jayasuriya J. stated:

Justice Dias in King v. Jayawardena 48 NLR 489 at 503

has considered the earlier line of decisions laying down the

cursus curiae with regard to the legality of filing convenient

and self-serving affidavits in appeal to vary and contradict

the record or with a view to purge a default which had

taken place before the Court of first instance. After a review

of these decisions he held that no party ought to be

permitted to file a belated self-serving and convenient

affidavit to contradict the record, to vary the record or to

purge a default where they have not taken proper steps to

file such affidavits before the Judge or President of the

Court of first instance or tribunal respectively. Vide also the

judgment of Justice Canekeratne in Gunewardena v.

Kelaart 48 NLR 522. If a party had taken such steps to file

papers before the presiding officer of Court of first instance,

then an inquiry would be held by him and the self-serving

statements and averments could be evaluated after

cross-examination of the affirmant when he gives evidence

at the inquiry. If such a procedure was adopted the Court of

Appeal would have the benefit of the recorded evidence

which has been subjected to cross examination and the

benefit of the findings of the judge of the Court of first

instance. When such procedure is not adopted, Justice Dias

5

ruled that the Court of Appeal could not take into

consideration self-serving and convenient averments in the

affidavits to contradict and vary the record or to purge a

default committed before the Court of first instance. In the

courts of first instance I have respectfully followed such

prudent observations made by judges with considerable

experience in the actual working of the Magistrate and of

the District Courts. In the circumstances this Court refuses

to take into consideration the self-serving and convenient

oral assertions on the facts made by the learned counsel for

the Appellant for the first time at the hearing of this appeal.

I reject the contention of the petitioner that her mother,

Pinhamy, was unaware of the partition action.

After trial, the Judgment had been entered in 1989 and the

appeal filed against the said Judgment had been dismissed by

this Court in 2001.

Thereafter a commission has been issued to prepare the final

scheme of partition. According to paragraphs 15 and 16 of the

petition and the corresponding paragraphs of the affidavit, the

petitioner says that, when the surveyor came to the land for final

survey on 02.06.2003 and 06.05.2006, she along with two

others obstructed the surveyor to execute the commission as a

part of a different land claimed by them was being surveyed, and

until the surveyor showed her the Preliminary Plan and

informed her of the purpose of his visit she was unaware of the

partition case.

6

That means, at least in 2003, when the surveyor came to the

land to prepare the scheme of final partition, the petitioner knew

about the partition case.

However, the petitioner has come before this Court in 2010, i.e.

7 years after she became aware of the partition action.

In paragraph 22 of the petition and the corresponding paragraph

of the affidavit the petitioner says that she waited to come before

this Court until the contempt inquiry for obstruction of the

surveyor was over. This explanation is completely unacceptable.

Contempt inquiry has nothing to do with this application.

Contempt proceedings have commenced in 2007, and I find in

the Journal Entry No. 88 dated 25.04.2005, the petitioner has

made an application to the District Court for intervention and

thereafter as seen from the Journal Entry No. 89 dated

29.08.2005, that application has been virtually withdrawn. The

petitioner has come before this Court 5 years after that

application for intervention.

It must be stressed that the power to grant relief by way of

restitutio in integrum is a matter of grace and discretion. (Usoof v.

Nadarajah Chettiar (1958) 61 NLR 173 at 177) The petitioner

cannot seek restitution as of right. A person invoking the

jurisdiction of this Court by way of restitutio in integrum must

act with the utmost promptitude. (Menchinahamy v. Muniweera

(1950) 52 NLR 409 at 414, Babun Appu v. Simon Appu (1907) 11

NLR 44 at 45, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited v.

Shanmugam [1995] 1 Sri LR 55)

7

As Chief Justice Sansoni stated in Cassim v. Government Agent,

Batticaloa (1966) 69 NLR 403 at 404 There must be finality in

litigation, even if incorrect orders have to go unreversed.

I have no hesitation to conclude that the petitioner did not act in

promptitude and is clearly guilty of laches in coming to this

Court and on that ground alone the application of the petitioner

shall be dismissed.

There is another more fundamental matter, which disentitles the

petitioner to maintain this application. That relates to standing

of the petitioner to file this application. By looking at the reliefs

sought for in the prayer to the petition and the penultimate

paragraph of the petition, it is abundantly clear that this is

purely an application for restitutio in integrum (and not an

application for revision and/or restitutio in integrum).

There cannot be a dispute that the petitioner was not a party to

the partition action. It is well settled law that an application for

restitutio in integrum can only be filed by a party to the action.

(Perera v. Wijewickreme (1912) 15 NLR 411, Menchinahamy v.

Muniweera (1950) 52 NLR 409, Dissanayake v. Elisinahamy

[1978/79] 2 Sri LR 118, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v.

Shanmugam [1995] 1 Sri LR 55, Fathima v. Mohideen [1998] 3 Sri

LR 294 at 300, Velun Singho v. Suppiah [2007] 1 Sri LR 370)

The petitioner has no locus standi to file this application.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs.
