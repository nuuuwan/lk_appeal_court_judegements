The Petitioner in this case seeks a Writ of Mandamus to compel the Divisional

Secretary, Lankapura to take all necessary steps to prevent the construction of a

place of worship on a land that is subject to a grant under the Land Development

Ordinance. The gravamen of the complaint of the Petitioner is that it is illegal for the 3rd

2

Respondent to construct a temple on a land that had been granted to the 4th, 5th, and 6th

Respondents upon a nomination made under the Land Development Ordinance.

The 3rd Respondent who is a Buddhist Thero belonging to U darata Arnarapura Chapter

had received higher ordination on 27.06.2009-A certified copy of the declaration

regarding Upasampada Bhikshu under Section 41 of the Buddhist Temporalities

Ordinance No.l9 of 1931 issued by Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs has been annexed

as 3R2 to the statement of objections.

The 3rd Respondent carne to the temple (Sri Shanthinikethanaramaya) on or about

14.11.2013 on an invitation of the then Chief Incumbent of the said temple, Rev.

Elamalpotha Devarakkitha Thero, and stayed there performing religious activities.

However the owner of a rice mill named L. Mithrapala was not in good terms with the 3rd

Respondent since the 3rd Respondent along with the people of the village had protested

against the disposal of waste products from the said rice mill to a lake thereby.

It is averred that on the influence of the said owner of the rice mill, the Chief Incumbent

of the said temple did not want the 3rd Respondent to continue to stay there. It is further

averred that the villagers wanted the 3rd Respondent to stay in the same village and the

6th Respondent was gracious enough to offer one of his houses with the land in extent 1

M acres situated within the same village to the 3rd Respondent and invited the 3rd

Respondent to stay there. In the said circumstances, the 3rd Respondent together with

his 6 student Samanera Bhikshus shifted to the new place and started the constructions

of a new place of worship with the permission of the owner (6th Respondent), and in

association with the people of the village.

The uncontroverted averment is then that notwithstanding his disputes with one L.

Mithrapala in Pulasthigarna, the villagers requested the 3rd Respondent to stay in the

village and it was on their invitation he began to construct the temple on the land which

was on a state grant. The 4th, 5th and 6th Respondents and one J.H. Shiran Abeykumara

who are the owners of the adjoining lands submitted affidavits expressing their consent

to the Divisional Secretariat, Lankapura and these affidavits have been appended to the

3

. I I 114\ , ; (til fiR'. 11 At

Statement of Objections filed by the 3rd Respondent. The 3rd Respondent had also sought

permission from the Secretary, Ministry of Buddha Sasana and Religious Affairs to

construct or maintain a place of worship and in consequence the 3rd Respondent received

a letter dated 04.01.2017 from the Senior Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of Buddha

Sasana stating that the particular land had not been legally transferred and requested

that the application for registration be submitted after having fulfilled the relevant

requirements. A number of persons from the village of Abeypura, Pulasthigama had made

a request of the District Secretariat of Polonnaruwa dated 08.11.2014 seeking permission

for registration and construction of the new temple. It is the contention of the 3rd

Respondent that since the villagers have been associated with him, the Petitioner has

acted with malice and he avers that this application has been made mala fide to prevent

the construction of the new temple and its religious activities.

The laudable objective of the 3rd Respondent is brought out by the fact that he had

commenced the construction of the new temple at the request of the villagers and it

would appear that he is motivated with a genuine intent to uplift the spiritual

knowledge of the villagers and community of the area. The uncontroverted assertion of

the 3rd Respondent is that among other community services of the new temple, it

maintains a training centre for Samanera Bhikkus publishing Thripitaka Dharma and

Sunday Daham School.

The 3rd Respondent also has stated in his affidavit that the main requirements which

should be in a temple i.e. Bodhi Prakaraya, Bodhi Kutiya and Ghantara Kuluna are all

perfectly completed and the Sangawasaya has been constructed with the approval of

Lankapura Pradeshiya Sabha. Thus it would appear that the 3rd Respondent has obtained

a sanction of all authorities to construct a temple and if at all, the question whether the

3rd Respondent and any other persons possess the right to construct a temple within the

land on a state grant is a matter for the 1st Respondent, Divisional Secretary, Lankapura

who represents the interest of the state and this Court observes no objections towards

the construction of this temple from this Respondent.

4

It will be inequitable and unreasonable if this Court is to interfere with the discretionary

power of the 1st Respondent which has been properly exercised in order to promote

spiritual upliftment of the people in the area. I do not find any legal right in the

Petitioner, nor does he have locus standi to file or maintain this application before this

Court. In these circumstances, this Court is disinclined to grant this application for a

Writ of Mandamus and I proceed to refuse this application.
