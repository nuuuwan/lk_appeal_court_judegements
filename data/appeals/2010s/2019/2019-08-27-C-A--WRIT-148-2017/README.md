Janak De Silva J.

The grand father of the Petitioner, Rajakaruna Wasala Mudiyanselage Ukku Banda (Ukku Banda)

was issued a permit (lR1) under the Land Development Ordinance (Ordinance) for the land

described in the schedule to the petition. The permit (lR1) referred to two lands, a paddy land in

extent of 3 acres and a high land in extent of 1 Y, acres.

The Petitioner, 1" and 4th Respondents are in agreement that Ukku Banda nominated

Samarakoon Banda as the sole successor to both the above lands although the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents state that they are unaware of such a nomination. Samarakoon Banda is the father

of the Petitioner.

Parties are in agreement that Ukku Banda passed away on 17.05.1979. The relief that the

Petitioner seeks to obtain from these proceedings is essentially permits/grants to the lands

described in the schedule to the petition which fall within the permit 1R1.

As far as the high land is concerned it is not possible for at least five reasons. A grant (lR2) under

section 19(4) of the Ordinance has been issued to Bandara Menike, wife of Ukku Banda sometime

in 1996 under the hand of H.E. the President for the high land. The Petitioner contends that the

Page 2 of 6

issue of such a grant is contrary to law. However, as Lord Radcliffe held in Smith v. East Ellae Rural

District Council [(1956) A.C. 736, 769-770]:

"An order, ... is still an act capable of legal consequences. It bears no brand of invalidity

upon its forehead. Unless the necessary proceedings are taken at law to establish the

cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise upset, it will remain as effective for

its ostensible purpose as the most impeccable of orders."

Firstly, the Petitioner has not sought a quashing of the said grant (lR2). In Weerasaoriya v. The

Chairman, National Housing Development Authority ond Others [C.A. Application No. 866/98,

CAM. 08.03.2004] Sripavan J. (as he was then) held that the court will not set aside a document

unless it is specifically pleaded and identified in express language in the prayer to the petition.

Secondly, Amaratunga J. in Wijeratne (Commissianer of Motor Traffic) v. Ven. Dr. Paragada

Wimalawansa Thero and 4 others [(2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 258 at 267] held as follows:

"The first rule regarding the necessary parties to an application for a writ of certiorari is

that the person or authority whose decision or exercise of power is sought to be quashed

should be made a respondent to the application. (i) If it is a body of persons whose

decision or exercise of power is sought to be quashed each of the persons constituting

such body who took part in taking the impugned decision or the exercise of power should

be made respondent. The failure to make him or them respondents to the application is

fatal and provides in itself a ground for the dismissal of the application in limine. (Jamila

Umma vs. Mohamed, Karunarathna vs. the Commissioner of Cooperative Developments;

British Ceylon Corporation us Weerasekara). (ii) Ifthe act sought to be impugned had been

done by one party on a direction given by another party who has power granted by law

to give such direction, the party who had given the direction is also a necessary party and

the failure to make such party a respondent is fatal to the validity of the application.

(Mudiyanse vs. Christie Silva, Government Agent, Hambantota)."

H.E. the President who decided to issue the grant (lR2) is not a party to this application and in

fact could not have been made so in view of Article 35 ofthe Constitution.

Thirdly, the grant (lR2) was issued in 1996 whereas this application was filed in 2017 more than

21 years after the issue of the said grant. Unexplained delay is a ground to refuse granting of

discretionary remedies such as writ of certiorari. In Jayarathne v. Wickremaratne and Others

[(2003) 2 Sri.L.R. 276] it was held that even when a petitioner is entitled to the relief on grounds

of error of law, if the petitioner is guilty of laches it stands against the grant of relief by way of

Page 3 of 6

writ of certiorari. In this case, the Court specifically came to a finding that the decision impugned

in that application was irrational, arbitrary and unreasonable. Yet the relief was refused since the

application was made to Court 7 years after the impugned decision.

Fourthly, Bandara Menike nominated three successors to the high land, namely Samarakoon

Banda (father of the Petitioner), 2nd Respondent (her son) and 3rd Respondent (her daughter).

Samarakoon Banda passed away on 06.04.2011 whereas Bandara Menike passed away

afterwards on 19.07.2011.

In w.M. Chandra Kumari Palamakumbura v. P.A. Hema Damayanthie and Others [BAL.!. XXII

(2016) 171] the Supreme Court held that the rights of a nominated successor are contingent upon

the nominated successor fulfilling the requirements under the provisions of the Ordinance and

that the mere nomination of a successor does not tantamount to automatic transfer of the land

to the nominated successor. The Court further held that the nominee is required to have the

permit officially transferred upon making an application to that effect to the relevant authority

and that in view of section 55 of the Ordinance only upon regularising the permit can the

successor gain full benefit of the enjoyment ofthe land. It was further held that where the permit-

holder makes a nomination but is survived by a spouse, as in the instant case, the nominated

successor has to succeed to the land by entering into possession within the time stipulated in

section 68(2) of the Ordinance. No such evidence has been placed before Court by the Petitioner.

However, he has with his written submissions sought to place documents marked A1 to A7 to

establish such entering into of possession. Firstly, such new material has been placed before this

Court in breach of Rule 3(8) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 and as such

cannot be considered by Court. In any event, they do not cover the period mentioned in section

68(2) of the Ordinance.

Fifthly, section 60 of the Ordinance states that no nomination or cancellation of the nomination

of a successor shall be valid unless the document (other than a last will) effecting such nomination

or cancellation is duly registered before the date of death of the owner of the holding or the

permit holder. Several decisions ofthe superior courts have held that the provisions in section 60

of the Ordinance is mandatory and the failure to register renders a nomination invalid.

[Madurasinghe v. Madurasinghe (1988) 2 Sri.L.R. 142, Gunadasa v. Marywathy (2012) B.L.R. 248,

Gunaratne v. Agalawatta (2013) Galle Law Journal Vol. 11325, Ranjith v. Nissanka Arachchi and

Page 4 of 6

Others (C.A. Writ 453/2013, C.A.M. 10.10.2016)]. There is no evidence that the nomination of

Samarakoone Banda by Ukku Banda was registered.

This leaves only the question of paddy land to be considered. Before examining that issue a

further narrative of the facts is needed.

Upon the death of the original permit holder Ukku Banda on 17.05.1979, the lands covered by

the permit was given to the surviving spouse of Ukku Banda, Bandara Menike who had nominated

Samarakoon Banda and the 2nd Respondents (her sons) as the successors. This nomination was

cancelled in 2012 (P3).

However, upon a request made by the Petitioner, a permit under section 19(2) of the Ordinance

has been issued in favour of the Petitioner for 1 acre and 2 roods of the paddy land (P4). The

signature of the Petitioner appears on page 4 therein and is dated 15.10.2015. This in my view

clearly indicates the acceptance by the Petitioner of part of the paddy land in dispute.

Scrutton, U . in Verschures Creameries Limited vs. Hull & Netherland Steamship Ca. Ltd. [(1921) 2

KB 608 at 612] held:

"A person cannot say at one time that a transaction is valid and thereby obtain some

advantage, to which he could only be entitled on the footing that it is valid, and then turn

around and say it is void for the purpose of securing some other advantage. This is to

approbate and reprobate the transaction."

Samarakoon c.J. in VisuvaJingam v. Liyanage [(1983) 1 Sri L.R. 203 at 227] adopted principle in a

different formulation by stating that one "cannot blow hot and cold."

In Ranasinghe v. Premadharma and athers [(1985) 1 SrLL.R. 63 at 70] Sharvananda C. J. held:

"In cases where the doctrine of approbation and reprobation applies, the person

concerned has a choice of two rights, either of which he is at liberty to adopt, but not

both. When the doctrine does apply, ifthe person to whom the choice belongs irrevocably

and with full knowledge accepts the one, he cannot afterwards assert the other; he cannot

affirm and disaffirm"

To that extent, I hold that the Petitioner cannot approbate and reprobate as he seeks to do by

seeking to assail the documents by which he accepted part of the paddy land. In any event, the

fourth and fifth reasons set out above equally applies to the paddy land.

Page 50f6

For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the application of the Petitioner with costs.

However, when Court sought clarifications from the Petitioner as to whether he is not satisfied

with what he has received in the form of paddy land, the learned counsel for the Petitioner

informed that he is prevented from exercising his rights under the permit (P4) for the paddy land.

In those circumstances, Court directs the 1st Respondent to consider taking steps under the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act to evict any unauthorised occupants from the paddy land

given to the Petitioner in terms of permit marked P4 and hand over vacant possession ofthe said

paddy land to the Petitioner expeditiously.

Subject to the above direction, the application dismissed with costs.
