The Petitioner seeks an order in the nature of a writ of mandamus on the 1st

Respondent, who is the Divisional Secretary, Nuwara Eliya, to compel him to refer the

claims of the Petitioner and the 3rd and 4th Respondents to the District Court of Nuwara

Eliya for determination of their rights as to compensation for the allotments of land that

had been acquired. A schedule containing details of the compulsory acquisitions has been

appended to the petition. The claims for compensation had been made by the Petitioner,

the 3rd Respondent and 4th Respondent. Mr. N. Jayanthan, Counsel for the Petitioner

submitted that as far back as 13.01.2012, the then Divisional Secretary had addressed a

2

letter to the General Manager of the Petitioner stating that since he was unable to decide

on the claims made before him owing to disputed claims of ownership, he had decided to

refer the matter, under Section lO(l)(b) of the Land Acquisition Act, to the District Court

for determination as to the rights of parties. Thereafter, nothing was heard of any such

reference to the District Court and for several years the jurisdiction of the District Court

was not invoked. Several letters had been addressed by the Petitioner to the 1st

Respondent demanding that the statutory duty to refer the dispute under Section lO(l)(b)

of the Land Acquisition Act be exercised but they had been of no avail. The Petitioner

wrote to the Divisional Secretary by his letter dated 03.12.2015 that since no reference had

been made to the District Court regarding the payment of compensation, he would be

interested to know whether the Divisional Secretary had taken any steps to refer the

matter to the District Court or whether they would take such steps before the end of the

year namely 2015.

By way ofa response to this letter, the Divisional Secretary, Nuwara Eliya stated that they

had decided to deposit the compensation payable in the District Court of Nuwara Eliya and

they would inform the parties of the steps taken within two weeks.

Thereafter, the Petitioner had written to the 1st Respondent on the 10.02.2016 stating that

they would institute legal action within one week if nothing was heard on this matter.

Dr. Sunil Coorey who appears for the 4th Substituted Respondent also made submissions

on the failure to perform the statutory duty mandated by law and Mr. N. Jayanthan and

Dr. Sunil Coorey both submitted that Section lO(l)(b) of the Land Acquisition Act, No.9

of 1950 as amended casts a mandatory duty on the part of acquiring officer holding the

inquiry wither to make a decision on a retain claims or in the event of a difficulty to

determine the claims refer the claim or dispute for the determination to the District Court.

The aforesaid provision goes as follows:-

1) At the conclusion of an inquiry held under Section 9, the acquiring officer holding

the inquiry shall either-

3

a) make a decision on every claim made by any person to any right, title or

interest to, in or over the land which is to be acquired or over which a

servitude is to be acquired and on every such dispute as may have arisen

between any claimants as to any such right, title or interest, and give notice of

his decision to the claimant or to each of the parties to the dispute, or

b) refer the claim or dispute for determination as hereinafter provided ........... .

It would appear from the correspondence available on the record that a promise had been

made to discharge this statutory duty but, so far the expectation of the Petitioner has yet

not been fulfilled. The learned Senior State Counsel, Chaya Sri Nammuni appearing for the

Hon. Attorney-General submitted that the extent of the land is so vast that it has taken a

while for the steps to be completed in order to file action in this matter and in any event

she stated that plaints in regard to two claims pertaining to parcels of land of this land

have been forwarded to the 1st Respondent with a view to instituting proceedings in the

District Court.

However, it appears that the action under Section 1O(l)(b) has yet not be initiated by the

statutory functionary namely the 1st Respondent to this application, if at all the plaints

have been forwarded.

Having regard to the correspondence and the submissions made by all counsel, it appears

to this Court that there has been a delay and failure to refer this dispute to the District

Court of Nuwara Eliya.

Though the Petitioners had been agitating for an institution of proceedings since 2015,

nothing has been done to facilitate the payment of compensation that pervades the spirit

of Section 1O(1)(b) of the land Acquisition Act. The pith and substance of the land

Acquisition Act embodies the concept of eminent domain or no expropriation of private

land without compensation.

In the House of lords judgment of Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v. Melbourne

Harbour Trust Commissioners (1927) AC 343 at 359, lord Warrington of Clyffe noted:-

"In considering the construction and effect of this Act, the Board is guided by the well known

principle that a statute should not be held to take away private rights of property without

compensation unless the intention to do so is expressed in clear and unambiguous terms."

It is trite law that private property can only be compulsorily acquired or used by the State

and not otherwise. The rationale of compulsory acquisition by the State is that private

interests may in some circumstances be subordinated to the higher interests of the public.

Patanjali Sastri, CJ in delivering the judgment of the Indian Supreme Court in State of

Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh AIR 1952 SC 252 at 264 said:~

"It is true that under the common law of eminent domain as recognized in the jurisprudence of all

civilized countries, the State cannot take the property of its subject unless such property is required

for a public purpose and without compensating the owner for its loss."

However, it must be noted that the laws which enable expropriation of private property

must be stated in clear and unambiguous terms and moreover must afford adequate

compensation.

In view of these well established principles this Court deems it apt that it should exercise

its discretionary powers under Article 140 of the Constitution to grant the relief namely a

writ of mandamus on the rt Respondent ordering him to perform his duty that is required

of him under Section 10 (l) (b ) of the Land Acquisition Act, No.9 of 1950 as amended.

The Divisional Secretary is directed to give effect to the claims that have been forwarded

by the Hon. AG and immediately institute this action in the District Court of Nuwara Eliya

to proceed with the payment of compensation to the Petitioners and the 3rd and 4th

Respondents.

In the circumstances, this Court issues a writ of mandamus ordering the 1st Respondent to

refer without delay the claims of the Petitioner and the 3rd and 4th Respondents to the

District Court of Nuwara Eliya for determination of their rights to compensation.
