Asthika Devendra with Ulan

Warusawithana and Sunali Jayasuriya Wasantha for the Petitioner

Kushan de Alwis PC with Kaushalya Navaratne for 1st to t h Respondents

29.04.2019

This application for judicial review raises the question whether a resolution

adopted by a bank, prior to the enactment of Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special

Provisions) (Amendment) Act, No 1 of 2011, could be acted upon to conduct a parate

execution and recover outstanding dues from a borrower, even when the

principal amount borrowed is less than Rs 5 million. Does the bank act ultra

vires in acting upon a pre-amendment resolution and proceeding to auction? Is

the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act, No 1 of 2011

retrospective so as to nullify the pre-amendment resolution? These are the

questions that arise in these proceedings.

The learned counsel for the Petitioner Mr Asthika Devendra has strongly

contended that the Amendment Act, No 1 of 2011 is retrospective and this

retrospectivity is manifest upon a perusal of the speech made by the relevant

Minister who introduced the bill on 06,h January 2011. The Hansard of

Parliamentary proceedings on 06,h January 2011 figured prominently in the

argument for retrospectivity Mr Devendra put forward. A recourse to extrinsic

aid to statutory interpretation is consequent upon this argument and the

learned counsel relied on the seminal case of Pepper (Inspector of Taxes) v

Hart (1993) AC 593; (1992) 3 WLR 1032 which holds that Parliamentary

material is a permissible aid to starutory interpretation. Interestingly, the spirit

of Pepper v Hart lives on in many a jurisdiction and in 2010, a nine-judge

bench of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom cited Pepper as an

authoritative pronouncement of Parliamentary privilege-see R v Chayton

(2010) UKSC 52.

Long before the advent of this case, our courts acknowledged the relevance of

Hansards in judicial proceedings and Samarakoon C] inJD. Textiles Industries

Ltd v Minister of Finance and Planning (1981) 1 Sri.LR 156 alluded to the

admissibility of statements made in Parliament as evidence in a case. Be that as

it may, I shall rerum to this argument and echoes of Pepp er v Hart in Sri Lanka

later in this judgment and let me now deal with the crux of the issues.

The Petitioner seeks in the main to quash the resolution of 17'h June 2003 that

finally led to the sale of the mortgaged properties in 2012. The resolution relied

upon by the bank is evidently a pre-amendment step taken under Sections 3

and 4 of the principal amendment namely Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special

Provisions) Act, No 4 of 1990. By the Amendment Act, No 1 of 2011 which was

certified on 28th January, 2011, Section SA was brought in to give relief to

borrowers who had obtained a loan of less than Rs 5 million. The Amendment

Act, No 1 of 2011 was further amended by Amendment Act, No 19 of 2011 on 31st

March 2011 to clarify that the Amendment would operate only in respect of

borrowings where the principal amount borrowed is less than Rs 5 million.

Section SA as amended by Act No 19 of 2011, which comes up for interpretation

on the question whether it is retrospective in its effect, goes as follows:

SA (1)

"No action shall be initiated in terms of section 3 of the principal enactment for the

recovery of any loan in respect of which default is made, nor shall any steps be taken in

terms of section 4 or section 5 of the aforesaid Act, where the principal amount

borrowed of such loan is less than rupees five million ......... "

So as of 28.01.2011 when the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions)

(Amendment) Act, No. 1 of 2011 was certified, 3 types of action or steps are

prohibited on the part of banks in respect of a loan when the principal amount

borrowed is less than Rs.5 million.

1. Section 3 action

2. Section 4 step

3. Section 5 step

All these three actions or steps that are authorized by the principal enactment

namely Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No.4 of 1990 are embargoed

by the Amending Act No. 1 of 2011 as amended.

So what was prohibited by the Amendment Acts in 2011, when the principal

amount borrowed is less than Rs. 5 million, have to be reemphasized.

1. Section 3 of the principal enactment Act No.4 of 1990 enables the board

of a bank to treat a borrower as if in default of the entirety of the unpaid

portion of the loan in the event he has defaulted in the payment of any

sum, whether on account of the principal or interest.

2. This deeming provision to treat the borrower as a defaulter enables the

bank to initiate, in its discretion, action either in terms of section 4 or

section 5.

3. Section4 of the principal enactment empowers the board of a bank to

adopt a resolution to authorize any person to sell by auction any

property mortgaged to the bank, which is the security for the loan.

4. The board may, in terms of Section 5 of Act NO. 4 of 1990, authorize any

person by resolution to enter upon the mortgaged property, take

possession and manage it.

From the effective date of the Amendment Act No 1 of 2011 namely 28th January

2011, none of the above steps could be taken by any bank in respect of the

specific class of borrowers i.e those who have borrowed less than Rs 5 million.

The intendment of the legislature is quite clear and unambiguous upon a

scrutiny of the above provisions and the pith and substance of the Amendment

read with the principal enactment is that no resolution to sell by parate execution

a mortgaged property can be adopted by a bank, after 28th January, 2011, in

respect of a borrower whose principal amount borrowed is less than Rs 5

million. So the RecoveJY of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act, No 1 of

2011, as amended by Act No 19 of 2011, confers an advantage on these class of

borrowers in that there will be no more board room resolutions to effect parate

executions of their mortgaged properties but it will be open to the creditor

bank to institute hypothecary action in respect of these loans less than Rs 5

million.

The watershed date is 28th January, 2011, after which there must be, in esse, a

borrower whose borrowing must be less than Rs 5 million. The date of the loan

is immaterial. It can be before or after 28th January 2011. The consequence is

that the bank is incompetent to adopt a resolution in terms of section 3, 4 or 5

of the principal enactment.

The gravamen of the argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was

that since the Petitioner's loan was Rs 2 million, he falls within section SA (1)

and no resolution can be passed against him.

But the nub of the problem in this case is distinctive. The resolution to sell by

auction the mortgaged property had long been adopted by the People's Bank as

far back as 17'h June 2003-alrnost 8 years before the Amendment Act No 1 of

2011 carne into effect. The Amendment Act prohibits the passage or adoption of

a resolution only after 28th January 2011. The Amendment is only offensive of a

prospective resolution. It cannot possibly claw back at a resolution adopted as

far back as 17'h June 2003.

Bearing this in mind, Mr.Asthika Devendra quite ingeniously argued that the

Amendment Act bears a retrospective effect because it was enacted in order to

help the small time borrowers. Section SA is broad enough to nullify the prior

resolution and as such the resolution dated 17'h June 2003 must be quashed by

certiorari. This was the argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

Before I answer this question presently, I find upon the chronology of events

surrounding the loan transaction that the resolution dated 17'h June 2003 was

frustrated a number of times by acts undertaken by the Petitioner. I will not go

into detail as regards the factual background of the case but suffice it to say

that the Petitioner was granted two loans by the People's Bank and the

mortgaged properties operated both as primary and secondary mortgages for

these two loans. Two lands which constitute the security were offered by the

Petitioner to the bank as a security for an initial loan of Rs 2 million and later

the Petitioner executed a secondary mortgage of these two lands for an

overdraft facility of Rs 1 million on 30.06.l999. There was also a primary

mortgage of another land which the Petitioner offered as a security for the

overdraft. Though the Bank adopted a resolution upon default, this was not

proceeded with as the Petitioner sought the indulgence of the bank to pay and

settle the dues. As the Petitioner did not honour his undertaking, it would

appear that the bank was compelled to adopt another resolution on 17.06.2003-

X21 and X21A.

This is the resolution that is sought to be quashed in these proceedings by way

of a writ of certiorari. I find a number of letters from the Petitioner which

acknowledge liability on his part. Though an auction had been fixed, it would

appear that it was cancelled because of a solemn undertaking on the part of the

Petitioner to make payment. The letter marked as X29 bears this out. Since no

meaningful steps were taken by the Petitioner to make the payment, an auction

came along for 5.04.2005. But just 4 days before the auction, the Petitioner

went before the District Court of Ku/iyapitiya and obtained an interim order

against the conduct of the auction. The matter had proceeded in the District

Court for three years until the action was dismissed on 12.03.2008 eventuating

in the dissolution of the interim injunction.

Having made several representations to various institutions other than the

bank, the Petitioner eventually settled the outstanding amount on the overdraft

facility that had been granted. In other words the secondary mortgage bond

was discharged and the deed of release is found at X43. The security taken for

the overdraft was thus released.

But this left the loan facility of Rs 2 million unsettled and the primary mortgage

bond was yet alive for the bank to realise its outstancbng dues on this loan. X21

and X2lA-the Sinhala and English versions of the resolution of 17'h June 2003

clearly identify the two loans separately and a sum of Rs 1.8 million was due on

the original loan of Rs 2 million together with interest at 26 per cent from

12.11.1998 onwards. Thereafter steps were taken in due compliance with the law

to effect parate execution and by X47 dated 10.10.2012, the Bank gives its

reasons as to why it was proceeding to an auction. Before the auction was held,

the Amendment Act No 01 of 2011 was passed but the auction proceeded to a

fruition and one finds a certificate of sale (X58 dated 20.12.2012) by which the

Bank purchased the property at the auction and became its owner. No doubt

the Bank enjoys a vested right of resale of the properties provided it has acted

properly in accordance with the law.

It is in this factual background that the Petitioner has raised the quintessential

question before this Court namely whether the Amendment Act No 01 of 2011

applies to the facts and circumstances of this case. Does section 5A of

Amendment Act No 01 of 2011 disable a resolution adopted prior to its passage?

Is the Amendment Act retrospective? Could the bank have acted upon the

resolution of 17'h June 2003?

The learned President's Counsel Mr Kushan de Alwis for the Respondent Bank

chose to demonstrate that the Amendment Act No 01 of 2011 was not

retrospective at all. He strenuously contended that there is nothing in the Act

that manifests an intention to prohibit and nullify the effect of a previous

resolution. Section 5A on the face of it does not eventuate in a retrospective

effect. The learned President's Counsel cited a judgment of Anil Goonerame J in

S.KRahuman Maulana v People's Bank (2004) Volume 1 Hulftsdorp Law

Journal 510 wherein the learned Judge took the view in the Court of Appeal

that the Amendment Act No 01 of 2011 does not have a retrospective effect.

As I set out the ambit of section 5A before, the prohibition is only against

passing a resolution after 28th January 2011, when the principal amount

borrowed is less than Rs 5 million. Ex facie, there is no prohibition against prior

resolutions that have been adopted.

The crux of the Amendment Act No 1 of 2011 as amended by Amendment Act

No 19 of 2011 is that no bank can pass a resolution with a view to holding an

auction when the prinCipal amount is less than Rs 5 million. The Amendment

Act only nullifies a post-Amendment resolution that comes after 28th January

2011 and it leaves intact a resolution that was adopted prior to 28th January

2011. This is the view I take after having carefully examined the Amendments

vis a vis the principal enactment.

If a resolution had been adopted prior to 28th January 2011, it is quite clear that

the Amendment Act No 1 of 2011 as amended would not apply. Section 5A (1)

of the Amendment Act would not prohibit the holding of an auction and sale of

the mortgaged property if the auction emanates from a resolution that was

adopted before the Amendment Act came into effect on 28th January 2011.

One has to give effect to the clear words of a starute and as Lord Diplock said in

Duport SteeivSirs(1980) 1 WLR 142:

"Where the meaning of the statutory words is plain and unambiguous it is not for the

judges to invent fancied ambiguities as an excuse to give effect to its plain meaning

because they consider the consequences of doing so would be inexpedient, or even

unjust or immoral."

Mr. Asthika Devendra's argument that the resolution of June 2003 flies in the

air as Section 5A has to be given retrospective effect would also fail by the

canons of interpretation surrounding the presumption against retrospectiviry.

It is axiomatic that as the legislarure of a state is sovereign in its sphere of

legislative competency, the Sri Lankan legislarure in the exercise of its

authoriry enjoys the competence to enact legislation with retrospective effect-

see Article 75 of the Constirution which enacts that" Parliament shall have the

power to make laws including laws having retrospective effect and repealing or

amending any provision of the Constirution ....... ".

But this competence is subject to its guiding principles recognized by well

known cases and commentators.

N.S. Bindra's Interpretation of Starutes (12th Edition .. , 2017, p 508-509 ) states

the prinCiple as follows:-

"When the law is altered during the pendency of an action, the rights of the parties are

decided according to the law, as it existed when the action was begun, unless the new

statute shows a clear intention to vary such rights ....... .

Where the rights and procedure are dealt with togerher, the illtention of the legislature

may well be that old rights are to be determined by the old procedure, and that, only

the new rights under the substituted section arc to be dealt with by the new procedure.

If the procedural alteration is closely and inextricably linked with the changes

Simultaneously introduced in another part of the statute dealing with substantive

rights and liabilities, it is not possible to give retrospective operation to the

amendment regarding procedure unless the legislature has indicated such an intention

either by express words or by necessary implication ...

So the legislature must manifest retrospectivity on the face of the statute and as

the learned President's Counsel for the Respondent Bank correctly submitted,

the Amendment Act does not display such intention.

Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes at page 215, 218 and 220 (12th Edition),

states as follows:-

Page 215

"Upon the presumption that the legislature does not intend what is unjust rests the

leaning against giving certain statutes a retrospective operatiOn. They are construed as

operating only in cases or on facts which come into existence after the statutes were

passed unless the retrospective effect is dearly intended. It is a fundamental rule of

English law that no statute shall be construed to have a mrospective operation unless

such a construction appears very clearly in the terms of the Ace, or arises by necessary

and distinct implication"

Page 218 -

"The rule tinder discussion has been applied chiefly, in cases in which the statute in

question, if it operated retrospectively, would prejudicially affect vested

rights or the legality of passed transactions or would impair contacts or would

impose new disabilities in respect of past transactions ..... "

Page 220 -

"In general, when the substantive law is altered during the pendency of an action, the

rights of parties are decided according to the law as it existed when the action was

begun, unless the new statute shows a clear intention to vary such a right."

Thus Maxwell makes it clear that legislature is loath to remove vested rights

and if retrospectivity results in an eventuality of vested rights being taken

away, one cannot hold that the presumption against retrospectivity has been

rebutted. By way of the resolution adopted as far back as 1th June 2003, the

People's Bank acquired a vested right to take further steps in order to effect

parate execution. There was no defeasance of this vested right by the

Amendment Acts enacted in 2011. Since legislature is slow to remove vested

rights, retrospectivity cannot thus be presumed.

In this regard, the attention of the Court was drawn to page 64 of eraies on

Statute Law 7"h Edition Universal Law Publishing where it is stated as

follows:-

"Strictly speaking there is no place for interpretation or construction except where the

words of statute admit two meanings. As Scott LJ said: Where the words of an Act of

Parliament are clear, there is not room for applying any of the principles of

interpretation which are merely presumptions in cased of ambiguity in the statute ....... .

The cardinal rule for the construction of an Act of Parliament is that they should be

construed according to the intention expressed in the Act themselves.

If the words of a statute are themselves precise ........ then no more can be necessary than

to expound those words in their ordinary and natural steps ........ .

The Tribunal has to construe an Act of a Legislature, or indeed any other document has

to determine the intention as expressed by the words used. And in order to understand

these words it is natural to inquire what is the subject matter with respect to which

they are used and the object in view. In 1953 Lord Goddard C]. said, "A certain amount

of common sense must be applied in construing statutes. The object of the Act has to be

considered ...

Where the language of an Act is clear and explicit. we must give effect to it. whatever

may be the consequences,for in that case the words of the statutes speak the intention of

the legislature."

So the retrospectivity argument would come a cropper but the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner invited this Court to presume retrospectivity by way of the

principles adumbrated in Pepper v Hart (supra). The invitation was to infer

retrospectivity having regard to the speech made by the Minister when he

presented the Amendment Bill. In fact both Counsel read out to Court some of

the excerpts from the speech of the Minister who moved the Bill in Parliament.

In 1992 the House of Lords delivered what some commentators call a

blockbuster in the case of Pepper v Hart (supra). By a six to one majority (Lord

Mackay LC dissenting) the House of Lords decided to allow reference to be

made to Hansard in limited circumstances. Reference to Parliamentary

materials would be allowed where:

(a) legislation is ambiguous or obscure. or leads to absurdity;

(b) the material relied upon consists of one or more statements by

Minister or of the promoter of the Bill. together if necessary with such

other Parliamentary material as is necessary to understand such

statements and their effect:

(c) the statements relied upon are clear.

In this case, the effect of permitting reference to Hansard was that the literal

meaning of the statute in question was not followed.

Some comments by their Lordships are worth noting here. Lords Bridge stated

(at l039H, WLR) that:

It should, in my opinion, only in rare cases where the very issue of interpretation

which the courts are called on to resolve has been addressed in Parliamentary debate

and where the promoter of the legislation has a clear statement and directed to that

very issue, that reference to Hansard should be permitted.

Lord Oliver commented (1042H, WLR)

It can apply only where the expression of the legislative intention is genuinely

ambiguous or obscure or where a literal or prima facie construction leads to a

manifest absurdi ty.

Lord Mackay (dissenting) observed:

1 believe that practically every question of statutory construction that comes before

the courts will involve an argument.. ... [on (a) to confirm the meaning of a provision

as conveyed by the text, its object and purpose; (b) to determine a meaning where the

provision is ambiguous or obscure; or (c) to determine the meaning where the

ordinary mealling is manifestly absurd or unreasonable] .... it follows that the

parties' legal advisors will require to study Hansard in practically every such case

to see whether or lIot there is allY help to be gained from it. 1 believe this is an

objection of real substance.1t is a practical objection not one of principle .... (1037G,

WLR).

Such an approach appears to me to involve the possibility at least of an immense

increase ill the cost of litigation in which statutory construction is involved. (1038B,

WLR).

Lord Bridge further commented on the issue of additional costs (1039H, WLR).

Provided the relaxation of the previous exclusionGlY rule is so limited, I find it

difficult to suppose that the additional cost of litigation or any other of the ground of

objection can justify the court cOlltinuing to wear blillkers which, in such a case as

this, conceal the vital clue to the intended meaning of an enactment....[WJhere

Hansard does prOVide the answer, it should be 50 clear to both pGlties that they will

avoid the cost of litigation.

There has since been rise and fall of Pepper v Hart-see some useful comments

such as ].Steyn; "Pepper v Hart: A Re-examination" (2001) 21 Oxford Journal of

Legal Studies, 59; S.Yogenauer, "A Retreat from Pepper v Hart? A Reply to Lord

Steyn", (2005) 25 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies, 629-74. For specific

references to Pepper v Hart in Sri Lanka see the cases of De Silva v jeyaraj

Fernandopulle and Others (1996) 1 Sri.LR 70; Hettiaarachchi v Seneviratne,

Deputy Bribery Commissioner and Others (No 2) (1994) 3 SrLLR 293. For

references to Hansards being made for purposes of statutory interpretation also

see in addition to fB.Textiles (supra)-Gunasekera and Others v Ravi

Karunanayake (2006) 3 SrLLR 16; Shiyanl v Offlcer-i.n-Charge, Narcotics

Bureau and A.nother (2006) 2 Sri.LR 156. Thus it is clear that our courts have

indeed alluded to statements made in Hansards and it has to be acknowledged

that the relaxation of the exclusionary rule against Hansards was recognised in

this country long before it was set down in England.

Elizabeth Laing writing in (2006) JudiCial Review 44 reiterates the

applicability of the grounds as I set out above at (a), (b) and (c), if Hansard

speeches were to be brought into a case for interpretation-see Pepper v Hart:

Where Are We, How Did We Get Here, and Where Are We Going?

(2006) JR 44 at 46. If the legislation is unambiguous or clear, there is no

warrant for the applicabiliry of parliamentary material to statutory

construction. I have taken the view that the statutory language manifest in the

Amendment Act is so plain as the pikestaff that recourse to Parliamentary

speech made by the mover of the Bill becomes otiose. I have though carefully

gone through the speech of the relevant minister at pages 488, 489 and 490 of

the Hansard dated 16th January 2011 and I do not find any clear statement made

by the Minister on the issue for interpretation before this Court. In the

circumstances I hold that there is no warrant to infer rerrospectivity having

regard to the facts and circumstances of this case.

So I would hold that the Respondent Bank lawfully acted on a resolution of 17'h

June 2003 in order to carry out its pm'ate powers. The Amendment Act No 1 of

2011 as amended does not have a rerrospective effect so extensive enough to

invalidate the prior resolution.

In view of this holding it is not necessary for me to consider the other

discretionary bars such as laches that the learned President's Counsel for the

Respondent bank raised in regard to this application. Accordingly I would

refuse the remedies prayed for by the Petitioner and proceed to dismiss the

application for judicial review.
