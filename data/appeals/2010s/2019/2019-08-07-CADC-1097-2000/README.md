Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is an appeal filed by the 8th and 9th defendants (appellants)

against the Judgment of the learned District Judge of Balapitiya

dated 12.09.2000. 19 years have passed since the filing of the

appeal. When this appeal came up for argument the first time

before me on 04.07.2018, as the learned counsel for the

appellant was held up in another Division of this Court,

argument was re-fixed for 05.07.2018. On 05.07.2018 also

argument was postponed for 03.08.2018 as the learned counsel

for the appellants was unavailable. On 03.08.2018, brief oral

submissions were made by learned counsel for the appellants

and the plaintiff (respondent). As the written submissions of

both parties had not been filed by then, I directed both parties to

file written submissions on or before 25.09.2018 with a copy to

the Attorney-at-Law of the opposite party. Case was to be

mentioned on 26.10.2018 to file reply submissions, if any.

Learned counsel for the respondent has filed 1 pages of brief

written submissions on 15.10.2018. Case was called on

26.10.2018, 27.11.2018, 05.02.2018 and 27.02.2019 for the

written submissions of the appellants to be filed, but no written

submissions were filed. On 27.02.2019, I directed the written

3

submissions of the appellants to be tendered on or before

20.06.2019 and fixed the matter for Judgment for today. Up to

now, no written submissions have been filed on behalf of the

appellants.

I read the entire original case record of the District Court

including the petition of appeal, amended plaint, amended

statement of claim of the appellants, admissions and issues,

evidence led at the trial with marked documents and the

Judgment of the District Court to understand the grievance of

the appellants.

There is no corpus dispute. Corpus is admitted. Original

owners are admitted. They are Seeman, Johanis, James Sinno,

Babanis and Siyohamy. There is a limited pedigree dispute

raised by the appellants. That is (a) Kirihamy is not a child of

Seeman and (b) Siyohamy had only one child, namely,

Hinniappuhamy, and did not have three children. The other

point the appellants raised was that they have prescribed to the

land.

The learned District Judge in his Judgment has given very

convincing reasons why he cannot accept those positions taken

up by the appellants. It is a very well-written Judgment.

Reasons given for his conclusions are lucid and coherent.

There is hardly anything which I can add other than repeating

the same reasons in English language.

The evidence of the all the witnesses at the trial has been led

before the District Judge who delivered the Judgment. In a

partition case where pedigree is unfolded by the witnesses

4

memory, this is very important. The plaintiffs evidence is

convincing. He has given evidence with confidence.

If I may say very briefly, even though Kirihamys birth certificate

had not been produced, the fact that Kirihamy was a daughter of

Seeman has been proved by other evidence. For instance, in

Deed marked P3 (at page 341 of the brief), in the legend, it has

been stated that Kirihamy is a daughter of Seeman.

The sole reason why the appellants are not agreeable to accept

that Kirihamy was a child of Seeman is that, in the earlier

partition case No. 10011, Kirihamy, who was the 38th defendant,

was allotted Lot 16, whereas Seeman and his children, who were

32nd-36th defendants, were allotted Lot 20. Vide Final Decree of

that case marked P1 at page 330-333 of the brief. It is the

contention of the appellants that if Kirihamy was a child of

Seeman, there was no reason to allot a different Lot and her

share also could have been included in Lot 20. As the learned

District Judge has explained in the Judgment, Lot 16 has not

been allotted only to Kirihamy but both to Kirihamy and her

husband, Haramanis, who were 38th and 39th defendants in that

case. As Kirihamy was married and separated, they would have

preferred to have a separate Lot, which is not unusual. The

learned District Judge has also referred to the Interlocutory

Decree of that case marked P2 (at pages 334-339 of the brief) to

point out that the shares given to all the children of Seeman

(34th-36th defendants and 38th defendant) are the same, that is

each 1/840 share. This reasoning is acceptable.

5

Siyohamys grandson-the 10th defendant has given evidence to

say that Siyohamy had three children as opposed to the

appellants position that Siyohamy had only one son, who is

Hinniappuhamy. Deeds marked P7 and P8 (at pages 356, 360 of

the brief) inter alia go to show that Siyohamy had two other

children, namely, Parlis Appu and Ratu Hamina.

The learned District Judge cannot be found fault with for

accepting the version of the plaintiff on that limited pedigree

dispute than that of the 9th defendant appellant, who, at the

time of giving evidence was only 45 years of old. The 8th

defendant-appellant never gave evidence.

The appellants prescriptive claim to the entire land is not worth

investigating. They were not serious on that claim.

Notwithstanding they raised an issue on prescription, as I have

already stated, at least the 8th defendant-appellant did not give

evidence. According to the Preliminary Plan marked X, nobody

is living on the land. The 8th defendant has marked some old

electoral registers to say that he and his predecessors lived on

the land long time ago. The land to be partitioned is one Lot, to

be exact Lot 20, of a larger land, which is less than 10 perches

in extent. The adjoining Lot is Lot 19. It is not clear where the

8th defendant-appellant and his predecessors lived sometime

ago. In any event, they have not continued with possession.

Even though the 8th defendant did not give evidence he called

his elder brother, Peter Weeraratne, who was at that time 83

years of old to give evidence on possession. His evidence (at

pages 229-230 of the brief) was that appellants and their

6

predecessors were in possession not in Lot 20, which is the Lot

to be partitioned, but on the adjoining Lot, which is Lot 19.

It is hackneyed that proof of prescription against a real owner is

difficult, and proof of prescription against other co-owners is

extremely difficult. When a co-owner claims prescriptive

possession against other co-owners, proof of undisturbed,

uninterrupted, adverse or independent possession for more than

10 years explicitly adverted to in section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance itself is not sufficient.

In a co-owned property, every co-owner does not need to enjoy

the property to have the co-ownership intact. The possession of

one co-owner is in law the possession of other co-owners.

Nothing short of ouster or something equivalent to ouster by an

overt act as opposed to a covert act is absolutely necessary to

make possession adverse and end co-ownership.

There is absolutely no such evidence in this case.

I unreservedly affirm the Judgment of the learned District Judge

and dismiss the appeal of the appellants. However, I make no

order as to costs.
