The Accused- Petitioner-Petitioner has filed a reVISIon application in this cOUl1

seeking to set aside the order made by the Learned High Court Judge of Panadura

t dated 15.12.2017 in case No. 3262/20 15,lrefusing to enlarge the accused-petitionef

on bail pending an appeal. "

Facts of the case:

The accused- petitioner-petitioner (hereLlafter referred to as the 'petitioner') was

indicted before the Learned High Court Judge of Panadura for committing an

" offence punishable under section 383 read with section 380 and section 32 of Penal

Ii Code. At the conclusion of the case the ILearned High Court Judge had convicted

the petitioner.

Thereafter an application for bail, pentling appeal was made on behalf of the

\ petitioner and the Learned High Court Judge has dismissed the same on

, .1 15.12.2017. Being aggrieved by the said refusal, the petitioner preferred a revision

r application to this Court.

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioner has submitted following

grounds of revision in the petition and written submissions;

1. The sentence imposed by the Lea~ed High Court Judge is excessive sincCi

both the alleged deadly weapon 'lnd the co-perpetrator of the offence were

not produced before Court.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to duly appreciate the burden of

proof which is required to convict the petitioner under the present penal laws

of the country.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to appreciate the fact that as a

result of the force used by the police officers, at the time when he was taken

Page 3 of 7

into custody, the petitioner su~tained grave InJunes and had to be

hospitalized.

4. The complainant-respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

'respondent') had neither listed the alleged deadly weapon nor the co-

perpetrator of the offence during the trial even though the petitioner was

indicted under section 32 read with, section 383 of Penal Code.

5. Identification parade was held in contrary to the procedure and therefore it

caused prejudice to the petitioner.

6. The Learned High Court Judge ha~. failed to appreciate the oral submissions

of the petitioner's Counsel reg,:,rding the contradictory nature of the

evidence led in the High Court trial.

7. The Learned High Court Judge : as failed to appreciate the exceptional

circumstances brought to the notic~ of Court by the Learned Counsel in his

oral submissions while supporting".he petitioner's bail application.

8. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the fact that the accused

has previously not been convicted " f any offence.

9. Though the petitioner has filed -n appeal against the judgement of the

Learned High Court dated 15 .11.f O 1 7, by the time of the determination of

I the said appeal, the petitioner would have served a considerable part of !he

I sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge.

I

). The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner

was sentenced for a term of 10 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs'

10,0001= with a default term of 06 months simple imprisonment.

However it is imperative to note tha~ the petitioner has not submitted the

conviction and the sentencing order dated 15.11.2017. The Learned High Court

Judge in his order dated 15.12.2017 hlis mentioned about another order dated

Page 4 of 7

... ,

r " -'.

23.11.2017. Therefore we are unable to find the exact date on which the conviction

and the sentence were imposed on the petitioner.

In the case of Dahanayake and others V. Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation

Ltd. and others (2005) 1 Sri L.R. 67, it was held that,

"If there is no full and truthful di6'closure of material facts, the Court would

not go into the merits of the application but will dismiss it without further

examination.,. "

In the case of Lokugalappaththige C~ ril & Others V. Attorney General [S.C

(Spl.) L.A. No. 272/2013] it was held th it,

"In a brief manner a fair and fulr disclosure of all material facts would be

essential and should be pleaded in applications to Superior Courts by

parties aggrieved of orders and j udgments of the lower courts. In the same

manner a ''plain and concise statements of allfacts and material" would be

mandatory for special leave to Appeal Applications to the Supreme Court ... "

The Rule 3(1) (a) and (b) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 199,0'

require a petitioner to tender all the documents material to an application and in an

event a petitioner fails to comply with' such provisions, the Court may ex mero

motu or at the instance of any party, disrpiss such application.

(

In the case of Shanmugavadivu V. Kulathilake (2003) 1 Sri L.R. 215, it was 1,-held that,

"According to Rule 3(1) (a) it is .:Zecessary for an application to be made by

I' way of petition together with an,.:affidavit is support of the averments a'1d

these should be accompanied by the originals of documents material to surjz

application. Rule 3(b) specifically refers to the application made by way of

revision or restitution in integrum and states that those too should be made

, -

Pagt? 5 of 7 ,.

I I'-I }

in like manner referred to In Rule 3(l)(a) with copies of relevant

proceedings including pleadings tlnd documents produced in the Court of

First Instance, tribunal or other institution to which such application

relates ... " (Emphasis added)

These decisions amply demonstrate that ~t- is mandatory to submit all the relevant

I documents to Court when making an application and failure to do so will result in

dismissal of the application. The order f ontaining the conviction and sentence is

indeed a material document for an application for bail pending an appeal. Failure

I . to submit the conviction order is fatal to a revision application that seeks to revise , the order of bail pending an appeal.

Further we observe that the grounds submitted by the Learned Counsel for the

petitioner do not specify any illegality 'or irregularity in the bail order but in the

conviction. Those questions of law and facts need to be addressed in a separat'

appeal filed against the conviction. A J~dge is not required to consider the merits

of a case in an application for bail pendjng an appeal. We too are not inclined to

consider the merits of the High Court trialin this revision application that was filed

against the bail order.

In the case of Attorney General V. Ediriweera [S.C. Appeal No. 100/2005J

~J. (2006 B.L.R. 12), it was held that,

"The norm is that bail after conviction is not a matter of right but would be

granted only under exceptional circumstances. "

In the case ofR. Muthuretty V. The Qu'een [54 NLR 493], it was held that,

" ... J would say that the improbability of absconding would be a relevwtt

~ consideration in an applicatiorl for bail pending trial and not in alfl

applicationfor bail pending appeql.

" Pagq6of7

!

f

" . A Court will not grant bail as a rule. Bail is granted only in exceptional

circums tances ... "

Accordingly it is well settled law that bail, pending an appeal, will be granted only

upon the demonstration of exceptional circumstances. We observe that the Learned

High Court Judge in the order dated 15.12.2017 held that,

I, " " ... a50cs;i(!!l 2:5)~ ~ 0'C~ ~"lCzS~ eD"l zS zS8~ 2:5)6"l-&z:s5' <y~6a25f 2:5)6 0'25)J"l Z ,

Therefore the Learned High Court Judgy was correct in refusing to enlarge the

petitioner on bail pending an appeal due 0 lack of exceptional circumstances. For

these reasons, this revision application shr,uld stand dismissed.

We affirm the order of the Learned 'High Court Judge of Panadura dated

15.12.2017.

Accordingly the revision application is hereby dismissed without costs.
