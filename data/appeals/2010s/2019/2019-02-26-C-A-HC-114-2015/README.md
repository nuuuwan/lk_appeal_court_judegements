The Accused-Appellant (2nd Accused, hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted together with the 1st Accused, in the High Court of

Kegalle in terms of Section 296 to be read with Section 32 of the Penal Code for

causing the death of Hewayalage Alice alias Nandawathi (hereinafter referred to

as the deceased). At the conclusion of the trial before a jury, the 1st Accused was

acquitted from the said charge. The Appellant was convicted on a majority verdict

and was sentenced to death.

..

At the outset of the argument, the counsel for the Appellant raised a

preliminary issue stating that there is a serious misdirection of the jury by the

learned High Court Judge which amounts to a substantial miscarriage of justice in

terms of Section 243 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, (CCPA)

Section 243 of the CCPA states that;

"when the case for the defence and the prosecuting counsel's reply

(if any) are concluded the judge shall charge the jury summing up

the evidence and laying down the law by which the jury are to be .

guided. 11

The conviction against the Appellant which IS based on circumstantial

evidence is that;

a) soon after the incident, the Appellant armed with a knife had threatened

Batuwanage Sirisena (PW4).

b) the Appellant was wearing a blood-stained shirt at the time of arrest.

The Appellant submits that, PW 4 failed to disclose to the police in his

statement or at the non-summery inquiry, that the Appellant was armed at the time

he was identified nor has it been corroborated by any other witness and therefore,

contends, that the said omission should have been taken into consideration. Even

though the said omission had been brought to the notice of Court, the learned trial

judge has failed to charge the jury to consider whether this omission amounted to a

failure of justice.

"

According to the investigating officer, the Appellant had been arrested 4

hours after the incident. The investigating officer has stated that the Appellant was

wearing a blood stained shirt at the time of arrest.

The counsel for the Appellant. submits that, it is highly improbable that the

Appellant would have been wearing a blood stained shirt, 4 hours after the

incident and contends that the said fact does not pass the test of probability and

has invited Court to consider whether such non-direction of the jury to this

important issue of choosing between the more likely probability would amount to

a miscarriage of justice.

As held in, R vs. Pinhamy 57 NLR 169, the weight to be attached to the

testimony of a witness is a matter for the jury.

When dealing with circumstantial evidence, it is paramount that the learned

trial judge gives proper directions to the jury. It is observed that in the summing

up, the trial judge has failed to give guidance on evaluating circumstantial

evidence arising out of the prosecution case.

In King Vs. Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254, Soertsz J. stated that;

"in order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the jury

must be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of

the accused and inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of his

innocence "

, .

5

In the case of Mahmood v. State of U.P (1976) 1 see 542, it was held that,

"in a case dependent wholly on circumstantial evidence the Court must be

satisfied;

a) that the circumstances from which the interference of guilt is to be

drawn, have been fully established by unimpeachable evidence beyond

the shadow of doubt;

a) that the circumstances are of a determinative tendency unerringly

pointing towards the guilt of the accused; and

b) that the circumstances, taken collectively, are incapable of explanation

on any reasonable hypothesis save that of the guilt sought to be proved

against him."

The Counsel for the Appellant has submitted the case of W.A. Albert

Singho Vs. The Queen 74 NLR 368, where the court held that;

"A judge must not, in the course of his summing up, use language

the culminative effect of which would remove from the consideration

of the jury what are essentially questions of fact for their

determination ".

The counsel for the Appellant also contends that in his charge, the learned

High Court Judge has misdirected the jury by giving the impression that a defence

had been called since the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

At Pages 3 3 6 to 3 3 9 of the brief, the trial judge in his charge to the jury has stated

that when the prosecution has proved its case, the defence is required to explain its

" 6

position, whereby in effect the trial judge has shifted the burden of proof to the

defence. The trial judge has also failed to give guidance to the jury when

evaluating the dock statement.

In Kamal Addaraaarachchi Vs. The State 20021 SLR 312, the Court held that;

"it was a grave error for a trial judge to direct himself that he

should examine the tenability and truthfulness of the evidence of the

accused in the light of the evidence led by the prosecution. To

examine the evidence of the accused in the light of the prosecution

witnesses is to reverse the presumption of innocence"

In CAl26106 decided on 25/05/2010, Sarath De Abrew, J. held that;

"in adopting this strange "cart before the horse" procedure, the

learned trial judge had committed the following cardinal errors

which should necessarily be construed as a denial of a fair trial and

also denial of the right to be presumed innocent until the final drama

is enacted and the curtain falls.

(a) In holding that the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt after

analyzing only the prosecution evidence, the trial judge in effect

is shutting out the right of the accused person to have the defence

evidence too considered in totality with that of the prosecution

evidence in order to ascertain whether a reasonable doubt is

created.

(b) ----------"

..

It is observed that in the summing up the learned trial judge erred when he

charged the jury on questions of fact to be decided by the jury. The law as regards

to evaluation of circumstantial evidence, and the dock statement, arising on

evidence led in this case and also the burden of proof and the presumption of

innocence, has not been explained to the jury.

It is to be noted that in such glaring circumstances of non-direction and

mis-direction arising out of the summing up of the jury, the Senior State Counsel

appearing for the Respondent vehemently defended the conviction and sentence

and did not concede to any of the said infirmities discussed above.

In all the above circumstances, we find that the misdirection of the jury by

the learned trial judge has caused a substantial miscarriage of justice which

warrants an acquittal of the Appellant.

Therefore, we set aside the conviction and sentence and acquit the

Appellant.

Appeal allowed.

K. Priyantha Fernando, J.

I agree.
