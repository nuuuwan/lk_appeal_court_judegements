Decided on: 08.02.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner, a Squadron Leader of the Sri Lanka Air Force,

had been cashiered upon conviction after a General Court

Martial of two charges framed under the Air Force Act for

disgraceful conduct by knowingly signing a false payment

voucher and a cash cheque for a sum of Rs. 300,000/=. He has

filed this application seeking to quash by way of certiorari the

said verdict (P9) and the punishment (P10).

The only ground urged by the petitioner to grant that relief is

that the summing up of the 11th respondent Judge Advocate

after the trial contains misdirections and non-directions and

therefore the verdict of guilty entered by the General Court

Martial is unsustainable. He says that the Judge Advocate in

the summing up failed to mention matters adequately in relation

to burden of proof, standard of proof, contradictions and

omissions in the evidence led, accuseds rights etc. The said

summing up has been produced by the petitioner marked P8. I

read the entire summing up running into 27 pages to realize

that the said complaint of the petitioner is devoid of merit. It, in

my view, covers all the major matters which the petitioner now

3

complains of. No summing up will be one hundred percent

perfect. So do, in my view, Judgments handed down by Courts.

It is subjective.

Under judicial review, this Court, unless there is an obvious

error of law on the face of the record, will not overturn a decision

on merits.1 I find no such patent error in the said summing up.

In Kalamazoo Industries Ltd v. Minister of Labour & Vocational

Training2, the petitioners sought to quash the arbitral award by

certiorari and prohibition. Dismissing that application,

Jayasuriya J. inter alia stated:

There is no misdirection in point of fact or law which

vitiates the award. There is no failure on the part of the

arbitrator to take into consideration the effect of the totality

of the oral and documentary evidence placed before him

and there is no improper evaluation of the evidence placed

before the arbitrator on a consideration of the award and

the totality of the evidence placed before him in this matter.

This court must keep prominently in forefront that it is

exercising in this instance a very limited jurisdiction quite

distinct from the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. Relief by

way of certiorari in relation to an award made by an

arbitrator will be forthcoming to quash such an award only

if the arbitrator wholly or in part assumes a jurisdiction

which he does not have or exceeds that which he has or

acts contrary to principles of natural justice or pronounces

an award which is eminently irrational or unreasonable or

is guilty of an illegality. The remedy by way of certiorari

cannot be made use of to correct errors or to substitute a

correct order for a wrong order and if the arbitrator's award

was not set aside in whole or in part, it had to be allowed

to stand unreversed. It is pertinent to refer to the principles

laid down by Prof. H. W. R. Wade on "Administrative Law"

12th edition at pages 34 to 35 wherein the learned author

states: "Judicial review is radically different from the

system of appeals. When hearing an appeal, the court is

concerned with the merits of the decision under appeal. But

in judicial review, the court is concerned with its legality.

On appeal, the question is right or wrong. On review, the

question is lawful or unlawful..judicial review is a

fundamentally different operation. Instead of substituting

its own decision for that of some other body, as happens

when an appeal is allowed, a court, on review, is concerned

only with whether the act or order under attack should be

allowed to stand or not". In the circumstances the objective

of this court upon judicial review in this application is to

strictly consider whether the whole or part of the award of

the arbitrator is lawful or unlawful. This court ought not to

exercise its appellate powers and jurisdiction when

engaged in the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction and

judicial review of an award of an arbitrator.

In Public Interest Law Foundation v. Central Environmental

Authority3 Gunawardana J. held:

There is a distinction between appeal and review. If one

appeals against a decision, one is claiming that the decision

3 [2001] 3 Sri LR 330 at 334

5

is wrong and that appellate authority or court should

change the decision. The Court of Appeal, if it is persuaded

by the merits of the case (appeal), may allow the appeal

and thereby substitute its view for that of the Court or

tribunal of first instance. Under judicial review procedure,

the Court of Appeal is not concerned with the merits of the

case, that is, whether the decision was right or wrong, but

whether the decision is lawful or not. In the words of Lord

Brightman: "Judicial review is concerned, not with the

decision but with the decision making process" (Chief

Constable of North Wales Police v. Evans [1982] 1 WLR

1155 at 1173) It is worth observing that the review

procedure is not well suited to determination of disputed

facts-factual issues arising in this case being imprecise and

disputed.

As seen from R1, unknown to the petitioner, His Excellency the

President has approved the said punishment well before the

petitioner came before this Court seeking inter alia a direction to

the 12th respondent the Commander of the Sri Lanka Air Force

not to communicate the punishment to His Excellency the

President for confirmation until the final determination of this

application as such confirmation of the President is not

amenable to writ jurisdiction. Hence this application has now

become ex facie futile.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs.
