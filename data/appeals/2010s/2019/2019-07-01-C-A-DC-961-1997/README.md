JUDGMENT ON 28.06.2019

K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J.

01. Plaintiff Respondent (Respondent) filed the above action to partition the

land called Udumullewatte more fully described in the schedule to the plaint.

According to the plaint, Plaintiff is entitled to 8/16 (112) share of the land

and 1 st to 5th Defendants are entitled to balance 8/16 (112).

02. Although, Defendant Appellants (Appellants) did not challenge the

plaintiffs pedigree, they disputed the rights of Ruwanpura Tharalis de Silva

and Ruwanpura Walton de Silva by their statement of claim. The position

taken by the Appellants was that said Tharalis de Silva and Walton de Silva

did not have any rights to the land and therefore, Plaintiff could not have

devolved any rights from them.

03. After trial, the learned District Judge delivered the judgment in favour of the

Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, Appellants appealed

against the same urging the following grounds.

1. That the judgment is contrary to law and against the weight of evidence.

2. That the learned District Judge has misdirected himself in holding that

the said Tharalis de Silva had the title to the subject matter of this action

though he had sold the same outside the statutory determination. (Vide

V.l)

3. That the learned District Judge has misdirected himself in holding that

the said Walton de Silva had title to the subject matter of this action

3

though he had violated the section 18 of the Land Refonn Law despite

the fact that the operation of section 3(1) of the said Land Refonn Law.

4. That the learned District Judge erred in law in failing to grant title to the

Land Refonn Commission on the ground that the Attorney General has

not been made a party to this action.

04. We considered the evidence adduced at the trial including the documents

filed, Judgment of the learned District Judge, and submissions made by the

counsel for all parties at the argument.

05. Counsel for the Appellants submitted that the subject land had not been

included in the statutory detennination as per section 19 of the Land Reform

Act marked as V.1, and therefore Tharalis de Silva could not have owned the

land as mentioned in the plaint.

06. Counsel for the Respondents submitted that the title deeds are based on the

last will of Ruwanpura Clement Singho and that the subject land was

included in the last will. Counsel further submitted that no document was

produced to show that the corpus was vested with the Land Refonn

Commission (LRC). As L.R.C was not made a party, Plaintiff did not have

any knowledge of the land being vested with the L.R.C.

07. In tenns of section 05 ofthe LRC Act after the date of commencement ofthe

Land Refonn Law, any person becomes the owner of agricultural land in

excess of the ceiling shall as from the date be deemed to vest in the

commission and deemed to be held by that person under a statutory lease

from the commission.

08. After the statutory declaration is made under section 18 by the statutory

lessee, commission would make and publish in the gazette the statutory

4

determination specitying the extent of the agricultural land permitted by the

commission to be retained by the statutory lessee. These provisions were

discussed at length By Her Ladyship Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake CJ in case

of Ananda Seneviratne and another V. Anthony Weerathunga and

another SC Appeal 1812010. 15.03.2012. In that case Court went further

into the question of the date of publishing the statutory determination in the

gazette. It was made clear that until the statutory determination is published,

the lessee in terms of section 05 of the Land Reform Act would not get title

to the land included in the statutory determination.

09. The above statutory determination published in the gazette said to be

relevant to the said Ruwanpura Tharalis de Silva in this case was marked as

V I at the trial. It was also evident that Tharalis de Silva and Walton de

Silva in the plaintiffs pedigree, each of them owned thousands of acres of

land. (Vide evidence of the witness for plaintiffR. Dharmasena Silva at page

187). On the evidence adduced at the trial it is clear that Tharalis de Silva in

V 1 is the same Tharalis Silva in the plaintiffs pedigree. In the statutory

determination V 1, the subject land to this case Udumullewatta is not

included. Therefore, it is clear that Ruwanpura Tharalis de Silva did not

have any title to the subject land as mentioned in the plaint and hence, his

heirs did not have any right to convey to the plaintiff by deeds No. 1965 and

1999 marked as P5 and P6 respectively.

10. The contention of the counsel for the Appellants is that the same position

taken by the Appellants on the title of Tharalis de Silva in terms of ceiling

under the Land Reform Law applies to Walton de Silva as well. It is further

submitted that in terms of the inventory filed in the Testamentary case in

respect of the estate of said Walton de Silva who died in 1988, the land in

5

this case was not included. Therefore, it is submitted that Walton de Silva

did not have any right to this land for the plaintiff to derive title as per the

plaint.

11. It is submitted by the counsel for the Respondent that the law relating to

testamentary actions cannot be raised in favour of the Appellants as they

were not parties to such actions and Appellants have not produced any

material documents to establish that no probate or letter of administration

was issued in the said testamentary action. Therefore, provisions of sections

545 and 547 ofthe Civil Procedure Code are in favour of the Plaintiff.

12. Point of contest No.7 was raised at the trial on the inventory filed in the

testamentary case in respect of the estate of Walton de Silva. The above

inventory was produced in evidence at the trial as V 2 and the learned

District Judge has correctly answered point of contest No.07 in favour of the

Defendants.

13. It was evident that the said Walton de Silva owned so many acres of

agricultural land beyond the ceiling prescribed in terms of the Land Reform

Act. Walton de Silva had died on 18.09.1988 and the testamentary action in

respect of his estate had been filed on 29.04.1992 by his wife R. Elsi de

Silva. There was no dispute that 'V 2' is a certified copy of the inventory

filed in the District Court in the said testamentary case and that the land

which is the subject matter in this case is not included in V 2 as a property

owned by Walton de Silva at the time of his death. No statutory

determination by the Land Reform Commission was filed by parties to show

that the subject land to this case was allowed to be retained by Walton de

Silva. Therefore, we find that Walton de Silva did not have title to the

subject land for his heirs to inherit and that vendors in deed 1958 marked as

6

P7 did not have title to transfer by deed P7. Hence the learned District Judge

has erred when he answered points of contest Oland lOin favour of the

plaintiff. In the above premise, plaintiff has failed to prove his title to the

land and he is not entitled to any share of the subject land sought to be

partitioned. Appeal is allowed to that extent.

14. Defendants have claimed prescriptive title to the whole land. In his

Judgment the learned District Judge has considered the evidence adduced at

the trial and the law that applies with regard to the prescription the

Appellants claimed, in pages 09, 10 and 11 of the judgement. (Pages 281,282

and 283 ofthe brief).

15. When the parties are co-owners, mere possession for 10 years would not

suffice to gain prescriptive title to a land co-owned. Every co-owner is

presumed to be in possession in his capacity as a co-owner. In case of Maria

Fernando V. Anthony Fernando [1997J 2 Sri L.R. page 356 Court of

Appeal held that:

"Long possession, payment of rates and taxes, enjoyment of

produce, filing suit without making the adverse party, a party,

preparing plan and building house on land and renting it are not

enough to establish prescription among co-owners in the absence of

an overt act of ouster. A secret intention to prescribe may not amount

to an ouster"

16. Also, in terms of section 07 of the Land Reform Law where any agricultural

land is co-owned, each co-owner shall be deemed to own his share in such

land as a distinct and separate entity.

7

17. As discussed by the learned District Judge in his judgment, although there is

evidence to the effect that the Defendants have claimed possessing the land,

there is no evidence of any act of ouster against the Plaintiff. Further, as

mentioned before, when the share of the corpus owned by Tharalis de Silva

and Walton de Silva are vested with the Land Reform Commission,

Defendants could not have claimed prescriptive title for that share without

making the Land Reform Commission a party.

18. Therefore, Defendants are not entitled to prescriptive title to the whole land

sought to be partitioned. Defendants are entitled to the half share devolved

from Kalugalage Andoris Pieris and finally from Rathgamage Senawasa de

Silva as mentioned in the Plaintiffs pedigree.

19. For the aforementioned reasons following orders are made;

114 share of Ruwanpura Tharalis de Silva which is vested with L.R.C

will be kept unallotted,

114 share of Ruwanpura Walton de Silva which is vested with L.R.C

will be kept unallotted.

Balance half Share will be divided on the Defendants as follows;

1st Defendant Ponnahandi Algin Nona 114

2nd Defendant Ratgamage Wotmin de Silva 1116

3rd Defendant Ratgamage Luxman de Silva 1116

4th Defendant Ratgamage Molee de Silva 1116

5th Defendant Ratgamage Dudley de Silva 1116

Improvements in the lots to be divided proportionately among the allottees.

8

Costs to be born by the allottees proportionately.

District Judge Balapitiya is directed to enter the interlocutory decree

accordingly.

Appeal is allowed to the above extent.
