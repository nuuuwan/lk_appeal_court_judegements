Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner-appellant filed this application in the High Court

seeking to quash the decision of the 1st respondent Commissioner

General of Agrarian Development marked P4 by writ of certiorari.

The learned High Court Judge dismissed this application. This

appeal by the petitioner is against the said Judgment.

It is undisputed that the mother of the 2nd respondent was the

tenant cultivator of the paddy land in suit under the petitioner as

the landlord. Upon the death of the mother, when the 2nd

respondent started to continue with the cultivation, the petitioner

has objected to it on the basis that, the 2nd respondent cannot

succeed to the tenancy rights of her deceased mother.

It appears from 1R1 that the 2nd respondent has complaint it to

the Agrarian Development Officer of the area. As seen from 1R2,

the latter has held an inquiry into that matter. The learned State

Counsel for the 1st respondent has tendered the same written

submission which was tendered to the High Court wherein it is

stated that "At the end of the said inquiry the Agrarian Development

Officer had informed the parties to seek the advice of the 1st

respondent since the matter involved a succession of the tenancy

rights [and] thereafter the petitioner had dispatched the letter

marked as P3 addressed to the 1st respondent". Then it is

abundantly clear the background to the letter marked P3.

3

By P3, under the heading of "To Know Succession of Tenant

Cultivator under the Agrarian Development Act, No. 64 of 2000", the

petitioner requested the 1st respondent to inform her, upon the

death of a tenant cultivator, whether, a family member can

succeed to the tenancy rights despite her objections, and, if so,

according to the Agrarian Development Act, No. 64 of 2000, who

shall be the next tenant cultivator. As seen from P3, the petitioner

has sent a self-addressed stamped envelope to send the reply.

There cannot be any dispute that P4 is the reply to P3. P4 is under

the same heading and refers to P3 in the first sentence.

Surprisingly, the 1st respondent does not in P4 answer the clear

question which the petitioner raised in P3, but informs the

petitioner not to disturb the cultivation rights of the 2nd

respondent.

Both the learned State Counsel for the 1st respondent and the

learned counsel for the 2nd respondent admit that by P4 the 1st

respondent did not address the issue raised by the petitioner, i.e.

succession under the Agrarian Development Act.

The learned State Counsel at the argument further stated that

what the 1st respondent has done is to make a provisional order in

order to prevent the breach of the peace. That argument is equal

to the answer of the 1st respondent by P4 to P3.

The learned counsel for the 2nd petitioner in order to justify P4,

drew the attention of the Court to section 90 of the Agrarian

Development Act to say that the 1st respondent was entitled to

make that order.

I accept that the 1st respondent is empowered under section 90 of

the Act to make decisions on cultivation rights of agricultural

4

lands. But I am unable to accept that this was the occasion to

decide that question.

With the risk of being repetitive, if I may stress, P4 claims to be the

reply to P3, but admittedly it is not so. P3 question is on one point

and P4 purported answer is on another point. The fact that the

decision contained in P4 is one which the 1st respondent is

entitled to make is, in my view, beside the point. I quash P4 on

that basis by way of certiorari.

The 1st respondent will now reply to P3 if necessary after holding

an inquiry.

This Judgment of mine shall not be construed to mean that the 1st

petitioner cannot decide on agricultural rights in terms of section

90 of the Agrarian Development Act.

The High Court has not considered the application on the correct

perspective but dismissed the application on a wrong premise on

suppression of material facts.

I set aside the Judgment of the High Court and allow the appeal

with costs.

I agree.
