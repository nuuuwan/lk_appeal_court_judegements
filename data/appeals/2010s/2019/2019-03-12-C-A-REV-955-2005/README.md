Samayawardhena, J.

This is a partition action. The petitioners filed this application

for revision and/or restitutio in integrum basically seeking to set

aside the Judgment of the District Court dated 24.01.1973 on

the basis that at the time of the pronouncement of the

Judgment the land belonged to the Land Reform Commission

and not to the plaintiff or to the parties in his pedigree.

The plaintiff filed this action in 1971 in the District Court of

Ratnapura seeking to partition the land known as

Mailagahayaya in extent 23 Acres 3 Roods and 21 Perches

among the plaintiff and the 1st-3rd defendants in equal shares.

At the trial, as seen from P5, the plaintiff has given brief

evidence, and the District Judge, as seen from P6, has

pronounced a brief Judgment in 1973 partitioning the land

among the plaintiff and the 1st-3rd defendants as prayed for in

the prayer to the plaint. However, the Final Decree has been

entered long after that, i.e. in the year 2000, that is, more than

27 years after entering the Judgment/Interlocutory Decree. Writ

of possession issued in 2003, has not been executed as the

petitioners are now in occupation of the land allegedly on the

permission of the Land Reform Commission.

The applications made to the District Court by the Land Reform

Commission and the petitioners seeking to set aside the

Judgment has rightly been refused by the District Court by

order dated 01.03.2005 marked P13. After entering the Final

Decree, how can the District Court set aside its own Judgment?

It is thereafter the petitioners have filed this application in this

Court.

The Land Reform Commission has been made the 4th respondent

to this application, and the Land Reform Commission has filed

objections together with documents.

Now it is crystal clear that by the time the plaintiff gave evidence

before the District Court on 14.12.1972 and when the District

Judge pronounced the Judgment on 24.01.1973, the land had

been vested in the Land Reform Commission by operation of law,

i.e. by operation of section 3 of the Land Reform Law, No. 1 of

1972, which came into operation on 26.08.1972.

According to section 3(1) of the Land Reform Law, On and after

the date of commencement of this Law the maximum extent of

agricultural land which may be owned by any person, in this Law

referred to as the ceiling, shall (a) if such land consists

exclusively of paddy land, be twenty five acres; or (b) if such land

does not consist exclusively of paddy land, be fifty acres, so

however that the total extent of any paddy land, if any, comprised

in such fifty acres shall not exceed the ceiling on paddy land

specified in paragraph (a).

Section 3(2) enacts that Any agricultural land owned by any

person in excess of the ceiling on the date of commencement of

this Law shall as from that date (a) be deemed to vest in the

[Land Reform] Commission; and (b) be deemed to be held by such

person under a statutory lease from the Commission.

Section 6 reads as follows: Where any agricultural land is vested

in the Commission under this Law, such vesting shall have the

effect of giving the land in the Commission absolute title to such

land as from the date of such vesting, and free from all

encumbrances.

5

Section 18 provides for making Statutory Declarations, which is

mandatory. Section 18(1) states: The Commission may, by

Order published in the Gazette and in such other form as it may

deem desirable to give publicity to such Order, direct that every

person who becomes the statutory lessee of any agricultural land

shall, within a month from the date of the publication of the Order,

or of becoming a statutory lessee under this Law make a

declaration, in this Law referred to as a statutory declaration, in

the prescribed form of the total extent of the agricultural land so

held by him on such lease.

It is relevant to note that this Statutory Declaration is in relation

to Agricultural Lands and no other. As seen from 4R1, 4R2, S1-

S4 tendered by the 4th respondent Land Reform Commission to

this Court, it is clear that the plaintiff (together with the 1st-3rd

defendant-respondents) has made that Statutory Declaration in

November 1972, i.e. before the plaintiff gave evidence at the trial

and before the Judgment was pronounced.

According to section 19(1) of the Land Reform Law, upon the

receipt by the Land Reform Commission of a Statutory

Declaration made under section 18, the Land Reform

Commission shall make a determination known as Statutory

Determination specifying the portion or portions of the

agricultural land owned by the statutory lessee, which he shall

be allowed to retain, and thereafter the Land Reform

Commission shall publish the Statutory Determination in the

Gazette and shall also send a copy thereof to such lessee.

No such Statutory Determination in favour of the plaintiff-

respondent and the 1st-3rd defendant-respondents has been

made and published in the Gazette at the time of plaintiff giving

6

evidence or Judgment being pronounced or simply stated up to

now.

The plaintiff and the 1st-3rd defendants have not disclosed these

things to the District Judge when they obtained the Judgment.

In short, they had no entitlement to the land at the time of the

pronouncement of the Judgement except, in terms of section 3(2)

of the Land Reform Law, deemed to be holding the land under a

Statutory Lease from the Land Reform Commission with the

absolute title of the land vested in the Land Reform Commission

in terms of section 6 of the said Law.

By the Gazette 4R3 tendered by the Land Reform Commission to

this Court with their objections, it is seen that the Land Reform

Commission has decided to pay compensation to the 2nd

defendant-respondent in respect of 17 Acres of this land vested

in the Land Reform Commission.

The plaintiff-respondent together with his objections has

tendered documents marked R1 and R2 to say that some

portions of the land do not fall into the category of Agricultural

Lands and therefore Land Reform Law has no application to

those portions. Firstly, it is the plaintiff who made the Statutory

Declaration stating that the entire land is an Agricultural Land.

Secondly, such a portion has not been identified by way of a

superimposition on the Preliminary/Final Plan of Partition, and

it is not possible to do it at this stage of the case. Thirdly, R1

and R2 have been issued long after the Final Decree has been

entered, and such Statutory Determination if any on the part of

the Land Reform Commission is yet to be Gazetted.

7

The Judgment of the District Court cannot be allowed to stand.

It is hereby set aside by invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of

this Court but reserving the right to the plaintiff or any other

party to file a fresh partition action to a portion of the land, if so

advised.

Appeal allowed. No costs.
