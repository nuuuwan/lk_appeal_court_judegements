S.N.Vijith Singh with Chitralal Liyanage for the Plaintiff,Appellant

Upul Kumaraperuma with Chandrika de Silva for Defendant'Respondent.

21.11.2018

This appeal engages the all too familiar question that crops up in day to day district court

practice. What is the consequence when an Attorney' at,law informs Court that he has

no instructions from the Plaintiff? Is dismissal of the plaint an automatic consequence in

those circumstances? If this intimation to Court happens on an adjourned date, how

does the District Court treat this notification? What is the interrelationship of Section

144 of the Civil Procedur Code( the Code) vis,;l,vis th provisions found in Chapter XII

of the Code in the event of a default?

The appeal also pertains to the question of propriety of the subsequent order made by

the Additional District Judge of Galle on 31.01. 1997, refusing to set aside his order of

dismissal of the Plaintiff's action made on 15.07.1996. Let me narrate the progress of the

trial prior to the date on which the learned Additiof1.11 District Judge dismissed the

plaint.

The Plaintiff,Appellant ( hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiff), who was

suing the Defendant, Res )ondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Defendant)

for a declaration of a rit'>ht to possess a state land .based on an annual permit and

ejectment of the Defend mt therefrom, had testified on four trial dates and another

witness a colonization officer had just concluded his evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff

when the matter was re, xed for further trial to be had on 03/04/1994. Both the Plaintiff

and his witness had been subjected to long,drawn-out cross' examination but the

2

Plaintiff had not closed his case when the case came up for further hearing on 03.04.1994

on which date the Additi nal District Judge of Galle was on leave. On the follOWing date

namely 18.09.1995 the learned Judge was on furlough again but it has to be noted that the

journal entries and minutes of proceedings indicate that both the Plaintiff and Defendant

had been present in Court on all the aforesaid dates.

When the further trial came up on 26.02.1996 before a succeeding judge, he adopted the

evidence led on previous dates and adjourned the further trial for 15.07.1996. On

15.07.1996, the Plaintiff was not present in Court and the proceedings dated 15,07.1996

do not make it clear whether or not the registered Attorney/at/law was present. But

the Counsel for the Plaintiff Mr. Sarath Bandara notified to Court that he had no

instructions from the registered Attorney/at/ Law. Thereupon Mr. Gange the Attorney/

at/ Law for the Defendant moved Court to have the action of the Plaintiff dismissed

subject to costs.

It is on this application that the learned Additional District Judge of Galle dismissed the

case of the Plaintiff ordering costs against him. Let me epeat that by the time when the

dismissal of the action took place on 15.07.1996, the Plaintiff and his witness had been

extensively cross/examined but the plaintiff's case had not been closed. In other words

the Defendant was yet to commence his case. The dismissal of the action took place on

an adjourned date and the question arises/would the. absence of the Plaintiff on the

adjourned date, though his' counsel was present, attract automatically the sanc~ion of a

dismissal of the case? Does the intimation to court by Counsel for the Plaintiff "no ,. instructions from the registered Attorney/at/law" entail the automatic consequence of a

dismissal? This appears to be the quintessential issue in this case to which I will revert

after briefly adverting to he subsequent order at the purge/default inquiry.

Purge/ Default Inquiry

At the purge/default inquiry that took place on 31.01.1997, the Plaintiff testified putting

forward the cause, as is the wont under Section 87(3) of the Code, that he was prevented

3

, /

from attending Courts on 15.07. 1996, since he had met with an accident which resulted

in the Plaintiff receiving treatment.

But the learned Additional District Judge was not satisfied that there were reasonable

grounds for the non~ appearance of the Plaintiff on 15.07.1996 and he refused to set aside

the order of dismissal by his judgment dated 3pt January 1997. It was in this backdrop

that this appeal has been preferred against the judgment dated 31st January 1997.

Mr.Vijith Singh for the Plaintiff-Appellant put forwarJ two frontal arguments in order

to assail the judgment dated 31st January 1997, which had refused to set aside the order

of dismissal made agains~ the Plaintiff. He argued that the learned Additional District

Judge of Galle could not have dismissed the action of t e Plaintiff since it is section 144

of the Code that would govern this situation and there was a failure to utilize the power

given in section 144.

Mr Upul Kumaraperuma contended that since the Plaintiff did not prefer an appeal

against the omission of the Additional District Judge to resort to section 144, such

omission cannot be imp ached in an appeal that focusses on whether the Plaintiff has

satisfied the court as t the reasonableness of his grounds for non~appearance on

15.07.1996. In other words the gravamen of Mr Upul Kumaraperuma's submissions was

that the Plaintiff would perforce be confined only to the refusal of the Additional District

Judge to set aside the rder of dismissal and no other omission on the part of the

Additional District Judge could now be impeached.

So these rival arguments engage one significant questj C?n to pose. What is the relevance

of Section 144 of the Code if at all a default occurs in appearance on the part of a Plaintiff

or a Defendant? Both Counsel made submissions on the basis that there was indeed a

default on the part of the Plaintiff. Was there a default at all in this case when the

Attorney~ at~law said that he had no instructions? Right at the outset let me state that I

conclude in the end that there was no default at all in appearance on the part of the

Plaintiff and if there was no default, Section 144 of the Code would have no application

to this case and this case has to be disposed of having regard to another provision of the

4

adjectival law namely Se tion 24 of the Code and a plethora of case law that surrounds

this issue. I will deal with this aspect of no default pre~ently.

Section 144

But I do consider it apposite to make a few observations on Section 144 of the Code since

it was referred to by Mr Vijith Singh in the course of his argument. The provision is

inextricably interwoven with Chapter XII of the Code which deals with defaults in

appearance or non ~appearance of respective parties; whether it be the Plaintiff or

Defendant in a case. I hold this opinion because Section 144 of the Code which bestows

a wide discretion in District Judges unerringly makes reference to Chapter XII.

Whenever a default appears on an adjourned date, a District Judge must have regard to

Section 144 of the Civil Procedure Code. What strikes me as significant about ?ection

144 is that the provision gets engaged on an adjourned date and the said provision reads

\ , as follows:

" Section 144

If on any day to which the hearing of the action is adjourned, the parties or any'of them

faj} to appear, the court may proceed to dispose of the action in one of the modes directed in

that behalfby Chapter XII, or make such other order as it thinks fit.

A District Court has to apply the discretionary power i~ Section 144 when parties or any

of them fail to appear on an adjourned date.

, -Section 144 of the Code is identical to Order XVII, Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure,

1908 of India, which substantially mirrors the language of its Sri Lankan counterpart ~

Where, on any day to which the hearing of the suit is adjourned, the parties or any of them fail

to appear, the court may proceed to dispose of the suit in one of the modes directed in that behalf

by Order IX , or make such other order as it thinks fit.

There are differences though between the two provisions. The first difference between

the two sections is only cosmetic and constitutes no difference at all. The words If and

action in Section 144 have been substituted by the word where and suit in the Indian Code

5

with a reference to Order IX, which is the corresponding chapter for defaults in

appearance in India. Needless to say, these words make no difference without a

distinction and there is a plethora of cases that have interpreted Order XVII, Rule 2 in

, ' India.

There is an explanation appended to the Indian provisipn which stares the following:

Where the evidence or a substantial portion of the eVidence of any party has already been

recorded and such party fails to appear on any day to which the hearing of the suit is adjourned,

the Court may, in its discretion, proceed with the case as if such party were present.

Chitaley and Rao in their' Commentaries on the Code of Civil Procedure (7th Edition)

draw attention to a concatenation of cases but in view of my final finding in this case

that there was no default on the part of the Plaintiff, a that I would henceforth say on

Section 144 would likely tun the risk of being called obiter but I would emphasize that if

indeed there is a default on the part of either the Plaintiff or Defendant on an adjourned

date, a District Judge has to bear in mind the provision , of Section 144.

Section 144 will come into play only when the hearing of the suit has commenced and

the trial is adjourned as q' part heard suit to a future date. When the partly heard case

comes up on an adjourned date and a default in appearance occurs, it is Section 144 of

the Civil Procedure Code that governs the situation. The provision gives the District

Judge a discretion and gives him two options, either of which the learned District Judge

is empowered to adopt subject to rules pertaining to the exercise of discretionary

powers. Either the District Judge resorts to Chapter XII ( Chapter on default in

appearances) or he must make such other order as it thinks fit. This discretion to adopt either

of the two options must be exercised fairly and reason~ bly. Neither option is automatic.

The order to adopt either of the two options must be nriched with reasons which this

Court could assess for its reasonableness having regar to the material on record.

Section 144 came up for interpretation in johanis Appuhamy v. Car}incho (1963) 67

N.LR.144. After the Plaintiff had closed his case and the Defendant called a witness, the

6

, case was put off for furth r hearing. On that adjourned date, the Defendant and his

proctor were absent. The District Judge pronounced judgment for the Plaintiff on the

basis that the Defendant did not intend to lead any further evidence.

The question that arose in appeal was whether in these circumstances the District Judge

enjoyed the power to pronounce judgment on merits as if the case had been heard inter

partes or whether he should have entered only a decree nisi in the plaintiff's favour.

Sansoni]. (with whom H.N.G. Fernando]. concurred) held that in the circumstances,

the only course which a Court could have adopted was to enter a decree nisi in favour of

the Plaintiff in terms of Section 85 of the Civil Procedure Code. In the circumstances of

the case, the Court could not have given judgment for the Plaintiff on the ground that

the Defendant did not int nd to lead any further evidence.

Sansoni]. posed the pertinent question, "Does the judgment given by the District Judge

come under the words 'make such other order as it thinks fW'" The learned Judge opined that

"I do not think so, because those words seem to contemplate some other order such as

giving notice to the absent party, or putting the case y, short of an order disposing of

the action". 't

In other words Sansoni J. took the view that the learned District Judge of Galle in johanis

Appuhamy (supra) must have resorted to chapter XII al1d pronounced an ex parte

judgment, instead of an inter partes judgment as he did. There was certainly warrant for

this view because neither the defendant nor his proc "or was present in Court on the

adjourned date and thus there was no appearance for the defendant. There was clearly a

default in appearance on the part of the Defendant. In the circumstances the learned

District Judge of Galle m st have proceeded to an ex parte decree or a decree nisi as was

the wont in days gone by .. Instead he gave judgment as if the case had been heard inter

partes. So the Supreme Court (Sansoni,J with H.N.G.Fernando,J concurring) proceeded

to strike down the order of the District Court to enter a judgment on the merit and

directed him to enter a cecree nisi. In a terse and lacOllic judgment Sansoni, J held that

7

the facts and circumstances of the case would not permit the judge to write an inter parte

judgment even under the second limb of Section 144- "make such other order as it thinks fit".

The phrase "make such other,order as it thinks fit" does not;.include within it the disposal of

the case on the merits. In other words what the learned District Judge of Galle did in

johanis Appuhamy -i.e proceeding to write a judgment on the merits cannot be justified

under the phrase "make uch other order as it thinks fit". It was an erroneous exercise of

discretion. The proper course must have been for the learned District Judge to have

entered a decree nisi under Section 85 of the Old Civil Procedure Code. That would also

give the absent Defendant an opportunity to purge his default.

In the process Sansoni, J stated that the words "make such other order as it thinks fit"

contemplate some order such as giving notice to the absent party, or putting the case

by, short of an order disposing of the action.

According to the Supreme Court, the grant of a date was indeed an option on an

adjourned when a party has defaulted but on the fact~ ofjohanis Appuhamy(supra),

the Supreme Court was not inclined to set aside the inter partes decree and grant him a

date to lead evidence. Instead the Supreme Court felt that the District Court should

proceed under Section 85(1) and enter an expartedecree, because both the Defendant and

his proctor were absent on the adjourned date.

The case of johanis Appuhamy v Caiincho (supra) acknowledges the fact that a

discretion resides in the District Court by virtue of Section 144 to grant a date under the

phrase "make such other order as it thinks fit" having regard to the facts and circumstances of

a particular case. In other words recourse to Chapter J2 is not automatic.

As I said before,johanis Appuhamy (supra) has no application at all in this case. The

case ofjohanis Appuhamy (supra) will not apply here because in that case both the

Defendant and his proctor were absent on the adjourn d date and so there was indeed a

default on the part of t1 '- Defendant. The Supreme ourt felt that the then learned

District Judge of Galle in johanis Appuhamy (supra) must have proceeded to an ex

8

parte decree. In the case before me which has also co e up on appeal incidentally from

the Additional District Court of Galle, though the Plaintiff was absent, his proxy given

to his registered Attorney remained valid and effectual and his Counsel only notified

Court that he had no inst.ructions.

The Counsel did not say that he was withdrawing his appearance for the Plaintiff and

therefore the appearance f Mr Sarath Bandara constitutes an appearance on that day for

the Plaintiff. A Plaintiff may appear in person or thrOltgh his registered Attorney or his

Counsel. Section 24 of the Code makes this position cr stal clear.

Any appearance, application or act in or to any Court, required or authorized by law to be made

or done by a party ' to an action or appeal in such Court, except only such appearances,

applications, or acL as by any law for the time being in force only attorneys/at/law are

authorized to make r do, and except when by any such law otherwise expressly proVided, may

be made or done by the party in person, or by his recog ized agent, or by a registered attorney

duly appointed by the party or such agent to act on behalf of such party;

, " Provided that any su~h appearance shall be made by th party in person, if the Court so directs.

An Attorney/at/law instructed by a registered attorney for this purpose, represents the

registered attorney in Court.

The pith and substance ;qf this provision is that a party is allowed to appear by his

registered Attorney/at/law and Section 24 goes on to sa that "An Attorney/at/law instructed

by a registered attorney for thi,s purpose, represents the registered attorney in Court". Since there is a

contractual nexus between a party and his registered Attorney-at-law, the registered

Attorney-at-law would epresent the party in Court by virtue of his appointment.

Where his appointment authorizes him to retain another Attorney-at-law (cou~sel), as

it does in this case, that Attorney-at-law would repres nt the registered Attorney. That

means that his appearanc.e, is the appearance of the registered Attorney. The C9unsel's

appearance is indeed th appearance of the registere'i Attorney and that again is the

appearance of the party.

9

/ . So when Mr Sarath Bandara appeared in Court on IS. '7.1996 and stated that he had no

instructions, that amounted to Plaintiff's appearance and there was no default on the

part of the Plaintiff. This is the view that prevails now but there was quite an uncertainty

about it at one time. Whether the proceedings should be inter partes or ex parte in the

context of a defendant when his Attorney stated to Court "he had no instructions" came

up before Middleton J in Senanayake v Cooray IS N.L.R 36 and he took the view that

in such circumstances th proceedings would be ex parte.

On the day fixed for the trial, the defendant in the case was absent and his proctor on

, record, who was presen~ in court, stated he had no instructions. It was held that the

physical presence of the proctor in the Court, coupled with what he said on the trial day,

I did not constitute an appearance for the defendant, which would give the proceedings

the character of an inter partes trial enabling the judge to enter a final decree.

But a four bench division of the Supreme Court in Andiappa Chettiar v Sanmugam

Chettiar 33 N.L.R 217 reached judicial consensus that when an Attorney~at~law

intimated to Court that he had no instructions, that would be tantamount to appearance

of the party and therefore there cannot be recourse to 0 hapter 12 of the Code.

In Andiappa Chettiar vs~ Sanmugam Chettiar (supra) Macdonell C.J heading a bench

of four judges of the Supreme Court (with Garvin S.P.]., Lyall Grant J., and Maartensz

A.J ) held that the presel1ce in Court, when a case is ca ed, of the Proctor on th~ record

constitutes an appearance for the party from whom the proctor holds the proxy, unless

the proctor expressly informs the Court that he does ot, on that occasion, appear for

the party.

Macdonell. C.J was quite 'emphatic

The proctor of record is there when the case is called; the. , if he wishes his presence in Court not , to be reckoned an ppearance for the defendant, he hould make that clear to the Court

forthwith. This is necessary in the interest of the Court it elf, to inform it if, notWithstanding the

10

presence of the proctor in Court, the occasion is not to be treated as an appearance; the Court

needs this information that it may know how to proceed. This is necessary also in the interest of

the proctor himself, that there may be some entry in the journal of the case to show what he did

, for his client on the case being called.

So if the proctor wishes not to appear for the client, he must bring it home to the notice

of Court.

Garvin S.P.] too at p 222 of the judgment emphasizes this requirement of informing court

that a lawyer does not wish to appear for a party.

If the proctor, though present, does not wish his presence to be construed as an appearance on

behalf of his client, he must immediately inform the Court that he does not desire to and is not

entering or making a . appearance in the case. This must"be done clearly and unambiguously. It

is not sufficient, as in the case under consideration, to say that he has no

instructions.

So mere ipsissima verba of an Attorney~at ~law that __ has no instructions does not

constitute non~appearance of his client unless it is ele rly brought home to Court that

the Attorney~ at~law was ceasing to make an appearance for the party.

Maartensz A.] too echoed the same principle.

I agree with my Lord the Chief] ustice that a definite nde should be laid down for the guidance

of proctors and the Courts of original jurisdiction; and that the rule should be that a proctor

present in Court when his case is called, ifhe does not des ~re to enter an appearance for an absent

party whose proxy he has filed should definitely state L the Court that he is not entering an

appearance, and that otherwise his presence in Court s1 uld be deemed an appearance for that

party.

The instructive judgment of Andiappa Chettiar v Sanmugam Chettiar (supra) where

all four judges of the Supreme Court wrote separate :udgments was followed by the

Court of Appeal in Alimc Umma vs. Siyaneris (2006) 1 Sri.LR 22 where on the trial date

11

the plaintiff was absent and her registered attorney an counsel were present and were --, ready to start the plaintiff's case. The objection taken by the defendant that since the

plaintiff has failed to appear, the action had to be di missed under section 87(1) was

upheld. The plaintiff moved in revision. Gamini Ameratunga J held

"In terms of section 24 of the Code, the registered attorney or any attorney/adaw instructed by

the registered attorney can represent a party to the action in court. If the registered attorney is

in court and represents the party that is an appearance for the party even if the party is not

physically present in Court, the Court cannot dismiss the action for the absence of the party.

On the same lines as in Andiappa Chettiar v Sanmugam Chettiar (supra), the Court of

Appeal held as follows in Ishek Fernando v Rita Fernando and Others (1999) 3 Sri.LR

29:

"Section 84 read with Section 24 defines what constitutes appearance. What i~ says by

"appearance" is that 'an appearance may be by the party in person or by his counsel or his

Attorney."

It is thus acknowledged in this country that a mere statement from the bar that a

particular counsel or registered attorney has no instruction is not enough to constitute

a non/appearance of the party. It is yet an appearance of the party. If it is intended that

the recognized agents I have mentioned above do no longer appear for the party, they

must inform Court that t ey do not appear for the party.

The case of Andiappa Chettiar v Sanmugam Chettiar (supra) was followed by

Chitrasiri, J in CisjJin Nona alias Personahamy v Gunasena Jayawardana (2016)

Athula Bandara Herath~s Supreme Court Law Rep rt 247. Chitrasiri, J affirmed the

judgment of Anil Gooneratne J in the Court of Appeal which is reported in 2012 (B.LR)

361 sub nom, Jayawardena v CicjJin Nona . What Cl itrasiri, J stated in the Supreme

Court is pertinent to quote:

12

" ..... Both in the journal entry and in the proceedings recorded on 27.05.l997 show that

Mr.Junaideen Attorney/at/law, on that date, he being the proxy holder had marked his

appearance on behalf of the respondent. Even the answer of the respondent had been filed under

his name. Having marked his appearance for the respondent, he has merely submitted that the

respondent had not given him instructions to appear on that particular date.

Authorities referred to above show that the trial judge, under those circumstances should have

taken up the matter onsidering it as an inter partes trial and allowed the counsel to cross/

examine the witness. Accordingly, it is clear that the Court of Appeal has correctly decided the

issue in this case having adopted the law relevant theret .... "

In fact in De Mel et ai vs. Gunasekera et ai41 N.L.R 33, on the day fixed for trial, an

Advocate entered an ap earance for the defendants and applied for a postponement,

which was refused. The Advocate thereupon withdrew from the case, intimating that he

had been instructed only to apply for the postponement. It was held that the proceedings

were inter partes.

In the above case it was conceded that if a defendant applied for a postponement and

then withdrew, the trial i Tould proceed inter partes. It was also conceded that if a Proctor

acted similarly, the pr ceeding would be inter partes, but it was contended that if an

Advocate appeared for a limited purpose of applying for a date and withdrew upon

refusal of the application, his appearance was only r that purpose and no other. De

Kretser j., expressed the view that. "This seems as , rtung proposition, and its only

foundation is that a Proctor holds a proxy from his client and therefore represents him,

but a Counsel does not represent him; yet it is conceded that if he did appear for a part

of the trial and then 'thdrew, the trial would be onsidered one inter partes ... The

Advocate's appearance for a limited purpose was the _ roctor's appearance for ~ limited

purpose, and that again was the appearance of the party for a limited purpose". De

Kretser J went on to hold ::hat even if the Advocate withdrew from the case, intimating

.. 13

that he had been instructed only to apply for a postpon ment, the proceedings were inter

partes.

So it is clear that when an Attorney-at-law, be it the registered Attorney or Counsel

intimates to Court that he has no instructions in the case, there cannot be an ex parte trial

nor could there be a dismissal of the plaint. The trial judge may proceed with the inter

partes trial. The trial judg '. may even proceed to notice the Plaintiff or Defendant because

it may well be that the Plaintiff may have encountered a difficulty that prevented him

from instructing his registered Attorney or Counsel.

Section 91 A (3) of the C de states that the Court may, for sufficient cause, either on the

application of the parties or of its own motion, advance, postpone or adjourn the trial to any

I other date upon such ter 1S as to costs or otherwise a' to it shall seem meet. It was for

, I this reason that it was held in Rev.Sumanatissa v Harry Dias (2009) (1) Sri.LR 31 that

the Court has to have regard to the past history of the' case. Sufficient cause may lie in

the fact that the case record displays, as in this case, constant presence of the Plaintiff in

Court, whereas absence from Court is just an isolated instance on the adjourned day.

As I said before, the facts in the case before me are quite different from the ,facts of

johanis Appuhamy (supra). In that case both the defendant and his proctor were

absent. But in this case both the Plaintiff and his registered attorney were absent but his

counsel Mr Sarath Bandara was present in Court. The counsel did not say that he was

withdrawing from making an appearance for the Plaintiff. He merely intimated ~o Court

that he had no instructions from the registered Attorney-at-law. The learned Counsel

was present in Court because of the legal nexus between him and the registered

Attorney. Thus the appearance of counsel in court constituted an appearance on behalf

of the Plaintiff and it cannot be said that the Plaintiff defaulted in appearance in Court.

So the learned District Judge could not have resorted to Chapter XII and dismissed the

~ction of the Plaintiff under Section 87 (1) of the Civil Procedure Code. The proper order

would have been to grant a date and notice the Plaintiff and therefore the order of

14

dismissal made in this case was indeed a nullity. Nothing could have flowed from this

\ nullity. In fact Lord Denning in the Privy Council in McFoy v United Africa Company

(1961) 3 AER 1169 stated at p 1172

If an act in law is void, then it is in law a nullity. .... Ther is no need for an order of the court to

set it aside. It is automatically null and void without much ado, though it is sometimes

convenient to have the court declare it to be so. And every proceeding which is founded on it is

also bad and incurably' bad. You cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there. It

will collapse.

There was no warrant for the learned Additional District Judge to have dismissed this

matter on the basis that there was a default on 15.07.1996. He proceeded to dismiss the

plaint subject to cost immediately upon an applicati )n made by the Counsel for the

Defendant. The learned Additional District Judge was oblivious to section 24 and a slew

of cases that have interpt:eted the provision. So this decision of the learned Additional

District Judge was per incuriam.

"There is at least one exception to the rule of stare decisis. I refer to judgments rendered per

incuriam. A judgment per incuriam is one which has been rendered inadvertently. Two examples

come to mind; first, where the judge has forgotten to take account of a previOUS decision to which

the doctrine of stare decisis applies. For all the care with which the Attorneys and judges may

comb the case law, errare humanum est, and sometimes a judgment which clarifies a point to be

settled is somehow n t indexed, and is forgotten. It is in cases such as these that a judgment

rendered in contradiction to a previous judgment that should have been considered binding, and

in ignorance of that judgment, with no mention of it, must be deemed rendered per incuriam; thus,

it has no authority .... The same applies to judgments rendered in ignorance of legislation of which

they should have taken account. For a judgment to be de med per incuriam, that judgment must

show that the legislation was not invoked." Louis Philippe Pigeon, Drafting and

Interpreting Legislation 60 (1988).

'!

"As ageneral rule the only cases in which decisions should be held to have beengiven per incuriam

are those of decisions given in ignorance or in forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory

provision or of some authority binding on the court concerned, so that in such cases some

features of the decision or some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found on that account

to be demonstrably wrong. This definition is not neces. arily exhaustive, but cases not strictly

within it which can properly be held to have been decided per incuriam, must in our judgment,

consistently with the stare decisis rule which is an ess 'ntial part of our law, be of the rarest

occurrence." Rupert Cross & ].W. Harris, Preceden in English Law, 149 (4th Ed. 1991).

In Halsbury, Laws of Eng and 4th Edition, Volume 26 para 578 it was stated that:

"A decision will be regarded as given per incuriam if it was given in ignorance of some

inconsistent statute Of binding decision: but not Simply because the Court had not the benefit of

the best argument."

In the case of Morelle Ltd v Wakeling (1955) 1 All ER 708 at page 718 Sir Raymond

Evershed MR stated that

As a general rule the only cases in which decisions should be held to have been given per

, ,. incuriam are tho t: of decisions given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent

statutory provision or of some authority binding on the court concerned so that in such cases

some part of the deci~ion or some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found, on that

account, to be demonstrably wrong. This definition is n t exhaustive, but cases are not strictly

within it which can properly be held to have been decided per incuriam must, in our judgement,

conSistently with the stare decisis rule which is an essential feature of our law, be, in the language

, of Lord Greene, MR., of the rarest occurrence. In the resent case, it is not shown that any

statutory provision ot-binding authority was overlooked, and while not excluding the possibility

that in rare and exce tiona 1 cases a decision may properly be held to have been per incuriam on

other grounds, we cannot regard this as such a case.

Having regard to the indicia given above, the learned Additional District Judge was in

ignorance or forgetfulness of Section 24 of the Code and the precedents such as

Andiappa Chettiar (supra) and De Mel (supra) and as Lord Green M.R said in Craig

v. Kanseen (1943) 1 A. E. R. 108 at p 113 "these cases appear to me to establish that an

order which can properly be described as a nullity is something which the person

affected by it is entitled ex debitojustitiac to have set asick ".

The Plaintiff did not default in appearance but because of the erroneous order of

dismissal, it would appear that he moved the District Court for a purge default inquiry

which was decided against him by an order dated 31.01.1997. As I said before, this inquiry

was a nullity because it flowed from a nullity. It was needlessly conducted when the

Plaintiff had no default to purge. If there was no default to purge, there could not be a

purge ~default inquiry.

It is an established rule tJ-tat no party should suffer due to an act of Court. It is set out in

the case of Rodger v Comptoir D'Escompte de Paris (1871) LR 3/14C 405 that

"One of the first and highest duties of all Courts is to take care that the act of the Court does no

injury to any of the suitors.

The bottom~line of all this boils down to this nitty~gritty. The case is still in existence

on the roll or the cause list of the District Court of Galle and should be expeditiously

recommenced and concluded. So I proceed to set aside the order of dismissal dated

15.07.1996 and the subsequent order dated 31.01. 1997 and declare them nullities.

Accordingly I allow the appeal of the Plaintifr Appellant and direct the learned District

Judge of Galle to recomn ence this trial inter partes from where it stopped and conclude

the trial as expeditiously as expeditious could be.
