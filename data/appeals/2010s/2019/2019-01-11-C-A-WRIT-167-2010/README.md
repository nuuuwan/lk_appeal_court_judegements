The Petitioner has filed this application seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash

the decision contained in document marked 'P3', which is the Order of the

Commissioner General of Labour dated 1st December 2009, where he held that

the services of the 4th - 22nd Respondents had been terminated in violation of

the provisions of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special

Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971 (as amended) (TEW Act).

This Court, having heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioner in support of

this application had issued notices on all Respondents on 26th March 2010.

According to the journal entry dated 28th July 2010, Objections have been filed

on behalf of the 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th - 16th and 18th - 22nd Respondents on 19~h July

2010 and the said Respondents had been represented by Counsel, until 25th

4

September 2014. The 4th -22nd Respondents had been absent and

unrepresented thereafter and argument had proceeded in their absence.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner is a company duly incorporated under the laws of Sri Janka and

is engaged ~n the business of managing the Mahaw_eli Reach Hotel, Kandy, of

which the Petitioner is the owner. The 4th - 22nd Respondents were employees

of the Petitioner and were working in the capacity of security guards at the

said Hotel.

The 4th - 22nd Respondents, along with four other employees of the Petitioner,

had made individual applications dated ih May 2009, to the Commissioner of

Labour (Termination of Employment Unit), alleging that their services were

unjustly terminated by the Petitioner. The contents of the letters are identical

except for the individual details of each employee and reads as follows:

Section 2(1) of the TEW Act reads as follows:

tlNo employer shall terminate the scheduled employment of any

workman without-

(a) the prior consent in writing of the workman; or.

(b) the prior written approval of the Commissioner."

Section 2(4) of the TEW Act specifies as follows:

"For the' purposes of this Act, the scheduled employment of any workman

shall be deemed to be terminated by his employer if for any reason

whatsoever, otherwise than by reason of a punishment imposed by way

of disciplinary action, the services of such workman in such employment

are terminated by his employer."

Thus, the primary function of the Commissioner General of Labour under the

TEW Act is to determine whether the services of the 4th - 22nd Respondents

had been terminated in accordance with the provisions of the TEW Act.

The said applications of the 4th - 22nd Respondents were taken up for inquiry

before the 2nd Respondent on 29th May 2009, where the parties agreed that

the 2nd Respondent could pronounce his order on the written submissions to

be filed by the parties.

6

In the written submissions filed before the 2nd Respondent, the Petitioner did

not dispute the fact that the prior written consent of the workmen or the prior

written approval of the Commissioner had not been obtained. The Petitioner,

having admitted that the services of the 4th -22nd Respondents were

terminated on sth May 2009 took up the position that the said termination

took place on grounds of misconduct on the part of the 4th - 22nd Respondents.

In support of this position, the Petitioner cited several instances of misconduct

on the part of the said Respondents including the consumption of food inside

hotel rooms during working hours, loss of goods belonging to the Petitioner as

well as that of hotel guests and the said Respondents found sleeping during

working hours. The Petitioner claimed that these acts of negligence resulted in

the security of the hotel being threatened and that the Petitioner was

compelled to discontinue the services of the 4th -22nd Respondents on

disciplinary grounds.

The 4th - 22nd Respondents have however denied the said allegations made by

the Petitioner. It was their position that on sth May 2009, they were called up

and told by the management that their services were no longer required and

to vacate the hotel premises by noon of that day. They further complained that

they had not been issued with any written communication and that their

consent had not been obtained to terminate their services.

This Court observes that in terms of Section 2{S} of the TEW Act, "where any

employer terminates the scheduled employment of any workman by reason of

punishment imposed by way of disciplinary action the employer shall notify

such workman in writing the reasons for the termination of employment

7

before the expiry of the second working day after the date of such

termination."

It is not in dispute that the Petitioner did not notify the 4th - 22nd Respondents,

in writing or otherwise, the reasons for the termination of their services. The

Petitioner cannot therefore _seek to w~tify its actions on the grounds of

misconduct of the 4th -22nd ~~pondents, even if that was correct, as the

Petitioner has failed to comply with the provisions of Section 2(5) of the TEW

Act.

After hearing both parties, the 1st Respondent Commissioner General of

Labour, by a letter dated 1st December 2009 annexed to the petition marked

'P3', informed the Petitioner that the services of the said Respondents have

been terminated in violation of the provisions of the TEW Act. This Court is

satisfied that the termination of the services of the 4th - 22nd Respondents by

the Petitioner was clearly in violation of the provisions of Section 2(1) of the

TEW Act and therefore is in agreement with the said decision of the 1st

Respondent.

The necessary consequence of a violation of the provisions of Section 2(1) is

set out in Section 5 of the TEW Act which reads as follows:

"Where an employer terminates the scheduled employment of a

workman in contravention of the provisions of this Act, such termination

shall be illegal, null and void, and accordingly shall be of no. effect

whatsoever."

8

Section 6 of TEW Act sets out the powers of the Commissioner of Labour in the

event a decision is made that Section 2(1) of the TEW Act has been violated.

"Where an employer terminates the scheduled employment of a

workman in contravention of the provisions of this Act, the Commissioner

may order such employer to continue to e_mploy the workman, with

effect frpm a date specified in such order, in the same capacity in which

the workman was employed prior to such termination, and to pay the

workman his wages and all other benefits which the workman would have

otherwise received if his services had not so been terminated; and it shall

be the duty of the employer to comply with such order. The

Commissioner sha'lI cause notice of such order to be served on both such

employer and the workman."

The 1st Respondent, acting in terms of Section 6 of the TEW Act, accordingly

ordered the Petitioner to reinstate the 4th -22nd Respondents with back-

wages. The reasons given by the 2nd Respondent for the said decision are as

follows:

"1971 qo&D 45 ~O!ft) ~l:~eDem ocre~ q~~ tDOO (~ OO~)6) (oge>

Being dissatisfied with the said decision, the Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction

conferred on this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution, seeking a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the said decision contained in 'P3'.

9

At the hearing of this application, it was submitted by the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner that the Petitioner is not contesting the fact that the

termination of the services of the 4th -22nd Respondents was contrary to

Section 2(1) of the TEW Act. It was however contended by the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner that the 4th -22nd Respondents playa very important and

strategic role within the hotel by providing security to the hotel and its guests

and that the Petitioner must have a very high degree of trust and confidence in

its security personnel. It was contended further that the working relationship

between the parties had deteriorated and that the reinstatement of the 4th -

22nd Respondents was not feasible and would only lead to a breakdown of the

industrial peace at the work place, not only between the Petitioner and the

said Respondents but also with other employees of the Petitioner.

The Petitioner submitted to this Court that in view of the above circumstances,

it informed the 2nd Respondent during the i~quiry that it was willing to pay

compensation to the 4th - 22nd Respondents for loss of employment but that

the said Respondents were not agreeable to the said settlement. It was

I submitted by the Petitioner that in terms of Section 6 of the TEW Act, the 1st

Respondent has the discretion to grant compe'nsation as opposed to the

automatic reinstatement of the employees in question. The Petitioner stated

further that the 1st Respondent erred by issuing the said order 'p3' for

reinstatement without taking into consideration the realities of the strained

employer-employee relationship between the Petitioner and the said

Respondents.

10

It was in this background that the learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted

that the 1st -3rd Respondents ought to have taken into consideration the

above circumstances, and ordered compensation, if they were of the view that

the services of the 4th - 22nd Respondents have been terminated in violation of

the TEW Act, as opposed to the reinstatement of the 4th - 22nd Respondents.

The question that arises for consideration in this application is therefore

whether the Commissioner General of Labour can only order reinstatement

with back wages and other benefits in a situation where the services of an

employee has been terminated in violation of Section 2{1} of the TEW Act, or

whether the Commissioner General of Labour has a discretion to order

compensation, in lieu of reinstatement.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner quite correctly pointed out that there

are judgments of this Court that take a very strict view of Section 6 that the

only consequence of a termination of employment in violation of Section 2{1}

of the TEW Act is reinstatement with back wages. He also submitted that there

are several judgments of this Court and the Supreme Court that have taken a

more liberal or practical view that the Commissioner General of Labour has in

fact been conferred a discretion by Section 6 and that in exercising that

discretion, the Commissioner of Labour can order the payment of

compensation as opposed to reinstatement.

The strict view referred to by the Petitioner has been taken by this Court in

Eksath Kamkaru Samithiya vs Commissioner of Labourl where Upali. De Z

Gunewardena J, having observed that the word "may" used in Section 6 comes

1 2001 (2) Sri LR 137.

11

in the wake of Section 5 and that Section 6 of the Act must necessarily be read

as referring back to the preceding provision i.e. Section 5, held as follows:

"It is clear that Section 6 of the Act has to be understood or interpreted in

the light of or against the backdrop of the circumstance adumbrated or

contemRlated in sectiol} 5 of the Act - th_e cir~umstance b~ing that the

terminat~on of employment of a workman, in contravention of the

provisions of the relevant Act viz. Termination of Employment of

Workmen Act Nd.45 of 1971 shall be of no effect whatsoever. From what

has been said above, it would be clear that section 6 of the Act caters to

the circumstance or situation specified in section 5 which, as shown

above, states emphatically that termination of employment of a workman

in contravention of the provisions of the relevant Act is illegal and null

and void, that is, destitute of any effect whatsoever. In other words such

a termination being wholly incapable of giving rise to or affecting any

rights or obligations - the contract of employment will subsist and remain

intact. Section 5 renders any termination of employment in contravention

of the relevant Act absolutely illegal. And section 6 states that the

Commissioner "may order the employer to continue to employ the

workman" in case the termination was in breach of the provisions of the

Act.,,2

The above reasoning is acceptable if Section 5 is read together with Section 6.

It is also logical that where the services of the employee is terminated contrary

to Section 2(1) of the TEW Act, such termination is held to be illegal in terms of

Section 5 and hence, on the basis that the contract of employment continues

12

in force, to order reinstatement with back wages, in terms of Section 6. The

only concern that this Court has with the said reasoning is that the word 'may'

in Section 6 then becomes superfluous. It would also prevent the

Commissioner General of Labour from taking into consideration the facts and

circumstances of each case and arriving at a practical solution.

This Court is mindful that a liberal interpretation of Section 6 without any

restrictions or controls can lead to abuse and a complete violation of the

industrial laws of this country. With this in mind, this Court would seek to

examine the several judgments that have taken a liberal approach towards

Section 6 by interpreting the word, 'may' as conferring a discretion on the

Commissioner General" of Labour.

The first case relied upon by the Petitioner is the judgment of the Supreme

Court in Ceylon Mercantile Union vs Vinitha Limited and the Commissioner of

labour3. In this case, MIs Vinitha Limited made an application to the

Commissioner of Labour in November 1974 under the TEW Act seeking

permission to terminate the services of five of its employees. After inquiry, the

Commissioner of Labour made an order granting permission to the employer

to terminate the employment of the said employees. However, prior to the

said order of the Commissioner of Labour, the employer had terminated the

services of the said employees. The Petitioner Union subsequently made an

application to the Commissioner of Labour for an order on the employer,

under Section 6 of the TEW Act, to continue the employment of the said

employees on the ground that the employer had terminated the services of

the said employees without the permission of the Commissioner of Labour.

3 SC Application No, 884/75; SC Minutes of 29th M arch 1976,

13

After further inquiry, the Commissioner of Labour refused to make an order

under Section 6 of the TEW Act.

After considering the above facts, Tennekoon c.J held as follows:

"A further point mad~ by counsel for the petitioner is that in regard to

the application under Section 6, it is mandatory on the Commissioner to

hold an inquiry when a workman complains that his employer has

terminated his employment without the permission of the

Commissioner of Labour and to make an order in terms of Section 6.

In regard to this submission, it would appear from the facts that have

been placed before us that the Commissioner has held an inquiry before

he refused to make an order on the employer to continue the

employment of the workmen concerned. The words in the section4 are

"may order" and not "shall order". The Legislature obviously did not

contemplate that in every case of termination of employment without

the permission of the Commissioner of Labour it would be mandatory on

the Commissioner to order reinstatement or continuance of

employment upon a complaint being made to him under Section 6."

It appears to this Court that the Supreme Court was influenced by the fact that

the Commissioner of Labour had granted approval under Section 2(1) of the

TEW Act, although such approval was still pending at the time of the

termination of services of the said employees.

4 Section 6 of the TEW Act.

14

The next case that was referred by the Petitioner was the judgment of the

Supreme Court in Lanka Multi Moulds (Pvt) vs. Wimalasenas. In this case, the

employee, a British national was employed by the Appellant under a contract

of employment commencing on 1st September 1992, for an initial period of 3

years. By letter dated 29th April 1994, the Petitioner informed the employee of

its decision to terminate his services with effect from 30th July 1994. Upon a

complaint bei,ng made, the Commissioner of Labour, acting in terms of Section

6 of the TEW Act ordered that the employee be reinstated with effect from

15th January 1996 (although the initial period of 3 years of employment had

lapsed) and that he be paid his back wages. Upon an application for a Writ of

Certiorari, this Court noted that the contract of employment was only for 3

years which meant that:' the contract ought to have ended on 31st August 1995.

This Court confirmed the order that the termination was illegal, quashed the

order for reinstatement and held that the employee was 'entitled only to get

wages for the balance period of his 3 year contract.'

On an appeal to the Supreme Court, the Counsel for the Petitioner contended

that while the Commissioner had a discretion whether or not to order

reinstatement under the first limb of Section 6, he was not entitled to make an

order for compensation under the second limb unless he had first made an

order for reinstatement; and that an order for wages could not be made as an

alternative to, but only in addition to, an order for continued employment.

Mark Fernando, J, having rejected the said argument, held as follows:

52003 (1) Sri LR 143.

15

"section 6 must also apply in situations where reinstatement has become

impossible pendente lite. A workman due to retire in one year's time

might complain of wrongful termination. The anomalous consequence of

the Petitioner's interpretation would be that if the Commissioner's order

was made be/ore the due date of retirement, the workman could be

awarded reinstatement and back wages up to that date; but if it was

made ~ven one day thereafter, he could get nothing. The contrary

interpretation, however, avoids anomaly, inconvenience and injustice: if

the Commission'er finds himself unable to order reinstatement although

he holds the termination to be unlawful, he can nevertheless order the

employer to pay the workman "his wages and all other bene/its which

the workman would otherwise have received". It is unnecessary to

consider whether that amounts to "compensation" or not, because

section 6 expressly empowers the Commissioner to order payment of

"wages" and "benefits". The Petitioner's restrictive interpretation would

create other anomalies too. Thus, the Commissioner may find that

although termination was not justified the workman was guilty of some

lapse which merited some punishment, and that therefore part of the

back wages should be withheld. However, the Petitioner's interpretation

would deprive the Commissioner of the equitable power to order

anything less than full back wages. In my view, the conferment of the

power to grant the greater relief includes the power to grant the lesser

relief. Accordingly, I hold that "may" in section 6 confers a discretion on

the Commissioner; that "and" must be interpreted disjunctively; and that

the Commissioner had the power to order payment of wages and benefits

for the balance period of the 2

nd Respondent's contract without making

16

'an order for reinstatement. The Court of Appeal was therefore entitled to

order such payment when setting aside the order for reinstatement.,,6

The following passage on the manner of applying Section 6 is important in the

consideration of the matter presently before Court and is re-produced below:

lilt woul!d be inequitable to interpret section 6 as requiring a mechanical

order for back wages from the date of wrongful termination up to the

date of reinstatement or the date on which the employment comes to an

end. There is no doubt whatever that the object which section 6 intended

to achieve was to annul an unlawful termination and to restore - insofar

as it was reason~bly possible - the status quo: to put a workman in the

position in which he would have been if his services had not been

terminated."?

In the case of J.P Alensu vs. Mahinda Madihahewa8, several employees of

Chandrasiri Hotel which was owned by the Petitioner had threatened the

Petitioner that the work of the hotel would be disrupted unless the Petitioner

granted leave to a fellow employee. Upon an application by the employees

under the TEW Act and after an inquiry, the Commissioner General of Labour

had made an order to pay compensation to the employees. Sriskandarajah, J,

having considered the above judgments as well as several other judgments9,

held as follows:

6 At page 149.

7 At page 151.

8 CA (Writ) 455/2006; CA Minutes of 14th February 2011.

(Pvt) Ltd. v Coeme [1996 (1) Sri LR 200].

..

"If the circumstances are such that ordering reinstatement causes

employer-employee unrest in the opinion of the Commissioner he could

order compensation instead of ordering the employer to continue to

employ the workman."

Although the above cases were categorized as taking a liberal view, this Court

observes that in each of the said cases, there were clearly identifiable and

compelling reasons as to why reinstatement could not be made and the

making of an order for compensation was the only option available.

Applying the rationale laid down in the judgments referred to above, this Court

is of the view that the" use of the word 'may' in Section 6 of the TEW Act does

in fact confer the Commissioner General of Labour a discretion on whether to

order reinstatement with back wages or to limit the relief to compensation.

This Court is further of the view that the termination of employment of an

employee contrary to the provisions of Section 2(1) of the TEW Act would

under normal circumstances attract reinstatement with back wages, as

provided for in Section 6. However, there can be exceptional situations as have

arisen in the judgments referred to above, which justify the Commissioner

General of Labour making an order for compensation. This Court is therefore

of the view that while reinstatement with back wages should be the norm,

awarding of compensation, depending on the facts and circumstances of each

case, should be the exception.

This brings me to the next question -should the 1st Respondent . have

considered the payment of compensation as opposed to reinstatement? It

does not appear from the Order 'P3' that any consideration has been given to

18

this issue or that the 1st Respondent was mindful that he in fact had a

discretion. In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the

Commissioner of Labour erred in law when he failed to consider the

submission of the Petitioner that the Commissioner was vested with discretion

in terms of Section 6 of the TEW Act.

Under normal circumstances, this Court should remit this matter to the

Commissioner General of Labour for a determination by the Commissioner as

to whether this is a fit matter for the Commissioner to exercise the discretion

vested in him in terms of Section 6 of the TEW Act. However, this Court is of

the view that remitting this matter to the Commissioner General of Labour

after almost 9 years after the initial decision would not be in the best interests

of the parties and hence, this Court decides to consider whether this is a fit

and proper case where the Commissioner General of Labour ought to have

exercised his discretion.

This Court is in agreement with the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the

4th - 22nd Respondents playa critical role in the day to day functioning of the

Petitioner's hotel and that it is absolutely important that the Petitioner has the

fullest possible trust and confidence in the said Respondents. Any ill-feeling

between the Petitioner and the said Respondents would have an adverse

impact on the day to day affairs of the Petitioner. The Petitioner has stated

further that it has already outsourced to a third party the provision of security

services for the hotel. In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that

reinstating the 4th -22 nd Respondents in service would not be a practical

solution and that this is a fit case where the Commissioner of Labour ought to

have exercised his discretion in favour of the Petitioner and granted

19

comp~nsation to the 4th _22 nd Respondents, instead of mechanically following

the provisions of Section 6 of the TEW Act. This Court however does not wish

to proceed any further than this, as it is of the view that the decision on the

quantum of compensation, back wages or other benefits that should be paid,

should be best left to the Commissioner General of Labour.

In these circumstances, this Court, while upholding the decision of the 1st

Respondent contained in 'P3' that the termination of services of the 4th - 22nd

Respondents is contrary to the provisions of the TEW Act, proceeds to issue a

Writ of Certiorari quashing only that part of 'P3' by which the 1st Respondent

ordered that the 4th -22nd Respondents be reinstated in service with back

wages. This Court directs the 1st Respondent to hear the parties and make a

suitable decision, within four months of this judgment, on the compensation

that should be paid to the 4th -22nd Respondents under and in terms of

Section 6 of the TEW Act.

This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
