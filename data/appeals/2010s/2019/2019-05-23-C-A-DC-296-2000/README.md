Dr.Sunil F.A. Coorey with C.Amaratunga for the Substituted Defendant-Appellant

Rohan Sahabandu P.C with Surekha Withanage for Plaintiff-Respondent.

10.12.2018

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff") instituted

this action against his elder brother the original Defendant seeking a declaration that the

Plaintiff was entitled to the land described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint, ejectment of

the original Defendant aJ ,d those holding under him, and for the recovery to damages

together with costs of action. One Punchi Banda was the father of both the Plaintiff and

the original Defendant. It IS over the succession rights to the permit of Punchi Banda that

the Plaintiff sued his elder brother in respect of the state land depicted in the schedule

to the plaint.

The crux of the issue before Court was whether the father Punchi Banda (the original

permit holder), despite h 'ling cancelled the nominations of the Plaintiff (one of his sons)

in 1980, re-nominated him in 1987, as claimed by the ~laintiff-Respondent in his plaint

dated 18.12.1991.

The Plaintiff premised hir action against the original Defendant (his elder brother) solely

on this re-nomination all >gedly effected by the father i 11987 and it is on this right that

he sought the ejectment of the original Defendant from the land depicted in the 2nd

schedule to the plaint.

It would appear that the father (the original permit holder) was given a state land in an

extent of 5 acres, 2 roods and 16 parches and the land depicted in the 2nd schedule from

which he wanted the elder brother (the original Defendant) evicted forms a portion of

the land depicted in the pt schedule. It is noteworth that even though the Plaintiff

claimed that he was nomi flated a second time by his father to the land in 1987, he claimed

2

that his elder brother TiL.karatne Banda had been in unlawful possession of the smaller

land depicted in the 2nd

~ chedule since 1991. Issue No . ~ raised on behalf of the Plaintiff

discloses this unlawful ossession against the elder brother~the original Defendant.

With the passing away 01 the original Defendant, his spouse has since been substituted

and I must observe that he answer filed by the original Defendant traversed the right

claimed by the Plaintiff a'ld the claim of right to the la d by virtue of the purported re ~

nomination has been str ~nuously impugned by the 0 iginal Defendant i.n his answer,

issues and evidence.

The learned District Judg ~ of Polonnaruwa by his judgment dated 03.06.2000 has ullowed

the reliefs claimed by the Plaintiff and the Defendant h;v appealed against this judgment,

dissatisfied with the reas'Jning of the said judgment. ,.

Let me now itemize the o. der in which the original peru :it holder Punchi Banda h"ls made

his nominations to the land in question. Several items of evidence inclusive of the

nominations Punchi Banuada made emerge through the testimony of one Somadasa

Somaratne from the offici;: of the relevant Divisional S '~cretary. The permit in question

and the land ledger in respect of this land was produce l as PI and P2 and they set out as

to how the paterfamilias Punchi Banda had nominatec his nor~inees. As could be seen

upon a perusal of the plTmit and the land ledger, the names of the nominees go as

I

follows: ~

1. Tikkiri Menike

2. Tilakaratne

3. Chandrasekara

4. Chandra Hemalatr a

But if one examines the pldce where the names of all these nominees appear namely page

2 of PI, all these names he\ ve been scored off thus

1. Tikkiri ~4enike

2. Chandrasekara (the-Plaintiff)

3

3. Tilakaratne Banda

4. Chandra Hemalatha

This could mean that Ch' ndrasekara (the Plaintiff) has been deleted twice and therefore

though he was once nominated by the father, the so ~called re ~nomination is not reflected

in PI. In the 2nd document namely the land ledger mar ed as P2 too, the same deletions

of the aforesaid names appear in the column "Nominatl'd Successors". So in both PI and

P2 one does not see a rvnomination of Chandrasekara (the Plaintiff) in the column

where the names of nominated successors must appear. Rather his name remains deleted.

In fact, the land ledger P2 gives 21st May 1980 as the date of the revocation of his name as

a nOImnee.

This documentary evide.lCe shows that the father Punchi Banda, despite an initial

nomination, had the plajntiff's name deleted as the nominee on 21.05.1980. The record

offers an explanation as to why the father had a change eJheart to revoke the nomination.

By the time the trial beg In, the old father for whose land this acrimonious battle had

raged for so long had pa3sed away and he could not be called as a witness. But it is

apparent that the father had sued the Plaintiff in a previous case bearing No.2609/L and

the testimony of the fath r given in the previous case along with the pleadings was led

in this case. That testimoAY of the father against the PI"'intiff in case No.2609/L gives the

background in which he (:ame to revoke the nomination that he had previously made in

favour of the Plaintiff. Tb ~ old father admitted to having nominated Chandrasekara ~the

Plaintiff. But he testifie j that in April 1980, the Plaiutiff in the case laid his jrnpious

hands on him, took not only forcible possession of the land depicted in Schedule 2 but a

large number of articles i _the house including items 0 . furniture and chased him away.

So in consequence of these acts of ingratitude an~ spoliation, he cancelled the

nomination of the not so grateful son in May 1980. 1 hat explains the notation dated

21.05.1980 which signifies the cancellation on P2 the land ledger. A colonization officer

who gave evidence in that previous case also corroborated Punchi Banda on this , . cancellation. The learnel t District Judge of Polonnaruwa who tried the previous case

4

bearing No.26091L uphtld the claim of the father and ordered the ejectment of

Chandarasekara (the Def ndant in that case but the Ph intiff in this case) from the land

by his judgment dated 0,9.11.1985. The Plaintiff in this case Chandrasekara did file an

appeal against the judgment in the previous case but quite significantly in May 1991 he

withdrew the appeal before Palakidnar J. (PICA) and Or. A. de Z. Gunawardana J. and

the appeal was accordingly dismissed.

So here was a father who :lad nominated the Plaintiff as his nominee but because the son

turned ungrateful and forgetful of his largess, the father cancelled the nomination on

21.05.1980 and sued him tor repossession of the land and ejectment.

But the plaint of the Plaintiff alleges that despite all tlis bad blood and acrimony, there

was a re~nomination of h' m as a nominee on 17.01.1987. Certainly this date appears at p.2

of the permit PI in the column where the names of the ..:leleted nominees appear but the

name of the Plaintiff as the nominee does not appear at all at p.2. The date 17.01.1987

stands sans the name of t: c Plaintiff.

In my view the 2nd page :)f Pl ~ the permit does not affclrd any evidence at all for the re ~

nomination upon which the Plaintiff sues in this cas . The Plaintiff's name does not

appeal at all on this page a.nd he only remains as a nominee revoked.

How the father who di ' d in May 1987, changed his heart and re ~nominated him in

January 1987 remains untxplained, given the fact the father had taken the son to court

for acts of ingratitude a Jd vindicated his honour in the previous case. Indubitably,

paternal instincts do overtake paterfamilias despite th :: peccadilloes of their issues but

the test of such a probabi ity in this case is not satisfied on oral evidence. It would appear

that even the permit -v-hich manifests various revocations in the place where

nominations should appe lr does not display the name 0'- the Plaintiff as the re ~nominated

nominee in 1987.

The attempt of the Plaintiff was to show that when hi. father passed away in May 1987

he had already become a nominee in January 1987. But tLe items of documentary evidence

do not advance his case. .

5

But the Plaintiff-Responc_ent relies on two other item , of evidence in the documentary

evidence. Both at the top of PI and P2 the name Chan .lrasekara is found. But his name

does not appear in the place where it should be-namely~'the column allotted for names of

I nominees. It is curious :hat Chandrasekara's name Jppears at the top of these two

documents PI and P2 but the officer who had inserted his name has been identified as

one Ramani Gunawardane who worked as the Divisional Secretary.

One Somadasa Somaratl c who was summoned by th,: Plaintiff from the office of the

r Diviiaonal Secretary identifies two dates namely 17.01.1987 and 04.12.1991.

As I said before, the date 11'.01.1987 is virtually 4 months: before the original permit holder

died. This date stands alone at p.2 of the permit wit ~out the name of Chandrasekara

(the Plaintiff). But this is the date which is relied upon by the Plaintiff as the date of his

re-nomination. But if that is his contention, the dat -, should be accompanied by a

mention of his name but his name does not appear, thus raising the possibility that this

may be an insertion.

The order date 04.12.1991 with the seal and another (~ ate 07.12.1991 with the initial of

Ramani Gunawardane appear at the top of PI. The I when was he re-nominated? It

~annot be 18.01.1987 beca~l se the name is missing in thE' nominee's column. If the date of

nomination is 07.12.1991,)t was almost 4 years and 8 ;uonths after the original,permit

holder had possessed away. At the top of page No.1 CJ~', permit, Punchi Bnada's name is

scored off and the plaintt f's name has been inserted.

If it was inserted on 07.12.1991, why should it be done 4 years and 8 months after the

original permit holder had died?

His name does not appea in the column for a nomine(> but it gets inserted at the top of

the pt page with two different dates. In such an event, I am irresistibly drawn to the

conclusion that the presumption in illustration (d) to Section 114 of the Evidence

Ordinance would hardly be engaged. Ramani Gunavvardane-the Divisional Secretary

whose initials have been identified as those appearing beside the name of the plaintiff

was a public official but !:here is abundant evidence on PI and P2 that falls far short of

6

raising the presumption :hat an official act has been regularly performed. Though the

burden is on the party who challenges the regularity of _he official or judicial act to plead

and prove his case (Ratnam v. Kanikaram A.I.R. (1964) S.C 244), in my view the

presumption was rebutted by the items of evidence that I have already itemised.

On the other hand Dr. Su nil Coorey questioned the authority of Ramani Gunawardane

to effect insertions in a p rmit sans instructions from the original permit holder.

The original permit holder passed away in May 1987. Only the date 17.01.1987 appears

next to the column for nominees sans the name of the Plaintiff. This does not raise the

presumption, while raising the probability that the permit holder never nominated the

Plaintiff before he passed away.

Whilst the Plaintiff reliell on this permit, the Defenda t raised the non-existence of the

nomination or rather the ,nvalidity of what Ramani Gunawardane had done. It called for

an explanation from Ramani Gunawardane as to why she inserted two dates namely

04.12.1991 and 07.12.1991. rhis gives one the impression that she inserted the name of the

Plaintiff on these two dates, almost 4 years and 8 months after the original permit holder

had possessed away.

Collateral Attack

In fact, this would amour L to an ultra vires act of this pu blic official who was unavailable

to explain the basis UpOI which the name of the Plai . tiff came to be inserted and the

Defendant was in effect IT aking a collateral attack on tl t permit and raising the question

of nullity of permit in favour of the Plaintiff. A person who wishes to challenge a decision

may do so directly or collGlterally. A collateral attack occurs when a decision is challenged

indirectly, such as by wa of a defence of invalidity of the act of Ramani Gunawardane

to a declaratory action be'_ ;~d on a permit. Where is the authrity of Ramani Gunawardane

to insert the name of the Plaintiff when there is no evi ence of a prior request from the

original permit holder-Pllllchi Banda? The officer wtc! gave evidence was not able to

speak to a written request on the part of the original permit holder to re-nominate the

Plaintiff as the nominee.

7

A collateral attack based )11 a public law defence of an ,dtra vires act is permitted in civil

cases and the English case of Wandsworth London Borough Council v. Winder(l985)

A.C 461 exemplifies this a proach, The Plaintiff's counc ~ had raised the rent of Winder's

flat; Winder refused to p, y the increase, paying only such an amount as he considered to

be reasonable; the council sued for arrears of rent and possession of the flat; Winder

argued in defence that the council had acted ultra vire:; by charging excessive rents The

local authority sought to /;trike out his defence in th ~: county court by saying that it

was only in judicial re ~iew proceedings that the jnvalidity of the raise could be

challenged. The council took Winder to the House of L'Jrds on this preliminary question

alone, The House held 'C ,at the defence could be raised without recourse to judicial

review proceedings, whHt admitting that the issues raised are those of the public law.

The validity of acts and decisions subject to review V1 'der the supervisory jurisdiction

may also be challenged a ~ ; I .1 defence in criminal proceedi llgs (see /\4acGillivary v Johnson

(No 2 1994 SLT 1012) and ope exceptionis in civil proceedings (see, especially, Vaughan

I' Engineering Ltd v Hinki"'1s &' Frewin Ltd 2003 SLT 428).

No doubt, the issue of invalidity of the act of Ramani Gunawardane giving this permit

to the Plaintiff without any scintilla of evidence to authorize that action is raised as a

defence in this case and l lv.ke the view that the defenc ~ must succeed. Ope Exceptionis the

plea of raised by the Def~ ndant that the document on hich the action is based is void

must succeed.

That would boil down to the effect that the Plaintiff \'Tas not the nominated successor

when Punchi Banda died in 1987.

Another question of la"v -Section 68 of the Land De~ elopment Ordinance

Assuming without conceding that the Plaintiff was the nominated successor, the

Plaintiff though failed tC' succeed under Section 68(2) of the Land Development

Ordinance. The law giv.:s a nominee a period of 6 m nths to enter into possession to

make the nomination eft . ctive. There is evidence that the Plaintiff never entered into

possession. As he failed to enter into possession within 6 months of Punchi Bnada's death

8

in 1987, or at least failed to take possession as by instituting an action, it follows that he

failed to succeed as required by Section 68(2) of the l.and Development Ordinance ~see

Basnayake C.J in Gunawardene v. Rosalin 62 N.L.R. 213; Rasammah v. Manamperi 77

N.L.R. 31; Leelawathie v. Perera (2012) 4 Sri LR 246.

If there is non~compliance with Section 68(2) of the Land Development Ordinance to

succeed, Section 72 kicks in and succession would take place in terms of the yd schedule

to the Ordinance, under. which it is the Defendant who would succeed as the elder

brother of the Plaintiff.

In the circumstances, the upshot of the above reasoning, would be that the Plain~iff was

not the nominated succe 'sor of Punchi Banda when the latter died in 1987 ad even if he

had been the nominate successor, he has failed to succeed to Punhci Banda under

Section 68(2) of the Lan '. Development Ordinance.

Accordingly, I proceed t " allow the appeal of the Detendant~Appellant, set aside the

judgment of the District Cour of Poldmnaruwa dated 03. 6.2000 and dismiss the action of

the Plaintiff.
