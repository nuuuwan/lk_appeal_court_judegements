Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is an appeal filed by the 1st party respondent-appellant

(appellant) against the Judgement of the High Court dated

10.06.2015.

The police filed the first information in the Magistrates Court,

under section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act,

naming the appellant as the 1st party respondent and his

deceased wifes brother as the 2nd party respondent

(respondent), regarding a dispute as to possession of a portion of

land described in the police observation notes dated

20.01.2011.1

There is no issue with regard to the identification of the disputed

portion of the land, although the learned counsel for the

appellant at the argument drew the attention of this Court to the

schedule of the respondents affidavit filed before the

Magistrates Court where boundaries of the disputed portion,

when compared with the police sketch, are misdescribed.2

When one reads the statement made by the respondent to the

police dated 26.01.20113, it is clear that the respondent does

not dispute the identification of the land. The land in dispute is

the land shown in the police observation notes referred to above.

The next question is who was in possession of the land on the

date of filing the first information in Court? It is undisputed that

it was the respondent who was in possession. Hence, in terms of

section 68(1), read with section 68(2) of the Act, the Court shall

remove any disturbances to his possession and confirm him in

possession. That is the basic principle.

However, if the appellant can show that although the respondent

is now in possession of the land, the respondent came to such

possession by forcibly evicting the appellant from possession

within two months before filing the information in Court, in

terms of section 68(3) of the Act, the appellant shall be restored

in possession. This, the appellant has failed to do.

The main document relied upon by the learned counsel for the

appellant is the Acreage Tax payment receipt marked 1V2,

which is dated 26.02.2010.4 As the first information was filed in

Court on 11.02.2011, this is not helpful to the appellant. There

are no documents to prove recent possession of the land by the

appellant.

This is a co-owned land. A partition case filed to end co-

ownership is pending in the District Court. It was revealed at the

argument that the parties to this appeal are also parties to the

said partition case. The parties can have a lasting solution to

this matter in the said partition case.

The appellant had not been in possession of the disputed

portion of the land when the respondent, on or around

10.01.2011, as seen from the police complaint of the appellant

dated 10.01.20115, cleared the area with the written consent of

some of the co-owners of the land, as seen from 2V1 dated

05.10.2010.6

Although I accept the submission of the learned counsel for the

appellant that the learned Magistrate in the impugned order has

not stated the law correctly, the conclusion reached therein by

the learned Magistrate is correct. However, the learned High

Court Judge, in a remarkably well-written judgment, has clearly

explained the law in this regard.

I affirm the Judgment of the High Court and dismiss the appeal

with costs.
