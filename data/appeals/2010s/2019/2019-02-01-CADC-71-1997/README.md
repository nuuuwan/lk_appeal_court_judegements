BEFORE : M. M. A. Gaffoor, J. COUNSEL : R. Chula Bandara for the 13th, 14th and 15th

Defendant-Appellants M. C. Jayaratne with M. D. J. Bandara for the

1st, 1C, 1D & 1E Substituted-Plaintiff-Respondents WRITTEN SUBMISSION FILED ON : 15.10.2018 (by the 13th, 14th and 15th

Defendant-Appellants) ARGUED ON : 18.06.2018 DECIDED ON : 30.01.2019

*******

M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent filed the above styled action before the District Court of

Kuliyapitiya to partition the land (more fully described in the schedule to Plaint)

called Diwulgahakumbure Pillewa which had been conveyed to 5 persons by

virtue of a settlement (P1).

After filing of the statement of claims, the case proceeded to trial (on 16.12.1986)

on 2 admissions and 11 issues. Having heard all the parties the learned District

Judge on 12.02.1997 delivered the judgment in favour of the Plaintiff-

Respondent.

Page 6 of 8

Being aggrieved by the said judgment dated 12.02.1997, the 13th, 14th and 15th

Defendant-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Appellants) preferred this

appeal on the ground that, the learned District Judge of Kuliyapitiya had erred in

law by allotting the share only to the 14th Defendant-Appellant from the corpus

and thereby had failed to analyses the evidence adduced from the 15th

Defendant-Appellant.

In this case, the identity of the corpus depicted in the preliminary plan as well as

the fact that same had been conveyed by the State to 5 persons namely,

Appuhamy, Tikkiri Banda, Punchi Banda, Ukku Banda and Kiri Mudiyanse were

recorded as admissions (vide page 116 of the appeal brief).

The Appellants stated that the said Appuhamy (1st Defendant-Respondent) sold

his share in the corpus which is a part of the land in dispute to Tikiri Banda

(father of the Appellants) by the document marked 15 V1.

The 1A Defendant though did not raise a point of contest took up a position in his

evidence that his father Appuhamy who was one of the 5 co-owners of the

corpus had not conveyed his 1/5 share to Tikkiri Banda by virtue of the deed

marked 15 V5.

The learned Counsel for the Appellants submitted that though the learned

Counsel for the 1A Defendant-Respondent by way of written submission raised

an issue first time in Appeal on the basis that the boundaries included in 15 V1 is

not a part of the corpus; such issue cannot be raised now since it is not a pure

question of law.

I am of the view that the above raised issue of the 1A Defendant-Respondent

cannot be stand in this appeal.

Page 7 of 8

In CANDAPPA vs. PONNAMBALAMPILLAI [(1993) 1 SLR 184], it was held that

a party cannot be permitted to present a different case in appeal from that

presented in the trial court where matters of fact are involved which were not in

issue at the trial, such case not being one which raises a pure question of law.

In SETHA vs. WEERAKOON [49 NLR 225] it was held that,

A new point which was not raised in the issues or in the course of

the trial cannot be raised for the first time in appeal, unless such

point might have been raised at the trial under one of the issues

framed, and the Court of Appeal has before it all the requisite

material for deciding the point, or the question is one of law and

nothing more.

It also evident that the father of the 1A Defendant-Respondent had filed an action

earlier to invalidate the said deed marked 15 V5 but it was dismissed as per the

document marked on 15 V2 V4.

A close examination of the impugned judgment reveals that the learned trial

judge in the process of investigation of title has failed pay attention to said deed

which was executed in 1940s upon which the Appellants said to have derived

title on inheritance.

In these circumstances, I allow the appeal with costs whilst setting aside the

impugned judgment and the case is remitted to the District Court for a re-trail.

The learned Judge is directed to conclude the case as expeditiously as possible.

Further, the learned District Judge is hereby directed to pay attention to the

strength of the deed marked 15 V5 judiciously. However, parties are permitted to

make an application to adopt the evidence already led and call more witnesses

once re-trial commenced if necessary.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to forward this record in Case No. 6372/P

with a copy of this judgment to the respective Court forthwith.

Appeal allowed, Re-trail ordered.
