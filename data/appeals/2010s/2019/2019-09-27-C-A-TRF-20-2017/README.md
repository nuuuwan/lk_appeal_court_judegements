The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, inter alia, to

have an order transferring Case No. HC 8570/16 (sometimes referred to as the

"impugned case") from High Court No. 06 to any High Court not presided

over by the learned High Court Judge, who presided over the said case at the

time material to this application. The application for transfer of the said case is

made under and in terms of Section 46 of the Judicature Act.

Section 46(1) of the Judicature Act reads as follows,

"46(1) Whenever it appears to the Court of Appeal -

(a) that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had in any particular court or

place; or

(b) that some questions of law of unusual difficulties are likely to arise; or

(c) that a view of the place in or near which any offence is alleged to have

been committed may be required for the satisfactory inquiry into or trial

of the same; or

(d) that it is so expedient on any other ground;

Page 2 of 12

the court may order upon sllch terms as to the payment of costs or otherwise as

the said court thinks fit, for the transfer of any action, prosecution, proceeding

or mailer pending before any court to any other court and accordingly in evelY

sllch case, the court to which any such action, prosecution, proceeding or

mailer is so transferred shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this

or any other law, take cognizance of and have the power and jurisdiction to

hear, try, and determine such action, prosecution, proceeding or maller, as

fully and effectually to all intents or purposes as if such court had an original

power and jurisdiction. "

The facts leading to this application can be briefly set out as follows,

At the time of filing this application the Petitioner was indicted in 3

separate cases before the High Court of Colombo, that is, HC 8546/ 16, HC

8222/ 16 and HC 8570/16. All 3 cases were listed before the same judge

presiding in High Court No. 06.

On 02/02/2017, when Case No. HC 8546116 was mentioned before the

said Court, the learned High Court Judge referred the said case to High Court

No. I for reallocation on the basis that Case No. HC 8222/ 16 pending against

the same accused was already listed for trial before him, a fact disclosed by the

learned judge.

On 15/03/2017, when Case No. 8222/ 16 was taken up, the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner made application to have this case heard before

another High Court Judge, on the basis that the presiding judge has been

Page 3 of 12

arrainged as the 3rd Respondent in Writ Application No. CAl89/20 17. The said

Writ Application was filed to challenge the mandate and proceedings in inquiry

bearing No. P.c.I. 549/2015 before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to

investigate and inquire into serious acts of fraud, corruption and abuse of

power, state resources and privileges, commonly known as the PRECIFAC, on

the basis that the Petitioner was, in/er alia, denied a fair hearing at the said

inquiry. The presiding judge was a member of the PRECIFAC. Having

considered the said application, the learned High Court Judge, on 15103/2017,

made order declining to hear the case and referred the case to High Court No. I

to be reallocated to be heard by another judge.

On 15106/2017, when Case No. 8570116 was mentioned before the same

judge, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner made the san1e application and

drew the attention of Court to the said Writ Application No. CAl89/20 17, and

sought a transfer of the case to be heard by another High Court Judge. The

learned High Court Judge having considered that notices had not been issued in

the said case bearing No. Writ Application No. 89/2017, refused the application

made by the Petitioner and declined to transfer the impugned case to be heard

by another judge and proceeded to fix the case for trial.

The application for the transfer of the impugned case from the presiding

judge to be heard by another judge is primarily based on two grounds, namely,

I. Hearing cases against the Petitioner during the pendency of case bearing

No. CAlWritl89/20 17, leads the Petitioner to reasonably apprehend that

Page 4 of 12

..

the learned High Court Judge is motivated by bias against the Petitioner

and/or extraneous considerations.

2. Comments made by the learned Judge in Case No. HC 8026/15 are

capable of depriving the Petitioner of having a completely independent

and an objective mind devoid of prejudice being brought to bear on the

merits and the demerits of the impugned case.

In support of the l SI contention, the learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner submits that the sudden and unexpected change of mind by the

learned judge to decline the application to transfer the impugned case to be

heard before another judge gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias on

the part of the trial judge. The sudden and unexpected change of mind is

attributed by the Petitioner to the decision of the trial judge to decline to

transfer the impugned case to be heard before another judge, after having

already decided to transfer case bearing No. HC 8222116 against the same

accused on the ground that the learned judge was a member of the PRECIF AC,

which is common to both cases.

In case bearing No. 8222116, in advance of the hearing, the learned ,

judge was alerted to the pendency of the said Writ application by the Petitioner

and an objection was raised by the Petitioner. On ascertaining the facts

submitted by the respective counsel, the learned judge recused himself from the

case.

Impartiality of a tribunal was considered in Locabail (UK) Ltd. v.

Bayfield Properties Ltd: (2000) Q.B. 451 , CA (Civ. Div.), where it was held

Page 5 of 12

.'

that "--- if, before he begins, the judge is alerted 10 some mailer that might,

depending on the fiill facts throw doubt on his fitness to sit, he should inquire

into the fiill facts, so far as (hey are ascertainable, and make appropriate

disclosure. If (he mailer only emerges during the hearing, he is obliged to

disclose what he then knows. He is not bound to fill gaps in his knowledge,

which if filled might provide stronger grounds for objection, but if he does

make further inquiry and discovers filrther relevant facts, he is bound to

disclose them. However, it is generally undesirable that hearings be aborted

unless the reality or appearance of justice require such a step. "

When the impugned case was mentioned before the learned judge on

15/06/2017 against the same accused, the learned judge in the course of the

application for transfer of the said case to be heard by another judge, inquired

from the counsel regarding the present position of the writ application in order

to ascertain whether notices were issued on the Respondents. Since the answer

was in the negative, the learned judge proceeded to fix the case for trial.

Therefore, the learned judge made the said order from facts which could have

been ascertained at the time he made the decision. In his order he further states

that in the event notices are issued in the said case, a further application can be

considered.

The pending writ application in this Court is the only reason given by

the Petitioner to "reasonably apprehend" that the learned judge is motivated by

bias and/or extraneous considerations against the Petitioner. "--- personal

Page 6 of 12

imparliality of the judge is presumed, until there is proof 10 the contrary".

(Castillo Algar v. Spain, 30 E.H.R.R. 826)

[n Re. Medicaments and Related Classes of Goods (No.2) (200 I)

WLR 700, CA (Civ. Div.), the Court of Appeal of England considered the

compatibility test of bias or apparent bias when raised as a ground of appeal

taking into consideration the jurisprudence set out by the European Court of

Human Rights in Incal v. Turkey E.H.R.R. 449 where it was held, inter alia, on

the question of impartiality "two tests are to be applied, the first of which

consists of trying to determine the personal conviction of a particular judge in a

given case. (the subjective approach) and the second in asserting whether the

judge offered guarantees sufficient to exclude any legitimate doubt in this

respect (the objective approach)

Tn applying the objective approach, the Court needs to be satisfied that

the Petitioner has a legitimate reason which is objectively justified.

The Petitioner in paragraphs 10, 11,44,45 and 46 in the writ application

marked P6(a), inter alia, states that,

"the PRECIFAC and the purported investigation and inquiry carried oul inter

alia against the Petitioner by the PRECIFAC as more fully pleaded hereinafter,

forms part of much larger mala fide politically motivated witch hunt against

the Petitioner as the brother and a strong supporter of the former President"

"that the above pleaded political back ground and patent political

victimi=ation has a material bearing on the subject molter of this application".

Page 7 of 12

The argument in support of the Petitioner is that the learned judge

having considered the above stated facts and circumstances considered it

appropriate to transfer case bearing No. HC 8222116 to be heard by another

judge, however declined to do so in the impugned case which was similarly

circumstanced. This argument in my view, does not hold ground for the simple

reason that the order to transfer case bearing No. HC 8222/ 16 was given taking

into consideration the ascertainable facts disclosed to Court at the time of

making such order. However, when the order in the impugned case was made

the learned judge made directions on the ascertained facts leaving the option to

revisit the issue when full facts were known.

In Incal v. Turkey, (supra), the Court went on to say that, "appearances

may be of certain imparlance; whal is al slake is Ihe confidence which the

courts in a democratic sociely must inspire in Ihe public and, above ali, as far

as criminal proceedings are concerned; in Ihe accused; in deciding whelher

there is legitim ale reason to fear thai a parlicular cOllrt lacks independence or

imparlialily, Ihe stand poinl of the accused is important wilhoul being decisive;

what is decisive is whether his doubts are objectively justified. "

This brings me to the 2nd ground urged by the Petitioner that the learned

Judge was motivated by bias against the Petitioner and/or extraneous

considerations, when he made certain comments which are more ' fully

described in paragraph 22 of the Petition which relates to the convicting and

sentencing the accused in case No. HC 8026115. It is contended that comments

made by the learned judge with regard to a certain 'political culture' prevalent

Page 8 of 12

during the previous administration, during which the Petitioner, inter alia, held

a Cabinet Portfolio, was influenced by an independent personal opinion formed

on the basis of extraneous considerations. Such statements, the Petitioner

states, are partisan views which will affect all those who were part of the said

previous administration. It has been said on high judicial authority that judges,

like Caesar's wife, should be above suspicion. (Leeson v. General Council of

Medical Education (1889) 43 Ch. D. 366 at p. 385, per Bowen L.1. There must

not even be the appearance of bias. (Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal (1852) 3

H.L.C.759.

At the outset, it is to be noted that comments alleged to have been made

by the learned judge are comments not made in the impugned case. In applying

the subjective test, as discussed earlier, there is a presumption that the Court

has acted impartially, which must be displaced by evidence to the contrary. In

applying the objective test, the question is whether a legitimate doubt as to the

impartiality of the tribunal can be 'objectively justified'.

In Porter v. Magill; Weeks v. Magill (2001) UKHL 67; (2002) 2A.C.

357, the House of Lords held that the test to be adopted was that put forward in

Re. Medicaments and Related Classes or Goods (supra),where "the court

should first ascertain all the relevant circumstances and then ask whether those

circumstances would lead a fair minded and informed observer to conclude

that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased". In Helow v.

Secretary of State for the Home Department (2008) UKHL 62; Lord Hope

Page 9 of 12

described a fair minded and informed observer as someone "who is neither

unduly sensitive nor suspicious"

The test that has often been applied by our courts is whether there is a

likelihood of bias. (Simon v. Commissioner of National Housing (1972) 75

NLR 471). [n Dr. Karunaratne v. Attorney General and another (1995) 2 SLR

298, answering the main contention of a reasonable apprehension of the

Petitioner that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had before the learned trial

judge, Gunersekera J. held, at page 302, "in regard to the application of the

test of reasonable suspicion of bias it must be shown that the suspicion is based

on reasonable grounds which would appeal to the reasonable right thinking

man, it can never be based on conjecture or on flimsy insubstantial grounds"

and further that "there must be material which shows a tendency to favour one

side unfairly at the expense of the other". [n Re R. Ratnagopal (1968) 70 NLR

409 (Supreme Court), T. S. Fernando J. stated, at page 435, that "The proper

test to be applied is, in my opinion, an objective one, and / would formulate it

somewhat on the following lines: Would a reasonable man, in all the

circumstances of the case, believe that there was a real likelihood of the

Commissioner being biased against him?" The Supreme Court went on to hold

that the allegations of bias are vague and unsubstantial. In Ratnagopal v. The

Attorney General ( 1969) 72 N.L.R. 145, at page lSI, the Privy Council agreed

with these views (the Privy Council set aside the judgment of the Supreme

Court on other grounds). There may be real likelihood of bias where there is,

for example. personal friendship or hostility, fami ly or other close relationship

Page 10 of 12

" with a party. (See De Sm ith, Judicial Review of Administrative Action 2nd

Edition, pages, 246-252)

In the performance of his judicial functions in case bearing No. HC

8026/ 15, which is unrelated to the impugned case, the learned High Court

Judge has made a finding that certain public servants act with impunity, a

comment based on the evidence in that case. Apart from that comment,

reference is also made to a certain "political culture" which prevailed at the

time, which is an opinion expressed by the learned judge in deciding the said

case. The Petitioner is aggrieved by the said comments by the learned judge,

citing bias towards him due to the Petitioner's close association with the

previous administration. The Petitioner in claiming that the reference to a

"certain political culture" as bias or considering extraneous considerations, has

failed to give reasons to objectively justify his concerns. The opinion expressed

in the course of a judicial finding, unrelated to the impugned case, in my view,

caIUlot be regarded as objectively justifying reasonable apprehension of bias on

the pat1 of the learned High Court Judge. It must be stated that when bias or

extraneous considerations are not established, impartiality towards the

Petitioner should be presumed.

"Views expressed by a judge in open courl in the pelformance of his judicial

jimclion, which were not graluilously oulspoken opinions or plainly oulside Ihe

scope oflhe proper performance of his dUlies, would nol give rise 10 a doubl as

10 a projessional judge 's abilily 10 perform his duties wilh an objective judicial

Page 11 of 12

, mind" (O'Neill v. I-1M Advocate (No.2); Lauchlan v. Same (2013) UKSC 36; 2

Cr.App.R.34)

The Petitioner has also not established, that by being a close associate of

the previous administration, the opinion expressed by the learned judge has

given rise to a doubt as to the judge's ability to perform his judicial duties.

Therefore, the Petitioner has failed to 'objectively justify' that the comments

expressed by the learned judge in that case have influenced him of bias or

extraneous considerations towards the Petitioner, when deciding on the

impugned case, as alleged by the Petitioner.

For all the reasons stated above, I refuse the application of the Petitioner

and dismiss the application without costs.

Petition dismissed without costs.
