Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner filed this Contempt of Court application against the

Respondents on 18th July 2018 alleging that the Respondents have failed to

implement the judgment delivered by this Court in CA (Writ) Application No.

177/2010. The Petitioner thereafter filed a motion on 15th November 2018

seeking to amend the caption by adding the aforestated party who is a Senior

State Counsel of the Attorney General's Department as the 13th Respondent.

The Hon. Attorney General, by way of a motion filed soon thereafter has

objected to the said application of the Petitioner, for the reasons set out

therein.

The aforementioned application of the Petitioner to add a Respondent was

taken up for support on 8th August 2019. On an inquiry made by this Court

prior to the matter being supported, the learned Additional Solicitor General

and the Petitioner informed this Court that neither party has any objection to

3

this matter being taken up before this Bench and an Order being made on the

said application.

A consideration of the present application of the Petitioner requires this Court

to examine the background circumstances that led to the filing of the original

contempt of Court application.

The Petitioner and three others had filed CA (Writ) Application No. 177/2010

complaining that the 8th - 12th Respondents to this application had carried out

unauthorized development of lands adjoining the Bolgoda Lake and had sought

inter alia the following relief against the Respondents:

(1) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 3rd Respondent, the Sri Lanka Land

Reclamation and Development Corporation to act under the provisions

of the Colombo District (Low lying area) Reclamation and Development

Board Act and to act forthwith against the unauthorized soil fillings in

the Bolgoda Lake system;

(2) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 4th Respondent, the Central

Environmental Authority to act under Section 24B of the National

Environmental Act No. 47 of 1980, as amended;

(3) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 5th Respondent, the Divisional

Secretary of Kesbewa to recover the State land under Section 65 of the

Irrigation Ordinance No. 32 of 1946, as amended, and under the

provisions of the State Lands Recovery of Possession Act.

4

-.

Having heard all parties, this Court, by its judgment delivered on 30th May 2014

issued the above relief directing the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents to implement

the above, not only with regard to the 8th -12th Respondents who are alleged

to have carried out the illegal development, but with regard to the entirety of

the Bolgoda Lake, which, needless to say, was a herculean task, given the

extent of the Lake.

It is the position of the Petitioner that the 15t - 6th Respondents initiated action

to comply with the said judgment of this Court and that 'after the re-surveying

was accomplished and the boundaries were identified to install the boundary

stones' by the Survey Department, a person named Bathiya Udumalagala had

filed CA (Writ) Application No. 53/2017 on 20th February 2017 challenging the

said re-surveying. On an application made by the parties that the subject

matter of the said applications are connected with the issue arising in this

application, the aforementioned Writ application as well as CA (Writ)

Application No. 125/2017 were taken up together with this application.

This Court has examined the petition filed in CA (Writ) Application No. 53/2017

and notes that the complaint of the petitioner was that the Survey Department

is utilising a plan prepared in 1888 in order to demarcate the boundaries of the

Bolgoda Lake and that utilising a plan that was over 100 years old is both

irrational and arbitrary as the physical characteristics of the Lake is likely to

have changed over the years and a demarcation of the boundaries based on

such an old plan would affect his property rights. The petitioner had also

submitted that there was an imminent threat of the boundaries being

physically demarcated by placing boundary stones on his property.

s

The said application had come up for support before this Court on 10th March

2017, for notice as well as for interim relief. The respondents had been

represented by the aforestated learned Senior State Counsel who is the party

that is now sought to be added by the Petitioner as the 13th Respondent. In

view of the interim relief that had been prayed for, an undertaking had been

given by the learned State Counsel (as she was then) that she would inform the

Respondents to endeavour to maintain the status quo till the date of support.

This Court does not see anything unusual in such an undertaking being given,

especially as it preserves the status quo until this Court goes into the matter

fully and takes a decision on whether notice and/or interim relief should be

issued. There exists in practice a necessary inference that the undertaking

given by the learned State Counsel was based on instructions received and the

consideration of such instructions.

By a letter dated 13th March 2017, annexed to the petition marked 'X17' the

said learned State Counsel, writing on behalf of the Hon. Attorney General had

informed the Legal Officers of the 4th Respondent, the Central Environmental

Authority and the Survey Department as follows:

@Q)rn~ ~~ @@CltD @~ ~oi~) OO."

This shows that the learned State Counsel has correctly conveyed to the

parties represented by her, the undertaking given by her to this Court.

The Petitioner has not sought to intervene in CA (Writ) Application No.

53/2017. Instead, the Petitioner filed this Contempt of Court application over a

year later on 18th July 2018 against the same persons who were Respondents

in CA (Writ) Application No. 177/2010. As observed earlier, it is the complaint

of the Petitioner that the Respondents have failed to implement the judgment

of this Court in CA (Writ) Application No. 177/2010 and that the failure to

comply with the said judgment tantamount to contempt of Court.

It is the position of the Petitioner that as a result of the aforementioned

undertaking given by the learned State Counsel, the surveying and re-

demarcation process initiated by the Respondents has been stalled after 13th

March 2017. Although not pleaded specifically, the Petitioner appears to be of

the view that the non-implementation of the judgment in CA (Writ) 177/2010

has arisen as a result of the said undertaking given by the learned State

Counsel. This is the basis of the Petitioner's application to add the learned

Senior State Counsel as a Respondent.

The question that this Court is called upon to consider is whether the

Petitioner has been able to satisfy this Court, on a prima facie basis, that the

learned Senior State Counsel acted in willful or contumacious disobedience of

the judgment of this Court, when she gave an undertaking to this Court, and by

the issuing of the letter marked 'X17'.

Article 105(3) of the Constitution states that the Supreme Court of the

Republic of Sri Lanka and the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Sri Lanka shall

each be a Superior Court of record and shall have all the powers of such Court

including the power to punish for contempt of itself, whether committed in the

court itself or elsewhere, with imprisonment or fine or both as the court may

deem fit.

The law of contempt as a whole is concerned with the upholding of the due

administration of justice, and perceptions the public ought to have regarding

Courts of law. It is obvious that disregard of a court order not only deprives the

other party of the benefit of that order, but also impairs the effective

administration of justice. The need for society to preserve the rule of law and

protect the rights of its citizens as well as those of the State lies at the heart of

cont empt.

In The Law of Contempt by Borrie and Lowe1 it has been stated as follows:

"Contempt can be divided into two broad categories, contempt by

interference and contempt by disobedience.

The former category comprises a wide range of matters such as disrupting

the court process itself (contempt in the face of the court), publications or

other acts which risk prejudicing or interfering with particular legal

proceedings, and publications or other acts which interfere with the

course of justice as a continuing process ...

1 3'd Edition; page 2.

8

:

:

The second category comprises disobeying court orders and breaking

undertakings given to the court."

Borrie and Lowe goes on to state that, "traditionally contempts have been

classified as being either criminal or civil. Under this scheme it can broadly be

said that interference contempt is seen as criminal contempt and disobedience

contempt as civil ... ,,2

The complaint that is before us with regard to the party sought to be added as

the 13th Respondent falls under the 'disobedience' category known as 'civil

contempt'.

A charge of contempt of Court is a very serious allegation to be made against a

person, and once this Court issues summons, such person is treated as an

'accused' and penal sanctions follow if this Court finds such person 'guilty' of

the cha rge. Hence, it is important that this Court exercises great caution prior

to issuing summons on any person accused of being in contempt of Court.

The caution that should be exercised prior to taking action for contempt is

reflected in the following passage from The Law of Contempt:

"Even if the contempt powers are sought to be invoked the courts will be

reluctant to exercise their powers and will do so only in the clearest cases,

namely, where an offender, having had proper notice of the order, has

been shown beyond all reasonable doubt to have committed the

, Ibid. page 3.

.'

.'

contempt. In most cases this will mean that the offender will have been

shown to have deliberately or willfully disobeyed the court order. 3

So far as English law is concerned it is established that the standard of

proof is that applicable to criminal cases, so that the breach must be

proved beyond all reasonable doubt."4

In Re Bramblevale Ltd.s, Lord Denning M.R. held as follows:

"A contempt of Court is an offence of a criminal character. A man may be

sent to prison for it. It must be satisfactorily proved. To use the time-

honoured phrase, it must be proved beyond all reasonable doubt."

This was followed in the case of Knight v Clifton6 where it was held as follows:

"Contempt of court, even of the type that consists in breach of an

injunction or undertaking, is something that may carry penal

consequences, even loss of liberty, and the evidence required to establish

it must be appropriately cogent."

The above dicta would become relevant only at the end of the inquiry.

However, when seeking to add a party, the person complaining of contempt

must make out a prima facie case, which justifies subjecting another to the

rigorous process involved in an inquiry into contempt.

,"

In the case of Upali Dharmasiri Welaratne vs. Wesley Jayaraj Moses7, Justice

Marsoof laid down the following as being the required elements for a finding

of civil contempt:

"(1) the existence of an undertaking or order;

(2) knowledge of the undertaking or order;

(3) ability to comply with the undertaking or order; and

(4) willful or contumacious disobedience of the undertaking or order,"

In Arthur Reginald Perera v. The King,8 the Privy Council held that, "there must

be involved some "act done or writing published calculated to bring a Court or

a judge of the Court into contempt or to lower his authority" or something

"calculated to obst ruct or interfere with the due course of justice or the lawful

process of the CourtS.,,9

Thus, it would be seen that the 'intention' to insult or bring Courts and the

system of administration of justice into disrepute in the eyes of the public is a

cornerstone of Contempt of Court.

As observed earlier, the complaint of the petitioner in CA (Writ) Application

53/2017 was that utilising a survey plan that was over 100 years old is both

irrat ional and arbitrary as the physical characteristics of the Lake is likely to

.

have changed over the years and a demarcation of the boundaries based on

such an old plan would affect his property rights. The fact that this Court

issued formal notice on the respondents in that case demonstrates that this

Court was in fact satisfied that there was a matter to be looked into. This Court

is also mindful that the judgment in CA (Writ) Application No. 177/2010 did not

specify that the demarcations be carried out according to a particular survey

plan and that it was open to the authorities to decide on this issue. In doing so,

there would be objections by the parties who are affected and it is the right of

such parties who are affected by the conduct of public authorities to seek the

protection of our legal system. Just as much as the Petitioner has, in the public

interest, the right to seek recourse to the legal system in order to protect the

environment, the land owners have the right to protect their property rights.

This Court cannot t urn a blind eye when such a complaint is made, and use as a

shield t he aforementioned judgment in CA (Writ) Application No. 177/2010

when t he judgment itself is silent with regard to the procedure that should be

adopted in carrying out t he surveys and re-demarcations of the boundaries.

In the above circumstances, can it be said that there been a willful or

contumacious disobedience of the judgment of this Court on the part of the

learned Senior State Counsel? This Court thinks not, especially in view of the

last paragraph of 'X17', where the learned Senior State Counsel has specifically

requested the recipients of the letter to inform her of the following: u~ t6l

ern:e>t~() ~ !5l ISlJj@fSJ1 ~ ~ c.o~OO ~ @fSJ1 CN()~e>&lS

ettoS!5l J <!Ie>rn eJei)J @mrne> ~elle>!5l <!I@QoS <!I&l\ ~elle>J &l."

There is no material before this Court as to what transpired thereafter.

,.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner has failed

to make out a prima facie case that the conduct of the learned Senior State

Counsel is in willful or contumacious disobedience of the judgment of this

Court in CA (Writ) Application No. 177/2010 and for that reason, this Court

rejects the application made by the Petitioner seeking to amend the caption by

adding the learned Senior State Counsel as the 13th Respondent.

Taking into consideration the fact that the Petitioner has appeared in person

and that the Petitioner is purportedly acting in the public interest, this Court

makes no order with regard to costs.
