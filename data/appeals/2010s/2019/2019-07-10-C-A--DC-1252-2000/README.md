01. Plaintiff Respondent (Respondent) instituted this action in the District Court

of Mathugama against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants Appellants

(Appellants), seeking inter alia, declaration of title to the land more fully

described in the plaint, ejectment ofthe Appellants from the land, restoration

of possession and damages.

02. Appellants filing their answer prayed for dismissal of the plaint and 1 S\ 2nd

and 3 rd Appellants prayed for prescriptive title to lots 02, 01, and 03

respectively.

03. After trial the learned District Judge delivered the judgment in favour of the

Plaintiff and only the 1 st Appellant was granted the house he was occupying

with 40 perches of appurtenant land. Claims of 2nd and 3rd Appellants were

dismissed. Being aggrieved by the above judgment, the Appellants lodged

the instant appeal.

04. It is submitted on behalf of the Appellants that the evidence of the Court

commissioner in regard to the exclusive possession of the Appellants was

not considered by the learned District Judge. The respective lots being

possessed by the Appellants are separated from the lot 07 that is being

possessed by the Respondent by permanent boundaries.

05. It was also submitted that there was no basis for the learned District Judge to

give an extent of 40 perches of land appurtenant to the house of the 1 st

Appellant. When deciding on the prescription, the learned District Judge has

failed to take the age of the plantations. The learned District Judge has erred

when he rejected the claim of prescriptive possession by the 2nd Appellant on

3

lack of corroborative evidence when in fact his son has corroborated his

evidence, it is submitted.

06. Contention of the counsel for the Respondent is that the plea of prescription

is bad in law as per section 161 of the Land Development Ordinance. It is

submitted further that the Appellants have failed to prove that they possessed

the respective blocks of land adverse to the rights of the Respondent. Being

in mere possession for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive period

can not be considered as evidence of uninterrupted and adverse possession.

07. It is unchallenged evidence that the corpus is depicted in plan No. 780 of

licensed surveyor marked P3 and that the Respondent gained title to the

corpus as per the averments 02 and 03 of the plaint. It is also not disputed

that the Respondent was in possession oflot 07 at the time of the survey.

08. As submitted by the counsel for the Respondent, it is trite law that the

burden is on the party claiming prescription to prove that he possessed the

land adversely to the rights of the owner over a prescriptive period.

09. Once paper title of the Plaintiff is undisputed, his possession is presumed.

The burden is shifted to the Defendant to show that he had independent and

adverse possession in the form of prescription claimed by him. ( Leisa and

another V. Simon and another {2002J 1 Sri L.R.148.)

10. In case ofChelliah V. Wijenathan 54 N.L.R. 337 at 342 as per Gratiaen J.

"Where a party invokes the provisions of section 03 of the

Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of a adverse

claimant to immovable property the burden rests fairly and squarely

on him to establish the starting point of his or her acquisition of

prescriptive rights. '" "

4

11. The party claims prescriptive title has to prove that his possession was

adverse and independent to the Plaintiff. His occupation of the land has to be

with a manifest intention to hold the land against the claim of all others and

the possession has to be hostile or adverse to the rights of the true owner.

12. In the instant case the learned Trial Judge has clearly reasoned out as to why

he came to the conclusion that the Appellants have failed to prove their

prescriptive rights. Although there is evidence that the Appellants were in

possession of the respective lots, in evidence they have failed to establish a

starting point where they started possessing the land, hostile to the Plaintiff.

Mere possession for a prescriptive period will not suffice.

13. In his judgment the learned Trial Judge has separately considered the

evidence on prescriptive possession adduced on behalf of the Appellants 1, 2

and 3. The learned District Judge also has considered the age of the

plantations in considering the judgment.

14. Learned District Judge also has given good and sufficient reasons for

rejecting the evidence of the 1 st Appellant on prescriptive title on lot No. 02

of the plan P3, and the basis he decided to grant an extent of 40 perches of

land appurtenant to the house of the 1 st Appellant. He had said at page 10

(Page 199 of the brief) of his judgment, that although he found that the 1 st

appellant could not prove prescriptive title to the whole lot No.2, that the 1 st

Appellant had occupied the house there in since year 1981. Therefore, the

learned District Judge had reasonably decided to grant the 1 st Appellant an

extent of 40 perches of land appurtenant to the house. I see no reason to

interfere with the decision of the learned District Judge.

5

In the above premise I find that the instant appeal is without merit.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.

I agree.
