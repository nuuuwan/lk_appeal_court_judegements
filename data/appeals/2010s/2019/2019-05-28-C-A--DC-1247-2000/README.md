C,J. Ladduwahetti with Keerthi Sri Gunawardena for the Plaintifr Respondent

28.06.2018

T

he Plaintiff~ Respondent in this appeal (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the

Plaintiff") Munasinghe Arachchige Millie Mangalika presenting a plaint sought to

partition a land, to which she averred she had derived her title to a l/3rd share from one

Muthugal Pedige Obia by a deed marked P4 and dated 21.09.1980. Obia had transmitted

to the Plaintiff a 1/3rd share to the corpus from what she had got on two deeds namely

Deed marked as P3 of 27.04.1938 and the Deed marked as P2 of 15.12.1940. The pedigree

filed on behalf of the Plaintiff described a corpus that was originally owned by Babiya,

Gunaya and Setha.

Babiya, Gunaya and Setha had each l/3rd of the entire land. The corpus is known as

@l(5)OO~OO (Gorakagahawatte) and there is no dispute as to the interest flowing from

the shares of Gunaya and Setha. It is the 1/3rd share of original owner Babiya that has

given rise to this appeal.

According to the pedigree filed by the Plaintiff, Babiya's 1/3rd share had devolved on his

widow Kiththa and son Aviya alias Saima in equal shares. The devolution of the shares is

reflected in the following table:

(PLAINTIFF)

As the table No.1 indicates, Kiththa (the widow of Babiya) had transferred her l/6th share

by PI to Muthugal Pedige Gunaya who later transferred it to Obia by P2, and thereafter

Obia transferred a l/3rd share to Mangalika-the Plaintiff by P4. Obia was able to transfer

a l/3rd share to the Plaintiff in 1980 because by the year 1938 she had already got l/6th

share of A viya by P3.

In other words the 1/6th share which had devolved on the son Aviya was transferred by

Aviya by Deed No.11588 dated 27.04.1938 (P3) to Muthugal Pedige Obia, who upon this

transfer became entitled to l/3rd share of the corpus, which the original owner Babiya

had. Muthugal Pedige Obia thereafter by Deed No.2139 dated 21.09.1988 (P4) transferred

the l/3rd of this land to Munasinghe Arachchige Milinona-the Plaintiff in the case.

From the above narrative of devolution which is apparent upon the table above, one

could see that at the time of execution of the Deed No.11588 on 27.04.1938 (P3), it was

the paternal inheritance of Aviya which was transferred by that deed to Mutugal Pedige

Obia.

3

It has to be observed that the son of the original owner Babia, A viya did not get any

maternal inheritance from his mother Kiththa and he could not have had any such

maternal inheritance as Kiththa had already dealt with her 1/6th share by the deed

marked as PI in favour of Muthugal Pedige Gunaya.

Answer filed by 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants at page 34 of the Brief

In the joint answer dated 25.03.1996, the 3rd and 4th Defendant'Appellants along with the

2nd Defendant disputed the genuineness and authenticity of the deed marked as P3 by

which A viya had transferred his l/6th share to Muthugal Pedige Obia. It was pleaded at

paragraph 6.3 of the answer that that P3 bearing No.11588 and dated 27.04.1938 was

fraudulent. The devolution according to the joint answer can be graphically depicted as

follows.

As I said before, there is no dispute between the Appellants (the 3rd and 4th Defendants

in the case) and the Plaintiff,Respondent as to the devolution under Gunaya and Setha.

The nub of the matter revolves around two deeds namely P3 bearing No.11588 of

27.04.1938 and 3V3 bearing No.8433 of 20.01.1958. The Plaintiff, Millie Mangalika

produced P3, whilst the 3rd Defendant, Nuwan Priyantha produced 3V3.

4

The deeds PI, P2 and P4 which are all depicted in table No.1 above were not impugned

at all. It is P3 bearing No.11588 of 27.04.1938 that was disputed by the 2nd and 3rd

Defendant~Appellants when they filed their joint answer dated 25.03.1996 along with the

4th Defendant. In other words the 2nd and 3rd Defendant~Appellants disputed the

genuineness of P3 by which A viya had transferred his l/6th share to Muthugal Pedige

Obia in 1938.

In their joint answer dated 25.03.1996, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants further pleaded that

Aviya alias Saima transferred his share in the corpus to their father Muthugal Pedige

Santhiya by a Deed bearing No.8433 and dated 20.01.1958. In other words it was the

contention of these contesting Defendants that 30 years after A viya alias Saima had

executed P3 dated 27.04.1938, he chose to transfer by 3V3 of 20.01.1958 his rights in the

land to their father Santhiya. Santhiya later transferred that interest to Priyantha~the 3rd

Defendant~Appellant by 3V4.

So, whilst the 3rd Defendant~ Appellant traced his rights in the land to A viya alias Saima

through 3V3 and 3V4, the Plaintiff too claimed her title to the l/3rd share of the land

through the same source A viya alias Saima through P3. Her claim was that P3 and P4

combined together to give her 1/3rd share of the corpus~vide Table No.1. In fact the learned

District Judge of Gampaha has indeed allotted this share to the Plaintiff.

Therefore the crux of the dispute was between P3 dated 27.04.1938 and 3V3 dated

20.01.1958. At the trial, the 3rd and 4th Defendant~Appellants raised an issue to the effect

that P3 the Deed bearing No.11588 of 27.04.1938 was not the act and deed of Aviya.

Moreover, in the same issue, they claimed that P3 was forged and fraudulent.

The learned District Judge of Gampaha has answered this issue against the 3rd and 4th

Defendant~Appellants and has accepted P3 that transmitted Aviya's right to Obia who,

with this transmission, became entitled to 1/3rd of the corpus. This l/3rd share finally went

to the Plaintiff. A perusal of Table No.1 will bring this out more saliently.

5

The argument at the appeal focused on the burden of proof with regard to P3 which

Aviya alias Saima had executed on 27.04.1938. This deed was indeed impeached by the 3rd

and 4th Defendant~Appellants in their joint answer, issues and the trial.

The contention was advanced on behalf of the 3rd and 4thDefendant~Appellants that

when the Plaintiff produced P3 in the course of her examination in chief, they raised the

objection "subject to proof' and in light of the issue that they had raised in relation to the

deed which they alleged to be fraudulent, the burden lay on the Plaintiff to have

established the due execution of the deed.

It was also argued that the objection "subject to proof' was raised twice over~once when

the deed was produced by the Plaintiff and secondly when the Plaintiff closed his case~

see Sri Lanka Ports Authority v. Jugolinija (1981) 1 Sri.LR 18. In the circumstances it was

contended that it behoved the Plaintiff to have proved that P3 was genuine. In support of

his argument, Mr. Sandamal Rajapaksha the learned Counsel for the 3rd and 4th

Defendant~Appellants cited the case of Francis Samarawickrema v. HildaJayasinghe

and Another SC Appeal No. 7/2004, which has been reported sub nom F.

Samarawickrema v.Jayasinghe and another 2009 B.LR 85. This case was cited to drive

home the argument that when the Plaintiff relies on a deed to stake a claim to a land but

the Defendant alleges it to be a forgery, the due execution of the deed must be duly

established in terms of the law.

What Saleem Marsoof, J. PC encountered in the above case was a rei vindicatio action that

had originated in the District Court of Kalutara and the learned Judge begins his

illuminating judgment by describing the appeal before the Supreme Court as a sequel to

the decision of the Court of Appeal of Sri Lanka dated 03.05.1982 in c.A. Appeal

No.469/78 (F) and reported as HildaJayasinghe v. Francis Samarawickrema (1982) 1

SrLLR 249. In this case which traversed a labyrinthine path in both the Court of Appeal

and the Supreme Court, the case of the Defendant~Appellants was that the Notary

fraudulently obtained their signatures (and thumb impression) on blank papers which

6

were subsequently filled up in the form of a deed of sale; that no consideration passed

and that the two attesting witnesses were not present at the time of the execution.

The recurrent issues in the first and second appeals ((1982) 1 SrLLR 249 which led to SC

sequel reported in 2009 B.L.R 85) were whether there was a due execution of a deed

relied upon for title vis-iI-vis the allegation of fraud alleged against the notary. If one

carefully goes through the SC judgment reported in 2009 B.L.R 85, one would observe

that Saleem Marsoof, J. (with whom S.N. Silva, P.C, CJ and Shiranee Tilakawardane, J.

agreed) proceeds to answer two questions that oftentimes come to the fore in rei

vindicatio actions. Who bears the respective burdens of proof in these cases when one

party relies on a deed for title and the other party goes to impeach the deed as fraudulent

and fictitious? As for due execution the learned District Judge held that Section 101 of the

Evidence Ordinance deals with burden of proof in cases, and lays down that whoever

desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent upon the

existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. In other words the

legal burden of proving all facts essential to his claim would rest upon the plaintiff in a

civil suit or the prosecutor in criminal proceedings. As for the burden of proof on the

question of fraud, Marsoof, J. cited the judgment of Subramaniam v. Thanarase 61

N.L.R 355 and the commentary of E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy on the case in his treatise The

Law of Evidence VoLlI, Book 1 page 259 and proceeded to hold that the burden would be on

the Defendant.

I was confronted with the selfsame questions in Dhanawathie v. Nandasena (2016) 1

SrLLR 18-an appeal that came on from the District Court of Balapitiya and I would

respectfully record that what appeared to me to be the law on these two questions had

appeared to be the same to Marsoof, J.

In Dhanawathie v. Nandasena (supra), I had occasion to consider the burden of proof in

regard to an argument of fraudulent disposition raised by the defendant in the case. The

question that arose in the appeal was as to who bears the burden when fraud is alleged

by the defendants. The vital issue-Issue No.4 put in by the defendant in that case was-

Was the deed bearing No.33504 fraudulently executed?

7

I pointed out that Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance is premised on the Latin tag~"Ei

qui affirmat 'non ei qui negat, incumbit probatio-the proof lies upon him who

affirms, not upon him who denies. It is expressed in the commonplace dictum~one who

asserts must prove.

Section 101 places the legal burden of proof on the party who asserts the existence of any

fact in issue or relevant fact. Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance obligates a party

seeking judgment in the suit to prove his case. He has to prove it to the standard required

as defined in Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance. In a civil case it would be on a balance

of probabilities ~for a classic exposition of "balance of probabilities", see per Denning, J. in

Miller v. Minister of Pension (1947) 2 All ER 372.

Having thus posited the burden of proof on the Plaintiff to establish due execution of the

deed by the mode insisted upon in terms of Section 68 of Evidence Ordinance, I went on

to hold that the burden of proof of fraud is upon the Defendant who raises it in the trial. I

would recall what I said in that context.

"When a Defendant takes up a defence such as forgery or fraud, Section 101 of the Evidence

Ordinance will equally apply to him because the Defendant, just as much as the Plaintiff, has to

establish his pleaded case. Since the Defendant has taken up a defence of forgery of his Signature on

the deed bearing No.33504, which is in the form of an avoidance of the claim, the Defendant would

bear the "burden to prove his case" ifhe were to succeed ... "

Needless to say, in the present case, the contesting Defendant~Appellants did purport to

impeach the deed P3 on the ground of fraud, whilst the Plaintiff~Respondent rested her

case on the validity of P3~a deed which had been executed as far back as 1938.

Having regard to the interplay of the respective burdens on the part of the Plaintiff and

Defendant to prove due execution of a deed and fraud in its execution, it is commonplace

that these obligations are often encountered by parties in rei vindicatio actions and they

are distributed among parties because of specific provisions found in the Evidence

Ordinance namely Sections 68, 101 and 103.

8

But a mere assertion of fraud in the pleadings or issues will not suffice. In the case before

me, the identity of the person whose act is alleged or tainted as fraudulent is scarcely

apparent upon the pleadings or evidence. How did any specific act of fraud which is

attributed to anyone in particular vitiate the deed of 1938? I find no credible evidence of

fraud proved against anyone and I see no reason to disturb the answer to the issue of

fraud given in the case even though the learned District Judge has not indulged in an

incisive analysis of the question of fraud. If the answer to an issue is supportable having

regard to the material on record, a mere want of discussion on the evidence surrounding

the issue is not per se a ground to vitiate the judgment in appeal.

In any event my next discussion on Section 68 of the Partition Law No.21 of 1977 will

show that the impugned deed P3 remains proved by operation of law. I would however

proceed to state on the question of fraud that whoever asserts the fact of fraud must

establish the fact and Sections 101 and 103 of the Evidence Ordinance would place the

legal burden of proving fraud on the Defendant, because it is him who has put it in issue.

The above account is certainly true for rei vindicatio actions as well as for partition suits.

But on the facts and circumstances of the case before me, the Defendant~Appellants have

failed to establish fraud and as it would be abundantly clear upon the evidence given by

the 3rd Defendant~Appellant alone, it is the due execution of Deed P3 that has been

established rather than the allegation of fraud. In any event it was only after a lapse of 58

years after its execution that the deed of 1938 (P3) was first challenged as fraudulent in

the answer filed on 25.03.1996 and the case of Ranasinghe v. De Silva 78 N.LR 500

would bar even a collateral attack on the deed.

"An action for a declaration that a notarially executed deed is null and void is preSCribed within 3

years of the date of execution of the deed in terms of Section 10 of the Prescription Ordinance" ,

Wimalaratne, J. with Sirimanne, J. and Gunasekara, J. agreeing.

In view of Section 68 of the Partition Law No.2l of 1977, the due execution of the deed

(P3) is almost a given and I would now advert to that provision.

9

Due execution in Partition suits

In Sri Lanka there are various special statutes under which rules of evidence are provided

for specific matters, and the special provisions prevail over the general provisions of the

Evidence Ordinance, in case of any inconsistency~Genera lia specialibus non derogant. Thus

for partition suits, Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance has not been fully transported

as such into the Partition Law No.21 of 1977 and it is Section 68 of Partition Law No.21 of

1977 that governs the question of due execution in partition cases.

In order to buttress the argument that within its parameters Section 68 of Partition Law

No.21 of 1977 prevails over Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance, Salam, J. referred to

two maxims in Wimalawathie v. Hemawathie and Others (2009) 1 Sri.LR 95 at p.99

namely Lex posterior derogate priori and leges posteriors priores contrarias abrogant~later laws

repeal earlier laws inconsistent therewith in order

The earlier Act (Sec.68 of the Evidence Ordinance) must give way to a later enactment

(Sec.68 of the Partition Law No.2111977).

Section 68 of Partition Law No.21 of 1977 enacts:

"It shall not be necessary in any proceedings under this Law to adduce formal proof of the

execution of any deed which, on the face of it purports to have been duly executed, unless the

genuineness of that deed is impeached by a party claiming adversely to the party prodUcing that

deed, or unless the court requires such proof"

There is a relaxation of the necessity to prove the due execution of a deed, provided it is

apparent on the face of it that it has been duly executed. In two situations formal proof

has to be established. Firsdy the genuineness of that deed must be impeached by a party

claiming adversely to it or the court must require such proof. In the instant appeal the

deed P3 has been on the face of it duly executed by A viya alias Saima before a notary and

two witnesses and the same has been duly registered. The Court has not seen it fit to

require proof of execution of the deed but the Defendants proceeded to impeach its

genuineness in the statement of claim, issues and the trial. In such a situation the proper

10

question to pose in terms of Section 68 is-Does the 3rd Defendant claim adversely to the

Plaintiff who produced P3?

As Mr. Champaka Ladduwahetty rightly pointed out, the 3rd Defendant who holds 3V3

is not a party claiming adversely to the Plaintiff who produced P3, because the deed 3V3

from which the 3rd Defendant claimed his rights does not deal with the same rights

already dealt with by the deed P3, 20 years earlier. By the deed P3 which was executed

in 1938, A viya alias Saima transferred his paternal rights to Obia. By the deed 3V3, which

was executed in 1958, Aviya is said to have transferred his maternal inheritance to

Santhiya-the father of the 3rd Defendant. Whilst P3 transferred paternal inheritance, 3V3

transmitted maternal inheritance. In other words P3 and 3V3 are not competing deeds

and therefore 3V3 cannot claim anything adverse to P3. In the circumstances the 2nd

limb of Section 68 of the Partition Law, No.21 of 1977 namely the genuineness of the deed

must be impeached by a party claiming adversely to it does not apply in this case and one

cannot then argue that deed P3 has not been proved. On the contrary, in light of Section

68 of the Partition Law No.21 of 1977, this deed must be deemed to have been proved.

In fact Kittha (the mother of A viya) had long disposed of her rights by PI of 09.02.1925 to

Gunaya and if at all, it is with this deed of 1925 that the deed 3V3 would actually

compete. P2 and P4 too transferred what would have been the maternal inheritance of

A viya and 3V3 could be said to compete with those deeds too as they dealt with the

same subject-matter-maternal inheritance. The mother Kiththa had disposed of her

inheritance by PI in 1925 and the son A viya could not have had any maternal inheritance

to transmit in 1958. It is noteworthy that Aviya could not have transferred what he says

he had transferred in 3V3 when his mother had already dealt with her entire rights in

1925.

A perusal of deed 3V3 really shows that what had been purported to be transferred were

not the rights transferred by P3 but different rights.

It is interesting to note that the deed 3V3 by which A viya alias Sima had sold his

maternal inheritance in 1958, says ''rnrn)Gles5 l c cn;",C) C) ~~"(at page 113). It

is also interesting to note that the bottom line of the schedule referred to in the above

11

~" .

Therefore it is abundantly clear that what A viya alias Sima had transferred in 1958 is not

the lJ6th share he inherited from his father, but whatever he would have inherited from

his mother Kiththa upon her death. It is significant to note that the clear lJ6th share given

in 1938 by deed P3 is missing in subsequent deed 3V3. What has been dealt with is

whatever share he would have been inherited upon his mother's death. Therefore the

deed 3V3 must be interpreted holistically and the words "o~@ 60 ~O~>C)@(s)eD

B)l;~ ~K) dS)rn 6rnrn(s)eD E) CClcoC) C) crt3~ ) e:eeD O~E) ey~

e>~eD" taken together with the words in the schedule "@5)0) en Q~)O ~~~>O C)

Cfl;o) Sco@ ~)S~", clearly shows that what A viya alias Sima had transferred was

not the rights that he had transferred by way of deed P3 20 years earlier.

In the circumstances the fact remains that P3 of 1938 could not be impeached and it

remains proven by virtue of Section 68 of the Partition Law.

The proof of P3, apart from Section 68 of the Partition Law, also emerges from the

evidence given by the 3rd Defendant himself. The 3rd Defendant was the only witness who

gave evidence on behalf of the contesting Defendants at page 54, wherein he states that

he did not search the Land Registry before the purchase of rights on deed 3V3.

It is also interesting to note that in cross-examination the 3rd Defendant admitted that

that Obia had transferred all the rights that he had in the land, by deed P4, to the

Plaintiff. In other words the 3rd Defendant speCifically admitted that Deed P4 had

transmitted lJ3rd of the corpus to the Plaintiff. This deed P4 included the rights sold by

A viya by deed P3. On the evidence of the 3rd Defendant, there is then the admission that

the deed P3 was valid and effectual-vide page 59 of the appeal brief.

I am therefore perforce impelled to accept the submission advanced on behalf of the

Plaintiff-Respondent that the contesting Appellants did accept that the rights

transferred by Aviya in 1938 went to the Plaintiff.

12

It has to be noted that Obia had acted upon the impugned deed from the time it

conveyed her rights. Noteworthy is the question at page 58 where it was specifically put

to the 3rd Defendant-Appellant whether Obia possessed the rights he had purchased

upon P3 from 1938 to 1980. This specific question has been answered in the affirmative

by the 3rdDefendant-Appellant. In other words the 3rd Defendant-Appellant has admitted

that Obia had been in possession of his rights that accrued to him in 1938 by way of the

deed P3. Needless to say it is the case of the Appellants that deed P3 had been acted

upon by the predecessor in title of the Plaintiff.

Thus due execution of P3 has been established and there is no established fraud that

vitiates this deed. Before I part with this judgment, I must say that Section 90 of the

Evidence Ordinance too raises the presumption that deed bearing No.11588 of 27.04.1938

(P3) has been duly executed.

Presumption as to documents thirty years old-Section 90

It is pertinent to observe that the presumption with regard to deeds which are over 30

years old would also apply in this case. This deed was attested in 1938 and duly

registered, long years ago. It was produced from the custody of the Plaintiff. The

illustration (a) to the Section 90 of the Evidence Ordinance clearly states that if the

Plaintiff has been in the possession of the land and if the deed relating to the land is

produced from his custody, the production of the deed is from proper custody.

The principle underlying Section 90 is that if a document, 30 years old or more, is

produced from proper custody and is, on its face, free from suspicion, the court may

presume that it has been signed or written by a person whose signatures it bears or in

whose handwriting it purports to be. The ground of the rule is the great difficulty,

indeed in many cases, the impossibility of proving the handwriting, execution and

attestation of documents in the ordinary way after a lapse of many years.

Another ground is the circumstances of age, or long existence of the document, together

with its place of custody, its unsuspicious appearance, and perhaps other circumstances,

suffice, in combination, as evidence to be submitted to Court.

13

Proof of custody is required as a condition of admissibility to afford the court reasonable

assurance of the genuineness of the document as being what it purports to be.

Section 90 does away, ordinarily, with the necessity of proving those documents, for

documents 30 years old are said to prove themselves, that is, no witnesses need, unless

the court so requires, be called to prove their execution or attestation.

This section does away with the strict rules of proof enforceable in the case of private

documents by giving rise to a presumption of genuineness with regard to documents

more than 30 years old.

On the strength of the evidence in the case the presumption in Section 90 may properly

been drawn and the burden would then shift to the opposite party to show that it is a

fraud on the registration, that deed is illegal, void and not acted upon. No such rebuttal

of the presumption has occurred in the case.

In effect Section 90 of the Evidence Ordinance is worded in general terms as it is

designed to meet situations varying in character, where passage of time might have

obliterated the proof of the genuineness of any disputed document.

In the end I would conclude that the learned District Judge of Gampaha reached the

correct decision by placing reliance on P3 and allotting the 1I3rd of the corpus to the

Plaintiff and this deed remains proven by various methods that I have enumerated above.

In the circumstances I affirm the judgment of the District Court of Gampaha dated

17.11.2000 and proceed to dismiss the appeal.
