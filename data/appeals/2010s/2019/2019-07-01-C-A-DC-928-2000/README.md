SUBSTITUTED~PLAINTIFF~ RESPONDENTS

A.H.M.D. Nawaz,J .

Rohan Sahabandu P.C ~th Hasitha Amerasinghe for the Defendant~ Appellant

Respondent abs~nt and unrepresented

03.09.2018

, The Plaintiff Respondent instituted this action in November 1997 claiming a sum

of Rs 200,000 as damages payable to him out of an accident which involved the

Defendant Appellant. Th~ plaint averred that on or about 22.12.1995, around 5

AM, when the Plaintiff was crossing the road, the Defendant Appellant riding a

bicycle negligently without lights and recklessly collided with him causing

damage. The defendant in his answer, whilst controverting the matters raised,

'I

,

i. :

specifically stated that or this particular day and ~t that particular time, he was

not involved in any accident with the Plaintiff.

The trial began with se':en issues and it has to be noted that the Defendant

Appellant raised no issues. One Dr Alwis gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff

and produced medical reports pertaining to the Plamtiff. However the fact

remains that he was not the doctor who treated the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff did

not give evidence but led;:~vidence of his daughter in la,v and a police officer and

thereafter the Plaintiff closed her case leading in evidence documents PI,P6. The

defendant did not give evidence.

The learned District Judge of Avissawdla pronounced Judgement on 20.10.2000

and held in favour of the Plaintiff granting her damagf:' in a sum of Rs 100, 000.

The learned President's c: !JJnsel for the Defendant,ApF'2llant submitted that the

witness for the plaintiff s ~ated that her mother in law \vas not crossing the road

at that time, but was sunding on the edge of the read. The learned counsel

pointed out that the pbnt stated that whilst she w.ts crossing the road, the

defendant's push bicyclE ;;truck her. He argued therefore that what the witness

stated in court was fals( This material contradictior i has not been taken into

consideration by the le,-~ ned District Judge,so argued the leal:ned President's

I Counsel. The witness ha,t not given a statement to tb police and according to

her evidence, she had not seen the accident, but had ody seen the cyclist and the

cycle on top of her mother in law.

As far as the police testin \my was concerned, he was not the man who recorded

the statement. There wa ,'10 evidence recorded whether in fact the push cycle

n had lights on it.

The learned President's Counsel further submitted thot there Wa3110 evidence of

negligence or having ridden the bicycle recklessly. In such circumstances, he

argued the learned Distrht Judge could not have given judgement in favour of the

plaintiff.

As for compensation, t;: learned President's Cour:sel submitted that the

compensation awarded lamely Rs 100, was excessive. The learned President's

Counsel further submit:::d that the learned District Judge has not given any

reasons as to why he wa! awarding such an excessive :ompensation. There is a

lack of computation of tIt ~ quantum and therefore he al gued that the decision of

the learned District Judgt must be set aside.

The Plaintiff was 80 yeac )~)f age when this accident ol.curred. Even though the

Plaintiff did not give evidt Lice, there was an eyewitness account narrated to court

and the witness was givir g direct evidence of what she ;;aw, heard and observed.

rhe absence of the Plail) -.iff from the witness stand (bes not detract from the

~"'urden of proof which is the civil standard of a prepo~:" rlerance of evidence. The

evidence need not ema( ~!te from the Plaintiff. Sect on 134 of the Evidence

Ordinance clearly lays do ;/)1 that no particular number of witnesses is needed to , , prove a fact in issue. In:}f: case of MaDawa v State "f Madhya Pradesh AIR

1976 S.C 989 it was held :hat evidence has to be weigh,~d, but not counted. The

question before Court w ,s whether there was a breach of duty of care owed to

the users of the road. W:1ether one walks on the cro.:;:sing or stands as a mute

bystander, a duty of care is owed to them by riders of vehicles and when there is

a breach of duty of care, .f egligence ensues.

"

Though the Plaintiff did 1 ;)t give evidence, the eye witness clearly stated that she

saw the cycle and the (yclist on top of her mother in law. The cyclist was

identified as the Defenda.lt Appellant. If a cyclist veers off the road and strikes a

bystander who was mutdy standing on the age of the road, this is a case of res

ipsa loquitur and the defendant owed an explanation to Court. This was not

, forthcoming and thereforethis raises a prima facie case of negligence. The item of

evidence, though presumptive, turns conclusive when there is no explanation to

rebut the prima facie case uf negligence. So I would not, fault the learned District

Judge of Avissawella for fn-:ding negligence against the defendant.

The doctor gave evidence as to the injuries sustained a~ld the treatment given to

the plaintiff and even though there was no computation of the quantum, the trier

of facts is not precluded from awarding a victim of (J road accident damages

which he thinks is reasonable. The absence of a mathematical computation of

quantum does not vitiate the judgement and in my view an award of Rs 100, 000

was fair and reasonable h~ving regard to injuries and pain of mind caused to an

80 year old lady.

So I would affirm the judgment dated 20.10.2000 and dismiss the appeal.
