and 10 Others.

Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Upul Ranjan Hewage for the Petitioner.

Respondents.

Decided on: 26.02.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking a writ of certiorari to

quash the decision X23/X27 whereby the 1st respondent-

Commissioner General of Excise refused to issue liquor licences

under the categories of F/L 7 and 8 for the Talawakele Rest

House in the name of the petitioner; and to compel the

Commissioner General of Excise by a writ of mandamus to issue

the said licences for the year 2016.

It is common ground that the old Talawakele Rest House was

demolished in 2007 as it was situated in the catchment area1

relevant to the Upper Kotmale Hydropower Project, and until

such time a liquor licence had been issued to the said Rest

House.

After 7 years, in the year 2014, the new Talawakele Rest House

had been built, quite obviously, not in the same place, but, as

the petitioner himself has admitted in X24, in a different place

although it seems to be closer to the old place. No evidence has

been placed by either party regarding the actual distance

between the two places.

By the Agreement to Lease marked X6 dated 18.11.2014 (which

is not an Agreement of Lease), the Talawakele-Lindula Urban

Council has agreed to lease out the Rest House for a period of 7

years to the petitioner.

By clause 2(d) of the said Agreement to Lease, the Urban

Council has allowed the petitioner to take steps to obtain the

1 Vide X14, X15

liquor licence to the new Rest House. It is relevant to note that

the old liquor licence was never in the name of the petitioner,

and the old licence had been issued in the category of F/L 12

(not 7 or 8).

There is no dispute that the Rules published in the Gazette No.

1544/17 dated 10.04.2008 marked X8 and cited as Excise

Notification No.902 are applicable in issuing liquor licences by

the Commissioner General of Excise.

Guidelines and Conditions No.1 thereof says that there is no

automatic renewal of licences; and the licensee, fifteen days

prior to the expiry of the existing licence, shall make an

application to the Commissioner General of Excise; and the

Commissioner General of Excise shall consider the issuance of

licences in terms of the Guidelines and Conditions contained in

the said Gazette and any other directions as stipulated in the

Excise Ordinance.

Condition No. 20(c) of the said Gazette is that: The location of

premises for operation of licences in respect of sale of liquor off the

premises should be 100 meters away from schools and places of

public religious worship and in respect of licences for selling liquor

for consumption within the premises should be 500 meters away

from schools and places of public religious worship.

However condition 20(c) further says that in respect of the

existing licences a relaxation of distance can be considered

provided there are no objections by the public.

The petitioner has tendered only a copy of the application for

liquor licence sent for the year 2015 marked X9. That

application is for liquor licence in the category of F/L 12. But

the petitioners reliefs are in respect of liquor licences in the

categories of F/L 7 and F/L 8 for the year 2016. The petitioner

has not tendered copies of those two applications, but only

tendered two receipts issued to obtain the applications for F/L 7

and F/L 8. It appears to me that, the petitioner purposely did

not produce those to applications because the contents of them

are unfavourable to him. Why I say so is that the contents of X9

for the category of F/L 12 are unfavourable to him. In X9, the

petitioner has clearly admitted that the last year which the

licence had been issued was 2007, and within 500 radius there

are a Kovil, Church, School and Hindu Temple. That means,

Condition 20(c) is not satisfied and also no relaxation can be

made as there is no existing licence as the last licence had been

issued to the old Rest House in 2007.

This is supported by X16 dated 16.03.2016 whereby the Sri

Lanka Tourism Development Authority has written to the

Commissioner General of Excise recommending the issuance of

liquor licences in the name of the petitioner only up to

31.12.2016 subject to the rules/regulations/terms and

conditions of the Department of Excise. It further says: Please

note the distances from the establishment: (1) Kathireson Kovil

161m (2) Church 246m, Primary (Sinhala) School 315m, Hindu

Temple 358m.

Then it is abundantly clear that in terms of condition 20(c), the

Commissioner General of Excise could not have issued the

5

licences applied for, and also that, no relaxation of the distance

could have been considered as there was no existing licences in

operation when the two applications (which are not before Court)

for F/L 7 and F/L 8 were tendered by the petitioner. I might

also add that the old licence expired last in the year 2007 was

for F/L 12 and not for F/L 7 and/or F/L 8.

From the above it is abundantly clear that the refusal by the

Commissioner General of Excise to issue two new licences in the

categories of F/L 7 and F/L 8 was not at all ultra vires or

unreasonable.

No legitimate expectation can be based on X12 whereby the

Commissioner General of Excise whilst rejecting the application

of the petitioner merely stating that he could consider issuance

of the licence provided the petitioner obtains the approval of the

Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. I have already

discussed the alleged approval of the said Authority contained in

X16, which, in my view, is not favourable to the petitioner. The

decided authorities cited by the learned counsel for the

petitioner on legitimate expectation and issuance of liquor

licences2 are distinguishable in many a respect including the

fact that the petitioners in those cases were existing licence

holders whereas it is not so in the case at hand.

In view of the above clear facts, I think there is no necessity to

consider the other objections taken up by the learned senior

state counsel appearing for the respondents.
