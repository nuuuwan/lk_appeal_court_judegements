Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up on th June 2019, the learned President's

Counsel for the Petitioners and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

Respondents moved that this Court pronounce its judgment on the written

submissions that have been tendered on behalf of the parties.

The issue that arises in this application is whether the Petitioners should be

placed on the Salary Code MN-1-2006 as decided by the Respondents or on the

Salary Code MT-2-2006 as argued by the Petitioners.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The 1st -4 th Petitioners are Agricultural Overseers employed by the

Department of Prisons. The 5th and 6th Petitioners had joined the Department

of Prisons as Agricultural Overseers and pursuant to the promotions received

by them to the post of Agricultural Instructors on 15th April 1997, were holding

the said post of Agricultural Instructor at the time this application was filed in

2006.

According to the Scheme of Recruitment for the post of Agricultural Overseer

annexed to the petit ion marked 'P3', the educational qualifications that an

applica nt for the said post must possess are as follows:

"~~1 <llGM eSll ccxS ~ oaofu -

This Court must observe at this stage that neither the Petitioners nor the

Respondents have placed any material before this Court to demonstrate that

the programme of study that a candidate is required to follow at a

Government Agricu lt ural School and the qualifications that such person

obtains are of a technica l nature.

4

The Petitioners state that they possessed the required results at the General

Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level examination and a Diploma in

Agriculture at the time they applied for the post of Agricultural Overseer.

While the l 't, 3'd and 4th Petitioners had been appointed to the said post with

effect from 3'd July 2000, the 2nd Respondent had been appointed to the said

post on 21't July 2000. The letters of appointment issued to the Petitioners

have seen annexe.d to the petition marked 'PSA3', 'PSB2;, 'PSC', 'PSD', 'PSE'

and 'PSF'.

The Petitioners state that the next promotion an Agricultural Overseer can

aspire to is that of an Agricultural Instructor. The Scheme of Promotion for the

post of Agricultural Instructor has been annexed to the petition marked 'P6'. In

order to be eligible to be promoted as an Agricultural Instructor, an

Agricultural Overseer (an internal candidate) should have completed ten years

of service in the post of Agricultural Overseer; should have passed the

Efficiency Bar; should have earned all salary increments; and should not have

been subject to any punishment for a period of five years.

The Petitioners state that pursuant to the Budget proposals for the year 2006,

the Government had decided to implement a new salary structure for all Public

Servants with effect from 1st January 2006. The Petitioners have annexed to

the petition marked 'P8', Public Administration Circular NO.6 of 2006 which

contains the new salary structures that were introduced in 2006. Paragraph 2

of 'P8' is titled 'Re-categorisation and Re-grouping of Posts/ Services' and reads

as follows:

5

"In order to implement the new salary structure all posts/services in the

Public Service should be re-categorised/re-grouped by each Ministry and

Department based on the definitions given in Annexure II and in terms of

Annexure III - 'Index to Salary Conversion'''.

Thus, the primary function of identifying the new category or group to which

an employee shQuld belong to is vested with the relevant Ministry or

Department, which is required by 'P8', to follow the definitions given in

Annexure II of 'P8' in carrying out the re-categorisation and re-grouping.

Paragraph 1 of Annexure II sets out that the categorisation of employees has

been prepared on the basis of the following criteria:

1) Entry qualifications / Scheme of recruitment

2) Promotional procedures

3) Nature of duties

4) Simplicity

5) Practicability

6) Consistency / compatibility.

The relevant Ministry and Department are required to follow the above criteria

and the descriptions given in 'P8', which would be adverted to later on in this

judgment, when determining the new category or group of an existing

employee.

'P8' also sets out four service levels identified as Primary level, Secondary level,

Tertiary level and Senior level, and re-grouping with the new terminology, with

detailed definitions for each group . The level that is relevan t to this application

6

is the Secondary level and the relevant group is that of Management

Assistants.

Consequent to the issuance of 'P8', the 16th Respondent, the Commissioner

General of Prisons had issued the letter dated 31't May 2006, annexed to the

petition marked 'pg' informing the new salary groups within the Department

of Prisons. According to 'pg', the post of Agricultural Instructor had been

placed under salary category 'MN-1-2006 -Step 12' while the post of

Agricultural Overseer had been placed under salary category 'MN-1-2006 -

Step 1'.

Having had several discussions with the officials of the Department of Prisons,

the National Salaries and Cadre Commission, by a letter dated 5th July 2006

annexed to the petition marked 'P10', had agreed with the recommendation in

'pg' that the post of Agricultural Overseer should be assigned the salary code

'M N-1-2006 - Step l ' and that the post of Agricultural Instructor should be

assigned the salary code 'MN-1-2006 - Step 12'.

The grievance of the Petitioners is that the classification of Agricultural

Overseers and Agricultural Instructors under the category of MN-1-2006 is

unreasonable and arbitrary, in view of the qualifications that they are required

to possess and the job functions that are ca rried out by them. It is in the above

circumsta nces that the Petitioners have filed this application seeking inter alia

the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the recommendation of the National Salaries

and Cadre Commission, as co ntained in 'P10';

7

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the direction of the 16th Respondent, as

contained in 'pg';

c) A Writ of Mandamus directing the National Salaries and Cadre

Commission to recommend the categorisation of the posts of Agricultural

Overseers and Agricultural Instructors under the salary category 'rvlT-2-

2006'.

The argument of the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners is three

fold.

The first argument is that it is unfair and unreasonable to classify the

Petitioners under MN-1-2006 in view of the fact that they have completed a 2

yea r specialised technical course in addition to passing the GCE (OIL)

examination.

In considering the said argument of the learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioners, this Court must bear in mind the submission of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General that this Court does not have the expertise to decide on

classification of employees by applying the criteria laid down in 'P8'.

The approach that should be adopted has been laid down by this Court in

Wakwella Kankanamge Dayananda VS. National Salaries and Cadres

Commission l, where it was held as follows:

l CA 682/2009; CA Minutes of 3" June 2009.

8

"The 1" Respondent Commission (National Salaries and Cadre

Commission) was appointed for the purpose of categorisation of the

employees and allocation of salary code and it has authority to make such

decision because of the special expertise and it has material and evidence

to come to a specific finding. This court in these proceedings does not

have all the material that the 1

st Respondent relied to arrive at its finding.

In judicial review proceedings this court can only consider the legality of a

decision and not whether a decision is right or wrong."

When one considers the salient features of 'P8' which has been referred to

earlier in this judgment, it is clear to this Court that 'P8' is a document carefully

prepared by experts in the field, having taken into consideration a wide array

of factors, and is best interpreted by experts. As observed earlier, the initial

recommendation 'P9' has been made by the Commissioner General of Prisons,

and the decision of the National Salaries and Cadre Commission, confirming

the recommendation in 'P9' had been taken after several meetings with the

officials of the Department of Prisons, as borne out by 'PlO'. This Court is

therefore in agreement with the submission of the learned Deputy Solicitor

General that this Court should be cautious when reviewing a decision of an

expert body.

The submission of the learned Deputy Solicitor General is a reiteration of the

principle that, wh en considering an application for a Writ of Certiorari, a Court

looks at the legality of t he decision and not whether it is right or wrong. As

Lord Brightman stated in the House of Lords in Chief Constable of North Wales

Police v Evansl , applications for judicial review are often misconceived :

J !19? l! I WlR 1155.t 117,1

9

"Judicial review is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision

making process. Unless that restriction on the power of the court is

observed, the court will in my view, under the guise of preventing the

abuse of power, be itself guilty of usurping power ..... Judicial review, as

the words imply, is not an appeal from a decision, but a review of the

manner in which the decision was made. n

Even though a decision may have been taken by experts, it is the view of this

Court that in an application for judicial review, this Court is entitled to look at

inter alia the reasonableness of the decision, keeping in mind the following

statement made by Lord Diplock on irrationality in Council of Civil Service

Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service3,

"By 'irrationality' I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as

'Wednesbury unreasonableness,4. It applies to a decision which is so

outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no

sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided

could have arrived at it."

The above position has been considered by the Supreme Court of India in

Dalpat Abasaheb Solunke and Others. Vs. Dr. B.S. Mahajan and OthersS

where it was held as follows:

l [1geslllc 374.

~ Associated Provine;,,1 Pic ture r-lous ~ s Ltd II Wednesbury Corporation 1948(1)KB 223. , IIIR 1990 SC 434. Also re ferred to In Chief Inspector C.Y. Weerasena VS. Officer in Charge/Personnel SC (FR) No 830/2009; SC M,nutt!s of 8" December 2017.

10

"It will thus appear that apart from the fact that the High Court has rolled

the cases of the two appointees in one, though their appointments are

not assailable on the same grounds, the Court has also found it necessary

to sit in appeal over the decision of the Selection Committee and to

embark upon deciding the relative merits of the candidates. It is needless

to emphasise that it is not the function of the Court to hear appeals over

the decisions of the Selection Committees and to scrutinize the relative

merits of the Candidates. Whether a candidate is fit for a particular post

or not has to be decided by the duly constituted Selection Committee

which has the expertise on the subject. The Court has no such expertise.

The decision of the Selection Committee can be interfered with only on

limited grounds, such as illegality or patent material irregularity in the

Constitution of the Committee or its procedure vitiating the selection, or

proved mala fides affecting the selection etc."

This Court must state that it is not within the parameters of its role, nor is it its

function to determine which salary code the Petitioners should come under,

and will only go so far as to determine if all the relevant factors were

considered by the Respondents in making their decision in 'P9' and 'PiO', and

whether the said decision is reasonable as opposed to being "outrageous in its

defiance of logic."

Accord ing to 'P8', MN-1-2006 carries the title, 'Management Assistants Non

Tech Segment 2'. Management Assistants are defined in paragraph 3.2 of

Annexure II of 'P8' as follows:

11

"Management Assistants are the employees who facilitate and assist the

administrative, managerial and executive grades in the discharge of their

duties. Their entry qualifications differ in keeping with the duties assigned

to them. This category is further divided into two sub-categories, namely

Non-Technical and TechnicaL"

Paragraph 3.2.1 of Annexure II of 'P8' defines 'Management Assistants (Non-

Technical) as follows :

"Management Assistants recruited purely on educational qualifications

and in whose case no technical expertise is required at recruitment or for

promotion, are listed under the category of Management Assistants -

Non Technical. This category is further divided into 2 segments as follows:

3.2.1.2 - Segment 2

Employees who fall within the above category of 'Management

Assistants' whose basic educational qualification in terms of the Scheme

of Recruitment is a pass at the G.C.E. (OIL) or (AIL) examinations and are

not required to possess skills of any defined nature as an entry

qualification, are included in Segment 2 of Management Assistants - Non-

TechnicaL"

This Court has examined 'P3' which is the Scheme of Recruitment for

Agricultural Overseers and observes that in addition to the GCE (OIL), .at the

time of recruitment a ca ndidate is required to have successfully followed a two

yea r cou rse of study at a Government Agricu ltural School and possess a

12

certificate confirming completion of a one year period of training in agriculture

and cow husbandry, animal husbandry and chicken husbandry at a

Government registered farm. This Court observes that 'P6', which is the

Scheme of Recruitment for Agricultural Instructors, does not require any

further educational qualifications from internal candidates who are

Agricultural Overseers. When one considers paragraph 3.2.1.2 of 'P8' in the

context of 'P3', it is clear that what a candidate must have to become an

Agricultural Overseer are the aforementioned educational qualifications and

work experience. A candidate is not required to have skills which are of a

defined nature. Furthermore, it appears that the requirement to successfully

complete a two year programme cannot be equated to technical expertise but

rather an exercise to ensure that the candidate has the necessary knowledge

on the subject and has acquired the necessary work experience required for

such post. The work experience gained in particular areas cannot be classified

as a skill of any defined nature. Thus, it appears to this Court that the

classification of an Agricultural Overseer under MN-1-2006 is not

unreasonable. As observed earlier, in order to be promoted to the post of

Agricultural Instructor, an Agricultural Overseer is not required to acquire any

further educational qualifications, and therefore the decision to place an

Agricultural Instructor in MN-1-2006 - Step 12 cannot be considered as being

unreasonable.

Accord ing to the Petitioners, they should be categorised under MT-2-2006,

which is titled 'Management Assistant Technical Segmen t 2'. Annexure II of

'P8' defines 'Management Assistants - Technica l' as follows:

13

"All employees falling within the above definition of Management

Assistants who are required to possess an institution/in-service vocational

training of a technical nature leading to a certificate or a diploma for the

purpose of recruitment in addition to the G.C.E.(O/L) or G.C.E.(A/L)

qualifications. This category is further divided into 4 segments:

3.2.2.2 - Segment -2

Employees whose technical/vocational training is of a duration between

13-24 months are brought under this category."

The issue that this Court is therefore called upon to consider is whether the

failure to classify the Petitioners under 'Management Assistants - Technical', is

unreasonable? The answer to this is question is perhaps found in the Schemes

of Recruitment marked 'P3' and 'P6', which do not require any certificate of a

technical nature for the purpose of recruitment to the said posts. In the

absence of such a requirement, and considering the fact that in re-c1assifying

employees, the Department of Prisons is required to consider the entry

qualifications and the Scheme of Recruitment, the decision of the Respondents

not to apply MT-2-2006 to the Petitioners cannot be considered as being

unreasonable.

The second argument of the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners is

that in te rms of Paragraph 6.4.1 of the Service Minute of the Sri Lanka

Technological Service published in Extraordinary Gazette bearing No. 1094/2

dated 23'd August 1999, annexed to the petition marked 'Pll', a two year

agricultural diploma offered by an institute approved by the Government has

14

been considered as a technical qualification for recruitment to the said service.

The position of the Respondents in this regard is that the posts held by the

Petitioners were not absorbed into the Sri Lanka Technological Service at the

time the said Service was established in 1999 by 'PH' as they were not

qualified in terms of 'PH', even though certa in other posts such as Works

Inspector, Assistant Works Inspector and Draughtsman under the Department

of Prisons were absorbed to the said service. Once again, this Court must state

that it does not have the expertise to decide if the qualifications possessed by

the Petitioners are similar or identical to the qualifications required from those

who enter the Sri La nka Technological Service. In these circumstances, this

Court cannot agree with the submission of the Petitioners.

The final argument advanced by the learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioners is that in terms of 'pg', drivers in the Department of Prisons who

have lesser entry req uirements than the Petitioners are drawing a salary which

is higher than the Petitioners' salary, and that for that reason too, the

classification of the Petitioners under MN-1-2006 is unreasonable. This Court

must observe that in terms of 'P8', drivers are classified under category PL-

1/2/ 3 and that the starting salary under each of the said categories is less than

the starting salary of MN-1-2006. However, with the salary increments that a

driver is entitled to earn, there can be drivers who draw a salary higher than

what an Agricultural Overseer who has just joined the service would earn. This

cannot be termed unreasonable. The Respondents have infact pointed out that

the refere nce made by the Petitioners to a driver placed on step 22 of PL-3-

2006 drawing a salary higher than the Petitioners is a reference to a .heavy

veh icle driver in Class l. The Respondents have stated further that even prior

to 'P8', heavy vehicle drivers in Class 1 were drawing a salary higher than

lS

Agricultural Overseers. This Court therefore does not see any merit in the final

argument of the Petitioners.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to grant the

relief prayed for by the Petitioners.

It appears to this Court that the Respondents have not shut the door on the

Petitioners, for in paragraph 7 of the Statement of Objections, which is

supported by an affidavit of the then Chairman of the National Salaries and

Cadre Commission, it has been stated that, "the 16th Respondent6 is taking

steps to ascertain whether the Petitioners possess the qualifications that will

be adequate to categorise them under the Management Assistant - Technical

category." This position has been reiterated in paragraph 12 of the Statement

of Objections. The Petitioners have also filed by way of a motion dated 9th

November 2010, a letter dated 19th March 2010 marked 'X3' written by the

Secretary, Ministry of Justice and Legal Reform to the Chairman of the National

Salaries and Cadre Commission, recommending that the post of Agricultural

Overseer and Agricultural Instructor be classified under MT-2 category. This

Court, whilst observing the absence of any specific justification for the said

recommendation save the repetition of the educational qualifications that a

candidate must possess to become an Agricultural Overseer, has not been

apprised of the decision of the National Salaries and Cadre Commission on 'X3'.

Hence, this Court is of the view that this judgement shall not be an

impediment to the National Salaries and Cadre Commission considering the

complaint of the Petitioners afresh. Such a course of action would enable the

National Sa laries and Cadre Commission of examining the rationale behind

., The Commissioner General of Prison'}.

16

'X3', the entry requirements for the post of Agriculture Overseer, and the

qualifications required to join the Sri Lanka Technological Service, and

thereafter arrive at an appropriate decision.

Subject to the above, this application is dismissed, without costs.
