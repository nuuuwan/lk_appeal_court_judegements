The Accused-Petitioner has filed this revision application seeking to revise and set

aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Neg ambo dated 12.12.2017 in

case No. HC 71711988. The Learned SSC for the complainant-respondent

informed that she would not file written submissions since a comprehensive

statement of objections had been filed.

Facts of the case:

The Accused-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the 'petitioner') was arrested

upon a warrant and produced before the Learned Magistrate of Point Pedro and

thereafter, transferred to be produced before the Learned High Court Judge of

Negombo on 17.06.2015 under case No. 717/88. When the petitioner was produced

before the Learned High Court Judge ofNegombo, she was informed that she had

Page 2 of 10

been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for possession of 240.01g

Heroin. The petitioner submitted that there was no case record available to

ascertain any further facts pertaining to the service of summons, trial in absentia,

judgment and sentence of the said case other than a Case Number which was

revealed to be HC 71711988. Thereafter, the petitioner was remanded pending an

inquiry into the missing case record.

An inquiry was held before the Learned High Court Judge of Negombo, and the

evidence of the orc of Police Narcotic Bureau and the Registrar of the Negambo

High Court were led. At the conclusion of the said inquiry, the Learned High Court

Judge by order dated 12.12.2017, pronounced a sentence of life imprisonment on

the petitioner, since such sentence had been earlier imposed on the petitioner under

case No. HC 71711988.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner filed this revision application. The

Learned President's Counsel for the petitioner contended that the order of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 12.12.2017 is illegal, misdirected and contrary to

legal precedent on the following grounds;

1. There is no judgment as statutorily required in Section 283 of the Criminal

Procedure Code, against the petitioner

2. The petitioner was denied of the Right of Appeal as there is no judgment

placed before court as statutorily conditioned

3. A purported sentence has been imposed on the petitioner based on an

unidentified and unproven note entered into by the Police Narcotics Bureau

which has no evidentiary value

4. The said sentence has been imposed on vague, inaccurate and suspicious

entries

Page 3 of 10

5. The petitioner had not been served sUI1).mons nor is there a single record of

an attempt to serve summons and/or any other judicial notice or evidence to

that effect.

6. There is no judicial record of proceedings nor does the purported judgment

marked as 'P 4' refer to judicial proceedings except the notes entered into by

the said officers which at best are entries made for their own purposes.

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the mam

contention, which this Court is called upon to decide, is ""hether a Court can act on

any document other than a court record or a duly certified copy of a court record

when acting upon any judicial proceeding, especially when making an order of

incarceration of an individual which affects his liberty.

As it was revealed, the petitioner, who was a resident of Velvettithurai, was

arrested along with another, at the Bandaranaike International Airport on or about

14.08.1986 for being in possession of heroin. The petitioner was kept in remand

for some time and granted bail in November, 1987. The Registrar of the High

Court gave evidence that, as per a record maintained by the High Court, the High

Court had received an indictment against the petitioner on 05.02.1988 and the

Officer in Charge of Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) produced a file maintained by

the Narcotics bureau, in which it was stated that the petitioner had been sentenced

to life imprisonment. The Registrar of High Court further stated that as per records,

the productions relevant to the case against the petitioner had been destroyed in

front of the Learned High Court Judge after publishing the said destruction on

Gazette (Page 143 of the brief).

The Learned SSC for the complainant-respondent raised (hereinafter referred to as

the 'respondent') following preliminary objections;

Page 4 of 10

1. The petitioner is guilty of contumaciou~ conduct

2. There are no exceptional circumstances to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction

of this Court

3. Undue delay in filing the revision application

4. The petitioner has filed an incomplete case record

The Learned SSC for the respondent submitted that the petitioner admitted she was

on bail which confirms she was aware of the pending case and the petitioner has, in

her evidence, stated that one bail condition was to report t.o the PNB every Sunday.

It was further submitted that the petitioner had stated untruth that she reported to

the PNB once whereas she had never reported to the PNB after getting bail. The

Learned SSC argued that even though the petitioner stated that she could not come

to Court since her village was under siege, she was able to retain a President's

counsel to get her personal belongings released from the Police on 21.12.1986.

Accordingly, it was contended that this evidence and the behaviour of the

petitioner amply demonstrated that the absence of the petitioner was mala fide.

The Learned President's Counsel for the petitioner answered to the above

contention that the aspect of contumacious behaviour arises only when the accused

knows of the case before him/her and willfully stays away. It was submitted that

the petitioner had no freedom of movement as she was living in a war-tom area

with no access to communication facilities and if the State could not execute a

warrant against the petitioner, then it is extremely unfair to expect the petitioner to

travel from a place where the State had not guaranteed freedom of movement.

Accordingly, the Learned President's Counsel for the petitioner contended that

there is no record whatsoever that the petitioner was willfully absconding.

Page 5 of 10

Upon considering the period, through which tpe trial was purported to be held, it is

quite clear that the residence of the petitioner was situated in an area which was

heavily affected by the War between the L TIE and the Government of Sri Lanka.

An affidavit was submitted by the OIC ofPNB along with documents marked from

'L 0 I to L 24' which included notes made by the officers of the PNB with regard

to the instant case.

It is apparent that even the authorities were not in a position to execute the warrant

against the petitioner prior to 2009, owing to the ongoiI).g War at that time. It is

noteworthy that there is no proof of summons being served on the petitioner as

well (Page 133, 134 and 148 of the brief). Therefore, I am of the view that this

Court is not in a position to merely assume that the petitioner was in fact

absconding given that there is no case record to prove that the petitioner was

absconding intentionally and accordingly, it cannot be said that the petitioner is

guilty of contumacious conduct.

Considering the facts of the case, I am of the view that there is a question of law to

be decided by this Court, in the instant case and therefore, I decide to go to the

merits of the case after overruling the preliminary objections raised by the Learned

SSC for the respondent.

As I have already mentioned, the Learned President's Counsel for the petitioner

invited this Court to decide whether a Court can act on any document other than a

court record or a duly certified copy of a court record when acting upon any

judicial proceeding.

Upon perusal of the order dated 12.12.2017, it is evident that the Learned High

Court Judge based his conclusion mainly relying on a file maintained by the PNB

with regard to the petitioner's case and a record book maintained by the High

Page 6 of 10

Court with regard to the receiving of indictm~nts. Further, the Learned High Court

] udge had considered notes made by the officers of the PNB about the trial against

the petitioner.

There is a single line of entry, in the document marked as 'L 23', stating that the

petitioner had been sentenced to life imprisonment on 14.12.1989. However, the

OlC of the PNB who produced the said document in the High Court was not able

to reveal the name of the officer who made the said entry or was not able to

identify the signature on it (Page 131 of the brief). On tl).e contrary to 'L 23', the

document marked as 'L 24' states that the conviction is dated 10.12.1984. The

Registrar of the Court specifically stated that there was no record of a judgment

and/or s sentence against the Petitioner (Page 139 and Page 147 of the brief). The

Registrar further testified that, two cases prior to and subsequent to the instant

case, namely 716/88 and 718/88, are still available in the High Court.

In the case of S. Kumaresan V. The State (Madras High Court)

[CrI.O.P.No.6788 of 2003 and CrI.O.P.No.24026 of 2003-delivered on

21.08.2018], it was held that,

"There is not an iota of material to show that the petitioner was responsible

for the missing records. This Court cannot proceed on the basis of mere

suspicion or surmises against the petitioner and make him responsible for

the missing records. The fact that neither police nor the Court really

bothered to fIX the person responsible for the missing of records for the last

30 years, makes it difficult for this Court to order for an enquiry on the

missing records, at this length of time. Such an enquiry will become an

empty formality since 30 years have passed"

In the case of The Queen V. W. Frances [67 NLR 432] it was held that,

Page 7 of 10

"1n this case it would appear that after the accused was convicted, he

appealed. Since then the record is said to have been lost. In these

circumstances, I would follow the case in the matter of an application in

respect of the loss of record in P. C. Panadure case No. 14,141, 7 Time of

Ceylon Law Reports, page 43 and quash the previous proceedings with

liberty to the complainant to bring afresh charge"

In the case of Hettiarachchige Chandana Hettiarachi V. Attorney General rCA

130/2005 - decided 13.07.2012], it was held that,

"1n this regard I have to be guided by the case record and whatever the

entries found in the Record cannot be lightly disregarded. The Record is the

sole guide to what actually transpired in court and the Record cannot be

impeached or supplemented without a substantial reason ... "

Another important judgment in this regard is found in the case of Jayasooriya and

others V. Attorney General [200911 Sri L.R. 101. In the said case, the issue was

whether the Trial Judge offered the accused of the option to be tried by a Jury. The

offer of the jury option was not recorded anywhere in the Court proceedings. The

State contended that the entry made in the official file maintained by the

prosecuting State Counsel as to a 'non-jury trial' is relevant to determine whether

the jury option was given. However, the Court rejected said contention and held

that,

"Every trial judge has, an obligation and responsibility to maintain a proper

and accurate record of what transpires before him in every trial ......... the

appellate Court should always be guided by what transpires in the case

record and not on some extrinsic material of which the trial judge had no

control whatsoever. "

Page 8 of 10

Therefore, it is understood that any other extraneous material cannot perform the

duty of the original case record and there is a serious danger in relying on such

documents which lack the originality and authenticity unlike a case record. I find

that most of the documents relied on, by the Learned High Court Judge lack

genuineness since the PNB was clearly an interested party in this case.

Further, Article 13(4) of our Constitution guarantees a Fundamental Right that,

"No person shall be punished with death or imprisonment except by order of a

competent court, made in accordance with procedure es.tablished by law ... " and

Section 283 (5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads that, "The

judgment shall be explained to the accused affected thereby and a copy thereof

shall be given to him without delay if he applies for it. "

Therefore, I am of the view that every accused is entitled to have a copy of the

judgment which is pronounced for or against himlher and non-availability of such

judgment clearly affects the Fundamental rights of the accused as well. The

'procedure established by law' would not necessarily be completed unless

mandatory provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code are complied. In the instant

case, even the right of the appeal of the petitioner is taken away since there is no

evidence about the existence of a valid judgment. Therefore, I am of the view that

Learned High Court Judge of Negombo clearly erred in law by enforcing a life

imprisonment against the petitioner, relying on third-party documents other than an

original case record or at least a certified copy of the judgment pronounced against

the petitioner. In any event, the petitioner cannot be expected suffer for the loss of

a case record and it was the duty of the officials in the High Court to protect each

and every case record with similar importance.

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and. others [200411 Sri L R 284, it was

held that;

"In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience of court. "

Considering above, I am of the view that the order of .the Learned High Court

Judge dated 12.12.2017 is irregular, arbitrary and contrary to law which warrants

the invocation of the revisionary powers of this Court. I set aside the order of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 12.12.2017 and order to discharge the petitioner.

The revision application is hereby allowed.
