*************

ACHALA WENGAPPULI, T.

This is an appeal by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants

(hereinafter referred to as the" Appellants") against an order of dismissal

of their application for Restitutio Integrum by the Provincial High Court of

Uva Province holden in Badulla in Revision Application No. 149/2008. In

the said application, the Appellants sought to revise an order of the

Magistrate's Court in case No. 98788, by which an order of ejectment was

made under State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as

amended, by the said Court.

2

On 02.05.2008, the Appiicant-Respondent-Respondent issued a quit

notice under Section 3 of the said Act and upon the Appellants failure to

hand over vacant possession of the State land described in its schedule, an

application was made before the Magistrate's Court seeking an order of

ejectment.

At the inquiry before the Magistrate's Court, the Appellant only

sought to challenge the competency of the Competent Authority in making

an application for their ejectment.

In delivering its order, the 11agistrate's Court noted that the

Appellants have failed to produce a valid permit or authority and

therefore an order of ejectment was issued on 20.10.2008. The said order of

ejectment had been executed by the Fiscal of Court on 25.10.2008.

The Provincial High Court, in its impugned order dismissed the

application to revise the order of ejectment on the basis that there were no

. exceptional circumstances to interfere with the legally correct order of

ejectment issued by the Magistrate's Court.

It is the contention of the Appellants that the order of ejectment was

made in violation of rules of natural justice. This submission was made on

the footing that there was no opportunity afforded to the Appellants to

show cause "on facts". It is the claim' of the Appellants that they raised a

3

I II

preliminary objection and with the ruling on it, the Magistrate's Court has

proceeded to "making an order in the main case" to eject the Appellants from

the said premises. It is also claimed by the Appellants that the Provincial

High Court has erroneously dismissed their application on the basis of

futility.

The Appellant relied on the reasoning of the judgment of the

Supreme Court in Diluni Abeyratne v Jaykay Marcketing Service' and

another S.C. Appeal No. 199/2012 - decided on 24.03.2015 in support of . his submissions on violation of rules of natural justice.

It is clear that the Appellant's primary contention is that they were

deprived of an opportunity to show cause "on facts" by the Magistrate's

Court. This Complaint should be examined by this Court.

The journal entries of the certified copy of the proceedings before the

Magistrate's Court reveal that the Appellants were present in Court on

11.08.2008 and sought time to tender "written show cause". On 25.08.2008

the Appellants have tendered their "written show cause". The Court

pronounced its order on 20.10.2008 after the Respondent's reply on

13.10.2008.

Section 6(1) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act states

that upon receipt of an application under Section 5 it shall forthwith issue

4

notice on the Respondent to show cause "why such person and his

dependents, if any, should not be ejected from the land ... ". If the Respondent

appears before Court and states that he has cause to show, then the Court

should inquire into it. Section 9 of the said Act specifically demarcates the

scope of such an inquiry. Section 9(1) states:-

"At such inquiry the person on whom summons under Section 6 has

been served shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated

in the application under section 5, except that such person may

establish that' he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a

valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in

accordance with any written law and that such permit or authority

is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid."

The Appellants, in showing cause sought only to challenge the

competency of the Competent Authority. This is in clear violation of the

clear statutory provisions contained in Section 6(1) since the Appellant

sought to contest"... the matters stated in the application under section 5."

Section 5(1)(a)(i) requires the Respondent to set forth that " ... he is a

competent authority for the purpose of this Act" and Section 6(1) prevents any

Respondent to an application under Section 5, to contest that fact.

Section 6A imposes a duty on the Magistrate's Courts to dispose of

applications under Section 5 within two calendar months.

5

It is clear what the Legislature has intended in enacting these

provisions of law. The opportunity provided for any Respondent in an

application under Section 5 to show cause is restricted to " ... establish that

he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other written

authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law and that such

permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid."

The statutory provisions have not provided for show cause" on facts" or

otherwise as claimed by the Appellants in their submissions.

In Muhandiram v Chairman, JEDB (1992) 1 Sri L.R. 110, it was held

that the onus is on the person summoned to establish the basis of his

possession or occupation and if that burden is not discharged, the only

option available for the Magistrate would be to make an order of eviction.

The Appellants, when they were asked to show cause in an

application under Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act, they must advise themselves properly of what the law expects of

them. The Magistrate's Court is not the forum before which a Respondent

could challenge the legal status of a Competent Authority in view of the

statutory provision already referred to on this judgment. Clearly the

Appellants have been given an opportunity by the Magistrate's Court to

show cause if they had any and when they failed to tender any valid

permit or authority, it is left with no other option but to issue the order of

eviction. This is exactly what the Court did.

6

The judgment relied upon by the Appellants have no relevancy to

the instant appeal since the question before their Lordships was whether

the failure to tender written submissions would render the matter being

dismissed without considering its merits.

After consideration of the submissions of the parties, we are of the

view that the appeal of the Appellant is bereft of any merit.

We therefore affirm the orders of the Provincial High Court as well

as of the Magistrate's Court and make order dismissing the appeal with

costs fixed at Rs. 25,000.00.
