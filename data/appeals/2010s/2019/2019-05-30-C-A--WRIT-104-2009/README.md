Respondents

Chrishmal Warnasuriya with Priyantha Herath for the Petitioners

Vikum De Abrew SDSG for the Respondents

Written Submissions tendered on:

Respondents on 28.02.2019

Argued on: 21.01.2019

Decided on: 24.05.2019

Janak De Silva J.

This matter was argued on 21.01.2019 and parties were directed to file written submissions on

or before 28.02.2019. When this matter was mentioned on 05.03.2019 no written submissions

were available in the docket and the parties were directed to file written submissions on or

before 04.04.2019 and judgment was reserved for 24.05.2019. The Respondents had filed written

Page 5 of9

submissions on 28.02.2019. No written submissions have been filed on behalf of the Petitioners

although by motion dated 01.03.2019 further two weeks' time was sought and granted for the

written submissions of the Petitioners.

The Petitioners are retired teachers of the Sri Lanka Teachers Service (SLTS) and at the time of

their retirement were Class I officers of the SLTS. The SLTS was not in existence when the

Petitioners were first appointed as trained/graduate teachers.

The SLTS was created by Gazette notification no. 865/3 dated 3rd April 1995 (P2/R1) (SLTS Minute)

and was deemed to have come into force from 06.10.1994. It provided for the establishment of

3 classes in the SLTS, namely Class 3 Garde II, Class 3 Grade I, Class 2 Grade II, Class 2 Grade I and

Class I with the entry point at Class 3 Grade II.

When the SLTS Minute became operative there were nearly 200,000 teachers serving in the state

sector and they were absorbed to Class 3 Garde II, Class 3 Grade I, Class 2 Grade II and Class 2

Grade I taking into consideration their educational and professional qualifications and the period

of service. Part III of the SLTS Minute set out the manner in which the absorption should take

place. There were no absorptions to Class I directly.

There is no dispute that the Petitioners were absorbed in to Class II Grade I of the SLTS and placed

at the maximum salary step.

Part III paragraph 2 of the SLTS Minute explains the procedure for promotion to Class I for two

categories namely:

(a) Graduate teachers with professional qualifications with 22 years of satisfactory service as

trained or graduate teacher

(b) Trained teachers with 25 years of satisfactory service as a trained teacher

Although the Petitioners contend that they were promoted to Class I with effect from 06.10.1994

since they had obtained sufficient marks to be promoted to Class I in view of their seniority in the

service of the SLTS (paragraph 5 of the petition), that position is not supported by any

documentation including the letters of appointment of the Petitioners to Class I.

Page 6of9

By circular No. 1/99 dated 30.09.1999 the requirements in the SLTS Minute on the promotion to

Class I were made non-applicable to those teachers (a) who had been absorbed into Class 2 Grade

I (b) who had reached the maximum salary scale in Class 2 Grade I, and (c) were over 50 years of

age and all such teachers were promoted to Class I of the service. The Petitioners were promoted

to Class I on this basis and their promotions back dated to 06.10.1994 and placed in the second

salary step of Class I of the SLTS.

The Petitioners were eligible to earn the annual increments due from 1994 by virtue of their

promotions being back dated although they were not eligible for back wages.

The Petitioners pray for a writ of mandamus directing the pt Respondent to issue specific

directions to the 2nd to 6th Respondents to implement the scheme/directions contained in PS, P6

and P7 and adjust the Petitioners retiral benefits accordingly and a writ of mandamus directing

the 2nd to 6th Respondents to adjust the Petitioners' retiral benefits in terms of Ps, P6 and P7.

Hence the main issue in this application is to ascertain whether circulars marked Ps(R6}, P6 and

P7 are applicable to the Petitioners.

Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990

The learned SDSG for the Respondents submitted that the Petitioners have failed to comply with

Rule 3(1}(a} of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 as they have failed to annexe

the letters of appointment by which they were promoted to Class I. Rule 3(1}(a} requires every

application made to this Court in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution to be accompanied by

the originals or duly certified copies of documents material to such application.

The gravamen of the Petitioners case is the retiral benefits of the post of Class I of the SLTS. The

letters of appointment to Class I is hence a material document and this application is liable to be

dismissed on this ground alone.

In Shanmugavadivu v. Kulathilake [(2003) 1 Sri.L.R. 215] the Supreme Court held that the

requirements of Rules 3 (l}(a) and 3 (1) (b) are imperative and that in the circumstances of the

Page 7 of9

case the Court of Appeal had no discretion to excuse the failure of the petitioner to comply with

the Rules.

No Enforceable Legal Right

The right of a retired Government servant to a pension is not one that can be enforced in a Court

of law [Gunawardena v. Attorney General (49 NLR 359)]. The Minutes on Pensions do not create

legal rights enforceable in the Courts [Attorney General v. Abeysinghe (78 NLR 361)]. Public

servants have no absolute right to any pension or allowance under the regulations of the Minutes

on Pension [Jayarathne v. Wickremaratne and Others (2003) 2 SrLL.R. 276].

In Perera v. National Housing Development Authority [(2001) 3 SrLL.R. 50 at 53] J.A.N. De Silva J.

(as he was then) held:

liOn the question of legal right it is to be noted that the foundation of -mandamus is the

existence of the right. (Napier Ex parte(l)). Mandamus is not intended to create a right,

but to restore a party who has been denied his right to the enjoyment of such right."

The Petitioners are seeking an enhancement of their retiral benefits by way of writ of mandamus

which is not possible.

PS, P6 and P7 Not Applicable to the Petitioners

In any event PS, P6 and P7 are not applicable to the Petitioners.

By the time PS was issued the Petitioners had already been promoted to Class I of the SLTS taking

into consideration their period of service after having being placed on the highest salary step

after absorption into Class 2 Grade I of the SLTS.

The fact that PS is inapplicable to the Petitioners is clearly demonstrated by the fact they were

placed in the second salary step of Class I with effect from 06.10.1994 and became eligible for

salary increments due to Class I teachers from 1994 and were in fact paid increments since 1999

whereas in terms of Ps those promoted were not eligible for back wages and were entitled to be

paid their salary together with the increments earned for service in Class I only with effect from

01.01.2005.

Page 8 of9

The Petitioners in their counter affidavit have sought to rely on a new document A7 to obtain

relief. This is not the basis of the case pleaded for writs of mandamus which the Respondents

were called upon to answer and the Petitioners are not entitled to rely on it now [Culasubhadra

v. The University of Colombo and Others (1985) 1 SrLL.R. 244].

For all the foregoing reasons the application is dismissed but without costs in the circumstances

of the case.
