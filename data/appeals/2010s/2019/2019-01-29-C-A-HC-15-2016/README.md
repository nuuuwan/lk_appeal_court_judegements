ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The Accused -Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant")

was indicted for the attempted murder of Batuwantudawa Kankanamge

Tushara Namal Batuwantudawa (PW1) by shooting at him on 12.08.2007.

After trial without a jury, the Appellant was convicted by the trial Court

and was imposed a ten-year term of imprisonment. He was also imposed

of a fine of Rs. 5000.00 with default term of two-years.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the Appellant

at the hearing of his appeal raised the following grounds of appeal in

challenging its validity;

2

a. The trial Court has failed to consider the fact that there was no

evidence of shooting at Batuwantudawa by aiming a gun at him by

the Appellant.

b. The trial Court has failed to appreciate the fact that there was no

evidence that the Appellant had the requisite knowledge of

inflicting an injury which is sufficient to cause death since there

was no motive established by the prosecution.

The Appellant, in support of his grounds of appeal, has contended

that none of the prosecution witnesses who testified at the trial claimed

that they have seen the Appellant firing a gun at Batuwantudawa. They

only heard a gunshot. Only Batuwantudawa claimed that the Appellant

aimed a gun and fired at him. The Appellant relied on the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses Kumara and Ratnayake who stated in their evidence

they did not see the Appellant firing at Batuwantudawa to substantiate his

submission. It is his contention that in the absence of any evidence that the

Appellant had aimed his gun at Batuwantudawa before firing it, the

prosecution has failed to establish the requisite mental element in relation

to the attempted murder charge that had been levelled against him.

In view of the submissions of the Appellant, two considerations

arise for determination. Firstly, this Court must decide whether there was

sufficient evidence before the trial Court to sustain the conclusion it

reached that the Appellant had in fact shot at Batuwantudawa?

3

Secondly, it is incumbent for this Court to decide whether the

evidence presented before the trial Court are sufficient to establish the

requisite mental element against the Appellant?

Both these considerations should have been established by the

prosecution before the trial Court beyond reasonable doubt.

In view of the grounds of appeal, it is important to consider the

evidence that had been placed before by the prosecution as well as the

Appellant albeit briefly.

Prosecution Witness No.1 Batuwantudawa, was the Commanding

Officer of the Army Training Camp at Kadurugasara during the relevant

time and the Appellant was a Lance Corporal serving under him. On

11.08.2007 he was informed by Captain Dikkumbura and also by the

Officer-in-Charge of Walasmulla Police Station that the Appellant was

wanted for causing death of two persons in his home town. Batuwantudawa

had then altered his men to conduct a search for the Appellant, after an

enquiring whether he had returned to the camp or not.

Sergeant Dias (PW3) was conducting a search as per the command of

his superior and observed a person hiding in a pit. When he flashed his

torch, that person got up and ran towards the quarters of Batuwantudawa.

At that time the witness identified the Appellant as the person lying in the

pit. Then he chased after him and shouted out to alert Batuwantudawa of

the approach of the Appellant towards his quarters. The Appellant had

then kicked twice on the door of the Officers' quarters. At that juncture,

witness grabbed the Appellant by his midriff. Ratnayake (PW4) too had

joined him to restrain the Appellant. At this time the witness noted

4

Batuwantudawa (PW1) coming out of the entrance to his quarters. They

shouted at him not to come and sound of a shot was heard by them at the

same time. Dias has seen a Galkattas in the hand of the Appellant

immediately after the sound.

Batuwantudawe, stated that he had heard the shouting from outside

and heard loud banging on his door. Despite the warning by his men, he

decided to come out of his quarters. What prompted him to come out was

that he was with his pregnant wife at that time and he did not want her to

get scared upon the commotion. He saw the door pane falling and outside

of the entrance, his men were grappling with the Appellant. As he came

out, he was shot at by the Appellant who had a firearm in his hand. He

fired only one shot, which narrowly missed him and thereafter hit on the

plastered wall behind him making a hole in it.

Then the Appellant shouted at him" Oil <g>c)60)6~~ q)@C), GOO

@&80 <g>~~ <!)~ g~G)@@(.:lci @~)@C} Investigating officers have also testified

confirming a repeated utterance of the Appellant indicating his mind in

their presence. Later he had examined the firearm used by the Appellant

and noted it to be a Galkattas weapon. The incident was reported to Police

and the firearm was handed over to them.

The Appellant's claim that there was no evidence to prove that he

has fired at Batuwantudawa is unacceptable. There is clear and direct

evidence that the Appellant had a firearm with him and he has fired it at

Batuwantudawe( PW1). It is correct that only Batuwantudawa has seen the

Appellant discharging a firearm at him. Dias who was holding the

Appellant at that time had not seen the firing but only heard the noise. The

5

Appellant sought to use this "inconsistency" to his advantage. The evidence

however clearly provided an explanation for this difference in their

evidence.

Dias was holding the Appellant around his waist by his hands and

was trying to pin him to the wall. He saw the arrival of Batuwantudawa by

seeing through the right arm pit of the Appellant. Dias also said that he

was holding the Appellant by positioning himself in front of the

Appellant. This left the two arms of the Appellant free. Dias did not notice

a firearm until it was fired by the Appellant. Immediately after the noise of

the gun shot, Dias saw a Galkattas in Appellant's hand.

In view of these clear evidence the first consideration that arose for

determination by this Court had to be decided against the Appellant. It is

our considered view that there is sufficient evidence to prove beyond

reasonable doubt that it was the Appellant who shot at Batuwantudawa.

Contrary to submissions of the Appellant, there was evidence that the

Appellant had fired directly at Batuwantudawa. The hole noted in the

plastered wall by the Police and the subsequent recovery of a bullet

embedded in it supports the fact that the shot was aimed at the chest level

of Batuwantudawa. The shot was fire in the direction of its intended victim.

The second consideration that whether the evidence presented

before the trial Court are sufficient to establish the requisite mental

element against the Appellant should be considered now.

In Sudu Banda v The Attorney General (1998) 3 Sri L.R. 375,

Jayasuriya J considered this issue and having recognised the applicability

6

of the tests of Proximity and Equivocality in determining the requisite

mental element in a charge of attempted murder, stated thus:-

" ... if the charge one of attempted murder, intent becomes

the principal ingredient of the offence. Thus, if A attacks B

intending to do grievous bodily harm and death results, that

is murder, but if A attacks B and only intends to do grievous

bodily injury and death does not result, it is not attempted

murder but wounding with intent to do grievous harm. This

statement of the law emphasises and stresses that in the

offence of attempt, intention is the essence of crime. II

The said judgment is in relation to an incident of shooting. There

was evidence that a shot emanated from the gun held by the Accused-

Appellant, but it did not hit the witness because he (the witness) had taken

defensive action in sprawling on the ground and thereby avoided

receiving any gunshot injuries.

Having considered this factual situation, his Lordship states that:-

" the accused appellant has clearly manifested by his

utterance his intention to commit the murder of the Police

officer in whose direction he had fired the shot after making

the aforesaid utterance. The act establish by the prosecution

evidence satisfy both the Proximity Rule and the

7

Equivocality Test which are the correct criteria to determine

whether the act of the accused constituted an attempt to

commit murder."

In applying the Proximity test to the evidence presented by the

prosecution before the trial Court in relation to the appeal before us, we are

of the view that the Appellant's of act hiding in a pit and no sooner his

discovery, rush to the door of Batuwantudawa's quarters, his repeated

kicking on it until it gave way and despite the physical restraint imposed

by two of his colleagues, firing at his superior who was at an arm's length

are sufficient to hold that these circumstances satisfy the requirements of

the said test.

The circumstances that are adverted to in the preceding paragraph

also satisfy the Equivocality Test, since they are clearly termed as /I ... acts

which are nearly enough related to the crime to amount to attempt to commit ... If.

In addition, the Appellant had unambiguously indicated his mind when

he repeated in his statement /I GOO ~o6~6~<!'l) Q)@O, Goo @&l80 ~~<!'l) W<!'l)

g~(3)~@oci @<!'l))@C). /I in the presence of the Police officers who arrived there

to investigate the incident. There was no denial to either of these

statements by the Appellant that are attributed to him by the prosecution

witnesses.

8

..

In view of the above reasoning, we hold that the appeal of the

Appellant necessarily devoid of merit. Accordingly, we affirm the

conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellant by the High Court of

Embilipitiya on 17.03.2016.

The appeal of the Appellant is dismissed.
