Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner claims to be the co-owner (5/12th share) of the land named Munhena situated

at Thimbirigaswela more fully described in the schedules to deeds marked P1, P3 and P5. He

started a fish farming project on the said land with the consent ofthe other co-owners for which

he applied and obtained a clearance certificate for a period of three months from the 3,d and

4 th Respondents (P6). The clearance certificate has been issued for lot 5 of plan no. 1521 (P7)

drawn by Licensed Surveyor Indratissa Kotambage.

The Petitioner claims that in order to construct the water ponds for inland fishing, sand had to

be removed from the land and in early September 2009 he applied to the 5th Respondent for

an "Industrial Mining Licence" with the recommendation from the predecessor of the 1st

Respondent (P8) who had stated in item 2 thereof that the land does not belong to the State or

a State institution.

The Petitioner was issued a Mining Licence initially on 29.09.2010 for the period 29.09.2010 to

28.12.2010 which has apparently been extended from time to time.

A dispute appears to have arisen with regard to the title of the land to which the Mining Licence

has been granted although the Petitioner claims that this was due to his refusal to sell the sand

mined from the said land at a very low price to the supporters of a politician in the area named

Dayasritha Tissera.

The predecessor of the 1st Respondent by letter dated 11.07.2011 (PlO) wrote to the Director,

Land Settlement Department informing that a dispute as to the title of land named Munhena

situated in No. 520 Madagoda village has arisen as a permit bearing no. 5848 has been issued

to one Bandappuhamy while a deed of transfer bearing no. 2919 (P3), which is a document

relied on by the Petitioner to establish his co-ownership, is there in the name of one Kumuduni

Mallawaaratchchi. A request was made to settle this land in order to establish its title. The said

letter also refers to a request made to the Surveyor Puttlam to confirm whether the said land

is state land. The Mining Licence granted to the Petitioner was apparently not extended due to

this letter (PlO) been copied to the 5th Respondent with the request to stop further action until

the issue of title is resolved [paragraph 19 of the petition].

The Director, Land Settlement Department has by letter dated 18.08.2011 (P11) replied to P10

stating that there has been no settlement made in relation to Madagoda village and that their

records do not indicate any steps taken to settle the village referred to as Thimbirigaswela

referred to in deed of transfer no. 2919 (P3). Accordingly, he has requested that further

inquiries in that regard be made from the Land Commissioners Department which issued permit

bearing no. 5848.

On 15.09.2011 (P15) the clearance certificate granted to the Petitioner earlier (P6) was

extended by a further three (3) months.

The Surveyor Puttalam has in his report dated 30.11.2011 (P12) informed that it is not possible

to indicate whether the land in dispute is state land or not as it is situated in an unsurveyed

area. The Land Commissioner by letter dated 07.09.2011 (P13) informed the 1st Respondent

that the permit may be rejected based on the report of the Surveyor Puttalam (P12) presumably

on the basis that the said permit is not for the land in dispute.

The Petitioner claims that the 1st Respondent did not vary his earlier decision (Pl0) despite the

above communications from the Land Settlement Department, Survey General's Department

and the Commissioner General of Lands. Hence the Petitioner by letter dated 21.12.2011 (P16)

requested the 1st Respondent to inform the reasons for preventing the project of the Petitioner.

The 1st Respondent by letter dated 27.12.2011 (P17) informed that the Ministry of Lands and

Land Development has requested the Land Settlement Department to settle the title within

four months and that further steps will be taken thereafter.

However, the Petitioner claims that due to representations made by him based on the report

of the Puttalam Surveyor (P12) and the above communication from Land Settlement

Department, the 5th Respondent extended the Mining Licence granted to the Petitioner from

27.01.2012 to 26.07.2012 (P9) and accordingly he resumed operations of his project.

Thereafter the 1st Respondent by letter dated 21.02.2012 (P18) copied to the Regional Manager

of the 5th Respondent directed the Petitioner to immediately stop the mining until the exact

identification of the land based on the deeds and plans submitted by the Petitioner is

ascertained and that his Mining Licence can be cleared after the settlement of the land.

Thereafter the Director General of the 5th Respondent by letter dated 28.02.2018 (P19)

informed the Petitioner that a decision has been taken to temporary suspend the mining in

relation to his Mining Licence in terms of section 44(f) of the Geological Survey and Mines

Bureau Act No. 33 of 1992 until the issues relating to the title of the land is settled and directed

the Petitioner to stop mining activity forthwith .

The Petitioner then by letter dated 05.03.2012 (P20) brought the conduct of the 1't Respondent

to the attention of the Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration who by letter dated

15.03.2012 (P21) requested the 1st Respondent to inform the Secretary through the 2nd

Respondent the basis on which approval is not granted for the project. The 2nd Respondent by

letter dated 10.04.2012 (P22) informed the Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration that

the 1st Respondent had acted on the decision of the District Agricultural Committee.

Page 4 or8

The Petitioner continued to make representation by pointing out that there has been a

suppression of facts. The Director General of the 5th Respondent by letter dated 22.05.2012

(P26) informed the 1" Respondent that according to the lega I division of the 5th Respondent the

Petitioner had title to the land in issue and called for a report from the 1" Respondent as to

why the title of the Petitioner is disputed. As the 1" Respondent did not respond to the said

letter the 5th Respondent issued the Mining Licence from 26.07.2012 to 26.01.2013 (5R10). This

has from time to time being extended up to 29.11.2013 by 5R13(a) to 5R13(d) and has now

lapsed. The Petitioner did not submit a further application for renewal of the licence.

The Petitioner also obtained an Environmental Protection Licence (EPL) dated 18.02.3013 (P29)

for the project which was valid up to 13.08.2013.

The complaint of the Petitioner is that whi le he was continuing with the project on or about

29.09.2013 he received letter dated 26.09.2014 (P31) from the 4th Respondent referring to a

letter dated 03.09.2013 (P33) addressed to him by the 1" Respondent which indicated that a

decision had been taken by the District Agricultural Committee to prohibit the Petitioner from

mining on the land in dispute and as such the EPL issued to the Petitioner cannot be extended.

The Petitioner has sought the following relief:

(a) Writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the 1" and 2nd Respondents and/or the

District Agricultural Committee of Puttalam reflected in P33 and P32 to prohibit the

Petitioner mining sand in the land,

(b) Writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the District Forest and Environmental

Committee of Puttalam reflected in P31 and P32 to prohibit the Petitioner mining sand

in the land,

(c) Writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the 3rd and 4th Respondents reflected in P31

not to extend/renew the Petitioners Environmental Protection Licence for the project,

(d) Writ of mandamus directing the 4th Respondent to extend/renew the Petitioner's

Environmental Protection Licence for the project.

Page 5 or8

The position of the Respondents is that the land referred to in the deeds submitted by the

Petitioner when obtaining the license from the 5th Respondent as well as the 3,d Respondent

was the land named as "Munhena watta" situated at Thimbirigaswela, Madampe falling within

the jurisdiction of the Madampe Divisional Secretariat but that it transpired that the Petitioner

was at material times carrying out mining activities on a land situated in the "Madagoda Grama

Niladari wasama" falling within the jurisdiction of the Mahawewa Divisional Secretariat and as

such the land on which the Petitioner is carrying out mining activities does not belong to the

Petitioner. There were also complaints received from the public about the harm caused to the

environment as a result of the mining activities of the Petitioner.

Accordingly, the Respondents state that the District Agricultural Committee meeting held on

14.02.2012 (lR4) a decision was taken to stop the mining activity and consequently P18 and

P19 was dispatched. At a further meeting held on 20.11.2013 (lR8) it was revealed that the

land on which the Petitioner is carrying out mining activities is state land.

Necessary Parties

The Respondents have raised an objection to the writs of certiorari sought claiming that

necessary parties have not been made Respondents and as such this application must be

dismissed in limine. They point out to the fact that the members of the District Agricultural

Committee and District Forest and Environmental Committee of Puttalam have not been made

Respondents and as such the writs of certiorari sought cannot be granted.

The Supreme Court in Wijeratne (Cammissianer af Matar Traffic) v. Ven. Dr. Paragoda

Wimalawansa Thera and 4 others [(2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 258 at 267] held that the first rule regarding

the necessary parties to an application for a writ of certiorari is that the person or authority

whose decision or exercise of power is sought to be quashed should be made a respondent to

the application. If it is a body of persons whose decision or exercise of power is sought to be

quashed each of the persons constituting such body who took part in taking the impugned

decision or the exercise of power should be made respondent. The failure to make him or them

Page 6 of8

respondents to the application is fatal and provides in itself a ground for the dismissal of the

application in limine.

The Petitioner is seeking writs of certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st and 2nd Respondents

and/or the District Agricultural Committee of Puttalam reflected in P33 and P32 and the

quashing the decision of the 1st and 2nd Respondents and/or the District Agricultural Committee

of Puttalam reflected in P33 and P32. The Petitioner submits that these Committees do not

have the power to take such decisions. However, before deciding the vires of the said decisions,

the persons who took the decision must be given a hearing as required by the rules of natural

justice. All the members of the said two committees who took part in the impugned decision

have not been made Respondents. As such the application is liable to be dismissed in limine on

that ground alone.

Disputed Questions of Fact

Our courts have consistently held that it will not exercise writ jurisdiction where the facts are

in dispute [Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board and another (1981) 2 Sri.l.R. 471]. The Supreme

Court has in Dr. Puvanendran and another v. Premasiri and two others [(2009) 2 Sri.l.R. 107,

2009 BLR 65] held that the Court will issue a writ only if the major facts are not in dispute and

the legal result of the facts are not subject to controversy.

The rationale is that where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the facts is

subject to controversy it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a suit where

parties would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses so that the Court would be

better able to judge which version is correct.

In fact, in Wijenayake and others v. Minister oj Public Administration [(2011) 2 Sri.l.R. 247] this

Court held that the material furnished suggest that a title/boundary dispute is agitated before

the Kurunegala District Court and as such finality (subject to appeal) of title and boundary of

the land in dispute lies in the action filed in the District Court of Kurunegala and that these are

all disputed facts which cannot be decided in a writ court.

Page 7 of8

In this case there is a dispute as to the identity of the land which is interconnected to the

question of title that has arisen between the State and the Petitioner. This entails disputed

questions of fact.

It is true that there has been earlier communication indicating that the land in dispute is not

State land. However, a mistake of fact cannot be the basis of a legitimate expectation [Rootkin

v. Kent County Council (1981) 1 W.L.R. 1186, Vasana v. Incorporoted Council of Legal education

and Others (2004) 1 Sri.L.R. 154J.

The Petitioner has tendered a further affidavit to Court dated 11th June 2015 to which is

annexed marked as X3 a certified copy of the proceedings in D.C. Puttalam Case No. 4234/ L

which according to the Petitioner is an action against the Hon. Attorney General seeking a

declaration of title in respect of the land, which forms part of the subject matter of this

application [paragraph 4 of the said affidavitJ. Hence the question of title is now before the

appropriate Court which better placed to determine that issue. This is also a ground to refuse

exercising the discretionary power of judicial review.

For all the foregoing reasons, this application is dismissed with costs.
