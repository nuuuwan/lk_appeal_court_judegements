M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J

This is an appeal from the judgment of the Learned District Judge of Negombo

in respect of a Land action bearing case Number 3413/L.

The Plaintiffs-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiffs) instituted

this action seeking for a Declaration of Title to the property described in the

4th schedule to the amended plaint and for the ejectment of the Defendant-

Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Defendants).

The Plaintiffs submitted that 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs are son and father and the

Defendants are husband and wife. The 1st Defendant is the sister of the 2nd

Plaintiff. The Ladis Laus Perera who is a brother of the 2nd Plaintiff and the 1st

Defendant. Both Defendants had come to reside with their mother in the

Mulgedara house with the leave and license and after the death of the mother

refused to vacate the house and the premises.

The Defendants submitted that they have prescribed the premises and denied

leave and license and claimed to the corpus on prescription.

The learned District Judge delivered his judgment on 04.06.1999 dismissing

the Plaintiffs action.

Being aggrieved with the judgment of the learned District Judge of Negombo,

this appeal preferred by the Plaintiff-Appellant to set aside the judgment on

the ground stating that the said judgment is contrary to law and the weight of

evidence led at the trial.

The Plaintiffs contended that the title of the land described in the 1st, 2nd, and

3rd schedule to the plaint have got amalgamated and form one land and the

amended plaint described the amalgamated land in the 4th schedule to the

plaint.

The Plaintiffs further contended that this land originally entitled to one Ladis

Laus Perera and the 2nd Plaintiff subject to life interest of B. Dona Dorthina,

the mother of the Ladis Laus Perera, 2nd Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant; and

the Defendants reside in the land without any title to it.

According to evidence led by Ladis Laus Perera that he, the 2nd Plaintiff and

the 1st Defendant lived with their mother in the Mulgedera which is the house

in suit and the Mulgethara belongs to Ladis Laus Perera, the 2nd plaintiff

moved to a new house in the same land and the 1st Defendant along with her

husband (2nd Defendant) continued to live with her mother and mother died

in 1976.

Further, the said Ladis Laus Perera in his evidence stated that after the

mothers death the both Defendants with his permission continued to live in

the Mulgedara and had given a promise that they would the leave the

premises. Later the said Ladis Laus Perera by way of a deed of Gift No. 442 in

1984 gifted all his rights including the Mulgeara which is belonged to him to

5

5

the 1st Plaintiff. Thereafter the Defendants refused to vacate the premises and

the said Ladis Laus Perera also send a notice to quit.

The Plaintiffs pleaded that they also issued notices to quit to the Defendants,

produced and marked as P5 and P6. The paper title of the Plaintiffs also has

been admitted by the Defendants.

However, the Defendants argued that they were living on the said land and

possessed the same as their own from 1958.

The facts that germane to the issue are whether the Defendants had

prescribed the Mulgedara house and the premises in terms of Section 3 of

Prescription Ordinance.

Under Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, No. 2 of 1889 the claimant

must prove,

1. Undisturbed and uninterrupted possession; 2. Such possession to be independent or adverse to the claimant plaintiff;

and 3. Ten years previous to the bringing of a such action

In order to initiate a prescriptive title, it is necessary to show a change in the

nature of the possession and the party claiming prescriptive right should show

an ouster

The 2nd Defendant in his evidence stated that he had told to Ladis Laus Perera

that he would pay to Ladis Laus Perera for the property and that Ladis Laus

Perera had told to him that if necessary he would get money from the 2nd

defendant and the 2nd Defendant had admitted that he has given Rs 2000/- to

Ladis Laus Perera in concern of the property.

It is to be noted that the above admission of the 2nd Defendant creates an

absurdity to the adverse possession claimed by him and also he himself

admitted that the Ladis Laus Perera is the owner of the house.

In Tillekaratne Vs. Bastian [(1918) 21 NLR 12] it is an established principle of

law that a person who has entered into possession of land as a licensee is

presumed to continue to possess it in the same capacity.

Where a licensee claims that his original possession has later become adverse,

he must prove of the manifestation of his intention to possess adversely to

the true owner by what is sometimes referred to as an overt unequivocal act.

In De Silva Vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue [80 NLR 292]

Sharvananda J. intensely observed that,

the principle of law is well established that a person who bases

his title in adverse possession must show by clear and

unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile to the real

owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property

claimed.in order to constitute adverse possession, the possession

must be in denial of the title of the true owner. The acts of the

person in possession should be irreconcilable with the rights of

the true owner; the person in possession must claimed to be so

as of right as against the true owner. Where there is no hostility

to a denial of the title of the true owner there can be no adverse

possession. In deciding whether the alleged acts of the person

constitute adverse possession, regard must be ascertained from

the facts and circumstances of each case and the relationship of

the parties. Possession which may be presumed to be adverse in

the case of a stranger may not attract such a presumption, in the

7

7

case of persons standing in certain social or legal relationships.

The presumption represents the most likely inference that may

be drawn in the context of the relationship of the parties. The

court will always attribute possession to a lawful title where that

is possible. Where the possession may be either lawful or

unlawful, it must be assumed, in the absence of evidence, that

the possession is lawful. Thus, where property belonging to the

mother is held by the son, the presumption will be that the

enjoyment of the son was on behalf of and with the permission

of the mother. Such permissive possession is not in denial of the

title of the mother and is consequently not adverse to her. It

will not enable the possession to acquire title by adverse

possession. Where possession commenced with permission, it

will be presumed to so continue until and unless something

adverse occurred about it. The onus is on the licensee to show

when and how the possession became adverse. Continued

appropriation of income and payment of taxes will not be

sufficient to convert permissive possession into adverse

possession, unless such conduct unequivocally manifests denial

of the permitters title. In order to discharge such onus, there

must be clear and affirmative evidence of the change in the

character of the possession. The evidence must point to the

time of commencement of adverse possession. Where the

parties were not at arms length, strong evidence of a positive

character is necessary to establish the change of character.

It is important to consider the evidence led by the Ladis Laus Perera that the

Defendants left the said land in dispute when they got married and lived

8

8

elsewhere for some time. Thereafter they came to Mulgedara as the 1st

Defendant was teaching in a school nearby.

It is to be noted the Defendants need to stay at Mulgedara for a purpose to

fulfill their needs but there was no proper intention to possess the land the

adversely to the true owner to claim the prescriptive title.

Therefore, I am of the firm view, that the learned District Judge who heard the

evidence has decided in favour of the Defendants only by bearing the fact that

they lived in the house from 1958 and failed to consider the important

evidence given by Ladis Laus Perera and had misdirected himself and given

bare answers to some of the issues without evaluating the evidence.

For the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgment of the learned District

Judge of Negambo and allow the appeal in favour of the Plaintiffs.

Appeal allowed.
