, X Jhen this matter came up before me on 20.02.2019, both counsel submitted that

V V this matter could be disposed of by written submissions and thus in this

application for restitutio in integrum, oral submissions have been dispensed with. The

written submissions of the respective parties have since been filed and I proceed to

pronounce judgment after having perused the written submissions.

Factual Template

The Plaintiff~ Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff") instituted

action against the 1st Defendant~Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the

Petitioner") and the 2nd Defendant~National Housing Development Authority (NHDA)~

seeking several remedies in his prayer to the plaint dated 12th December 2002. Two of the

reliefs sought inter alia against the 1st Defendant~Petitioner was ejectment from Unit D/29

2

of the Torrington Flats and damages. This housing had been given to the Plaintiff-

Respondent by the NHDA as he was a government servant and subsequently steps were

taken to transfer the ownership of the unit to the Plaintiff-Respondent. In the meanwhile

the Plaintiff-Respondent sublet the premises to the 1st Defendant-Petitioner and the cause

of action in the District Court was rooted in the refusal of the 1st Defendant-Petitioner to

vacate when the Plaintiff-Respondent wanted the premises back. Both the 1st Defendant-

Petitioner and the 2nd Defendant (NHDA) filed separate answers praying for a dismissal of

the Plaintiff's action. Later the NHDA (the 2nd Defendant) informed Court that it was

agreeable to abide by any decision of court.

After trial, the learned Additional District Judge of Colombo by her judgment dated

28.08.2008 held with the Plaintiff-Respondent and the 1st Defendant-Petitioner who faced

eviction in light of the judgment preferred an appeal against the judgment to the High

Court of Civil Appeal of the Western Province in Colombo. One of the issues among many

others that were raised by the 1st Defendant-Petitioner was that the Plaintiff-Respondent

could not maintain this action as the 2nd Defendant NHDA had decided to terminate the

tenancy given to the Plaintiff by way of a letter marked as P21. It is worthy of note though

that the NHDA asserted in its answer that no final decision had been taken to give effect

to any termination of tenancy between the Plaintiff-Respondent and NHDA. The learned

High Court Judges of Civil Appeal took cognizance of these matters and dismissed the

appeal of the 1st Defendant-Petitioner by their judgment dated 22.09.2015.

The leave to appeal application preferred by the 1st Defendant-Petitioner under Article 128

of the Constitution read with Section 5C of the Provincial High Courts (Special Province)

Act No.19 of 1990 as amended by Act No.54 of 2006 was refused by the Supreme Court on

nth July 2016.

Thereafter the learned District Judge entered decree and the Plaintiff applied for a writ of

execution and notwithstanding the objection to the issuance of the writ of execution, the

learned Additional District Judge of Colombo, after an inquiry, made order issuing the writ

of execution on 11.10.2017. In other words the stay of execution of the writ sought by the 1st

Defendant-Petitioner was thus refused.

3

This application for restitutio in integrum impugns the decree and writ of execution and the

1st Defendant~Petitioner also seeks in the main that he be restored to possession of the

premises from which he has been evicted consequent to the writ of execution. The writ of

execution was issued on nth October 2017 and it was executed on 2th October 2107 and

vacant possession was handed over to the Plaintiff~ Respondent.

The decree and writ of execution are now challenged before this Court in restitutio in

integrum proceedings. Before I proceed to consider the arguments advanced to impugn the

decree and writ issued in the case, I must observe that the decree is rooted in a judgment

that has been upheld by both the High Court of Civil Appeal and the Supreme Court. Then

the caveat follows ~the doctrine of res judicata to which I will advert presently would

prohibit the 1st Defendant~Petitioner from re~agitating issues that have either been

adjudicated upon or been waived by the Petitioner.

The quintessential argument advanced in the written submissions of the 1st Defendant ~

Petitioner is that according to Section 10 (4) of the National Housing Development

Authority the decree cannot be enforced because the provision requires that it should have

been made in favor of the Authority or the General Manager. The aforesaid provision

enacts as follows: ~

"No such fiat, house or living accommodation or bUilding or any land shall be attached in

execution of a decree of any court except a decree in favour of the AuthOrity or the General

Manager, as the case may be."

In other words the contention is that the decree was a nullity as the decree was not in

favour of the National Housing Development Authority nor was it in favour of the General

Manager. This presupposes the argument that the NHDA must have sued the 1st

Defendant~ Petitioner and secured a decree in its favour. It has to be recalled that the State

Counsel representing the NHDA sought its discharge at the trial by way of a motion

which stated that the Authority would abide by any decision of Court. The question of

maintainability of an action by a licensor against his licensee for ejectment is well known

to common law and this very question was gone into by the District Court and the High

4

Court of Civil Appeal and both Courts in their judgments confirmed the right of the

Plaintiff~Respondent to maintain this action against the 1st Defendant~Petitioner. It is trite

law that one need not be an owner of some premises to institute an action on the ground

oflandlord and tenancy~ Imbuldeniya v. D. De silvi (Sharvananda, c.].) Mark Fernando,

J. echoed the same principle in Gunasekera v. Jinadasa2 thus: ~

"It is settled law that tenancy is a contractual relation, which may subsist even where the landlord is

not the owner of the rented premises."

The NHDA was no doubt the owner of the premises but there did come into existence a

contract of tenancy between the Plaintiff~Respondent and the 1stDefendant~Petitioner. At

the trial there were formal admissions that would qualify to fall within Section 58 of the

Evidence Ordinance namely a) the Plaintiff~Respondent handed over the possession of the

premises to the 1st Defendant~Petitioner for a monthly rental of Rs.lOOor; b) the 1st

Defendant~Petitioner was served with a quit notice dated 09.06.1993; d) the 1st Defendant~

Petitioner was yet in possession of the premises let notwithstanding the quit notice. On

these admissions it is abundantly clear that the Plaintiff~Respondent made out a case for

ejectment and the percipient observations of U.de. Z. Gunawardana, J. in Ruberu v.

Wijesooriy:l come into play when the Plaintiff~Respondent instituted action to eject the

1 st Defendant~ Petitioner.

"Whether it is a licensee or a lessee, the question of title is foreign to a suit in ejectment against

either."

Thus the District Court of Colombo embarked on a suit properly constituted and reached

a decision ordering the ejectment of the 1st Defendant~Petitioner. This decision of the

District Court was upheld by both the High Court of Civil Appeal and the Supreme Court.

So the decree flowed from a judgment which is traceable to a validly constituted suit. This

suit at the instance of the licensor or lessor is not abrogated by the National Housing

Development AuthOrity Act. It is a common law right which the Plaintiff~Respondent

1(1987) 1 SrLLR 367. 2(1996) 2 SrLLR 115 at 120. 3(1998) 1 SrLLR 58.

availed himself of in order to seek the ejectment of the 1

st Defendant~Petitioner and in no

way is this right taken away or restricted by the provisions of the National Housing

Development Authority Act No.17 of 1979. There is neither an express exclusion nor an

implied abrogation of the common law right. So it was in pursuance of a valid judgment

that the decree flowed and the writ issued thereafter in the wake of all these

concatenation of events, as the crow flies. The judgment which gave rise to the decree and

writ was upheld by the High Court of Civil Appeal and the Supreme Court. Now before

this Court the decree and writ are sought to be challenged in restitutio in integrum

proceedings.

Res judicata

In this backdrop the invocation of restitutio in integrum by virtue of Article 138 of the

Constitution would be barred by the doctrine of res judicata, which would preclude the

Petitioner from maintaining this application before this Court. This case which began

between the two parties originally in the District Court has run its course all the way up

to the Supreme Court. If one peruses the application to this Court for restitutio in integrum

some of the issues that were agitated in the previous litigation have again been made the

subject~matter of contention in this application. For instance paragraph 20 of the

application for restitutio in integrum regurgitates the same grouse~namely the tenancy of the

Plaintiff~Respondent had been terminated by the NHDA on 19.03.1991 by the Deputy

General Manager of the 2nd Defendant for violating Section 10 of the NHDA Act. This issue

was litigated in the previous action (D.c. Colombo 19775/L) between the parties. In fact

the want of locus standi that the 1st Defendant~Petitioner alleged against the Plaintiff~

Respondent was disposed of and I have myself held above that the licensor enjoys locus

standi to institute an action to eject his licensee. The NHDA itself had informed Court that

there was no finality reached on the question of terminating the Plaintiff's tenancy and

this was a live issue that was considered even by the High Court of Civil Appeal. Can this

be reagitated before this Court in the guise of restitutio in integrum? I am afraid that the

6

Petitioner is estopped from re~litigating this issue before me. This is issue estoppel or cause of

action estoppel that gives rise to res judicata.

According to the view expressed by former Chief Justice, Basnayake, in the case of Herath

v. the Attorney Generat, the whole of our law of res judicata is to be found in Section 34,

207 and 406 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Voet defines res judicata as thus: "Now an exception is the shutting out of an action which

is available in strict law." So according to Voet, the effect of res judicata is the ouster of a 2nd

proceeding on the same issue.

Section 207 of the Civil Procedure Code reads:~

"All decrees passed by the court shall subject to appeal, when an appeal is allowed,

be final between the parties; and no plaintiff hereafter be non~suited.

Explanation: Every right of property or to money or to damages, or to relief of any

kind which can be claimed, set up, or put in issue between the parties to an action

upon the cause of action for which the action sis brought, whether it be actually so

claimed, set up, or put in issue or not in the action, becomes, on the passing of the

final decree in the action, a res judicata, which cannot afterwards be made the subject

of action for the same cause between the same parties."

Basnayake, C.J., refers to the explanation given above and states that "according to the

explanation for a matter to be res adjudicata the previous action which is pleaded as a bar to

the subsequent action must be, a) for the same cause of action, and b) between the same

parties"s.

In the course of his judgment in Sathuk v. Layandeen and others6 Basnayake, c.]. states:

"Voet states that the three requisites for res judicata are, same persons, thing and

cause. He (Voet) states there is nevertheless no room for this exception unless a suit

which had been brought to an end is set in motion afresh between the same persons,

460 N.L.R. 194

5 60 N.L.R. 194 at 223

6 63 N.L.R. 25 7

about the same mater and on the same cause of claiming, so that the exception falls

away if one of these three things is lacking."

Basnayake, c.]. goes on to quote, Voet with regard to the term 'same person'. "A deceased

and his heirs, a principal and his agent, a free town and its manager, an insane person or a

soldier and his curator, a ward and his guardian and a father and the son of his household

are in Civil Law the same person."

So this application for restitutio in integrum is doomed to fail as the same persons litigated

the same issues in the previous litigation. Apart from res judicata which will bar the

Petitioner, principles surrounding restitutio in integrum will also preclude this Court from

exercising this jurisdiction. Let me turn to some of the cases which have enunciated the

principles.

Restitutio in integrum is more in the nature of an overriding (equitable) jurisdiction that may

be invoked at the discretion of court. It may be invoked not only in respect of voidable

contract, but in respect of any voidable obligation, including a judgment, in respect of

which there is no other remedy. If there is some other adequate remedy is available, the

restitutio in integrum will not lie~ Perera et al v. Wijewickreme!.

In Abeyesekere v. Haramanis AppuB it was held:

"the remedy of restitutio in integrum is one which has taken deep root in the practice and procedure

of Courts, and it is too late to hold that the remedy ought no longer to be recognized. If the Court is

satisfied that there is a prima facie case, Court shall issue notice on the other side."

Restitutio in integrum to impugn judgments

The power to entertain applications by way of restitutio in integrum has now been conferred

with the Court of Appeal by the Constitution of the country. Article 138(1) of the

Constitution states that, "The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction of

715 N.L.R 411

8 14 N.L.R 353 8

..

all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by any Court of First Instance,

tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision

and restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things of

which such Court of First Instance, tribunal, or other institution may have taken

cognizance. "

In Kusumawathie v. Wijesinghtf, the defendant was married to one 'W'. After the death

of the said 'W', the petitioner was shown an ex parte decree obtained by 'W, dissolving the

marriage, by the deceased's sister at the police station, alleging that the petitioner was

occupying the house after she had been divorced and that the petitioner was not entitled

to pension of the deceased.

The petitioner sought by way of restitutio in integrum to remedy the injustice caused to her

by abuse and misuse of the legal process.

It was held by the Court of Appeal that; relief by way of restitution in integrum of judgments

of original courts may be sought where the judgments had been obtained by fraud by the

production of false evidence, nondisclosure of material facts or by force.

"When a party appears and complains that she has been wronged by a process of law, this Court

would not helplessly watch and allow the fraud practiced on that party to be perpetuated. Restitutio

in integrum prOVides this Court necessary apparatus to step in and rectify miscarriage of and

failure of justice. If this is not the case then there is a serious vacuum in the law, which can be made

use of by designing individuals as the Petitioner alleges had happened to her" Per Jayasinghe J.

In Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v. Shanmugan/ the following ratio appears.

Relief by way of restitutio in intergrum in respect of judgments of original Courts may be

sought;

(a) Where judgments have been obtained by fraud by the production of false evidence,

non disclosure of material facts or by force; or

9 2001 (3) Sri L.R. 238, 1(199S) 1 SrLLR SS.

9

..

(b) Where fresh evidence has cropped up since judgments, which was unknown

earlier to the parties relying on it or which no diligence could have helped to

disclose earlier; or

(c) Where judgments have been pronounced by mistake and decrees entered thereon

provided of course it is an error which connotes a reasonable excusable error.

Section 10(4) Argument

None of these criteria are grounds of attack in this case except for the assertion that the

decree must have been entered in favor of the NHDA or its General Manager. Section 10(4)

of the NHDA Act has been called in. In other words the argument is that since the decree

is in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent who is a government servant, the writ that was

issued was nullity. This argument does not hold water as the decree contemplated under

Section 1O( 4) is one that seeks to attach a flat, house or living accommodation or building

or any land belonging to the NHDA. Section 10(4) is referable to Section 10(3) which reads

as follows:-

"No lien by deposit of the title deeds as security for a debt, of any flat, house or other living

accommodation or building or any land that has been sold by the Authority shall be capable of

being created in favour of any person and no caveat in support of any such lien by deposit shall be

capable of being registered under the Registration of Documents Ordinance."

Section 10(3) prohibits a vendee from NHDA depositing the title deeds as a security for a

loan given to him by a third party. No lien in favour of the third party can be created by the

vendee for a loan from a third party by depositing title deeds. In other words there cannot

be an equitable mortgage in favor of anyone over a flat, house or living accommodation or

building or any land that has been sold by the NHDA. Section 1O( 4) prohibits the creditor

of the vendee taking out a writ to attach the dwelling. No such thing has happened this

case. The NHDA never sold this property to the Plaintiff-Respondent. There is no evidence

that the Plaintiff-Respondent borrowed from a third party like a bank and deposited the

title deeds with the creditor. This could not have happened because the Plaintiff did not

have any title deeds as he was not a vendee of the NHDA. No lien could have been created

10

<a.

by the Plaintiff~Respondent. In the circumstances Section lO( 4) of the NHDA Act has no

application to the facts of this case. One has to read between the lines when one tries to

interpret Section lO( 4).

Attachment

In the phrase writ of attachment, the word attachment will bear this meaning~the taking into

custody of a person's property to secure a judgment or to be sold in satisfaction of a

judgment. Joseph Goulden, in The Million Dollar Lawyers 52 ~53 (1978) seeks to render a

meaning to the concept of attachment. "The disputed residence was important because a

writ of attachment~briefly, an order freezing cash or other assets~cannot be obtained

against a person unless the person has a foreign address." Possibly assets were in one

jurisdiction and the owner was in another and unless one knew his address, the writ of

attachment cannot travel afar~this is how Joseph Goulden pithily summarized it.

Needless to say, Section 10(4) speaks of an order which is akin to sequestration or seizure

and it has nothing to do with the writ that was issued against the 1

st Defendant~

Respondent. What issued against the 1st Defendant~Respondent was a writ that executed

a decree within the meaning of Section 217(C) of the Civil Procedure Code. The decree

was one that was directed to the Petitioner to yield up possession of immovable property

and that decree was entered properly in favor of the Plaintiff~Respondent. That writ need

not issue solely at the instance of the NHDA.

So all the principles that have an interplay in the case namely res judicata and availability of

alternative remedies that the Petitioner himself has exhausted by taking the case all the

way to the Supreme Court will shut the door to the remedy of restitutio in integrum. There is

no reasonable error or Justus error in the judgment of the Court a quo.

Accordingly I proceed to affirm the decree and writ that have been entered in the case and

dismiss this application for restitutio in integrum.
