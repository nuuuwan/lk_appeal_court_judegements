Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioners filed this application seeking a writ of certiorari to

quash the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal marked

P1. The 25th and 33rd respondents filed a limited statement of

objections seeking dismissal of the application in limine on three

grounds.

The first preliminary objection reads as follows:

The application of the petitioners is bad in law since the

petitioners have sought to invoke the writ jurisdiction against

the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which has

varied the decision of the Public Service Commission whose

decisions are not amenable for judicial review in terms of the

expressed privative clause of

(a) Section 8(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal

Act No. 4 of 2002

3

and read together with the constitutional ouster of

(b) Article 61A (as amended) of the Constitution of the

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka

Administrative Appeals Tribunal was created by Article 59 of the

Constitution:

59(1) There shall be an Administrative Appeals Tribunal

appointed by the Judicial Service Commission.

(2) The Administrative Appeals Tribunal shall have the power

to alter, vary or rescind any order or decision made by the

Commission.

(3) The constitution, powers and procedure of such Tribunal,

including the time limits for preferring of appeals, shall be

provided for by law.

Section 8(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunals Act, No. 4 of

2002, reads as follows:

A decision made by the Tribunal shall be final and conclusive

and shall not be called in question in any suit or proceedings

in a court of law.

This is a statutory ouster clause, and not a constitutional ouster

clause. Ouster clauses contained in statutes, as a general rule, do

not oust the writ jurisdiction conferred on Courtsin Sri Lanka, on

the Court of Appeal by Article 140 of the Constitution. There is a

presumption in favour of judicial review and Courts have

throughout the history shown their great reluctance to accept

ouster clauses at face value. The tendency of Courts has been to

give ouster clauses a restrictive interpretation as much as possible

4

so as to preserve their jurisdiction to review administrative

decisions. The leading English case of Anisminic Ltd v. Foreign

Compensation Commission (1969) AC 147 provides a striking

illustration of this tendency. It is generally understood that the

ouster/preclusive/finality clauses are there to prevent appeals and

not to prevent judicial review. Those clauses do not and cannot

prohibit the Court of Appeal from exercising its writ jurisdiction to

look into the jurisdictional issues of the decisions of the

administrative bodies or tribunals.

In St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States (1936) 298 US 38,

Brandeis J. stated that:

The supremacy of law demands that there shall be

opportunity to have some court decide whether an erroneous

rule of law was applied and whether the proceeding in which

facts were adjudicated was conducted regularly.1

Professor Wade in his monumental workAdministrative Law, 9th

Edition, at page 713 states:

Many statutes provide that some decision shall be final. That

provision is a bar to any appeal. But the courts refuse to

allow it to hamper the operation of judicial review. As will be

seen in this and the following sections, there is a firm judicial

policy against allowing the rule of law to be undermined by

weakening the powers of the court. Statutory restrictions on

judicial remedies are given the narrowest possible

construction, sometimes even against the plain meaning of the

words. This is a sound policy, since otherwise administrative

5

authorities and tribunals would be given uncontrollable power

and could violate the law at will. Finality is a good thing but

justice is a better.

If a statute says that the decision or order of some

administrative body or tribunal shall be final or shall be

final and conclusive to all intents and purposes this is held to

mean merely that there is no appeal: judicial review of legality

is unimpaired. Parliament only gives the impress of finality to

the decisions of the tribunal on condition that they are

reached in accordance with the law. This has been the

consistent doctrine for three hundred years. It safeguards the

whole area of judicial review, including (formerly) error on the

face of the record as well as ultra vires.

Under the sub-heading Shall not be questioned clauses, Professor

Wade at page 717-718 inter alia states:

Wide enactments designed to oust the jurisdiction of the

courts entirely in respect of all remedies have come to be

known as ouster clauses. However they are worded, they

are interpreted according to the same principle.

The law as now settled by the House of Lords is that these

ouster clauses are subject to exactly the same doctrine as the

older no certiorari clauses, namely, that they do not prevent

the court from intervening in the case of excess of jurisdiction.

Violation of the principles of natural justice, for example,

amounts to excess of jurisdiction, so that where a minister

refused an application for citizenship without giving the

applicant a fair hearing the Privy Council invalidated his

6

decision notwithstanding a statute providing that it shall not

be subject to appeal or review in any court. AG v. Ryan [1980]

AC 718

Section 3(4) of the Land Redemption Ordinance, No. 61 of 1942

provided that The question whether any land which the Land

Commissioner is authorised to acquire under subsection (1) should

or should not be acquired shall, subject to any regulations made in

that behalf, be determined by the Land Commissioner in the exercise

of his individual judgment; and every such determination of the

Land Commissioner shall be final.

In considering of this section, in the case of Ladamuttu Pillai v. The

Attorney General (1957) 59 NLR 313 the Supreme Court stated that

when a statute provides that a decision made by a statutory

functionary shall be final or final and conclusive, the words final

and final and conclusive do not have the effect of ousting the

jurisdiction of the Courts to declare in appropriate proceedings

that the decision of the public functionary, when he has acted

contrary to the statute, is illegal.

Basnayake C.J. at page 329 stressed the point with vigor and force

in the following terms:

When an Ordinance or an Act provides that a decision made

by a statutory functionary to whom the task of making a

decision under the enactment is entrusted shall be final, the

Legislature assumes that the functionary will arrive at his

decision in accordance with law and the rules of natural

justice and after all the prescribed conditions precedent to the

making of his decision have been fulfilled, and that where his

7

jurisdiction depends on a true construction of an enactment he

will construe it correctly. The Legislature also assumes that

the functionary will keep to the limits of the authority

committed to him and will not act in bad faith or from corrupt

motives or exercise his powers for purposes other than those

specified in the statute or be influenced by grounds alien or

irrelevant to the powers taken by the statute or act

unreasonably. To say that the word final has the effect of

giving statutory sanction to a decision however wrong,

however contrary to the statute, however unreasonable or

influenced by bad faith or corrupt motives, is to give the word

a meaning which it is incapable of bearing and which the

Legislature could never have contemplated. The Legislature

entrusts to responsible officers the task of carrying out

important functions which affect the subject in the faith that

the officers to whom such functions are entrusted will

scrupulously observe all the requirements of the statute which

authorize them to act. It is inconceivable that by using such a

word as final the Legislature in effect said, whatever

determination the Land Commissioner may make, be it within

the statute or be it not, be it in accordance with it or be it not,

it is final, in the sense that the legality of it cannot be agitated

in the Courts. No case in which such a meaning has been

given to the word final was cited to us. The word final is

not a cure for all the sins of commission and omission of a

statutory functionary and does not render legal all his illegal

acts and place them beyond challenge in the Courts. The word

final and the words final and conclusive are familiar in

enactments which seek to limit the right of appeal; but no

8

decision of either this Court or any other Court has been cited

to us in which those expressions have been construed as

ousting the jurisdiction of the Courts to declare in appropriate

proceedings that the action of a public functionary who has

acted contrary to the statute is illegal.

Section 18(1) of the Medical Ordinance, No. 26 of 1927, as

amended, reads as follows:

Every order or decision of the Medical Council under this

Ordinance shall be subject to appeal to the Minister whose

decision shall be final.

In construing this provision, in Wijerama v. Paul (1973) 76 NLR

241 it was held that:

Notwithstanding that the decision of an inferior tribunal is by

a statute made final in the manner of section 18 of the Medical

Council Ordinance, certiorari can still issue for excess of

jurisdiction or for error of law on the face of the record or on

the ground of bias or violation of the principles of natural

justice. In the present case, there was error of law on the face

of the record. Although the Medical Council did not give

reasons for its decision, it maintained a complete record of its

proceedings and incorporated all the relevant evidence. There

was no evidence in support of the charge that the letter

written by the respondent to the editor of the newspaper

amounted to an advertisement by the respondent of his

professional skill. In the circumstances, the decision of the

Medical Council should be quashed.

Regulation 55 of the Emergency (Miscellaneous Provisions and

Powers) Regulations, No. 6 of 1971, published in Government

Gazette of August 15, 1971 provided that Section 45 of the Courts

Ordinance (which conferred jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to

issue writs of habeas corpus) shall not apply in regard to any person

detained or held in custody under any emergency regulation.

In Hidaramani v. Ratnavale (1971) 75 NLR 67 the majority of the

Supreme Court held that regulation 55 is intended to remove the

courts jurisdiction to issue a writ of habeas corpus only in respect

of a lawful detention under any emergency regulation and not

otherwise. In other words, regulation 55 will not apply to the case

of a person unlawfully detained under an invalid detention order

made in abuse of the powers conferred by regulation 18(1).

In Abeywickrema v. Pathirana [1986] 1 Sri LR 120 at 156,

Sharvananda C.J. opined that Ouster clauses do not prevent the

court from intervening in the case of excess of jurisdiction.

The parameters of the phrase excess of jurisdiction is so wide.

That should not be confined to the narrow question whether the

administrative body or tribunal had jurisdiction to inquire into the

matter. There may be a number of instances where despite the

administrative body having jurisdiction to embark upon the

inquiry, in the course of the inquiry, it does or omits to do

something of such a nature as to make the decision a nullity. That

may include the administrative body making a decision which it

has no power to make. It may have given the decision in bad faith.

It may have in good faith misdirected itself in construing vital

documents. It may have taken irrelevant matters into

10

consideration and ruled out relevant matters in the process. It

may have failed in the course of the inquiry to comply with the

rules of natural justice such as violation of audi alteram partem

rule. This list is not exhaustive. These are all, in broader sense,

jurisdictional issues.

In Gunasekera v. De Mel, Commissioner of Labour (1978) 79(2) NLR

409 at 426 the Supreme Court held that:

Lack of jurisdiction may arise in different ways. While

engaged on a proper inquiry the tribunal may depart from the

rules of natural justice or it may ask itself the wrong questions

or may take into account matters which it was not directed to

take into account. Thereby it would step outside its

jurisdiction.

It is the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioners that:

The promotion of the 16th-51st respondents as directed by the

AAT would compel the PSC to contravene its own procedural

rules as published in the Government Gazette Extraordinary

bearing No. 1589/30 dated 20.02.2009 and as such directs a

commission of an act which is totally without jurisdiction and

consequently the order sought to be impugned is ultra vires

and/or vitiated by an error of law which goes to jurisdiction.

Further the learned Presidents Counsel says that:

The said order of the AAT dated 02.11.2015 is also completely

illegal and arbitrary in that it purports to breach the

substantive rights of the petitioners by ante dating the

11

promotions of the 16th-51st respondents beyond the

appointment date of the petitioners-without having heard the

petitioners or without having considered the fundamental flaw

in the failure of the 16th-51st respondents to have made the

petitioners parties to the said Appeal No. AAT/179/2014

(PSC) and as such is contrary to the principles of natural

justice.

I hold that section 8(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunals Act

does not operate as a blanket prohibition on the Court of Appeal to

exercise writ jurisdiction over the decisions of the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal.

The part (a) of the first preliminary objection fails.

The part (b) of the first preliminary objection has no relevancy at

all to the present dispute.

Article 61A of the Constitution reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions of Article 59 and of Article 126, no

court or tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire

into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call into question

any order or decision made by the [Public Service]

Commission, a Committee, or any public officer, in pursuance

of any power or duty conferred or imposed on such

Commission, or delegated to a Committee or public officer,

under this Chapter or under any other law.

Article 61A of the Constitution provides immunity from legal

proceedings of the decisions of the Public Service Commission and

not those of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As held by the

12

Supreme Court in Ratnayake v. Administrative Appeals Tribunal

[2013] 1 Sri LR 331, Article 61A of the Constitution has no

application to the decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal

and there is no corresponding provision in the Constitution which

ousts the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal conferred by Article

140 of the Constitution in regard to the decisions of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

The part (b) of the first preliminary objection also fails.

Let me now quote the second preliminary objection of the said

respondents:

The application of the petitioners can not be maintained since

the issue before this Court has already been judicially

determined by the Supreme Court with special observation

that the dispute in question warrants no judicial review as a

matter of a legal issue and/or violation of law to be

questioned in relation to a decision of Public Service

Commission but to be addressed by way of administrative

procedures.

What the respondents attempt to say here, if I understand

correctly, is that the matter is res judicata. I have no reservation

to dismiss that objection unhesitatingly. What has happened is,

after the Public Service Commission refused the application of the

16th-51st respondents for promotions, the said respondents have

gone before the Supreme Court by way of a Fundamental Rights

Application (SC/FR/78/2013). The Supreme Court has refused to

grant leave to proceed with the observation (not a ruling) that the

grievance of those officers may be addressed by way of

13

appropriate administrative procedures thereby indirectly

intimating that they can go before the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal against the decision of the Public Service Commission as

provided for by Article 59(2) of the Constitution. That observation

can by no stretch of imagination operate as res judicata or judicial

determination by the Supreme Court which prevents this Court

from exercising writ jurisdiction in order to probe the vires of the

decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

This leads me to consider the third preliminary objection of the

respondents. It reads as follows:

The application of the petitioner has become redundant and

therefore cannot be maintained since;

(1) The decision of the AAT/179/2014 which is sought

to be reviewed by the application of the petitioner

has been already complied and acted upon and by

the Public Service Commission with necessary and

further directions

and therefore,

(2) The decision in force and operative in relation to the

issue before Court to be determined at present is a

decision of the Public Service Commission which has

been constitutionally declared to be immune from

legal proceedings in any manner whatsoever other

than in terms of the Article 126 of the Constitution.

(vide R1)

The Public Service Commission at the beginning refused the

application of the 16th-51st respondents for appointment as

14

Assistant Superintendent of Customs Grade II. In appeal to the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal as provided for by Article 59(2) of

the Constitution, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal changed the

decision of the Public Service Commission and allowed the appeal

of the said respondents. It is this decision of the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal which the Public Service Commission was

compelled to implement. There is no independent decision taken

by the Public Service Commission which attracts immunity in

terms of Article 61A of the Constitution. If the decision of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal is removed, there is nothing for

the Public Service Commission to implement. If the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal decision is bad, everything which flaws from it

also becomes bad.

Lord Denning in Macfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd. [1961] 3 ALL ER

1169 at 1172 stated thus:

If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only bad,

but incurably bad. There is no need for an order of the court

to set it aside. It is automatically null and void. Without more

ado, though it is sometimes convenient to have the court

declare it to be so. And every proceeding which is founded on

it is also bad and incurably bad. You cannot put something

on nothing and expect it to stay there. It will collapse.

This passage was quoted with approval by G.P.S. de Silva J. (later

C.J.) in Rajakulendran v. Wijesundera [1982] 1 Sri Kantha LR 164

at 168-169.

15

This principle was applied by the Supreme Court in the recent case

of Padmal Ariyasiri Mendis v. Vijith Abraham de Silva [2016] BLR 69

at 73 where it was held that:

The deed No. 1551 is void ab initio and therefore the title does

not pass from the plaintiff to any other person. Therefore

deed which was executed thereafter, i.e. deed No. 976 is also

void ab initio.

The third preliminary objection is also unsustainable.

Preliminary objections are overruled.

The costs of this inquiry will abide the final outcome of the

application.
