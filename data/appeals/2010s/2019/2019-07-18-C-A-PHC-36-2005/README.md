Before: K.K. Wickramasinghe, J.

Counsel: Gamini Senanayake for the Appellant.

Nalin Ladduwahetti, P.C., for the Respondents.

Decided on: 18.07.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner-Respondent (Petitioner) received the Notice marked

P4 from the Respondent-Appellant, Colombo Municipal Council

(CMC) asking the Petitioner to demolish the unauthorized addition

made to the upstairs section of the condominium property within

one week. Then the Petitioner made an application to the CMC to

regularize the said unauthorized construction. The CMC sent P12

dated 05.03.1999 to inform the Petitioner their inability to process

the said application as no consent of the ground floor owner of the

said property has been obtained for that addition.

The Petitioner filed this application in the High Court seeking to

quash P12 by way of writ of certiorari and compel the CMC to

process his application to regularize the unauthorized construction

by way of writ of mandamus.

The CMC in paragraph 19 of their statement of objections has

stated that consent of the ground floor owner is a must in terms of

by-law 2(dd) of the Second Schedule of the Apartment Ownership

Law, No.11 of 1973, as amended by Apartment Ownership (Special

Provisions) Act, No.4 of 1999.

3

It is significant to note that the Apartment Ownership (Special

Provisions) Act, No.4 of 1999, by which the said by-law was

introduced was certified by the Speaker on 10.03.1999. Hence it is

illogical to say that P12 dated 05.03.1999 was based on the said

by-law which became law on 10.03.1999.

Therefore the conclusion of the High Court that the writs prayed

for shall be issued is correct.

The CMC has also taken up a jurisdictional objection in paragraph

21(f) of the statement of objections, which has been rejected by the

High Court. The way it has been taken, it is clear that, the CMC

was not very serious on the said jurisdictional objection.

Otherwise they would have, I am certain, taken up that objection

not in paragraph 21(f) of the objections, but in paragraph 1, if not

by way of a motion, no sooner had they received notice of the

application. By that paragraph the CMC says that the Urban

Development Authority acting under section 23(5) of the Urban

Development Authority Law, No.41 of 1978, as amended, has

delegated its powers with regard to planning within the city of

Colombo to the CMC by the document marked R2, and the CMC is

therefore acting under the said delegated power, but the Urban

Development Authority is not a devolved subject, and therefore

High Court has no jurisdiction to hear the matter.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the CMC that, the

subject under consideration does not come under Provincial

Council List of the Ninth Schedule to the Thirteenth Amendment to

the Constitution, and it comes under item 5 of the Concurrent List,

4

and therefore the Provincial High Court cannot exercise writ

jurisdiction over that matter.

Notwithstanding the Urban Development Authority does not come

under the Provincial Council List, once the Urban Development

Authority delegates its powers on planning to the local authority in

accordance with law, the exercise of that power by the local

authority comes, in my view, under item 4 of the Provincial Council

List, and therefore the Provincial High Court is clothed with the

jurisdiction to deal with that matter.

I might add that the 4th Respondent Urban Development Authority

does not take up such a position, and the Urban Development

Authority has not even filed objections to the application of the

Petitioner notwithstanding it was fully represented by a State

Counsel in the High Court. Now I find that the CMC in filing this

appeal has dropped the 4th Respondent Urban Development

Authority altogether for reasons best known to them.

I take the view that Provincial High Court of the Western Province

had the jurisdiction to inquire into the vires of P12 issued by the

CMC by way of writ.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
