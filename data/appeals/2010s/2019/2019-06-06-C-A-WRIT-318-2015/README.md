Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner (Hilton International Colombo) filed this

application seeking to quash by way of certiorari the order of the

1st respondent (Commissioner General of Labour) dated

10.03.2015 marked P9 whereby the petitioner was ordered to

pay a sum of Rs.978,900/= to the 3rd respondent (Medical

Doctor) as gratuity on the basis that the 3rd respondent was an

employee (as opposed to an independent contractor) of the

petitioner from 01.06.1987-01.03.2012 (nearly 25 years).

It is the position of the petitioner that the 3rd respondent was

not an employee but an independent contractor and therefore

the petitioner is not obliged in law to pay gratuity to the 3rd

respondent.

So much has been written and so many theories/tests have

been evolved on how to distinguish an employee from an

independent contractor. However, whether a person is an

employee or an independent contractor is purely a question of

fact to be decided on unique facts and circumstances of each

individual case. In this process, labels, designations, particular

terms used by the employer in Agreements entered into between

the two parties etc. are, more often than not, misleading and not

binding.

The petitioner has advertised for the post of Medical Officer of

Hilton International Colombo. In response, the 3rd respondent

has applied for the said post by application dated 22.11.1986.1

By the letter dated 27.05.1987, the General Manger of the

petitioner has inter alia informed the 3rd respondent that we

decided to obtain your services as the Medical Officer of the Hotel

1 Page 48 of the Petition.

effective 1st June 1987 subject to the terms discussed with you.2

By letter dated 11.03.1996, the Director Personnel of the

petitioner has written to a third party This is to certify Dr.

L.P.V.E. Jayaweera (the 3rd respondent) was employed from 1987

July to date as our Chief Medical Officer. He is being paid a

monthly remuneration for the services rendered.3 By letter dated

15.03.1989, the Resident Manager of the petitioner has been

informed that As decided by the Management, Dr. L.P.V.

Jayaweera-the Hotel Medical Officer is to be extended 50%

discount on Food & Beverage excluding Banquets as in the case

of other Department heads. He is also to be extended with the

facility of using the Hotel Sports & Fitness Centre.4 The 3rd

respondent has used hotel letterheads with the Heading Hilton

Colombo Medical Clinic when writing prescriptions and internal

memos.5 Even in 1999, by letter dated 09.07.1999, the

Management has recognized the 3rd respondent as the In-house

Doctor Hilton Colombo/Hotel Doctor.6 In 2003, by letter dated

23.05.2003, the General Manager of the petitioner has

addressed the 3rd respondent as the House Doctor Hilton

Colombo.7

However in this letter dated 23.05.2003 the General Manager of

the petitioner has suggested to the 3rd respondent some terms to

be included in a formal Agreement to be entered into between

the two parties to provide professional medical services as a

service provider for an initial period of two years to be renewed on

an annual basis thereafter.8

This letter has been replied by the 3rd respondent by letter dated

10.06.2003.9 In that letter, the 3rd respondent, whilst

emphasizing that he has been functioning as the Medical Officer

in charge of Colombo Hilton from the inception of the hotel for

well over 17 years at that time and being on call for 24 hours

every day of the year, has stated that if he signs the Agreement

in the way it has been suggested in that letter, status quo will

change and he wants same status quo to remain.

This has been replied by the General Manager by letter

01.07.2003 and stated therein that the only relationship the

hotel had with the 3rd respondent was for you (the 3rd

respondent) to provide your professional services for a fee and

further stated that failure to respond to that letter before

28.07.2003 will result in retaining the services of another

Doctor.10

It is clear that one of the main purposes of insisting on entering

into a formal Agreement was the desire of the petitioner to

manifest that the 3rd respondent was not an employee of the

petitioner.

The first Agreement for 01.09.2003-31.08.2005 has been signed

on 01.09.2003.11 In this Agreement the 3rd respondent has been

identified not as the Hotel Doctor of Hilton Colombo but as the

service provider, and clause 12 particularly states that It is

hereby expressly agreed by and between the Hotel and the

Service Provider that this is a contract for services and that

nothing in the agreement shall be construed to mean and create

a relationship as Employer/Employee between parties. This

9 Page 161. 10 Pages 162-163. 11 Pages 3-4.

5

clause is, as I have already stated, not decisive and the Court is

free to disregard it if the other circumstances point to the fact

that there was a relationship of employer and employee.

When it is up to the Court to decide whether there was a

relationship of employer and employee between the parties on

the totality of the evidence, the inclusion of such a clause into

the Agreement by the employer, in my view, shows mala fides on

part of the employer to cover the true relationship.

In this Agreement instead of the words monthly salary of

Rs.40,000/= a fee of Rs.40,000 per month have been used.

According to the Agreement the 3rd respondent shall inter alia

conduct two medical clinics per day on weekdays at 8.30 am-

9.30 am and 3.30 pm-4.30 pm and the 3rd respondent shall

personally conduct the clinic at least three days a week. The 3rd

respondent shall be available on call for 24 hours on all days

himself or doctors assisting him. Thereafter, periodically,

Agreements have been entered into up to 31.08.2012.12

The main contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner is that the fact that the 3rd respondent could delegate

his work to another militates against having an employer-

employee relationship between the parties. The learned Counsel

cites The Times of Ceylon Ltd v. Nidahas Karmika Saha Velanda

Sevaka Samitiya (1960) 50 NLR 126 in support. The facts are

clearly distinguishable. In the Times of Ceylon Ltd case the

alleged employee was a delivery peon who distributed

newspapers on subscribers on payment of a monthly

commission, which could be done by himself or through

somebody. But in the instant case, the 3rd respondent medical 12 Pages 5-19.

doctor who got a fixed monthly salary had to conduct medical

clinics in the hotel 3 days out of 5 weekdays and his assistant

doctors who could do the other 2 days shall be doctors

acceptable to the hotel. On call duty for 24 hours on all days

shall be done by himself or doctors assisting him acceptable to

the hotel.

The next submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner is that the 3rd respondents service is not integrated

into the hospitality services provided by the Hilton Hotel and

therefore the 3rd respondent fails in the integration test. The

learned counsel cites clauses 5 and 6 of the Agreements

whereby the petitioner agreed to pay a fee of Rs.200/= per head

for certification of the medical fitness of prospective employees

and payment of consultation fee by the hotel guests. These are

extra earnings in addition to his monthly fee (salary) of

Rs.40,000/= which increased up to Rs.62,750/= by the time of

signing the last Agreement. Extra earnings shall be separated

from the fixed salary.

The belated complaint of the petitioner that no proper inquiry

was conducted as no oral evidence was permitted is

unacceptable. The petitioner has been fully represented by a

leading law firm and the petitioner has been given a fair hearing.

I am not inclined to disturb the finding of the Commissioner of

Labour. Application is dismissed with costs.
