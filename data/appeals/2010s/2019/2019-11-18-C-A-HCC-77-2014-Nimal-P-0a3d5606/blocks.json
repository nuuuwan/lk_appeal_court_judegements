There is no reference to the 'defence evidence' of the case, let alone an analysis of evidence of the defence and conclusions the court had reached from such evidence. The only inference that can be drawn from the said failure is that, when the learned High Court Judge considered the evidence of the case, she has not given due consideration to the defence evidence of the case. In fact, the consideration of evidence by the learned High Court Judge has been completely one-sided and in favour of only the prosecution. Therefore, this Court concludes that the learned High Court Judge has arrived at the finding of 'guilh/ upon only considering the evidence led by the Prosecution. Thus, this Court observes considerable merit in the submissions made on behalf of the Appellant by the learned President's Counsel for the Appellant.",

    "text": "A criminal trial in Sri Lanka's system of administration of justice is an adversarial process in which both sides to the case, i.e. the prosecution and defence are entitled to present evidence in support of their respective cases. Unless the Accused pleads 'guilh/ to the charge, the prosecution is obliged by law to present evidence and prove its case beyond 'reasonable doubt'. Unlike the prosecution, the defence is not obliged to present evidence. However, the defence is entitled to present evidence. Either by impugning the evidence of the prosecution and / or by presenting defence evidence, the duty cast on the defence is to create a 'reasonable doubt' regarding the case for the prosecution. The overall scheme relating to the procedure to be followed in the conduct of criminal trials as contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act is in conformity with the rules of 'natural justice'. The rules of natural justice require the judge who is called upon to adjudicate, to do so, objectively, after hearing and considering the evidence presented on behalf of both the prosecution and the defence. Objective consideration of evidence requires the judge to take into consideration all relevant facts and disregard any irrelevant facts. In",
