This case (CA/WRIT/98/2012) is connected to three more cases:

CA/WRIT/82/2011, CA/WRIT/61/2012 & CA/WRIT/73/2012.

As the relief sought by the Petitioners in all four connected cases

is the same, learned counsel for the parties, despite making

1 No written submissions have been filed on behalf of the 12th Respondent.

4

submissions separately, agreed to abide by a single Judgment to

be delivered in this case. The issue in all the cases is whether or

not the Government Surveyors can do private practice under the

present Law.

With the approval of the Minister of Land and Land

Development2, and the permission granted by the Secretary to

the said Ministry3, and also upon passing by majority vote at the

Land Survey Council4, by the Field Staff Circular No.5/2011

dated 25.11.2011 of the Surveyor General, private practice to

the Government Surveyors has been allowed subject to strict

terms and conditions.5

It is this Circular, the Petitioners, being Registered Surveyors

purely engaging in private practice, seek to quash by way of writ

of certiorari in these proceedings. This the Petitioners do

predominantly on the basis that it would adversely affect or

rather dilute their own practice.

According to the Circular, the Secretary to the Ministry has

imposed two conditions:6

(i) Subject to the other conditions imposed from time to

time by the Surveyor General, in addition to the rules

and conditions relating to appointment

2 Vide 12R7 filed by the 12th Respondent with his Statement of Objections dated 09.11.2012. 3 Vide 12R8. 4 Vide 7R4 tendered by the 7th-9th Respondents with their Statement of Objections dated 04.09.2012. 5 Vide the Circular marked P3 (Sinhala) by the Petitioner, and 12R9 (English) by the 12th Respondent with his Statement of Objections. 6 Vide 12R9.

5

(ii) Private practice should be based on Annual Practising

Licence and it is strictly limited to outside Government

office hours and public holidays only.

In terms of (i) above, the Surveyor General has for the time being

imposed 15 conditions.7 They are as follows:

1. All the officers in the Sri Lanka Surveyors Service who

are qualified to register in the Land Survey Council

according to the Survey Act, No. 17 of 2002 are

considered to be eligible to obtain annual licence.

2. The Surveyor General shall not recommend to obtain

annual licence to an officer, who has not satisfactorily

completed the duties assigned to the officer in the

previous year or who has been subjected to ongoing

disciplinary inquiry or who has been punished by a

disciplinary inquiry during the last 5 years or who has

caused loss or discredit to the Survey Department.

3. The officers may be called upon for urgent duties

required by the Surveyor General during the weekends

and public holidays and the officer should adhere to

such orders.

4. All the rules and regulations applicable to Registered

Licensed Surveyors with regard to the usage of old plans

and other documents for surveying and preparation of

plans are also obeyed. In case of an officer who belongs

to Sri Lanka Surveyors Service while engaged in private

7 Vide 12R9.

6

practice, prepares a plan using an old statutory plan, the

officer is liable to provide the information to Surveyor

General at any point of time, as to how the details of old

plan were obtained.

5. Priority should be given to surveys required by the

government and important surveys should be completed

on time. One has to complete a specified quantity of

work and above matters should be evaluated once in six

months and the officers are subject to cancellation of

licence if the Surveyor General is reported that the

officers duties are hindered.

6. All officers who obtain permission for private practice

should follow accepted office hours of the Government to

ensure that the office time is used for Government

duties.

7. The officers who engage in private practice should never

use in any manner the departmental resources for

private work and if any such incident is disclosed,

action will be taken to recommend cancellation of the

licence with immediate effect in addition to taking

disciplinary action against the officers.

8. The approval of the Surveyor General should be obtained

by the District Snr. Supdt. of Surveys to assign the

statutory surveys, that shall be carried out by the

Surveyor General under Departmental supervision, to

the Licensed Surveyors in the Survey Department.

7

Surveyor General shall appoint an officer to supervise

such surveys.

9. Legal or administrative matters related to private surveys

performed by any officer are governed by Survey Act,

No. 17 of 2002 and if it is reported that the Department

is discredited due to such matters, action will be taken

to recommend cancellation of the licence with immediate

effect in addition to follow up disciplinary procedure.

10. Application for annual practising licence should be

submitted to the Land Survey Council with the

recommendation of the Surveyor General in the month of

July in all the years in which the officer is qualified.

11. An officer in the Surveyors Service who obtained

permission for private practice is prohibited from

engaging in a private survey on a plan prepared by the

officer for a duty, within one year.

12. The officers, who apply for private practice, should

maintain 100% progress in the previous year as well as

up to month of June in the year of application submitted,

and also during the completed previous year.

13. The recommendation for issuing of licence to officers in

Surveyors Service in the post of Supdt. of Surveys and

higher, will be done by the Surveyor General based on

recommendation by the supervising officer.

8

14. The premises used as officers of the Survey Department

should not be used for private practice under any

circumstances.

15. The application form attached to this circular should be

used to get the approval for private practice.

The Private Surveyors say that a similar move by the

Government Surveyors by Circular No.5/1992 dated 05.02.1992

was successfully thwarted by way of another writ application.

The said Judgment of the Supreme Court is The Surveyors

Institute of Sri Lanka v. The Surveyor General, reported in [1994]

2 Sri LR 319. Therefore, they argue that the matter is res

judicata and shall be dismissed in limine.8 I have no hesitation

in rejecting that argument for the reasons stated below.

At the time that Judgment was delivered by the Supreme Court,

the subject of land surveying was governed by the Land Surveys

Ordinance, No.4 of 1866, as amended, and the Surveyors

Ordinance, No.15 of 1889, as amended. These two Ordinances

were repealed and replaced by Survey Act, No.17 of 2002, which

is now in operation.

Under the Surveyors Ordinance, all the powers regarding land

surveying were centered around the Surveyor General. The

Surveyor General was empowered inter alia to grant and cancel

Annual Licences and to regulate the conduct of surveyors. He

had the sole authority, under section 4 of the Ordinance, to

issue Annual Licences basically to those who pass the

8 Vide page 5 of the written submissions of the Petitioner dated 31.10.2018 filed (by Dr. Sunil Cooray) in CA/WRIT/682/2011.

9

examination to practice as Land Surveyors. Section 6 of the

Ordinance inter alia stated that a surveyor who has served in the

Survey Department was entitled to an Annual Licence without

passing the examination.

In the said case, when the decision of the Surveyor General to

call for applications from the Government Surveyors for the

issuance of Annual Licences to do private practice was

challenged before this Court, this Court has held with the

Surveyor General taking the view that the expression has

served referred to in section 6 read with item 9 of Schedule A,

could also include a person who was in service at the time he

made the application for an Annual Licence.

In appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the Judgment of this

Court mainly relying on section 18 of the Ordinance, which

stated that the procedure set out in the preceding sections of the

Ordinance regarding licensing shall not apply to any Land

Surveyor for the time being in the service of the Ceylon Survey

Department.

The repealed Ordinance thus allowed only the surveyors not in

the employment of the Survey Department to obtain Annual

Licences to practice land surveying.

Kulatunga J. on behalf of the Supreme Court at page 323 stated

that:

It is apparent that the provisions of sections 2-17 of the

Ordinance are essentially applicable to the licensing and

regulation of private surveyors; and section 18 provides

10

Nothing hereinbefore contained shall apply to any land

surveyor for the time being in the service of the Ceylon

Survey Department.

Accordingly, Kulatunga J. at pages 324-325 concluded thus:

After giving consideration to the submissions of parties, I

am satisfied that the effect of section 18 is clearly to confine

the persons exempted by section 6 from the requirement of

having to pass the examination to persons mentioned in

paragraph 9 of the Schedule who have ceased to hold office

in the Survey Department. I agree that the Court below has

misdirected itself by interpreting the Schedule

independently of section 6; in the result, it failed to consider

the impact of section 18 on section 6.

As regards the appellants submission that the

Surveyor-General holding office for the time being is clearly

without power to grant a licence to himself in view of the

anomaly which would result if he could do so, the Court

considered it irrelevant in ascertaining the intention of the

legislature. This too is a misdirection.

I hold that the Field Staff Circular No. 05/92 dated

05.02.92 is ultra vires and its implementation is in excess

of the 1st Respondents power to grant annual licences to

land surveyors under the Ordinance.

Then it is clear that the Supreme Court set aside the Judgment

of this Court and held with the Private Surveyors on two

grounds:

11

(i) Failure on the part of the Court of Appeal to consider

section 18 of the Ordinance, and

(ii) The anomaly which would be created if the Surveyor

General could issue a Licence to himself.

The Law was drastically changed by Survey Act, No. 17 of 2002.

By the new Act the powers of the Surveyor General were

substantially pruned and conferred the same on the newly

created Land Survey Council, a body corporate with perpetual

succession which can sue and be sued in such name.

After the new Act, inter alia, maintaining standards and

procedures relating to land surveying, registration of surveyors

and issuance of certificates of registration, issuance of Annual

Practising Licences to practise land surveying are within the

purview of the Council, and not the Surveyor General. Hence

the anomaly that the Supreme Court was anxious to avoid will

not arise under the new Act.

Further, there is no section in the new Act similar to section 18

of the Surveys Ordinance, which made the sections as to

issuance of Annual Licences inapplicable to Government

Surveyors.

Let me now consider whether the new Act permits issuance of

Annual Practising Licences to Government Surveyors which

would enable them to do private practice.

Section 39(1) of the Survey Act of 2002 states:

12

From or after the date of commencement of this Act no

person, other than a person who possesses the qualification

specified in the Schedule hereto and has obtained

registration with the Council and has been issued with a

certificate of registration which is for the time being in force,

may engage in land surveying.

There is no dispute that under sections 39 and 40 of the new

Act, all the surveyorsGovernment and Privateneed to be

registered in the Land Survey Council in order to engage in land

surveying. Those who have so registered are known as

Registered Surveyors. Be it noted that there was no such

requirement for registration for the Government Surveyors

under the repealed Surveyors Ordinance.

Section 41(1) of the Act reads as follows:

Every registered surveyor who is desirous of practising or

attempting or professing to practise land surveying, shall

apply to the Council for an Annual Practising licence.

Every Registered Surveyor issued with an Annual Practising

Licence is known as Registered Licensed Surveyor.

The proviso to section 41(1) states:

Provided however, Registered Surveyors in the Survey

Department engaging in land surveying under the

supervision of the Surveyor General shall not be required to

obtain an Annual Practising Licence for the purpose of

engaging in land surveying on behalf of the Government.

13

I am unable to agree with the argument of the Private Surveyors

that:

[T]he legislature has created such a distinction with the use

of a proviso to section 41(1) for the sole purpose of

distinguishing professionally qualified surveyors in the

service of the government and those engaged in private

practice, and as section 41 does not empower the Council to

grant annual practising licences to surveyors belonging to

the government service, the decision of the Council to grant

such licences is clearly ultra vires.9

It is not correct to say that section 41 does not empower the

Council to grant annual practising licences to surveyors belonging

to the government service. What that section states is that every

Registered Surveyorwhether in Government Service or Private

Sectorwho wishes to practise land surveying shall obtain an

Annual Practising Licence, but a Registered Surveyor in the

Government Service need not obtain such an Annual Practising

Licence for land surveying on behalf of the Government. In

other words, the Government Surveyors shall also obtain Annual

Practising Licences if they are to practice land surveying not on

behalf of the Government. The qualification on behalf of the

Government is not without significance. The concession given

to the Government Surveyors when engaging in land surveying

on behalf of the Government cannot be interpreted to mean that

Land Survey Council is prohibited from issuing Annual

Practising Licences to Government Surveyors.

9 Vide page 3 of the written submissions filed (by Manohara De Silva, PC) on behalf of the 7th-9th Respondents with the motion dated 27.02.2019.

14

If the intention of the legislature was not to issue Annual

Practising Licences to Government Surveyors, the proviso to

section 41(1) could have been simply drafted in the following

manner.

Every registered surveyor who is desirous of practising or

attempting or professing to practise land surveying, shall

apply to the Council for an Annual Practising licence.

Provided however, Registered Surveyors in the Government

Service shall not be issued with Annual Practising Licences.

The requirement for the Council to maintain a Register, in terms

of section 42 of the Act, of all Registered Surveyors and

Registered Licensed Surveyors makes no difference. I cannot

accept the argument that this is where one register is divided

into two, and it is where a surveyor would fall into one list or the

other.10 That is to distinguish Registered Licensed Surveyors

from Registered Surveyors because all the Registered Surveyors

do not wish to and are not required to compulsorily register as

Registered Licensed Surveyors.

Section 44 is the crucial or central section in deciding this

question. Both partiesGovernment Surveyors and Private

Surveyorshave interpreted that section in their favour. That

section reads as follows:

10 Vide page 21 of the written submissions filed (by Sanjeeva Jayawardena, PC) with the motion dated 21.02.2019 on behalf of the Petitioner in CA/WRIT/73/2012.

15

A registered surveyor-

(a) may engage in land surveys in the service of the

Government and when authorized by the

Surveyor-General; or

(b) who holds an Annual Practising License, may

engage in the practice of land surveying for fee or

reward.

On behalf of the Private Surveyors much emphasis is placed on

the word or found between the two subsections. They say that

the word or is used there to clearly keep apart Government

Surveyors from Private Surveyors. It is further argued that:

[T]he legislature clearly used the term or between

subsections (a) and (b) of section 44 to stipulate that a

surveyor who falls within the category prescribed in section

44(a), i.e. surveyors of the Department cannot fall within

the category prescribed by section 44(b). There can be no

doubt that it can only be one or the other and not both.11

I regret my inability to agree with this argument.

After the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, Article 23 of the

Constitution states that: All laws and subordinate legislation

shall be enacted or made and published in Sinhala and Tamil,

together with a translation thereof in English. The first proviso

to that Article further states that Parliament shall, at the stage

of enactment of any law determine which text shall prevail in the

11 Ibid, page 19.

16

event of any inconsistency between texts. Section 67 of the

Survey Act states that: In the event of any inconsistency

between the Sinhala and Tamil texts of this Act, the Sinhala text

shall prevail.

Sinhala text of section 44 reads as follows:

()

;

()

.

It is the word which has been translated into

English as or, and not vice versa. In my view, the better, if not

the best, Sinhala translation of the word , in this

context, is otherwise. The word otherwise as a conjunction

means if not or or else.

On the other hand, if the Sinhala translation of the word

shall be taken as or, or is used as a conjunction

to link or connect two or more alternatives or possibilities.

Either way, translation of the word does not favour

the Private Surveyors.

Section 44 has not been introduced to draw a dichotomy

between Government Surveyors and Private Surveyors. That is,

17

in my view, to further amplify or explain in clearer terms what

has already been stated in section 41(1) and the proviso to it,

which I have already discussed above.

According to section 44, a Registered Surveyor (both

Government and Private) can engage in land surveying in two

instances:

(a) If in Government Service, when authorized by the

Surveyor General (in which case, no Annual

Practising License is required, and no fee or reward

can be accepted).

(b) If a holder of an Annual Practising License, for a fee

or reward.

The same position is reflected in (i) and (ii) of section 45(1)(c)

when dealing with professional misconduct, which is nothing

wrong.

Section 54 deals with continuing education to improve

knowledge and skills in land surveying of all the Registered

Surveyors. Section 54(2)(a) says that when a Registered

Surveyor who has been issued with an Annual Practising

Licence fails to comply with the requirements of continuous

education, he can be dealt with by the Council. Section 54(2)(b)

says that when a Registered Surveyor who is in the Government

Service fails to comply with such directions regarding continuing

education, he shall be dealt with by the Surveyor General. It is

significant to note that section 54(2)(b) speaks of Registered

Surveyors in Government Service in general without making a

18

distinction between those who have been issued with Annual

Practising Licences and those who have not been issued with

Annual Practising Licences. The subject of continuing education

for Government Surveyors in land surveying shall come under

their Head of the Department who is the Surveyor General. That

has nothing to do with issuance of Annual Practising Licences to

Government Surveyors.

Let me make this point clear. There cannot be an argument that

there is a difference between Surveyors in Government Service

and those who are not. That is not the issue although Private

Surveyors have taken enormous effort to portray such a

distinction within the Act. The issue is whether, within the

scheme of the Act, the former can be allowed to engage in

private land surveying for a fee (subject to conditions).

On behalf of the Private Surveyors it is vehemently submitted

that, if the legislature intended to issue Annual Practising

Licences for the Government Surveyors to engage in private

practice, it could have been expressly stated so in the Survey

Act.12 I beg to disagree. If the legislature intended not to issue

Annual Practising Licences for the Government Surveyors to

engage in private practice, then it should have been expressly

stated in the Act, and not vice versa. Nowhere in the Act does it

say that a Government Surveyor is prohibited from obtaining an

Annual Practising Licence. It is a well-accepted principle that

prohibitions cannot be presumed.

12 Vide page 7 of the written submissions of the Petitioner filed (by Weliamuna, PC) with the motion dated 18.10.2018.

19

Courts are not to act upon the principle that every procedure

is to be taken as prohibited unless it is expressly provided

for by the Code, but on the converse principle that every

procedure is to be understood as permissible till it is shown

to be prohibited by the law. As a matter of general principle

prohibition cannot be presumed.13

Another argument is that allowing private practice to

Government Surveyors violates the Establishments Code.

Section 1:4 of Chapter XXX of the Establishments Code states

that:

The permission of the Secretary is required before an officer

may undertake for a fee any work outside his normal

official duties. Permission will not be given unless it is not

shown that no other means of getting the work are

reasonably available.

There is no dispute that the permission of the Secretary has

been given for the Government Surveyors to do private practice

outside working hours subject to conditions. Whether no other

means of getting the work are reasonably available, has not

been put in issue in these proceedings.

It is significant to note that similar provisions are applicable for

Government Medical Officers to engage in private practice

outside duty hours under certain terms and conditions.14

13 Hevavitharana v. Themis de Silva (1961) 63 NLR 68 at 72, Tambiah, J. quoted with approval dictum of Mahmood, J. in Narasingh Das v. Mangal Dubey (1883) 5 Allahabad 163 at 172. 14 Vide last paragraph of 12R7.

20

Yet another argument is potential conflicts of interest with the

State if the Government Surveyors are allowed to do private

practice outside duty hours. It is a mistake to think that

conflicts of interest will emerge only if Government Surveyors

are allowed to do private practice. That can happen even during

the course of their official commitments. Conflicts of interest

can also arise in cases of surveyors who engage exclusively in

private practice. Under the new Act as the Council is the

controller of all the Registered Surveyors, Government and

Private alike, it appears that, when necessity demands, the

Council can assign Government land surveying to Private

Surveyors. Then the same argument will be applicable to Private

Surveyors as well. I might add that the prospect of conflict of

interest is relevant to any profession including legal profession

irrespective of whether one is a Judge, or a lawyer, in the official

or unofficial Bar. If there is a likelihood of a conflict of interest,

the officer concerned is expected to desist from such

engagements. Such degree of professionalism is expected not

only from the Government Surveyors but also from Private

Surveyors.

Connected to the above, the Private Surveyors argue that if

private practice is allowed for Government Surveyors, that will

impinge upon independence of the Surveyor General and his

officers.

Government Surveyors who engage in private practice will be

under strict scrutiny of the Surveyor General and necessary

checks and balances are put in place by the said Circular itself

to regulate such private practice. Private practice is not

21

automatic. Government Surveyor who wishes to do private

practice shall obtain a Licence from the Land Survey Council,

which can be extended annually, based on various factors

including the performances of the previous year. Permission to

private practice is subject to several conditions designed to

maintain the integrity and efficiency of the Survey Department.

More importantly, the conditions in the Circular are not fixed. If

those conditions are not adequate, more conditions can be

introduced both by the subject Minister and the Surveyor

General to address the particular issues.

The impugned Circular No. 5/2011 of the Surveyor General

whereby the Government Surveyors are permitted to do private

practice subject to the conditions stated therein is, in my view,

not ultra vires.

The application of the Petitioners is dismissed. In the facts and

circumstances of this case, I make no order as to costs.
