The Accused-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the judgment

of the Learned High Court Judge of Kalutara dated 08.12.2017 in case No. HC

186/2009.

Facts of the case:

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') was indicted

under three charges in the High Court of Kalutara, for committing Grave sexual

abuse on his daughter, an offence punishable under Section 365B (2)(b) of the

Penal Code as amended.

The appellant was convicted after trial and sentenced to 18 years rigorous

imprisonment for each charge and said sentences were ordered to run

concurrently. Additionally, a fine of Rs.60,000/= with a default term of 6

months simple imprisonment and Rs.300,000/= as compensation were ordered

to be paid to the victim.

Being aggrieved by the said convictions and the sentences, the appellant

preferred this appeal.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted following grounds of appeal,

in the written submissions;

1. Prosecution had failed to establish the date of offence.

2. Conviction is unsafe in view of the fact that the prosecutrix's evidence is

not credible.

Page 2 of 12

3. The appellant has been denied a fair trial as the defence has been

evaluated improperly.

4. The Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself in law and facts.

The incident relevant to the instant case is as follows;

The prosecutrix had testified that, the incidents took place about two years prior

to testifying, when she was in Grade 8 (Page 94 and 95 of the brief). At the time

of the trial, she was 16 years old. The prosecutrix testified that the appellant had

abused her 5 or 6 times. One incident had taken place when she was on her way

to the aunt's house to watch television with her two brothers and the appellant.

At this occasion, the brothers were going in front of her and she was going with

the appellant and the appellant had put her to the ground and had pressed his

penis against her vulva after removing her under garment (Page 100 of the

brief). The prosecutrix had not revealed this to anyone since the appellant had

threatened to kill her.

Another incident had taken place at home, when the mother of the prosecutrix

was away. The elder brother of the prosecutrix was asked to go to temple to get

beetle leaves. Thereafter, the appellant had put the prosecutrix on the bed and

pressed his penis on her vulva (Page 101 of the brief).

The third incident had taken place on a rock close to her home where the

appellant had pressed his penis against the prosecutrix's vulva.

The prosecutrix testified that she had to divulge this incident to her mother since

the appellant had told the mother about everything he had done to the daughter,

and the mother had questioned her. Therefore, the prosecutrix had revealed the

entire incident to her mother. Thereafter, the mother had taken the prosecutrix to

the Police Station. As per the prosecution evidence, the incident had taken place

three months prior to making the Police complaint (Page 107 of the Brief).

Page 3 of 12

The birth certificate of the prosecutrix was marked as 'P l' and it was admitted

by the defence under Section 420 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Page 108 of

the Brief).

The JMO, who examined the prosecutrix, testified that no injuries were found

but the possibility of a sexual abuse cannot be excluded as per the short history

given by the prosecutrix (Page 316 and 317 of the brief).

When the defence was called, the appellant made a dock statement denying the

commission of the offence. The appellant had taken up the position that he was

falsely implicated by his wife as he caught her with her paramour. The appellant

stated that his wife lodged a complaint at the police station asking for the

custody of the children and he denied the same. Thereafter, the wife challenged

him that she would send him to the prison and would take the custody of the

children. The appellant called witnesses to give evidence on his behalf and the

said witnesses testified to the effect that his wife had an affair with a person

called Neville.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the prosecution had failed

to establish the date of offence. As per the indictment, the sexual abuse was

committed during the period from 01.06.2007 to 17.01.2008. The Learned

Counsel for the appellant argued that the prosecution has failed to elicit any

evidence from the victim with regard to the date of the alleged incident and the

said date was not extracted from the prosecutrix even by way of a suggestion. It

was further argued that the prosecutrix had categorically stated that she could

not remember when this incident took place (Page 168 of the brief) and

therefore, the prosecution has failed to establish a vital ingredient of the charge

which is a serious lapse on the part of the prosecution.

In reply to the above contention, the Learned DSG for the respondent submitted

that the prosecutrix had clearly stated that the incident took place in latter part

Page 4 of 12

of 2007. I observe that the prosecutrix had t~stified that the incidents took place

about 3 months prior to making the complaint at the Police Station (Page 107 of

the brief). During the cross-examination, the prosecutrix answered that the first

incident of sexual abuse happened in the latter part of year 2007 when she was

in Grade 08 of the school (Page 138 of the brief).

In the instant case, the perpetrator was the father of the prosecutrix who was

normally expected to be in the same house with the prosecutrix regularly. Since

the appellant is closely associating the prosecutrix daily, it is quite impossible

for her to remember the exact date of offence. Further, the prosecutrix has

mentioned about 4 or 5 incidents of sexual abuse within the said period of time.

In the case ofR. V. Dossi [13 Cr.App.R. 158], it was held that,

"The first point taken on behalf of the appellant is that there was no

power to amend the indictment, and that when the jury found that the

appellant had not committed the acts charged against him on the day

specified in the indictment but on some other day or days they found him

Not Guilty and that that verdict must stand. It appears to us that that is

not a correct contention in law. From time immemorial a date specified

in an indictment has never been a material matter unless it is actually an

essential part of the alleged offence ...

Thus, though the date of the offence should be alleged in the indictment, it

has never been necessary that it should be laid according to truth unless

time is of the essence of the offence ... "

I am of the view that when a small child is abused by someone who is

associating herlhim on daily basis/more frequently, the victim would not be able

to specifY the exact same date of offence. It is more difficult to mention such a

specific date if the perpetrator has abused the victim in several occasions. In the

instant case, the prosecution has mentioned a specific period of 07 months,

Page 5 of 12

within which the appellant had abused the prosecutrix. Upon considering the

evidence of the prosecutrix, it is proved that she was abused in several

occasions within the mentioned period of time. Therefore, the first ground of

appeal should fail.

Now I wish to consider the 2nd ground of appeal in which it was contended that

conviction is unsafe in view of the fact that the prosecutrix's evidence was not

credible. The Learned Counsel for the appellant brought to the attention of this

Court, about the contradictions and omissions in the testimony of the

prosecutrix.

In the evidence of the prosecutrix, an omission was brought to the notice of

Court that she had failed to mention in her Police statement, that the appellant

told not to shout during the incident and he would kill her if she revealed the

incident to anyone (Page 133 and 148 of the brief). A contradiction was marked

as 'VI' from her Police statement that she had told the Police incident took

place at one Samantha ayya's tea estate she could not remember the name of the

owner of the tea estate during the trial. The prosecutrix had admitted in her

evidence that the appellant goes to work in the morning and returns back late in

the night and she had been with her mother. The Learned Counsel for the

appellant argued that a serious doubt arises as to why she did not divulge the

incident to her mother when the appellant was not home (Page 110 and 180 of

the brief).

The Learned DSG for the respondent replied to the above argument that, even

though the prosecutrix was cross examined in length by the defence Counsel, he

failed to mark any more contradictions or omissions in her evidence other than

what is mentioned above.

I observe that the Learned High Court Judge has evaluated the evidence of the

prosecutrix in a lengthy manner. The Learned High Court Judge has not acted

Page 6 of 12

on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix and he had considered whether her . version was corroborated by other witnesses. In this regard, the Learned High

Court Judge w'as satisfied that the version of the prosecutrix was corroborated

by the prosecution witnesses as well as the defence witness Darshana who was

the elder brother of the prosecutrix. The prosecutrix testified that she was

abused while going to watch TV at the house of her aunt and the said road was

narrow and was covered with trees. She further testified that her two brothers

were walking ahead of her and the appellant, so the appellant had opportunity to

abuse her. The investigating officer, Kamal Prasanna (PW 09), testified that he

examined the said road and it was a very narrow road which was covered with

trees. The relevant portion of evidence is reproduced as follows;

Considering these, the Learned High Court Judge came to the conclusion that in

fact the evidence of the prosecutrix was corroborated by other witnesses as well.

In the case of Premasiri V. Attorney General (2006) 3 Sri L.R 106, Justice E.

Basnayake observed that,

"The learned counsel complained that the accused was convicted on

uncorroborated evidence. There is no rule that there must in every case,

be corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand. (Gour on

Penal Law of India 11 th Edition page 2657 quoting Raghobgr Singhe vs.

State(2); Rameshwar, Kalyan Singh vs. State of Rajasthan(3)). It is well

settled law that a conviction for the offence of rape can be based on the

sole testimony of the prosecutrix if it is reliable, unimpeachable and there

is no infirmity. (Bhola Ram vs. State of Madhya Pradesh (4)). If the

evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon

without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particular.

The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background

of the entire case and the trial court must be alive to its responsibility and

Page 8 of 12

Website Copy Website Copy

be sensitive while dealing with cases ~nvolving sexual molestation. State

of Punjab vs. Gurmit Singhe(5).

The rule is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a

conviction in a case of rape, but the necessity of corroboration as a

matter of prudence, except where the circumstances make it unsafe to

dispense with it, must be present to the mind of the judge. (Schindra Nath

Biswas vs. State(6) ... " (Emphasis added)

In the case of B. Bhoghinbhai Hirjibhai V. State of Gujarat (AIR) 1983 SC

753, it was held that,

" ... in the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of

sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule is adding insult

to the injury. "

Therefore, it is clear that, our law as it stands today, allows the trial Judge to act

on the sole testimony of a prosecutrix if the said evidence appears to be

trustworthy and reliable. In this regard, the Judge must be completely satisfied

that the prosecutrix is speaking the truth and the version narrated by herlhim

creates a ring of truth. In the instant case, the Learned High Court Judge had

made the following observation;

Therefore, it is manifestly clear that the Learned High Court Judge was satisfied about the trustworthiness of the witness. It is trite law that the appellate Court

should not disturb the findings of the Trial Judge who has a better opportunity

of observing the witnesses and the case as a whole, unless such finding of the

Trial Judge is manifestly wrong [vide Dharmasiri V. Republic of Sri Lanka

(2010) 2 Sri LR 241 & Chaminda V. Republic of Sri Lanka (2009) 1 Sri L.R.

1441. Therefore, I do not see any merits in the 2nd ground of appeal.

Now [ wish to consider last two grounds of appeal together, in which it was

argued that the appellant had been denied a fair trial as the defence has been

evaluated improperly and the Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself in law

and facts.

The appellant, in his dock statement, stated that he had a dispute with his wife

as she was having an affair with another man and she had challenged him that

she would send him to prison and take the custody of the children. It was further

submitted that the defence witnesses also corroborated the fact that the

appellant's wife was having an affair with a man called Nevile.

I observe that the Learned High Court Judge was of the view that the victim's

mother having an affair with another man is not relevant to this case and the

evidence of defence witnesses proved to be false. The Learned High Court

Judge rejected the said evidence stating that the relatives of the appellant were

trying to get the appellant released by testifYing falsely. [ observe that the

Learned High Court Judge has evaluated the defence case properly and has

given reasons for his decision to reject the same.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the Learned High Court

Judge failed to consider the two different versions stated by the prosecutrix for

her belated complaint and further concluded that the above omission does not

go to the root of the case, which caused serious prejudice to the appellant. Since

Page 10 of 12

J have already addressed the issue of credibility of the prosecutrix under second ground of appeal, I do not wish to repeat the same again. For the above reasons,

the 3rd and 4th grounds of appeal too should fail.

In the case of Chaminda (Supra), it was held that,

"Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of a judge who had

come to a favourable finding with regard to the testimonial

trustworthiness of a witness whose demeanour and deportment had been

observed by the trial judge. This view is supported by the judicial

decision in Alwis Vs. Piyasena Fernando(3) wherein G.P.s. de Silva CJ

remarked thus: "It is well established that findings of primary facts by a

trial judge who hears and sees witness are not to be lightly disturbed on

I II " appea. ...

I observe that the Learned High Court Judge had evaluated all the evidence

placed before him properly and delivered a well-reasoned judgment. I see no

reason to interfere with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge.

Therefore, I affirm the convictions and the sentences dated 08.12.2017.

The appeal is hereby dismissed.
