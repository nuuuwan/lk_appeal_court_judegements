ACHALA WENGAPPULI, I.

This is a matter where the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants have

lodged an appeal to this Court, seeking intervention to set aside an order

of dismissal made by the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa

Province holden in Kegalle, upon their application to revise an order of

ejectment issued by the Magistrate's Court of Ruwanwella under Section 7

of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as amended.

In making an application for the issuance of an order of ejectment

against the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant, the Applicant-

2

Respondent- Respondent ( hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent" )

has described the State land In the schedule to his

application as a parcel of land, which is in extent of approximately 10

perches with a common boundary to the adjoining State land in respect of

which the said Appellant had been issued with a permit under the Land

Development Ordinance.

When she was summoned to show cause by the Magistrate's Court,

the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant stated in her affidavit that the

Respondent is not the Competent Authority who could seek her ejectment

and the land she is in possession is a land that had been encroached upon

by her father when it was referred to as part of Tantiriyagala Mukalana long

time ago. It is also stated by her; that at a subsequent stage, a permit was

issued in respect of the said land on 11.11.1982. The said permit was

tendered to the Magistrate's Court, marked as VI.

In fact, the application for her ejectment was initiated upon the

complaint of the Management of Sapumalkanda Estate, that had been

addressed to the Divisional Secretary of the area on 27.07.1999, informing

him of the encroachment by the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant onto

Estate land which is also State land.

She had been served with a quit notice dated 25.04.2000 by the

Respondent and upon her failure to handover vacant possession on the

due date as per the said notice, an application seeking her ejectment was

made to the Magistrate's Court by the Respondent on 03.06.2001.

In view of the position taken up by the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant, the Magistrate's Court, has in its order dated 02.05.2002,

3

observed that there is a confusion in relation to the description of

boundaries of the State land in respect of which an order of ejectment is

sought as described in the schedule to the application and the State land in

respect of which a permit had been issued in favour of the 1st Respondent

Petitioner-Appellant. Having noted that the Court had no power to call for

evidence in support of the boundaries, nonetheless it proceeded to issue an

order of ejectment as prayed for by the Respondent. In appreciating the

legitimate rights of the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant, the Court

made a further order to the effect that if and when a writ of execution is

sought, it had to be mad~ in relation to a survey plan.

As a result of this order, a tracing has been prepared by Sri Lanka

Survey Department. In the tracing No. KE/DHO/2007/99, the areas of

encroachment by the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had been clearly

demarcated by the Surveyor General and upon the material presented

before the Court, it made a further order on 27.07.2010 issuing the writ of

execution. At the time of making this subsequent order, the 2nd

intervenient Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (erroneously described as

2nd Accused-Petitioner-Appellant in the petition of appeal) sought to

intervene before the Magistrate's Court as an added party on the basis that

if a writ of execution is issued against the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant, his rights too would be substantially prejudiced.

The Magistrate's Court has refused the 2nd intervenient-Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellant's application to intervene in making the said order on

27.07.2010.

4

With their joint application to revise the said orders of the

Magistrate's Court, the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant and the 2nd

intervenient-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the "Appellants") sought to challenge them before the Provincial High

Court, on the basis that the Respondent had no authority to make an

application for ejectment since he is not the Competent Authority over the

State land. The Appellants also claimed that the order of the Magistrate's

Court made on 02.05.2002 has been made per incuriam.

The Provincial High Court, by its order dated 10.08.2012 dismissed

the revision application filed by the Appellants. It has held since the

Magistrate's Court has clearly excluded the portions of State land that

overlap on the land in respect of which the order of ejectment was made, it

finds no illegality in the impugned order and therefore the Appellants

have failed to establish any exceptional circumstances that warranted its

intervention.

In support of their appeal before this Court, the Appellants

contended that;

1. the Respondent has failed to properly identify the State

land,

11. the order of the Magistrate's Court on 02.05.2002 had

been issued without properly identifying the land,

111. the said order could not be executed,

iv. the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant has not

encroached onto any State land as per the tracing,

5

v. the Competent Authority had no authority to make the

application for ejectment,

vi. the Appellants are not guilty of laches,

VB. the Appellants have shown exceptional circumstances.

It is clear from the above grounds of appeal, that the Appellants are

under a clear misconception about the jurisdiction of the Magistrate's

Court, when an application under Section 5(1)(b) of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 and when it proceeds to inquire . from a Respondent, to whom summons were served and who has

appeared before Court and inform that he has cause to show as to why an

order of ejectment should not be made against him.

This Court has in numerous judgments expressed its view on the

scope of the inquiry under Section 9(1) of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act.

Section 9 of the said Act is as follows;

II (1) At such inquiry the person on whom summons under

section 6 has been served shall not be entitled to

contest any of the matters stated in the application

under section 5 except that such person may establish

that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon

a valid permit or other written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law and that

such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or

otherwise rendered invalid.

6

(2) It shall not be competent to the Magistrate I s Court to

call for any evidence from the competent authority in

support of the application under section 5."

It is evident from plain reading of the provisions contained in

Section 9(1), the Legislature did not envisage a situation where legal

competency or the standing of a Competent Authority to make an

application under Section 5, should be allowed to contest by a Respondent,

after such an application for ejectment has been filed before the . Magistrate's Court in view of the statutory provisions contained therein.

Section 5(1)(a)(i) requires the Competent Authority to declare that

"he is a competent authority for the purposes of this Act." Cumulative effect of

the provisions contained in both subsections of Section 9 clearly has taken

away any opportunity to contest that assertion by a Respondent named in

such an application since sub Section 9(1) states " ... the person on whom

summons under section 6 has been served shall not be entitled to contest any of the

matters stated in the application under section 5 ... If. Section 6(2) restricts any

Magistrate's Court to " ... call for any evidence from the competent authority in

support of the application under section 5." Thus, when a Competent

Authority asserts in an application under Section 5 that "he is a competent

authority for the purposes of this Act" any person on whom summons under

section 6 has been served shall not be entitled to contest that fact before the

Magistrate's Court.

7

This position has been clearly laid down in Farook v Gunewardene,

Government Agent, Amparai(1980) 2 Sri L.R. 243 as follows;

"At the inquiry before the Magistrate, the only plea by wat{

of d~fence that the petitioner can pu t forward is "that he is in

possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or

other written authority of the State granted in accordance

with any written law and that such permit or authority is in

force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid. II Section

9(2) is to the effect that the Magistrate cannot call for any

evidence from the competent authority in support of the

application under section 5, which means that the

Magistrate cannot call upon the competent authority to

prove that the land described in the schedule to the

application is a State land." (emphasis added).

In respect of the complaint by the Appellants that the Court faulted

by "not identifying the corpus", it mu~t be observed that, in view of the

above quoted provisions of law, there is no legal requirement imposed on

the Magistrate's Court to "identify the corpus" prior to issuance of an order

of ejectment, if sought by a Competent Authority under Section 5 of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

The Magistrate's Court, in this instance, ex mere motu, directed the

Respondent to make out a survey plan with definite and identifiable

boundaries. This situation is an unfortunate result of the irresponsible

8

conduct of the public officials who were concerned with the issuance of a

permit under Land Development Ordinance in favour of the 1st

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant, for a parcel of State land which shared a

common boundaries with another larger extent of State land, gossessed by

another entity at that time identified as Deegala Estate.

The schedule to the said permit, which had been issued in respect of

a parcel of a State land in an extent of 1/2 an acre, had made no reference to

a plan in describing the boundaries in respect of the State land to which

the said permit was issued. Instead, the permit merely refers to following

boundaries in its description of the State land;

North Public Road

East Deegala Estate

South Deegala Estate

West Dried stream.

It appears that someone made a visual description of the boundaries

to the State land described in the said permit. The tracing prepared by the

Surveyor General upon the direction of the Magistrate's Court clearly

shows that all the lands which are located to the south of the Dehiowita-

Deraniyagala public road are State lands, inclusive of the parcel that had

been described in the permit issued to 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

and the lands described as Deegala Estate.

The Magistrate's Court had taken a pragmatic approach when it

foresaw that there could be a difficulty in executing its writ if it is issued as

9

per the schedule to the application and therefore directed the Respondent

to produce a survey plan. This course of action adopted by the

Magistrate's Court, though not legally sanctioned by any of the provisions

of the said Act, could not be faulted due to the peculiar circumstances of

this appeal. The 2nd order that had been made by the Magistrate's Court on

27.07.2010, was in relation to the said clearly demarcated and identified

parcel of State land, which had already been described in the schedule to

the application of the Respondent.

The Magistrate's Court, in advising the Appellants as to their legal

entitlement in view ot its order of ejectment, has explained to the

Appellants of the provisions contained in Sections 12 and 13 of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

In dismissing the Appellant's application for reVISIOn of the

ejectment orders by the Magistrate's Court, the Provincial High Court had

correctly decided that there is no illegality in the orders that had been

canvassed before it.

It has been stated in Divisional Secretary Kalutara and another v

Jayatissa SC Appeal Nos. 246,247,249 & 250/2014 - decided on 04.08.2017,

that in considering revision applications, a Court would take in to account

that;

/I if relief to be granted, the party seeking the relief has to

establish that, not only the impugned order is illegal, but also

the nature of the illegality is such, that it shocks the

conscience of the Court. /I

10

The material presented before the Provincial High Court by the

Appellant does not qualify under any of these considerations.

Therefore, it is our considered opinion that the appeal of the

Appellants is devoid of any merit. In the circumstances, the appeal of the

Appellants stands dismissed with costs fixed at Rs.l0,OOO.OO.
