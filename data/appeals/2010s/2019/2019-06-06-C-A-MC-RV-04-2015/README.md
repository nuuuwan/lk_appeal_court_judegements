Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The complainant-petitioner (petitioner) filed this application

seeking to revise the Judgment of the Magistrates Court dated

05.12.2014.

The petitioner instituted this action against the accused-

respondent (respondent) in the Magistrates Court under section

25(1)(a) of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act, No.2 of

1990 and sections 386 and 403 of the Penal Code upon three

dishonoured cheques marked at the trial P1-P3.

At the trial the petitioner and the respondent gave evidence. A

Bank officer was also called by the petitioner.

After trial the learned Magistrate has acquitted the respondent

on the basis that charges have not been proved beyond

reasonable doubt.

The respondent in his evidence has categorically admitted that

he put the dates and signed all three cheques and gave them to

the petitioner. But his position was that the rest of the

handwriting regarding the amounts is not his. When he was

3

asked why he gave three such cheques admittedly with date and

signature he has stated that he owed the petitioner a sum of Rs.

370,000/=. In his evidence he has stated that he was prepared

to pay Rs. 370,000/=. He does not say that he was forced or

lured to give such cheques. The value of the three cheques is

Rs. 4,900,000/=. When he was asked why he did not write Rs.

370,000/= in one cheque and give it to the petitioner instead of

giving three different cheques, he had been prevaricating. The

respondent is not an uneducated man. He claims to be a

software engineer. A man of that caliber would not have

behaved in that manner.

It is rare to admit date and signature and deny the amount in a

cheque. Whilst admitting the date and signature in all three

cheques, when the respondent denied his handwriting about the

amount, the Attorney-at-Law for the petitioner has moved to call

for an EQD Report. This has been objected to by the Attorney-

at-Law of the respondent and the learned Magistrate has upheld

that objection. However the learned Magistrate has in the

Judgment found fault with the petitioner for not calling an EQD

Report against denial of the handwriting in the cheques by the

respondent!

The Bank officer has confirmed that by the time the cheques

had been issued, the petitioners Account was closed. The

respondent did not dispute that fact. The Magistrate has in the

Judgment accepted that position.

4

Against this strong evidence, nay admissions, it is distressing to

note that the Magistrate has acquitted the respondent from all

the charges.

In my view, with that evidence, the Magistrate could at least

have easily convicted the respondent under section 25(1)(a) of

the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act, which reads as

follows:

Any person who knowingly draws a cheque which is

dishonoured by a bank for want of funds shall be guilty of an

offence under this Act and shall on conviction by a Magistrate

after summary trial be liable to punishment with imprisonment of

either description for a term which may extend to one year or with

fine of ten thousand rupees or ten per centum of the full value of

the cheque, order, authority or inland bill in respect of which the

offence is committed, whichever is higher, or with both such fine

and imprisonment.

In connection with instituting criminal proceedings under

section 25 of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act, the

Supreme Court in the case of OIC, CID v. Soris [2006] 3 Sri LR

375 at 381 stated that: We, accordingly, are mindful of the fact

that the Debt Recovery Act as amended, was necessitated by the

expansion of commercial transactions and that a prosecution

under the normal law was highly time consuming and protracted.

The Judgment of the Magistrates Court is set aside and a

conviction under section 25(1)(a) of the Debt Recovery (Special

Provisions) Act is entered in respect of count Nos. 1, 4 and 7 of

the Charge Sheet.

5

Although the accused-respondent was present and represented

by an Attorney-at-Law at the beginning before this Court1, he

never filed objections to the present application or participated

in the argument.

The respondent (Attorney-General) has been represented by

several State Counsel, but no objections or written submissions

have been filed.

Appeal is allowed.

Let the Magistrate decide the sentence.
