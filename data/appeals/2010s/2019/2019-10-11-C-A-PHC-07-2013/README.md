The Accused-Petitioner-Appellant has filed this revision application seeking to

revise the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Provincial High Court of

Western province holden in Colombo dated 0l.02.2013 in case No. HCRA

163/2012 and seeking to revise the order of the Learned Magistrate of Mt. Lavinia

dated 12.10.2012 in case No. 54060.

Facts of the case:

The accused-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant') was

charged in the Magistrate's Court of Mt. Lavinia under case No. 54060, for an

Page 3 of 12

offence punishable under the Primary Courts ,Procedure Act. The charge was read

over to the appellant in open court and the appellant pleaded not guilty.

Accordingly, a trial commenced and proceeded against the appellant. The appellant

raised a preliminary objection stating that the Learned Magistrate had no

jurisdiction since the appellant moved in revision to the High Court under case No.

HCRA 58/2010. On 03.02.2011, the Learned Magistrate made an order overruling

the said preliminary objection. In the said order, the Learned Magistrate had

reproduced the charge and included penal section i.e. Section 73 of the Primary

"-Courts Procedure Act, in the said charge. At the trial, the prosecution led evidence

of PW 02, 03 and 05 and all the witnesses were cross-examined on behalf of the

appellant.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case, the Learned Counsel for the appellant

made an application in terms of section 186 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act, to acquit or discharge the appellant since the charge sheet did not contain a

penal section. The prosecution sought permission of Court to amend the charge and

the Learned Magistrate allowed the same. The appellant preferred an application

for revision against the said order of the Learned Magistrate. The Learned High

Court Judge of Colombo refused to issue notice on the respondent and dismissed

the said revision application. Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the appellant

preferred this appeal.

The Learned President's Counsel for the appellant contended that the judgment of

the Learned High Court Judge is contrary to law and is against the principles of

law.

At this juncture, it is imperative to look into relevant sections in the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act (hereinafter referred to as the 'CCPA'), on framing

Page 4 of 12

charges and amending charges. As per section 164 of CCP A, there are certain

components that need to mentioned in a charge. Section 164(4) states that law and

section of the law, under which the offence said to have been committed is

punishable, shall be mentioned in the charge. The Learned President's Counsel for

appellant argued that this requirement in section 164 (4) is mandatory. However, as

per section 166 of CCP A, any error in stating either the offence or the particulars

required to be stated in the charge and any omission to state the offence or those

particulars shall not be regarded at any stage of the case as material, unless the

, accused was misled by such error or omission. There are several case law decided

on this question which I wish to refer to at this stage.

In the case of Jayaratne Banda V. Attorney General (1997) 3 Sri LR 210, it was

held that,

" ... The defence the accused-appellant had taken was a simple denial of the

commission of the crime. There is nothir:zg in the petition of appeal to

indicate that due to the mistake in the indictment the accused-appellant was

misled and thereby caused prejudice to his defence. In the circumstances it

is not difficult for us to conclude that the presence or absence of the 'error'

could not have made any difference to the general conduct of the defence

and therefore cannot be regarded as a material error in terms of Section

166 of the Code ...

In Molagoda v. Gunaratne (39 NLR 226) Counsel for the accused-appellant

sought to elevate the question of the wrong Gazette in the charge to a

fundamental defect of procedure. He contended that an omission to frame a

charge in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code

was an omission to frame a charge at all. This argument was rejected by the

Page 5 of 12

Supreme Court which held that a bread! of a specific rule of law in the Code

was curable by the application of Section 425 of the Old Criminal

Procedure Code (which is equivalent to section 436 of the present Code) if

the breach had not caused afailure of justice ... "

In the case of Nan des en a V. JP, Ragala (1961) 66 NLR 300, it was held that,

" ... There is an obvious error in respect of the section charged, for the

section should be section 68 (8) and not 69"(8), but that error is one which I

am satisfied, has not occasioned a failure of justice': Applying section 425 of

the Criminal Procedure Code I hold that the accused is not entitled to claim

an acquittal on that account ... "

In the case ofD.R.M. Pandithakoralge V. V.K. Selvanayagam (56 NLR 143), it

was held that,

"There can be no doubt that the accused was in no way misled by the

mistake as regards the date in the plaint. In the case of William Edward

James (17 CAR 116) it was held that a mistaken date in an indictment,

unless the date is of the essence of the offence or the accused is prejudiced,

need not beformally amended ... "

In the case ofR.T. Wilbert and 3 others V. Newman (75 NLR 138), it was held

that,

"However, a charge which is bad for duplicity is not necessarily fatal to the

conviction if it has not caused prejudice to the accused and is curable under

section 425 of the Criminal Procedure Code ... "

In the case of Weer asing he V. Samy Chettiyar (43 NLR 190), it was held that,

Page 6 of 12

" .. .1t is true that the attention of the appellant was not directed to the fact

that he committed an offence under this particular section of the law. On the

other hand, I do not think that he has been prejudiced in any way by such

failure to direct his attention to the right section. I think the case is met by

section 171 of the Criminal Procedure Code ... "

The Learned sse for the complainant-respondent-respondent and the respondent-

respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'respondents') submitted several decided

cases including the following;

1. Pieris V. Gunasekara [17 NLR 476]

2. Meera Natchiya V. Marikar [41 NLR 319]

3. Wickramasinghe V. Chandradasa [67 NLR 550]

In the case of Meera Natchiya, it was held that,

" .. .1 think a reference in the charge to the name of the offence as specified in

the Code was sufficient to give the appellant notice of the matter with which

he was charged. In the circumstances of this case, moreover, the omission

to state the proper particulars was not material inasmuch as the accused

could not be said to have been misled by such omission ... "

In the case of H.P.D. Nimal Ranasinghe V. OIC, Police, Hettipola [Se Appeal

149/2017], it was held that,

"The question that must be decided is whether any prejudice was caused to

the accused-appellant as a result of the said defect in the charge sheet or

whether he was misled by the said defect. It has to be noted here that the

accused-appellant, at the trial, had not taken up an objection to the charge

sheet on the basis of the said defect. In this connection judicial decision in

Page 7 of 12

the case of Wickramasinghe Vs Chan,dradasa 67 NLR 550 is important.

Justice Sri Skanda Rajah in the said case observed the followingfacts.

"Where in a report made to Court under Section 148(1)(b) of the

Criminal Procedure Code, the Penal Provision was mentioned but, in

the charge sheet from which the accused was. charged, the penal

section was not mentioned. "

His Lordship held as follows;

"The omission to mention in a charge sheet the penal section is not a

fatal irregularity if the accused has not been misled by such omission.

In such a case Section 171 of the Criminal Procedure Code is

applicable. "

Some of these cases were decided under the previous Criminal Procedure Code

No. IS of 1898. Therefore, it is imperative to note that section 166 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act 15 of 1979 is equivalent to section 171 of the previous

code whereas section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act is equivalent to

section 425 of the Previous Code.

In light of above, it is manifestly clear that mere absence of the penal section

would not be regarded as a fatal error unless the appellant was misled or grave

prejudice was caused due to such omission. I observe that in the instant appeal, the

charge contains the patiiculars such as the date of offence, the place of offence and

a lengthy description of the offence committed. I think the charge is descriptive

enough to give the appellant of notice as to, for what he is being charged.

Therefore, I am of the view that no prejudice had been caused to the appellant by

mere omission of the penal section.

The Learned President's Counsel for the ap'pellant contended that the Learned

High Court Judge failed to analyze that the Learned Magistrate erred in law by

permitting the prosecution to amend the defective charge and it is the duty of a

Magistrate to frame charge and not of the prosecution. The Learned President's

Counsel further argued that the Learned High Court Judge erred in law by ordering

that the appellant had a burden to point out to the Magistrate about the defect of the

charge. The cases of Abdul Sameem V. The Bribery Commissioner (1991) 1

SLR 76 and David Perera V. Attorney General and another (case reference or a

" copy of the case was not submitted) were cited in support of this contention.

In answer to the said contention, the Learned SSC for the respondents submitted

that under section 167 of the CCPA, any court may alter any indictment or charge

at any time before judgment is pronounced, or in the case of trials before the High

Court by ajury, before the verdict of the jury is returned.

I observe that in the case of Abdul Sameem (supra), the issue of failure to frame a

charge sheet by the Learned Magistrate was discussed. In the case of Abdul

Sameem, a written report was filed by the Bribery Commissioner, that the accused

had committed two offences under the Bribery Act and the Magistrate adopted the

said report by placing a seal. Therefore, there had been a total failure to frame a

charge by the Learned Magistrate. In the instant case before us, the Learned

Magistrate duly framed the charge, complying with Section 182 (1). Therefore, I do

not find that the Abdul sameem case to be supportive of the contention made by

the Learned President's Counsel. Since the Magistrate is empowered to amend a

charge, prior to delivering the judgment, allowing the prosecution to make

necessary amendment did not cause any injustice or prejudice. Even though the

charge was physically amended by the prosecution, it was under the authority and

Page 9 of 12

order of the Learned Magistrate. Therefore,. there is no prejudice caused to the

appellant and further, there is no irregularity or illegality in the said order.

In the case of H. G. Sujith Priyantha V. OIC, Police station, Poddala and

others ICA (PHC) 157/2012], it was held that,

"In this instance, the claim of the appellant who is not an accused in the

case had been made after the two accused were found guilty on their own

plea. Therefore, it is understood that the Court was not in a position to

consider the validity of the charge sheet at that belated pOint of time ...

Moreover, in the event this court makes a determination on the issue as to

the defects in the charge sheet at this late stage, it may lead to raise

questions as to the conviction of the accused as well. Such a position is

illogical and certainly it will lead to absurdity. Such an absurdity should not

be allowed to prevail before the eyes of the law ... "

In the aforesaid case of Jayaratne Banda (supra), it was further held that,

" ... Had the objection to the indictment been taken at the trial it would have

been open to Court to have acted under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act to amend the indictment. Senior Counsel for the appellant too

conceded that is was open for the prosecution to have amended the

indictment at any stage before the close of the prosecution case ... "

In the case of A.K.K. Rasika Amarasinghe V. Attorney General and another

[SC Appeal 14012010], it was held that,

"The Accused-Appellant has not raised an objection to the charge at the

trial. In the first place we note that at page 97, the Accused-Appellant has

admitted that he knows about the charge. As I pointed out earlier the

Accused-Appellant has failed to raise any objections to the charge at the

Page 10 of 12

trial. In this regard 1 rely on the j,udgment of the Court of Criminal

Appeal in 45 NLR page 82 in King V. Kitchilan wherein the Court of

Criminal appeal held as follows:

"The proper time at which an objection of the nature should be taken

is before the accused has pleaded"

It is well settled law that if a charge sheet is defective, objection to the

charge sheet must be raised at the very inception."

Accordingly, I am of the view that the appellant should have raised his objection

with regard to the charge at the commencement of the trial. Even though the

appellant did not have a burden to point out to the Magistrate any defect in the

charge sheet, it is trite law that an objection to charge should be raised as early as

possible.

Therefore, not raising any objection shall be regarded as a waiver on the part of the

appellant since it is implied that he clearly understood the charge. The appellant

had pleaded not guilty and stood for trial. The Learned Counsel for the appellant,

in the Magistrate's Court, had raised a preliminary objection once, but did not

object to the charge sheet. The Learned Magistrate in the order, with regard to the

said preliminary objection, had reproduced the charge and mentioned section 73 of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act. Even the police plaint contained the relevant

penal section. It appears that the absence of the penal section in the charge was a

typographical error. Considering all these facts, I am of the view that the appellant

did not raise any objection to the charge even though he had ample opportunity to

do so. Therefore, he should not be allowed to throw technical objections at the

procedure in order to delay the court proceedings.

Page 11 of 12

Considering above, I see no reason to interfere with the orders of the Learned

Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge since both orders were made well

within law. Therefore, I affirm the same.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
