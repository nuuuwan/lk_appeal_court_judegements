Decided on: 06.06.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash by way of

certiorari the decisions/entries reflected in the documents

marked C and D to the petition.

A Grant under the Land Development Ordinance, No.19 of 1935,

as amended, was issued in favour of P.P.D. Sirisena in respect of

the land in suit. Grantee Sirisena died on 07.06.2003.

Admittedly no successor has been nominated by Sirisena in the

said Grant.

3

When there is no such nomination, it is the contention of the

petitioner that he being the eldest son shall succeed to the land

(in terms of section 72 read with Rule 1 of the Third Schedule to

the Act) by operation of law, and this has been done as seen

from the second entry of the document marked B with the

petition.

It is the further contention of the petitioner that subsequent

succession effected in favour of the 2nd respondent Rosalin (who

is the widow of Sirisena and also the mother of the petitioner) by

R7 by the 1st respondent Divisional Secretary1 and the

nomination by Rosalin of the 3rd respondent as her successor2

and alienation of a part of the land by Rosalin to the 4th

respondent3 are null and void.

Before issuing the Grant, a Permit marked R5 had been issued

in favour of Sirisena. It is the position of the 1st respondent

Divisional Secretary that, as seen from page 2 of the said Permit,

Sirisena, first nominated his son, the petitioner as the

successor, and thereafter, instead of the petitioner, his wife

Rosalin was nominated as the successor, and it is on that basis

Rosalin was recognized as the successor.

However, in terms of sections 58 and 60 of the Land

Development Ordinance, no nomination or cancellation of the

nomination of a successor shall be valid unless the document

effecting such nomination or cancellation is duly registered by

the Registrar of Lands before the death of the Grantee or the

Permit-holder. There is no such proof of registration in respect

1 Vide the first entry in the document marked C with the petition. 2 Vide the second entry in the document marked C with the petition. 3 Vide the entry in the document marked D with the petition.

4

of nominations and cancellations reflected at page 2 of the

Permit marked R2. Hence those endorsements regarding

nomination and cancellation cannot be given legal validity.

Then the next question is whether succession effected by the

Divisional Secretary in favour of Rosalin as seen from the first

entry in the document marked C, and nomination of succession

and alienation of a part of the land by Rosalin as seen from the

second entry in the document marked C and the document

marked D are valid.

Section 48A of the Land Development Ordinance relates to

Permits and 48B relates to Grants. At the time of the death, a

Grant had been issued in favour of Sirisena.

Section 48B of the Act reads as follows:

48B(1) Upon the death of the owner of a holding4, the

spouse of that owner shall be entitled to succeed to that

holding subject to the following conditions:-

a) upon the marriage of such spouse, title to the holding

shall devolve on the nominated successor of the

deceased owner or, if there was no such nomination,

on the person who was entitled to succeed under rule

1 of the Third Schedule;

b) such spouse shall have no power to dispose of that

holding;

c) such spouse shall have no power to nominate a

successor to that holding:

4 Interpretation section 2 defines the word holding as a land alienated by a Grant.

5

Provided that the aforesaid conditions shall not apply to a

spouse who has been nominated by the deceased owner of

the holding to succeed to that holding.

(2) Any disposition or nomination made by a spouse in

contravention of the provisions of subsection (1) shall be

invalid.

From the above, it is clear that succession effected by first

endorsement in the document marked C by the Divisional

Secretary is valid, but the nomination and alienation by

successor Rosaline as seen from second endorsement in the

document marked C, and in the document marked D are invalid

as Rosaline has no authority to do so.

Hence the latter two decisions/endorsements (second

endorsement in C and the endorsement in D) are quashed by

way of a writ of certiorari.

In terms of section 72 read with Rule 1 of the Third Schedule of

the Land Development Ordinance, being the eldest son of

Grantee Sirisena, the petitioner shall succeed to the land.

However this is subject to two conditions. One is, in terms of

section 73 of the Act, that shall take effect from the date of the

death of Rosalin (the spouse of Sirisena and the mother of the

petitioner). The other is, the Divisional Secretary can convey 48

perches out of this land to the 4th respondent.5

Application is partly allowed. No costs.

5 Counsel for the petitioner in paragraph 23 of the written submissions dated 25.07.2018 says The petitioner further respectfully states that he is ready and willing to part with 48 perches of land to be granted to the 4th respondent as per settlement entered before the Divisional Secretary dated 2010.03.10 (document marked as R3).
