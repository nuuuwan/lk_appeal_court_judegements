Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application for restitutio in integrum

seeking to set aside the decree of divorce granted by the District

Court of Panadura in Case No. 3464/D.

That divorce action had been filed by the deceased husband

against the petitioner and obtained the divorce ex parte on the

basis that summons was served on her. According to the

journal entry No.1 of the District Court case record, summons

has been ordered to be issued on 05.01.2006 returnable on

16.01.2006. The same journal entry further reveals that the

plaintiff has hurriedly filed the divorce action and obtained a

short date for summons returnable stating that the petitioner

has come to Sri Lanka from abroad for one-month holiday.

According to the journal entry No.2 dated 16.01.2006, the

summons has been served on the petitioner by personal service.

Then according to the journal entry dated 08.05.2006, ex parte

decree nisi has also been served on the petitioner by personal

service on 26.04.2006.

The petitioner has convincingly proved before this Court by

producing her two passports marked P8(c) and P8(d) that she

was not in Sri Lanka at the time the summons and decree nisi

were alleged to have been personally served on her by the Fiscal.

That in my view is the best proof. This is a fraud.

After obtaining divorce by fraud, the deceased husband had

married the respondent to this application even before the

decree nisi was made absolute.

It is significant to note that notwithstanding the respondent has

been represented by a counsel before this Court, the respondent

has not filed objections to this application controverting those

facts. Hence those facts remain unchallenged.

Nonetheless, the learned counsel for the respondent has filed

written submissions and participated in the argument. His

submissions, in my view, are beside the point.

The sole matter to be decided is whether summons has been

served on the defendant, i.e. the petitioner to this application, in

the said Divorce Case?

Whether the petitioner was abroad with a valid visa or not,

which was what the counsel for the respondent attempted to

highlight during the course of argument, is irrelevant.

As was held in the celebrated case of Ittepana v. Hemawathie1:

Failure to serve summons is a failure which goes to the root

of the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine the

1 [1981] 1 Sri LR 476

4

action against the defendant. It is only by service of

summons on the defendant that the Court gets jurisdiction

over the defendant. If a defendant is not served with

summons or otherwise notified of the proceedings against

him, the judgment entered against him in those

circumstances is a nullity. The proceedings being void, the

person affected by them can apply to have them set aside

ex debito justitiae in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction

of the Court.

Vide also Sitthi Maleeha v. Nihal Ignatius Perera [1994] 3 Sri LR

270, Joyce Perera v. Lal Perera [2002] 3 Sri LR 8, Leelawathie v.

Jayaneris [2001] 2 Sri LR 231.

Once the petitioner has become aware of the divorce

fraudulently obtained, she has filed a separate action in the

same District Court to get the ex parte decree set aside. This

action has been dismissed by the District Court stating that the

petitioner shall, in view of Kusumawathie v. Wijesinghe2, seek

relief by way of an application for restitutio in integrum in this

Court. The petitioner has filed a revision application and a final

appeal against that dismissal in the High Court of Civil Appeal

and later revision application has been withdrawn.

The dismissal of that action by the District Judge is flawless.

The petitioner cannot litigate in the District Court against a dead

person. In such circumstances, only the Court of Appeal has

the power under Article 138 to set aside the decree obtained

2 [2001] 3 Sri LR 238

5

fraudulently in an application for restitutio in integrum. Vide

Kusumawathie v. Wijesinghe (supra), Paulis v. Joseph3.

The cases cited by the learned counsel for the respondent,

including Andradie v. Jayasekera Perera4, to say that the

petitioner shall first make the application in the District Court

divorce action itself to have the ex parte decree vacated, are

inapplicable and distinguishable, because in those cases, unlike

in the instant case, the plaintiffs were alive when the defendants

straightaway came before this Court to get the ex parte decrees

vacated on fraud.

Going before different Courts and getting unfavorable orders and

later withdrawing some of them etc., do not, as the counsel for

the respondent submits, amount to waiver or renunciation of the

petitioners right to come before this Court by way of restitutio in

integrum.

Counsel also submits that the petitioner is guilty of laches.

Delay shall not be a ground for dismissal of an action when

there is a manifest fraud, especially, abusing the process of the

Court, proven before Court. (Biso Manika v. Cyril De Alwis5,

Sebastian Fernando v. Katana Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society

Chief Justice Bertram in Suppramaniam v. Erampakurukal8

citing Black on Judgments9 stated that Fraud is not a thing that

can stand even when robed in a judgment. Vide also

Maduluwawe Sobitha Thero v. Joslin.10

In Sirisena v. Kobbekaduwa, Minister of Agriculture and Lands11,

Justice Vythialingam12 and Justice Weeraratne13 quoted with

approval the following dicta of Lord Denning in Lazarus Estates

Ltd v. Bearely.14

No Judgment of a Court or order of a Minister can be

allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud

unravels everything. The Court is careful not to find fraud

unless it is specially pleaded and proved. But once it is

proved it vitiates judgments, contracts, and all transactions

whatsoever.

Regarding the ambit of an application for restitutio in integrum

the following observation of Canekeratne J. in Dember v. Abdul

Hafeel15 is of particular importance:

The cases in which application for relief by way of

restitution in respect of judgments of original courts have

been made in Ceylon can, broadly speaking, be classed

under two heads: (a) where a judgement has been obtained

by fraud or where there has been a discovery of fresh 8 (1922) 23 NLR 417at 435 9 Black on Judgments, Vol 1, Section 292-293 10 [2005] 3 Sri LR 25 at 28 11 (1974) 80 NLR 1 12 At page 66 13 At page 140 14 (1956) 1 All ER 341 at 345 15 (1947) 49 NLR 62 at 66

evidence; (b) where a judgment has been entered of consent

and there has been an absence of a real consent such as in

cases of fraud, fear, excess of authority and mistake.

The decree of divorce in the instant case has been obtained by

the deceased husband of the petitioner by fraud without

summons being served on the petitioner. Hence the decree

entered against her is a nullity.

The petitioner, as she has gone before various Courts making

various applications, has, may be due to overzealousness,

sought various reliefs in this application. But granting relief as

prayed for in paragraph (c) of the prayer to the petition, which is,

quashing the entire proceedings in the Panadura District Court

Case No. 3464/D from the date on which summons is alleged to

have been served on the defendant including the ex parte

Judgment, decree nisi and decree absolute entered, serves the

purpose. Accordingly, the said relief is granted.

Application is allowed. No costs.
