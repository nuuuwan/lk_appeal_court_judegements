Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner Company (Design Consortium Limited) filed this

appeal against the determination marked X5 dated 31.10.2014

of the Compensation Tribunal set up under the provisions of the

Revival of Underperforming Enterprises or Underutilized Assets

Act, No. 43 of 2011 (which has now been repealed by Act No. 12

of 2019) whereby the claim made by the Petitioner Company was

rejected on the basis that the Petitioner Company has no

ownership to the Assets vested in the State.

The Petitioner Companys claim for a sum of rupees nearly 59

Million relates to providing Consultancy Services to the Ceylinco

Homes International (Lotus Tower) Ltd. in respect of design and

construction of Ceylinco Celestial Residencies at No. 116 and

134/1, Galle Road, Colombo 3, which Assets, according to the

Petitioner Company, were vested in the State by operation of the

said Act.

According to section 4(2)(b) of the Act, the owner or owners of

any Underutilized Assets shall be entitled to receive prompt,

3

adequate and effective compensation in terms of the succeeding

provisions of the Act.

Section 4(3)(b) further states that the compensation payable

shall, in relation to an Underutilized Asset, reflect the value of

such Asset based on the ownership by one or more owners.

There cannot be any doubt that the Petitioner Company which

provided services to construct a luxury apartment complex in

the Assets vested is not the owner or one of the owners of the

said Assets.

Hence the determination of the Tribunal not to pay the Petitioner

Company for Consultancy Services so provided, in my view, is

correct.

I dismiss the appeal of the Petitioner Company without costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
