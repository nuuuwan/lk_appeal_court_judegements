Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up on 16th May 2019, the learned Counsel for all

parties moved that this Court pronounce judgment on the written submissions

that have already been tendered by the parties.

The Petitioner is engaged in the business, inter alia, of the service and repair of

automobiles. The 4th Respondent handed over vehicle bearing registration No.

CPKJ- 3191 owned by him to the Petitioner on or about 18th September 2016

for the specific purpose of repairing a mechanical defect in the engine of the

said vehicle. The Petitioner claims that the required repair was duly carried

out.

It is admitted by the parties that on or about 6th October 2016, prior to

handing over the vehicle to the 4th Respondent after the repair of the vehicle,

and whilst the said vehicle was being driven by an employee of the Petitioner

by the name D. Chaminda Indrajith, an accident had occurred and the said

vehicle had been damaged. It is admitted by all parties that at the time of the

incident, the car was under the care and control of the Petitioner.

It does not appear that the Petitioner took steps to report the said accident to

the nearest Police Station. After the said accident, the Petitioner had initially

taken steps to contact the insurer of the 4th Respondent directly, withoot the

knowledge of the 4th Respondent. The Petitioner had informed the 4th

Respondent of the accident only thereafter. The 4th Respondent states that as

3

instructed by the Petitioner, the damaged vehicle was handed over for repairs

to Mis Car Mart Limited, the local agent for the said vehicle, on 9th October

2016.

The 4th Respondent states that after the handing over of the vehicle to Mis Car

~~lVTa~r~~Umiteq!_~_~~insurer inforrl1ed him ~hat !_he insurance claim filed in_r~spect

= -~O-Lthe said_dama~~_alisjo&lLQmth~ sajd accident had been r~jected,-It js_

admitted by the Petitioner that the insurer had rejected the claim of the 4th

Respondent. The 4th Respondent had annexed to his written submissions,

document marked 'V1' dated 2ih December 2016, issued by Sri Lanka

Insurance Corporation Limited, rejecting his claim. The 4th Respondent had

thereafter requested the Petitioner to carry out the repairs to the said vehicle

caused as a result of the said accident, at its own cost as the accident was

caused during the period the vehicle was under the care and control of the

Petitioner. The Petitioner however refused to comply with this request, after

which the 4th Respondent, by a letter dated 19th December 2016, annexed to

the petition marked 'P2', lodged a complaint against the Petitioner with the 1st

Respondent, the Consumer Affairs Authority.

The Petitioner states that by a letter dated 10th January 2017, annexed to the

petition marked 'P3', the 1st Respondent had forwarded a copy of the

complaint 'P2' to the Petitioner and had requested a representative of the

Petitioner to attend a discussion in respect of the said complaint 'P2', on 26th

January 2017. The Petitioner states that its representative attended the said

meeting held on 26th January 2017. The Petitioner states that it received from

the 1st Respondent another letter dated 1 i h January 2017 annexed to the

petition marked 'P4' requesting a representative of the Petitioner to attend

4

anotOher meeting on 22nd February 2017 in relation to the complaint 'P2'. The

Petitioner states it was represented on the said date as well. It is the position

of the Petitioner that lithe said discussions were merely preliminary

discussions held with a view to settlement of the issue" and that "no inquiry

was held" on the complaint 'P2'. This Court must observe that the 1st

-----~sp-6rfdEmthas not explained in the Statem~nt of Objections filed befQ~e this

Court as toWha_t tQQkQlacealJhe os_aid Jrleetin~s.

The Petitioner states that it received from the 1st Respondent a letter dated

19th September 2017 annexed to the petition marked 'PSa', requesting that it

pay a sum of Rs. 1,216,218,40 to the 4th Respondent. The Petitioner states that

annexed to 'PSa' was an Order of the 1st Respondent dated 2ih April 2017, a

copy of which has been annexed to the petition marked 'PS(b)', by which the

1 st Respondent had decided that the Petitioner is liable to pay a total sum of

Rs. 1,216,218.40 to the 4th Respondent, being the costs incurred by the 4th

Respondent to import spare parts worth Rs. 859,768.40 and repair costs of Rs.

356,450.

Dissatisfied by this Order, the Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction conferred

on this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution, seeking inter alia the following

relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the document marked tPS(b)' dated 2ih

April 2017;

b) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st Respondent from acting in

pursuance of the complaint marked 'P2/.

5

This Court is mindful that it is exercising its Writ jurisdiction in this matter. The

facts of this case would only be considered by this Court in so far as it is

necessary for a determination of the issues that have been raised by the

parties in this application. This Court shall refrain, as far as possible, from

. m~lkrnganyTadlJal determinations with regard to then~_~ility ofthePefitiol1er

in relaUon:rothesaid accident. ..

This Court would now consider each of the arguments placed before this Court

by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner in support of his position that this

Court must issue a Writ of Certiorari to quash 'PSb'.

The first objection raised by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the

1st Respondent does not have the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint of the

4th Respondent.

The objection on jurisdiction raised by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

consists of two limbs. The first is that the 1st Respondent has no jurisdiction in

terms of Section 32 of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act No.9 of 2003 to

entertain the complaint 'p2', as the damage that is complained of falls outside

the contract between the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent.

The right of a consumer to make a complaint against the provision of a service

is set out in Section 32(3) of the Act, which reads as follows:

"A consumer aggrieved by the breach of an implied warranty as provided

for in subsection (1) or (2) may make a complaint to the Authority in

6

writing against such breach within one month of the supply of such goods

or the provision of such services as the case may be, or the supply of

materials supplied in connection with the provision of those services."

The implied warranty referred to in Section 32(3} is provided for in Section

32(1} of the Act, which reads as foHows:

"In every contract for the supply of goods or for the provision of services

by any person in the course of a business of supply of such goods or

provisions of such services to a consumer, there is an implied warranty

that-

(a) the services will be provided with due care and skill;

(b) any materials supplied in connection with provision of such services

will be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are supplied;

(b) the goods supplied or services provided will be in conformity with

the standards and specifications determined under section 12 of this

Act; and

(d) the goods supplied will be reasonably fit for the purpose for which

they are supplied.

The complaint of the 4th Respondent marked 'P2' has been made on the basis

of a violation of Section 32(1)(a). That is, the Petitioner did not comply with the

7

implied warranty that it would exercise "due care and skiW' in the provision of

services, namely the repairing of his vehicle.

The Petitioner has sought to argue that the accident which was the subject

matter of the said complaint 'P2', was outside the scope of the contract,

implied or otherwise, between fne-Pe1:TtToner and -the 4th Respondent. It is the

Petitioner's contention that Seti~n 32{1} is onry appHcabJe to the "contract for

the supply of goods or for the provision of services" and that any duty to carry

out the services with due skill and care only extends to the scope of the said

contract. The Petitioner states that the contract for the provision of services

was to repair the engine of the vehicle belonging to the 4th Respondent, which

was carried out with "due skill and care", thus satisfying the provisions of

Section 32(1)(a}. The Petitioner states that the 4th Respondent has admitted

that the said repair had been conducted with due skill and care because he had

no complaints with regard to the repair, which proves that the Petitioner duly

carried out its obligations under the contract and thereby satisfied the

provisions of Section 32{1} of the Act. It is thus the position of the Petitioner

that the accident occurred after the engine repair had been effected and is

therefore outside the scope of the services that the Petitioner was required to

provide under the contract. On this basis, the Petitioner states that the 4th

Respondent had no right to make a complaint to the 1st Respondent under

Section 32(3) for breach of contract and accordingly the 1st Respondent does

not have the jurisdiction to hear the complaint.

8

Before considering the said argument, this Court would like to refer to the

judgment of this Court in Micro Cars ltd. vs. Consumer Affairs Authorityl

where it was held as follows:

"When considering the provisions of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act

along with its long title thiscourfls of fhe view -that, the said Act has been

primarily promulgated for the purpose of the effective competition and

protection of the consumers. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to

view the provisions of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act in the

perspective of not only of the effective competition but necessarily

focusing on the interest of the protection of the innocent consumers.

Under these circumstances it is the duty of this court when interpreting

the provisions of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, to be mindful of the

object of the above Act./I

This Court also referred to the judgment in Wickremaratne v.

Samarawickrema and others,2 which held that:

(a) The basic rule of interpretation is that the legislative objective should be

advanced and that the provisions be interpreted in keeping with the

purpose of the legislature;

(b) The interpretation of a statute should not have the effect of defeating the

objective of the legislature and of detracting from its purpose.

It is admitted by all parties that the 4th Respondent handed over his vehicle to

the Petitioner to effect engine repairs. The repair may have been carried out

but the vehicle continued to remain with the Petitioner until the date of the

accident. The Petitioner does not claim that its employee had gone on a frolic

of his own at the time the acciderifoccurred or that the Petitioner had not

authorised the said employee to drive the said vehicle. Thus, the only

inference this Court can come to is that the employee of the Petitioner was

driving the vehicle as part of the service that the Petitioner had undertaken to

provide or, as the learned Senior State Counsel for the 1st Respondent has

stated, to carry out a test drive, which is a necessary requirement of any

service to repair an engine.

This Court takes the view that a service provider such as the Petitioner must

take responsibility for a vehicle that is handed over to it. The duty to provide

the service with due care and skill commenced from the time the vehicle was

handed over to the Petitioner and ended only once the vehicle was repaired

and handed back to the 4th Respondent in the same condition that it was in, at ,

the time of the initial handing over, other than the engine repair, of course.

The Petitioner cannot absolve itself of its liability by seeking an extremely

narrow interpretation of Section 32(1). It would certainly be a violation of the

obligation to provide a service with due care and skill if the service provider

can damage, either Wilfully or due to negligence, the car handed over to it, the

rep'air cost of which is in excess of Rs. 1.2 million and thereafter claim that it

has repaired the engine which is the purpose for which the vehicle had been

handed over and that it is not responsible for any damage to the vehicle,

10

---1

although such damage occurred during the time vehicle was in the custody of

the Petitioner.

To accept the position of the Petitioner that the subject matter of the

complaint 'P2' is outside the scope of the contract would lead to an absurdity

and would be completely contrary to the objective of the Act, which is inter

alia to protect innocent consumers. If the argument of the Petitioner is

accepted, it would leave room for providers of a service to be completely

negligent in relation to anything other than the "scope of the service" they are

required to provide, which is most certainly not what the legislature intended

through Section 32(1} of the Act. This Court therefore rejects the submission of

the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent does not have

the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint of the 4th Respondent.

The second limb of the jurisdictional objection raised by the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner is that 'P2' has been lodged outside the time limit provided

by Section 32(3) of the Act for the making of complaints and therefore, the 1st

Respondent is estopped from considering the said complaint.

Section 32(3) of the Act reads as follows:

"A consumer aggrieved by the breach of an implied warranty as provided

for in subsection (1) or (2) may make a complaint to the Authority in

writing against such breach within one month of the supply of such goods

or the provision of such services as the case may be, or the supply of

materials supplied in connection with the provision of those services."

11

Thus, according to Section 32(3) of the Act, the 4th Respondent is required to

make to the 1st Respondent, a complaint in writing against such breach within

one month of the supply of such goods or the provision of such services as the

case may be. It is the position of the Petitioner that the complaint 'P2' made

on 19th December 2016, is out of time.

This Court must observe that even though the Petitioner has participated at

two discussions held on 26th January 2017 and 22nd February 2017, the

Petitioner does not appear to have raised the said objection at the said

discussions. In this regard, this Court would like to refer to the following

paragraph in Aqua Technologies (Pvt) Ltd vs. Consumer Affairs Authority and

Others3 which has stressed on the importance of raising objections based on

time bar at the first available opportunity:

liThe Petitioner's first objection in this application is that the 1st

Respondent has entertained the complaint of the 2nd Respondent even

though the said complaint was prescribed in terms of Section 13(2) of the

Consumer Affairs Authority Act. It is pertinent to note that the Petitioner

had not taken up this objection before the 1st Respondent -when the

inquiry was held before the 1st Respondent. The petitioner had

acquiesced in the proceedings before the 1st Respondent as it had not

taken up this objection before the 1st Respondent. As such the Petitioner

cannot raise the said objection in judicial review proceedings before the

Court of Appeal."

3(2012) 1 Sri LR 358; judgment by :>r!skandarajah, J (P/CA)_

12

In any event, this Court is of the view that the question of time should also be

given a purposive interpretation in view of the objects and purpose of the Act.

In the case of David Peiris Motor Company V. Consumer Affairs Authority and

eight Others4 this Court held as follows, in relation to the time bar contained in

relation to complaints made under Section 13(2) of the Act:

"Section 13(2) must be given a purposive interpretation. If a warranty of

goods covers for a period of two years and the purchaser can only

complain within three months of the purchase of the goods in relation to

the breach of a warranty or guaranty; it will lead to absurdity and the

protection given by section 13(1)(b) would be rendered nugatory. Section

13(2) has imposed a three months limitation for complaints only in

relation to the sale of any goods or to the provision of any service which

does not conform to the standards and specifications determined under

section 12."

The same course of interpretation was followed in Future Automobiles

(Private) Limited vs. Consumer Affairs AuthorityS, where this Court held as

follows:

"If I may add a few words to elaborate it further, under section 13(1)(b), a

consumer can complain to the Authority for any violation of a warranty or

guarantee given expressly or impliedly in relation to a good sold. If the

warranty period for a particular good, for instance, is three years, the

4CA (Writ) Application No. 635/2007; CA minutes of 3rd August 2009; as referred to in Micro Cars Limited vs. Consumer Affair, Authority and Others CA (Writ) Application No. 189/2014; CA Minutes of l't July 2016 ..

sCA (Writ) Application No. 26/2016; CA Minutes of 18th February 2019; judgment of Samayawardena, J.

13

consumer can, in terms of section 13(l){b), complain to the Authority

during the period of three years, but the Authority can entertain

complaints made only during the first three months of the warranty

period. Such an interpretation obviously leads to absurdity. It is a canon

of interpretation that statutes shall be construed to avoid absurdity.

Further, such an interpretation also, ex facie, defeats the intention of the

legislature in introducing this special piece of legislation, which is

primarily the protection of the consumer.

Thus, in adopting a purposive interpretation of the provisions of Section 32(3),

this Court holds that in this application, the time bar begins to run from the

date on which the Petitioner refused to pay for the repairs caused by the said

accident to the said vehicle belonging to the 4th Respondent, which could only

be after the insurer rejected the claim of the 4th Respondent. Though the

accident took place on 6th October 2016, the Petitioner held out to the 4th

Respondent that the accident has been reported to the insurer and that the

cost of the repair would be borne by the insurer. Thus, the 4th Respondent

cannot be faulted for being under the impression that his insurer would pay for

the damages. The 4th Respondent appears to have made an application to the

1st Respondent Authority, no sooner the rejection of the claim was finally

conveyed in writing by the insurer to him on 2th December 2016. Although

the complaint 'p2' is dated 19th December 2016, it appears that the 4th

Respondent filed it on 2th December 2016, after the insurer informed him in

writing that his claim has been rejected. Thus, this Court is of the view that

even if the Petitioner had raised the said objection before the 1st Respondent,

that argument cannot stand as 'P2' has been lodged within the time limit

14

specified under the Act. For these reasons, this Court does not see any merit in

the said argument of the Petitioner.

The next argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the Order

'PS(b), was issued without following the rules of natural justice and is thus, bad

in law and liable to be quashed by way of a Writ of Certiorari. The learned

Counsel for the Petitioner has specifically raised the following three matters in

this regard:

a. No proper inquiry was conducted by the 1st Respondent in terms of

Section 32{4} of the Act;

b. The Petitioner was not given the right to be heard by the 1st Respondent,

in that the Petitioner did not receive notice of the inquiry allegedly

conduCted on 2ih April 2017 and thus was not afforded the opportunity

of being heard as per Section 32{4} of the Act;

c. No reasons were provided for the decision of the 1st Respondent.

The provisions of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act pre-suppose that once a

complaint is made to the 1st Respondent, an inquiry should be held where both

parties are given the opportunity of being heard. This is set out in Section 32{4}

of the Act which states as follows:

"At any inquiry held into a complaint made under subsection (3), the

Authority shall give the trader or other person against whom the

15

complaint is made} an opportunity of being heard either in person or by

an agent on his behalf.1I

The requirement to conduct an inquiry is further manifested by the provisions

of Section 32(5) of the Act} which reads as follows:

"Where after the inquiry the Authority is of opinion that a breach of an

implied warranty has taken place} it shall order the trader or other person

to pay compensation to the aggrieved party or refund the amount paid

for the supply of such goods or provision of such services as the case may

be} and for the supply of any materials in connection with the provision of

those services} within such period as shall be specified in the order.1I

It is the position of the Petitioner that the discussions held by the 1st

Respondent at which the Petitioner participated} were merely preliminary

discussions and could not be considered (fan inquiryll within the scope of the

Act. According to the order of the 1st Respondent 'PS(bY, it is clear that the 1st

Respondent too did not consider 'P3} and 'P4' to be notices of an inquiry as the

Order states that the conclusions stated in 'PS(bY were arrived at following an

inquiry held on 2ih April 2017, which was incidentally the same date on which

the Order 'PS(b), was issued. It is also to be noted that the documents marked

'P3' and 'P4' appear to be discussions conducted for the purpose of reaching a

settlement, which appears to have been a preliminary step to conducting an

inquiry.

The Petitioner states that it was not aware of any inquiry that was to be held

on 2ih April 2017 and that it was not given notice in order to be present and

16

make representations. The 4th Respondenfs position is that both parties

agreed that the inquiry was to be held on 2ih April 2017 at the discussion held

on 22nd February 2017 and that as the Petitioner was not represented, an

inquiry was conducted ex parte and the order was issued on the same date.

The 1st Respondent has not explained in its Statement of Objections as to what

transpired on 22nd February 2017 and the manner in which the Petitioner was

informed of the date of inquiry nor has the 1st Respondent produced any

minutes of the di~cussions held on 26th January 2017 or 22nd February 2017 to

contradict the position of the Petitioner that it was not informed of the

inquiry.

In the case of Future Automobiles (Private) Limited vs. Consumer Affairs

Authoritl, this Court, referring to an inquiry held under a complaint made as

per Section 13{2}, held that:

"These inquiries are not very formal inquiries. They are sui generis but

conducted with due regard to the rules of natural justice."

The necessity to have an inquiry was considered by the Supreme Court in

Izadeen v. Director-General of Civil Aviation7 where it was held as follows:

6Supra.

" .... for the Respondent strenuously contended before us that there was

no need whatsoever for a formal inquiry. The "inquiry team" had probed

all aspects that need to be considered and had questioned the

17

Respondent and the student pilot on all relevant matters. With these

submissions, I find myself unable to agree. The inquiry conducted by the

lIinquiry team ll was at best an inquiry of a preliminary nature. In my view,

the Respondent cannot possibly rely on the statement of the Petitioner

and his student pilot recorded on 1st May 1993 as constituting compliance

with the rules of natural justice. There is no material on record to show

that the Petitioner was informed at that stage of the precise nature of the

allegations against him. He had no opportunity whatever of calling

evidence in support of his position. As far as the Petitioner was

concerned, the inquiry concluded in a matter of a few hours on the 1st of

May itself. It was not even the finding of the Court of Appeal that a formal

inquiry was unnecessary in the facts and circumstances of this case ll

Justice Kulatunga, agreeing with the judgment of Chief Justice G.P.S. De Silva,

held as follows in the same case:

III do not agree with the submission of learned counsel for the

Respondent that there was no need whatever for a formal inquiry. None

of the decisions cited in support of that submission has application to this

case. In Ridge v. Baldwin,8 Lord Hodson summed up thus:

IINo one, I think disputes that three features of natural justice stand out -

(1) the right to be heard by an unbiased tribunal, (2) the right to have

notice of the charges of misconduct, (3) the right to be heard in answer to

those charges. 1I

~ (1964) AC 40 at 132.

18

In Fountaine v. Chesterton cited in John v Rees9, Megarry J, referring to the

above dicta of Lord Hodson said:

"I do not think I shall go far wrong if I regard these three features as

constituting in all ordinary circumstances an irreducible minimum of the

requirements of natural justice."

Coming back to the facts of this case, it is clear to this Court that the Petitioner

has been made aware of the nature of the complaint made against it by the 4th

Respondent, for the reason that a copy of the complaint 'P2' was sent to the

Petitioner together with 'P3'. It is also clear that the 1st Respondent held an

inquiry into the complaint of the 4th Respondent. However, no material has

been placed before this Court that adequate notice of the inquiry that was

held on 2ih April 2017 was given to the Petitioner thus depriving it of the

opportunity to participate at the inquiry. Even though the background facts are

admitted, this Court is in agreement with the submission of the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner that it was not informed of the hearing that was

held on 2ih April 2017 and thus, was not afforded a hearing at which it could

have placed its side of the story. If the Petitioner was absent on 2ih April

2017, the 1st Respondent could very well have re-fixed the inquiry for an early

date and informed the Petitioner to be present on the next date, especially

since the Petitioner had honoured the notices 'P3' and 'P4' and participated at

the discussions. The fact that the 1st Respondent need not have rushed is

evident when one considers the fact that 'PSb' was dispatched almost five

months after 2ih April 2017.

3 (1969) 2 WLR 1294 -3t 1332

19

..

Before concluding, there is one matter that this Court wishes to advert to. The

Petitioner has brought to the attention of this Court that the 4th Respondent

has filed action in the District Court with regard to the same accident. While

this Court is of the view that the causes of action before the District Court and

the 1st Respondent are mutually exclusive, this Court wishes to reiterate that

the facts of this application were only considered in so far as it was necessary

for a determination of the issues that have been raised by the parties in this

application and that this Court has not reached any determination with regard

to the liability of the Petitioner, to compensate the 4th Respondent.

In the above circumstances, this Court issues a Writ of Certiorari in terms of

paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition quashing the decision contained in

'PSb'. This Court directs the 1st Respondent to afford the Petitioner and the 4th

Respondent a hearing, where they would have the opportunity of placing oral

and documentary material in support of their respective positions, and

thereafter make an order, with reasons for such order, within two months

from the date of this judgment. The Writ of Prohibition sought in paragraph (c)

of the prayer to the petition is therefore rejected. This Court makes no order

with regard to costs.
