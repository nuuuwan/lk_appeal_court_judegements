Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of

Panadura seeking to partition Lot 3 of Delgahawatta in extent

about 2 Roods among the Plaintiff and the 1st-4th Defendants.

The 5th-7th Defendants later intervened in the case.

At the trial, Plan No. 242 was considered as the Preliminary

Plan.1 It consists of 4 LotsA to D. Lot D, which is a road, and

1 Page 214 of the Brief.

3

Lot A, claimed by the 5th Defendant as a part of Lot 2 of

Delgahawatta2, were excluded from the land to be partitioned.

There is no dispute that Lot B in Plan No. 242 is Lot 3 of

Delgahawatta, the land to be partitioned. The dispute relates to

Lot C in Plan No. 242, i.e. whether it forms part of Lot 3 of

Delgahawatta. The position of the Plaintiff and the 1st-4th

Defendants is that the said Lot C is part of Lot 3 of

Delgahawatta whereas the contesting 6th and 7th Defendants

take a different position.

At this juncture it is apt to state that the 7th Defendant at the

end of the trial withdrew his issues as her dispute has amicably

settled with the 6th Defendant wherein the 6th Defendant has

agreed to give 10 perches to the 7th Defendant out of what she

would get from the corpus. The case of the 7th Defendant rests

on the success of the 6th Defendants case. In short, if the 6th

Defendant fails, the 7th Defendant shall also necessarily fail.3

I shall now advert to the issues raised by the 6th Defendant at

the trial. They are issue Nos. 15-19.4 By those issues the 6th

Defendant has taken up three positions.

a) The Plaintiffs action shall fail as the Plaintiff has filed this

action to partition a portion of a larger land known as

Delgahwatta.

b) The 6th Defendant is entitled to Lot C of Plan No. 242 by

Deeds.

2 Vide Plan No. 1064 at page 218 of the Brief and the Statement of Claim of the 5th Defendant at pages 165-170 of the Brief. 3 Vide the District Court written submission of the 7th Defendant at pages 269-275 of the Brief. 4 Pages 484-485 of the Brief.

4

c) The 6th Defendant has acquired the said Lot C by

prescriptive possession.

d) The 6th Defendant is entitled to all the improvements and

plantation in Lot C.

The learned District Judge has answered these issues against

the 6th Defendant and entered Judgment as prayed for by the

Plaintiff partitioning the Lots B and C of Plan No. 242 among the

Plaintiff and the 1st-4th Defendants.

Being dissatisfied with the said Judgment of the District Court

dated 11.09.2000, the 6th Defendant and the 7th Defendant have

preferred two separate appeals.

When these two appeals came up for the first time before me,

learned counsel for all the parties agreed to decide the two

appeals by way of written submissions and abide by a single

Judgment.

Both the 6th Defendant and the 7th Defendant, and also the

Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant, have filed written submissions.

I doubt whether the 7th Defendant can file a separate appeal

against the Judgment in the circumstances of this case.

Assuming she has, the only position taken up by the learned

counsel for the 7th Defendant in his written submissions is that

the Plaintiff cannot maintain this action to partition a portion of

the larger land known as Delgahawatta. Admittedly the Plaintiff

has filed this action to partition only Lot 3 of Delgahawatta.

5

This has been put in issue at the trial5 and the learned District

Judge has rightly answered that issue in the negative relying

inter alia on the 6th Defendants own Deeds. The Deed marked

6D1, executed in 1914, relates to Lot 2 of Delgahawatta.

According to the schedule of that Deed, the eastern boundary of

Lot 2 is Lot 1 of Delgahawatta and the western boundary of Lot

2 is Lot 3 of Delgahawatta, which is the land to be partitioned in

this case. That means, since at least 1914, Delgahawatta has

been divided into separate Lots and possessed separately.

Hence the finding of the learned District Judge on that issue is

flawless. The only argument of the 7th Defendant before this

Court therefore fails.

The learned District Judge has correctly held that the Deeds

produced by the 6th Defendant at the trial are not relevant to the

land to be partitioned, namely, Lot 3 of Delgahawatta.

This will take me to consider the appeal of the 6th Defendant. In

the written submissions filed on behalf of the 6th Defendant

instead of oral submissions, the only argument presented by the

learned counsel for the 6th Defendant is that the 6th Defendant

has prescribed to Lot C of Plan No. 242. The learned counsel

has not claimed any undivided rights on the Deeds.

The 6th Defendant or her successor the 6(a) Defendant (who is

the daughter of the 6th Defendant) was not living on that Lot.

They are living on the land above the northern boundary of the

land to be partitioned, which is Delgahawatta Kattiya.6 There is

no documentary evidence except the four Deeds (which are not

relevant to the Lot in question) marked at the trial to establish

uninterrupted and adverse possession over ten years.

A person who claims prescriptive title against the rightful

owners who have paper title has a very heavy burden to prove all

the requirements prescribed in section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance. The Plaintiffs Deeds relate to Lot 3 of Delgahawatta.

Mere possession over ten years is not prescriptive possession.

The possession shall be by title adverse to or independent of that

of the rightful owner. One cannot establish prescriptive title in

the air. A facile story of walking into abandoned premises after

the Japanese air raid constitutes material far too slender to found

a claim based on prescriptive title.7

There is another important point to be stressed. Where a party

invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in

order to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to

immovable property, the burden of proof rests squarely and fairly

on him to establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of

prescriptive rights.8 He is not entitled to do so by forming a

secret intention unaccompanied by an act of ouster.9

The parties to the case are close relations. The 6th Defendant

Baby Nona is the younger sister of the Plaintiff.10 When the

relationship between the parties is so close such as in the

instant action, the proof of the overt act manifesting the

commencement of adverse possession and leading strong

affirmative evidence to show continuation of such adverse

possession become extremely necessary.11

The 6th Defendant in this case has failed to prove any of these

things to successfully claim prescriptive possession to Lot C of

Plan No. 242 against the real co-owners of that Lot.

The claim of prescription of the 6th Defendant to Lot C of Plan

No. 242 is not entitled to succeed.

For the aforesaid reasons, I affirm the Judgment of the District

Court and dismiss the appeals of the 6th and the 7th Defendants,

but without costs.
