T

he Plaintiff~Respondent, who is now deceased, (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as "the Plaintiff") instituted this action originally in the District Court of Gampaha

praying inter alia for the following remedies :~

a. a declaration that the Defendant~Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

"the Defendant"), is a trustee of the Plaintiff to a l/3rd share of the land described in

the schedule to the plaint;

2

b. a declaration that the Plaintiff is the owner of the said 1/3rd share of the land

described in the schedule to the plaint;

c. an order directing the Defendant to transfer the said l/3rd share to the Respondent;

d. to eject the Defendant from the said 1/3rd share of the land.

In addition the Plaintiff averred in his plaint the following:-

a. on or around 27.03.1975 he had paid Rs. 3800/- and a further sum of Rs. 200/- as

notarial fees to a real estate agent House and Property Trades Ltd (H.T.P.) with

a view to purchasing the land described in the schedule to the plaint;

b. further he accompanied his father-in-law (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

Jamis Appuhamy) to the real estate agent (H.T.P) on the date he made the said

payment and the receipts acknowledging such payments were issued in his father-

in-law's name 'Mirihana Kankanamalage Jamis Appuhamy';

c. on 22.07.1977 the said Mirihana Kankanamalage Jamis Appuhamy-the Plaintiff's

father-in-law passed away and his estate along with this land devolved on the

Plaintiff's wife and two other children of the said Jamis Appuhamy; one child

being Nimalasena-the Defendant in the case;

d. accordingly, the deceased Defendant owned 1/3rd of the land described in the

schedule to the plaint;

e. however the deceased Defendant held this l/3rd share on trust, on behalf of the

Plaintiff because the Plaintiff had paid the consideration for the land;

f. since 15.10.1986 the deceased Defendant had been in possession of 1/3rd of the land

illegally, which was adverse to the interest of the Plaintiff.

The original Defendant by his answer had traversed the following:-

a. denying the averments contained in the plaint the deceased/original Defendant

Nimalasena stated that the land described in the schedule to the plaint was

purchased by his father "M.K. Jamis Appuhamy" having paid its market value at

the time;

3

b. the said M.K. Jamis Appuhamy passed away on 22.07.1977 and after his death his

estate devolved on the deceased Defendant and his two sisters;

c. thereafter by a Plan bearing No.2708 of LJ. Liyanage, Licensed Surveyor, the said

land was divided into 3 Lots and the Defendant and his two sisters began to enjoy

their respective lots since then;

d. further, having investigated into the matter after the death of the said Jamis

Appuhamy, the owners of the land described in the schedule to the plaint

transferred it to the deceased Defendant and his two sisters by a deed of sale

bearing No. 946 executed by C.L Abeygoda, Notary Public on 19.03.1987.

It is noteworthy that the original Plaintiff Edwin Wickramaarachchi who was married

to one of the sisters of the original Defendant namely Chandrawathie instituted this

action only against his brother-in-Iaw-the original Defendant and the cause of action

alleged was one of constructive trust against the brother-in-law only for a l/3rd portion of

the land, though another l/3rd had devolved on his wife Chandrawathie. The other l/3rd of

the land had devolved on the sister-in-law of the Plaintiff namely Sumanawathie.

Interestingly enough the Plaintiff claimed only the l/3rd held by his brother-in-law as

being embodied in the constructive trust. Whilst the case was pending in the District

Court, the original Plaintiff Edwin Wickramaarachchi passed away and the case was

continued in the District Court of Pugoda when the territorial jurisdiction of Gampaha

changed.

From the forgOing narrative of the case it is apparent that the Plaintiff formulated his

claim of constructive trust on the basis that it was him who had paid the consideration

for the land which was more fully depicted in Plan No.B05 and dated January 25, 1975.

The land which was described in the said plan as Lot 43 of a larger land is in an extent of

8 perches. The agents of the owners known as House and Property Trades Ltd (H.PT)

were selling the land on behalf of the owners of the land namely P.A.P Deraniyagala, S.U.

Deraniyagala and LR. Deraniyagala. In both the plaint and his testimony, the Plaintiff

relied on a document marked P4 which is a receipt for a payment of Rs. 1000/- as an

4

advance payment issued by Mrs. P. Deraniyagala. The said document P4 which is dated

15.03.1975 indicates that this sum of payment had been made to the said Mrs.

Deraniyagala by Mirihana Kankanamalage Jamis Appuhuamy~the father~in~law of the

Plaintiff, though the name of the purchaser is indicated as A. Wicramarachchi on P4.

If one peruses another document marked as PI which is styled as a sale book entry, the

name of the purchaser is once again M.K. Jamis Appuhamy~the father~in~law. This

document declares that a total sum of Rs.3800/~ has been paid but it would appear that

one A. Wickramarachchi made the payment of Rs. 3800/~ for M.K. Jamis Appuhamy.

The document marked P2 is a receipt from House and Properties Trade Ltd and this

document indicates that a sum of Rs.3800/ ~ had been paid by M.K. J amis Appuhamy. The

Document P2 does not mention nary a word about the Plaintiff as having made the

payment. The report of the Director (legal) of H.P.T Group marked as V5 and dated 4th

of September 1986 is more explicit as to who made the payment for the purchase of this

land. This document which draws attention to the dispute as to who has made the

payment sets out in detail, from the book entries maintained at the office of HPT, as to

who made the payments for the land. For clarity of the narrative it would suffice to set

out the contents of the document marked V5.

1. In terms of the receipt bearing No. C.055734 Jamis Appuhamy had paid a sum of

Rs. 1000/~ on March 15, 1975.

2. As borne out by receipt No. C.055858, Mr. Jamis Appuhamy had paid a sum of Rs.

3000/~on 2thMarch 1975.

3. In terms of a letter dated 25th of March 1975, a sum of Rs. 8200/~ and 190/~remained

outstanding to be paid for the completion of the purchase. It would appear that

this outstanding balance had been subsequently paid as borne out by receipt V2.

In other words it was a payment made by Jamis Appuhamy~the father~in~law of

the Plaintiff.

As I stated above these documents make it patently clear that it was J amis Appuhamy

who had made the payment for the purchase of Lot 43~the subject~matter in question

5

which was later transferred by the original owners of the land to the son and two

daughters of Jamis Appuhamy. The son who got 1J3rd of the land was the original

Defendant in the case, whilst the wife of the original Plaintiff obtained another 1/3rd and

the remaining 1J3rd devolved on the second daughter ofJamis Appuhamy. The deed of sale

was effected by the original owners the Deraniyagalas so to speak only after J amis

Appuhamy had since crossed the great divide. The document marked V5 of 4th of

September 1986 further states that as far back as 2th January 1979 a Surveyor named J.

Liyanage had partitioned Lot 43 into three allotments among the three children of the

deceased J amis Appuhamy namely Mirihana Kankanamlage Nimalasena (the Defendant-

the brother-in-law of the Plaintiff), Mirihana Kankanamlage Kusumawathie (sister-in-

law of the Plaintiff) and Mirihana Kankanamlage Chandrawathie (the wife of the

Plaintiff). The deed of sale bearing No.946 was executed on 19th of March 1987 in the

name of the aforesaid three children of the deceased J amis Appuhamy. One cannot resist

noticing the chronology of the events.

In 1975, the late father-in-law of the Plaintiff made a payment for the purchase of the land

as indicated by the receipts referred to above. In 1979, the three children, one of whom

was Chandrawathie-the wife of the Plaintiff, proceeded to block the land into three

equal parcels. It is curious that the Plaintiff who stood by as a mute bystander whilst the

partitioning was taking place around him possibly woke up only in June 1987 -barely two

months after the execution of the deed of sale in favor of the three persons who

partitioned the land. It also begs the question as to why the Plaintiff filed this action only

against Nimalasena his brother-in-law, whilst there were two others as well who had

become the legal owners of the land namely his wife and sister-in-law. The plaint seeks a

constructive trust only in respect of a 1/3rd of the property.

It is quite clear from the above narrative that the wife of the Plaintiff also became the

owner of a 1/3rd share of the land. It is quite strange as to how the Plaintiff could seek the

remedy of constructive trust only against his brother-in-law when his own wife became

the owner of another 1J3rd share of the land. If the brother-in-law was holding a 1J3rd

share as a trustee for the Plaintiff, it passes strange as to how the wife and sister-in-law

6

who also received l/3rd share each of the land have not been sued for a similar declaration

for constructive trust. Maybe the wife was omitted on account of uxorial bond. Why

was not the sister~in ~law sued? These are question that go a begging with nary an

explanation. For it was the assertion of the Plaintiff that he had paid the consideration

not for only 1/3rd but for the entire extent of land. Then there would exist a cause of

action to sue not only the brother~in~law (the Defendant) but also his wife

Chandrawathie and sister~in~law Sumanawathie. But the Plaintiff elected to sue only the

brother~in~law in order to have him held liable as a constructive trustee. The wife and

sister~in~law were spared the ordeal of a suit for a constructive trust.

Another important question arises. If the Plaintiff had acquired proprietary right or

beneficial interest over the land, why did he maintain a stoic silence when the land was

blocked into three equal portions by the surveyor on the 23rd of January 1979? The

surveyor was quite emphatic that nobody protested when he went to partition Lot 43

into three equal portions and demarcated the fragmented lots as 43A, 43B and 43C. The

evidence of the surveyor that nobody made any protestation or raised a whimper against

the partitioning of the land shakes the credibility of the Plaintiff's version that he had

acquired the beneficial interest of this land to himself.

The Plaintiff could not plead that he was unaware that not only his wife but also his

sister~in~law had become the owners of a 2/3rd share of lot 43. Apart from the fact that he

did not plead a constructive trust against his wife and sister~in~law, the fact that he

instituted this action only against the brother~in~law raises doubts about the veracity of

the Plaintiff's version that he held the beneficial interest only in the l/3rd share held by

the brother~in~law. Moreover, the silence on the part of the Plaintiff at the time of the

division of property into three equal parcels would connote estoppel by conduct and it

would not lie in the mouth of the Plaintiff now to assert that the beneficial interest of the

1/3rd portion resides in him. In my view, the omission to protest at the time of the

partition would estop the Plaintiff from asserting a contrary position at the trial. It has to

be recalled that the wife of the Plaintiff herself testified that the Plaintiff facilitated the

7

partitioning of the land into three blocks. Is this conduct of the Plaintiff consistent with

the legal and equitable dominium that he now seeks for only 1/3rd of the land?

Estoppel by Acquiescence or Standing by or Encouragement

Estoppels by standing by or encouragement or acquiescence are equitable causes of

action or they may constitute defences to an equitable claim. A declaration for a

constructive trust is an equitable claim which may be defeated by a successful plea of

estoppel by standing by or acquiescence.

Spencer Bower and Turner state the principle of estoppel by acquiescence as follows:~

"Where A has a right or title which B is in fact infringing under a mistaken belief that his acts are

not acts of infringement at all, and A is aware of his own title or right, and also of B's invasion of

that title or right, and of his erroneous belief that he is not encroaching thereon, but is lawfully

exercising rights of his own, and yet, with that knowledge, A so conducts himself or so abstains

from objection, protest, warning or action, as to foster and maintain the delusion under which he

knows that B is labOUring, and induces B to act to his prejudice on the faith of the acknowledgment

to be implied from such conduct or inaction or, A is not permitted afterwards to assert his own

rights against B, or contest B's rights against himself,,1

Thus, Thesiger, LJ. stated in De Bussche v. Alt:2

"If a person haVing a right, and seeing another person about to commit, or in the course of

committing an act infringing upon that right, stands by in such a manner as really to induce the

person committing the act, and who might otherwise have abstained from it, to believe that he

assents to its being committed, he cannot afterwards be heard to complain of the act. ,J

In Ramsden v. Dyson,4 Lord Cranworth, L.c. stated the necessary conditions of

estoppel by standing by or acquiescence or encouragement in the following terms:-

"If a stranger begins to build on my land, supposing it to be his own, and I, perceiving his mistake,

abstain from setting him right, and leave him to persevere in his error, a Court of Equity will not

allow me afterwards to assert my title to the land on which he had expended money on the

supposition that the land was his own It considers that, when I saw the mistake into which he had

fallen, it was my duty to be active and to state my adverse title; and that it would be dishonest in

me to remain wholly impassive on such an occasion, in order afterwards to profit by the mistake

which I might have prevented. But.. .... to raise such an eqUity, two things are required,first, that the

person expending his money supposes himself to be building on his own land; and, secondly, that

the real owner ..... knows that the land belongs to him and not to the person expending the

money ...... For if a stranger builds on my land, knOWing it to be mine, there is no principle of equity

which would prevent my claiming the land with the benefit of all the expenditure made on it. There

would be nothing in my conduct, active or passive, making it inequitable in me to assert my legal

rights. It follows5 as a corollary from these rules ..... that if my tenant builds on land which he holds

under me, he does not thereby, in the absence of special circumstances, acqUire any right to prevent

me taking possession of the lands and bUildings when the tenancy had determined."

The principle of giving relief in cases where the so called proprietor of land has

knOwingly acquiesced in another'S mistake was followed in Willmott v. Barber,6 where

Sir Edward Fry J. set out his famous 'five probanda': J

i. the person concerned must have made a mistake as to his legal rights;

4 (1866) lR 1 Hl129, 140-1, and 162, 163, 174; Michaud v. City of Montreal (1923) 92 UPC 161; A-G to the Prince of Wales v. Collom [1916] 2 KB 193, 203-4. lord Cranworth did not describe the owners conduct as acquiescence but this description was used in East India Co. v. Vincent (1740) 2 Atk 83, n 115.

Kundan Loll (1899) lR 26 Ind App 58, 64 where the Privy Council rejected a claim by tenants to perpetual leases based on alleged acquiescence by the landlord in their construction of buildings; approved Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The King [1931] AC 414,430 (Canadian Pacific); n 66. para 11-015.

(1975) 3 A.E.R. 865 at 876-877 and Kammins Ballrooms Co. Ltd., v. Zenith Investments (Torquay) Ltd., (1970) 2 All E.R 871 at 895 (Hl).

ii. he must have expended some money or must have done some act on the faith of his

mistaken belief;

iii. the other party must know of his own right; and

iv. he must also know of the other's mistake,

v. he must have encouraged the claimant's expenditure or other action, actively or by

saying nothing.

If one transposes the numbered paragraphs on the facts in this case the person concerned

would be the Defendant, because if at all the defence of estoppel by standing by or

acquiescence or encouragement would be open to him on evidence even though it was

not specifically pleaded; An appellate court could raise this issue of estoppel in appeal as

it arises on the evidence led. In fact when the partitioning of the land took place in 1979

among the siblings, they had not even become the owners of the land but they did

expend expenses in emplOying a surveyor to block the land into three parcels. There is

also evidence that some structure was put up on the land. The Plaintiff facilitated all this

though he later claimed that the beneficial title to the land resided in him. The

probability of that claim is weakened by the Plaintiff's acquiescence or standing by or

encouragement that he provided to the children of] amis Appuhamy, one among whom

was his wife.

There is a catena of cases in Sri Lanka that throw light on estoppel by standing by or

acquiescence or encouragement which could support either a cause of action or a defence

to an equitable claim like in the instant appeal.

In a banking litigation that arose in CoDettes Ltd v. Bank of Ceylon8 Sharvananda, J. (as

His Lordship then was) considered the concept of estoppel by acquiescence. In this case,

there was an obligation on the part of the defendant bank to send bank statements by

post, but the plaintiff company's employees were aware of and acquiesced in the handing

over of monthly statements for four years and weekly statements for the next six years to

one I, a sales manager and director of a subSidiary company, who committed several

8 (1984) 2 SrLLR 253 S.C

10

frauds on the company in regard to the transactions with the bank. It was held that an

acquiescence is not a question of fact but of legal inference from facts found and it must

be intentional conduct with knowledge, and the plaintiff was now estopped by twelve

years of acquiescence from complaining that the delivery of the bank statements to I was

wrongful. It was bound by such performance. By acquiescing in I's acts of collecting the

bank statements and permitting him to deal with them, the plaintiff held him out to the

bank as having authority to collect the monthly and weekly statements and thereby

dispensed with the necessity of sending them by post. The plaintiff by its conduct

ratified and adopted the delivery of the statements to I on its behalf and the obligation of

the bank to send them to the plaintiff was thereby discharged and there was estoppel by

acquiescence.

As in the English cases there are cases in Sri Lanka which impose a requirement of an

implied duty to speak when one's rights are being infringed upon. In Sri Lanka as in

England, a person, who knowing that a violation of his legal rights is in progress,

deliberately stands by and allows another person, who has no knowledge of the

existence of such a right, to believe that it does not exist and to spend his own money on

the strength of that belief, may be held to be estopped by acquiescence from afterwards

setting up as against the person so misled the right which he had concealed, see the

decision of Wood Renton c.J in Abdulla v. Amarasekera9. As concise as the judgment

is, the learned Chief Justice pithily uses the expressions such as standing by and

acquiescence in the case. As I said before, the court can draw legal inferences of estoppel

by acquiescence having regard to the proved facts in a particular case.

It is an essential ingredient that the person who had the legal and beneficial tide must

have kept silent; If the defence of estoppel by standing by or acquiescence or

encouragement were to succeed, there must be evidence that the legal owner knew of his

rights but yet chose to remain silent. Fernando v. Fernanddo reiterates that

requirement. The plaintiffs who were entided to three,fourths share of a land, not

9 (1914) 2 Balasingham's Notes of Cases 50.

10 (1911) 14 N.l.R 155.

11

knowing that they were so entitled, stood by when the 3rd defendant, who was entitled

to only 1/4th of the land, executed two successive leases in favour of the first and second

defendants, in which he dealt with the whole land. In an action brought by the plaintiffs

to vindicate their title against the defendants, it was held that they were not estopped

from setting up their title. The defence of estoppel by acquiescence specifically raised by

counsel for the defendants in this case failed to the ground for want of the ingredient

that is requite to the constitution of the defence-namely the Plaintiffs knew that they

were the owners of the three-fourths share of the land but yet they stood by holding the

3rd defendant out as the owner. In this case there was no evidence of any silence or

inaction on the part of the Plaintiffs on any occasion when it was their duty to assert

their rights.

Lascelles A.C.] said: "It is essential, in order to create an estoppel by acquiescence, to

show that the plaintiffs, knowing that a violation of their rights was in progress, stood

by and so misled the first and second defendants." Unlike in the case of Fernando v.

Fernando (supra) which was a case on an appeal from the District Court of Negombo, in

the instant appeal before me, the Plaintiff came to court asserting that he was the owner

of the entire land. His cause of action was that his brother-in-law (the Defendant) was

holding 1I3rd of the land on trust. If it was the case, why did he permit the Defendant to

secure that l/3rd by informally partitioning it and even improve on it? The Plaintiff had a

duty to speak but remained speechless.

In Saparamadu v. Saparamadu (1918) 20 N.LR. 369, this was an action for declaration

title to land and the plaintiff was the purchaser at a Fiscal's sale in execution against the

2nd defendant. The land was seized by the Fiscal on January 15 and sold on February 8.

On January 14 the 1st defendant took a conveyance from the 2nd defendant of the land in

question and registered the same on January 25. Thereafter, the land was sold in

execution against the 2nd defendant. The 1st defendant was present at the sale, but did not

inform the bidders at the sale that he had already purchased the land. In an action for

declaration of title brought by the purchaser, Ennis and Shaw JJ., held that, the 1st

defendant was estopped from setting up title to the said land. The absence of any

12

circumstance which might have put the purchaser on his guard, and on inquiry into the

title, facilitated the imputation of responsibility to the 1st defendant for the belief under

which the purchaser bought the land.

Once again the failure to assert one's own title figured in this case. There was estoppel by

acquiescence that is discernible on the part of the 1st defendant in the case. The crucial

factor that tilted the scales in favor of the plaintiffs in the case was that the 1st defendant,

though present at the fiscal's sale, did not intimate to the purchaser (the plaintiff) that

he was entitled to this land. He was a mute bystander when the plaintiff bought his land

at the fiscal's sale. Though Ennis, J. and Shaw, J. did not use in their separate judgments

the phrase "estoppel by standing by or acquiescence or encouragement" in this appeal

from the District Court of Negombo, the learned Justices were indeed dealing with this

species of estoppel. After all, estoppel by standing by or acquiescence or encouragement

has been described as 'no more than an instance of the law of estoppel by words or

conduct'. 11

All that these concatenation of cases lay down is that if A holds title to a property which

is encroached upon by B under the very nose of A and is improved upon by B with no

protest from A, on the supposition that he has proprietary interests therein, A would be

estopped from asserting his title afterwards as against B. Estoppel by standing by or

acquiescence or encouragement begins to operates against A and the defence is triggered

by A's silence. There was a duty to speak which A failed to discharge. The quiescence on

the part of A under those circumstances can best be described as acquiescence and

assent. It is no more than an instance of the law of estoppel by words or conduct. Silence

triggers it and the law prefers to call it estoppel by standing by or acquiescence or

encouragement.

Assuming without conceding that the Plaintiff had ownership in the property, one

confronts further questions. When did he acquire ownership? I have already held that

the evidence led in the case does not support his version that he had paid consideration

11 See De Bussche v. Alt (1878) 8 Ch.D 286, per Thesiger U at p.314. See also Halsbury (4thEdn. Reissue, 1992), xvi, para 924. 13

for the property. His only tenuous argument for assertion of title lay in his claim that he

paid the consideration but the receipts were issued in the name of the father-in-law.

Assuming without conceding that he had paid for the purchase, then the only way in

which he could claim beneficial interest in the property was through the conduit of a

constructive trust which he had placed before the District Court.

I have held that such an equitable owner should have protested against his wife, sister-

in-law and brother-in-law improving the property in defiance of his proprietary

interests. The precedents establish that he should have put them on notice. But was he

the equitable owner? Will equity aid him?

In this backdrop I would turn to the Plaintiff's equitable claim of constructive trust.

CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST

If at all, the provisions that could afford relief to the Plaintiff would be Section 83 and 84

of the Trust Ordinance. In my view the case advanced by the Plaintiff before the District

Court of Pugoda could not fall within Section 83 of the Trust Ordinance which goes as

follows:-

"Where the owner of the property transfers or bequeaths it, and it cannot reasonably inferred

consistently with the attendant circumstances that he intended to dispose the beneficial interest

therein, the transferee or legatee must hold such property for the benefit of the owner or his legal

representative.

Only the owner of a property who held that property before transferring it to another,

can claim the benefit of Section 83 of the Trust Ordinance. It is abundantly clear that the

Plaintiff was never the owner of the property on paper before it was transferred to

Nimalasena (the Defendant), Chandrawathie (the wife of the Plaintiff) and

Kusumawathie, the sister-in-law of the Plaintiff. In the circumstances Section 83 of the

Trust Ordinance would hardly avail the Plaintiff.

Then the Plaintiff would have to bring his case within Section 84 of the Trust Ordinance

as this is the section that could have well advanced the case of the Plaintiff provided the

14

ingredients of Section 84 were satisfied. In terms of Section 84 of the Trust Ordinance

where the property is transferred to one person for a consideration paid or provided by

another person, and it appears that such other person did not intend to payor provide

such consideration for the benefit of the transferee, the transferee must hold the property

for the benefit of the person paying or providing the consideration.

The rationale for this provision goes back at least as far back as the late eighteenth

century, and its most authoritative basis is the case Dyer v. DyeJ2. In this case Eyre CB

remarked that:-

"The trust of a legal estate ..... whether taken in the names of the purchasers and others jointly, or in

the name of others without that of the purchaser; whether in one name or several; whether jointly

or successive, results to the man who advances the purchase money."

Thus in English law whoever provides the purchase money for the property will be

viewed in equity as having an equitable interest in the property, in the form of a resulting

trust in their favour. It was Mr. Justice Megarry who defined this type of trust in the

leading case of Re VanderveU's Trusts (No.2j3 as 'presumed resulting trusts'. So

English law takes the view that whenever a person has bought property in another'S

name, unless there is some indication that he does not intend to keep the beneficial

interest, there is a presumption of a resulting trust in his favour-see Fowkes v. Pascoe.14

In English law this is a presumption, not a rule and like some presumptions, it may be

rebutted by evidence to the contrary. It is sometimes referred to as a presumption against

a gift. To put it in another way, in English law equity will presume that the property is

held on presumed resulting trust for the person providing the purchase money. There is

no presumption that it is a gift to the transferee who did not give consideration. In order

to rebut the presumption, the burden is on the transferee to prove that the transfer was a

gift.

But our Trust Ordinance No.9 of 1917 as amended incorporates purchase price resulting

trust as a species of constructive trusts under Section 84 of Chapter IX.

Section 84 of the Trust Ordinance makes it quite explicit:-

"Where property is transferred to one person for a consideration paid or provided by another

person, and it appears that such other person did not intend to pay or provide

such consideration for the benefit of the transferee, the transferee must hold the

property for the benefit of the person paying or providing the consideration."

For Section 84 to come into play, there must be consideration passing from A to a vendor

who in turn transfers the property to B. If it appears upon evidence that A contributed

the money towards the purchase price fully intending that B must hold the property on

trust for A, there will be a constructive trust resulting to the benefit of A. A will have a

beneficial interest in the property provided his intention not to make a gift of the

property to B emerges from evidence. In other words A the provider of consideration qua

a Plaintiff must prove a) he contributed to the purchase price and b) he did not intend to

have the transfer effected for the benefit of B. In addition to the proof that he paid the

consideration, the Plaintiff must establish in terms of Section 84 that he intended to keep

the beneficial interest for himself. There is a burden cast on a Plaintiff pleading a Section

84 trust to establish these ingredients-l) provision of money and 2) no intention to give

the beneficial interest to B-the transferee.

If A in the example is represented by the Plaintiff, the obvious question one would pose

is-Did he provide the consideration for the property? Both the oral and documentary

evidence in this case point to the fact that it was the father of the original Defendant

Nimalasena, Chandrawathie (wife of the Plaintiff) and Kusumawathie (sister-in-law of

the Plaintiff) who had paid the consideration for the transfer. The document marked VS

establishes that it was the father of the Defendant who had paid the consideration. This

is a report dated 4th September 1986 which preceded the execution of the deed of sale

bearing No. 946. Even the deed of sale in its attestation makes reference to consideration

for the purchase as having been made by ] amis Appuhamy the father of the Defendant.

16

On a preponderance of evidence, it is quite apparent that the payment of consideration

by the Plaintiff has not been established and it is improbable that Section 84 of the

Trusts Ordinance could come to the rescue of the Plaintiff in those circumstances. The

essential and primary requirement of Section 84 which is payment by the Plaintiff

towards the purchase price has not been proved on a preponderance of evidence and

therefore a constructive trust cannot arise on proved facts in the case.

In Wijesundera v. Neela Wickremasinghe (2002) 2 SrLLR 307, the plaintiff~

respondent instituted the action seeking a declaration that the defendant~appellant was

holding the property in trust for the plaintiff~respondent. The defendant~appellant

denied the said contention and sought a declaration that he is the owner. It was the

position of the plaintiff~respondent, that the property was purchased in the name of the

defendant~ appellant, and on the same day it was mortgaged to the Bank and the plaintiff~

respondent provided the money to the defendant~appellant to pay the instalments to the

Bank.

The District Court held with the plaintiff~respondent . On appeal it was contended that

it was the defendant~appellant who had paid the instalments to the Bank. The Court of

Appeal held: ~

(1) Under s. 84 the plaintiff~respondent in order to succeed has to establish (i) that

the consideration was paid or provided by him, (li) that the plaintiff~respondent

did not intend to payor provide such consideration for the benefit of the

defendant~appellant .

(2) On the material available, it is difficult to reject the position that it was the

defendant~appellant who had paid the instalments in respect of the loan secured

by way of a mortgage to the Bank.

(3) The plaintiff~respondent failed to produce a single receipt relating to the payment

of loan instalments from the commencement of payments. As the receipts were in

the defendant~respondent's name, even the advance payments to the seller had

been affected jointly.

17

Upon a conspectus of the foregoing it is crystal clear that the Plaintiff never made out a

case of constructive trust at the trial and the learned District Judge of Pugoda misdirected

herself on the law and facts when she proceeded to hold that the Defendant was holding

the 1I3rd of the property on trust for the Plaintiff.

I would observe that once the paterfamilias of the family Jamis Appuhamy passed away

the whole arrangement among the three children to secure the transfer in their names

had supervened and in my view there is nothing unjust in that equitable arrangement.

According to the testimony of Chandrawathie (the wife of the Plaintiff herself), it was

the Plaintiff who had facilitated the partitioning of the land which benefitted her. Thus

here was a Plaintiff who had acquiesced in the supervening arrangement and in my view

this voluntary acquiescence on the part of the Plaintiff also dis entitles him to invoke the

equitable jurisdiction of this court.

In the circumstances I set aside the judgment of the District Court of Pugoda dated 8th

December 2000 and allow the appeal of the Defendant~Appellant . The Plaintiff's case

would thus stand dismissed.
