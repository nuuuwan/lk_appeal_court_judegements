Thus the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the State submitted that since the Petitioner agreed to deposit the money in Magistrates Court, the State is agreeable to stay the proceedings in the Magistrates Court until the final conclusion of the matter and if the matter is decided in favour of the Respondent, he is entitled to withdraw the money. Counsel for the 4th had also no objection to this settlement. Accordingly, this Court directed the Petitioner Authority to deposit the ordered amount within one week from 04.12.2017 in the Magistrates Court of Kaduwela. Also, this Court informed the Petitioner that if the Petitioner fails to deposit that money within the prescribed period, the Magistrates Court case can be proceeded; if the money is deposited within the prescribed period of time the proceedings in the Magistrates Court is stayed until the final conclusion of this matter.",

The Arbitrator is not simply called upon to hold an inquiry, where the ball would be in the court of the parties to the dispute and, it would be left to them to tender what evidence they consider necessary requiring the arbitrator to be just a judge presiding over the inquiry, the control and progress of which will be in the hands of the parties themselves or their Counsel. What the Industrial Disputes Act has done appears to me to be to substitute in place of the rigid procedures of the law envisaged by the adversarial system, a new and more flexible procedure, which is in keeping with the fashion in which equity in English law gave relief to the litigants from the rigidity of the common law. The function of the arbitral power in relation to industrial disputes is to ascertain and declare what in the opinion of the Arbitrator ought to be the respective rights and liabilities of the parties as they exist at the moment the proceedings are instituted. His role is more inquisitorial, and he has a duty to go in search for the evidence, and he is not strictly required to follow the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance in doing so. Just as much as the procedure before the arbitrator is not governed by the rigid provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, the procedure followed by him need not be fettered by the rigidity of the law.

Lawyers familiar with the phraseology commonly used in relation to exercise of statutory discretions often use the word \"unreasonable\" in a rather comprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is frequently used as a general description of the things that must not be done. For instance, a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law. He must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is said, to be acting unreasonably",
