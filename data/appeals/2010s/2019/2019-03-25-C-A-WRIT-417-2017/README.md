Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this writ application on 08.12.2017 basically

challenging the decision of the Securities and Exchange

Commission of Sri Lanka to initiate legal proceedings against the

petitioner under the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri

Lanka Act, No. 36 of 1987, as amended. However the

application was supported only yesterday for interim relief and

notice as adjusting the matter outside the Court was failed and

the petitioner has received summons in MC Fort Case No.

12639/19 to appear before the said Court on the 28th March 2019

in respect of this matter.1

As legal proceedings have now been initiated, the learned

Presidents Counsel for the petitioner supported for the interim

relief preventing the Securities and Exchange

Commission/learned Magistrate from proceeding with that case

until final determination of this application. The learned Senior

State Counsel for the Securities and Exchange Commission

vehemently objects for granting interim relief and also notice

being issued on the substantive application.

The principal argument of the learned Senior State Counsel is

that no writ lies against the substantive reliefs sought for by the

petitioner in the prayer to the petition.

Conversely, the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for

the petitioner is mainly two-fold.

1 Vide motion of the Attorney-at-Law of the petitioner dated 19.03.2019.

The pivotal argument is that the decision of the Securities and

Exchange Commission not to compound the matter in terms of

section 51(a) of the Securities and Exchange Commission Act is

unreasonable and arbitrary and therefore shall be quashed by

way of certiorari. I am unable to accept that the said decision

P7 was taken arbitrarily as it has been reached after giving a

hearing to the petitioner as stated in P7 itself.

Even after the filing of this application, it appears, another more

serious attempt has been made by the petitioner to compound

the matter without success. Learned Senior State Counsel in

the course of her submission drew the attention of the Court to

a letter dated 24.01.2018 sent to the petitioner in pursuant to

that attempt and a letter dated 05.05.2018 received by the

Commission from the petitioner in reply.

The petitioner concedes that compounding under the Act is in

the discretion of the Commission.2 According to section 51(a) of

the Securities and Exchange Commission Act, The Commission

may having regard to the circumstances in which the offence

under this Act was committed, compound such offence subject to

conditions. This Court is unaware of the full circumstances

under which the offences are alleged to have been committed

except what has been stated by the alleged offender himself in

the petition.

On the other hand, whether this Court can, in the exercise of

writ jurisdiction, delve into those factual and always disputed

matters, is another question.

2 Vide paragraph 66 of the Petition.

Can this Court compel the Commission to compound the

matter? I think not. When that question was posed in the

course of the submission, the learned Presidents Counsel stated

that the petitioner seeks only to quash P7 whereby

compounding was ruled out. In my view, even if that relief is

granted, that will not solve the matter. If we stop at that, we are

in limbo. I regret, I am not impressed by that argument.

The other argument of the learned Presidents Counsel is that P8

and P9 speak of the alleged violations of Colombo Stock

Exchange Listing Rules, and those violations cannot, even if

true, be considered as offences committed under the Securities

and Exchange Commission Act, and therefore, P8 and P9

decisions and/or findings3 are void ab initio. Learned Senior

State Counsel does not accept that argument. I think, for the

present purposes, I do not need to rule on that matter.

In any event, P8 and P9 are Show Cause letters, and therefore

constitute part of the investigation process. They are not final

decisions. P8 and P9 have been sent to Show Cause before

taking a final decision.

On the other hand, violation of Colombo Stock Exchange Listing

Rules is not the only offence which is alleged to have been

committed by the petitioner. The petitioner is, as seen from P4-

P7, also suspected of Insider Trading. This is a different offence,

and as seen from P7, was the one, the Securities and Exchange

Commission was unwilling to compound. Insider Trading is,

3 Vide paragraph 50 of the Petition.

5

without doubt, an offence under the Securities and Exchange

Commission Act.

For the aforesaid reasons, I am not inclined to grant the interim

relief.

I understand that this is an important case. Hence there is no

necessity to hurriedly decide the question whether or not Notice

shall be issued. Yesterday, the learned counsel for both parties

could not make their submissions fully due to time constraints.

Therefore both parties can file their written submissions on the

question whether Notice shall be issued on the substantive

application on or before 15.05.2019 at the registry with a copy

to the Attorney-at-Law of the opposite party. Reply

submissions, if any, can be tendered on or before 29.05.2019.
