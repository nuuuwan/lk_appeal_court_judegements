M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

This an appeal stemming from the judgment of the learned District Judge of

Matale in respect of a land action bearing Case No. 3458/L.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) instituted the

above action praying inter alia for a declaration that the Defendant-

Respondent (Respondent) does not have any right to use the right of way in

the compound or near the compound (as described in the schedule to the

plaint) to have access to his house and a direction on the Respondent that he

should use the roadway on the Northern side which was used by the

Respondent previously and for costs.

The Appellant in his plaint stated that he became entitled to 1/2 share of the

corpus by deed bearing No. 1022 dated 01.01.1982 and he possessed the

corpus. He further stated that The Respondent after giving up the road access,

he continued to use the road way in the compound of the Appellant (vide

page 35 and 42 of the appeal brief). Being strained with the above action of

the Respondent, the Appellant compelled to file the above action in the

District Court.

In contrast, the Respondent in his answer stated inter alia that the right of

way was used by him for more than 50 years (vide: page 46 of the appeal

brief).

After conclusion of trail, the learned District Judge dismissed the action of the

Plaintiff and answered the issue raised by the Respondent in his favour. Being

aggrieved by the said judgment the Appellant preferred this appeal.

It was the contention of the Appellant that the right of way which was used by

the Respondent-the road on the North edge of the Appellants land and that

road still available for reasonable access. Also it is revealed form the Plan

bearing Nos. 2024 dated 20.04.1991 and 2194 dated 12.01.1989 correctly

depict the road way used by the Respondent is A to B (vide: page 133-134 of

the appeal brief). In addition to this road way (A to B), the Respondent

claimed for a right of way which is depicted in Plan No. 2194 dated

12.01.1989.

Its clear from the trial proceedings that, the Respondent in his testimony

stated that he commenced to use the right of way in question after he had got

a cart which he bought 20-25 years ago; and he accepted that he bought the

cart in 1985, but the dispute started even before that. (Vide: page 81 of the

appeal brief).

Its further revealed that even, the Respondent argued that he used the road

for more than 62 years he coherently had not lead any evidence in this regard.

In Kandaiah Vs. Seenitamby [17 NLR 29] it was held that,

The evidence to establish a prescriptive servitude of way must

be precise and definite. It must relate to a defined track, and

must not consist of proof of mere straying across an open land at

any point which is at the moment most convenient.

In Adonis Fernando Vs. Livera [49 NLR 350] it was held that,

"The onus of proving a claim of this character is upon the person

alleging it, and the claimant, to succeed, must show that he has

no reasonably sufficient access to the public road for himself and

his servants to enable him, if he is a farmer, to carry on his

4

farming operations. If he has an alternative route to the one

claimed, although such route may be less convenient and involve

a longer or more arduous journey, so long as the existing road

gives him reasonable access to a public road he must be content,

and cannot insist upon a more direct approach over his

neighbor's property."

[Vide: Graham J.P. in Lentz Vs. Mullin (1914) A.D.69 at 76]

In the circumstances, I hold that the learned District Judge was not mindful on

the above lacunas and the contradictions on the Respondents case.

Therefore, I set aside the judgment of the District Court and grant the reliefs

sought by the Appellant.

However, I make no order as to costs.

Appeal allowed.
