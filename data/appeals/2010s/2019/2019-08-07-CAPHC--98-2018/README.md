The Petitioner-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the order of the

Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of North Central Province

holden in Anuradhapura dated 25.06.2018 in Case No. 41/2017 (REV) and seeking

Page 3 of8

to set aside the confiscation order mady by the Learned Magistrate of

Anuradhapura dated 02.10.2017 in Case No. 73711.

Facts of the case:

The 3(a) and 3(b) accused-respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 'accused

persons') were charged in the Magistrate's Court of Anuradhapura for clearing and

digging soil in a Reserve Forest, an offence punishable under section 20(1) and

section 53A read with section 40(I)(a) and (b) of the Forest Ordinance as

"-amended. The accused persons pleaded guilty and were convicted and imposed a

fine of Rs. 2000/= on each accused. Thereafter a vehicle inquiry was held with

regard to the Bulldozer/Caterpillar bearing No. CAT - D4E that was used for the

commission of offence. The petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

'appellant') gave evidence in the inquiry and the Learned Magistrate confiscated

the vehicle by his order dated 02.10.2017.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant preferred an application for

revision to the Provincial High Court of Anuradhapura and the Learned High Court

Judge affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant filed this appeal.

The following grounds of appeal were averred on behalf of the appellant;

1. The order of the Learned High Court Judge is bad in law and against the

material placed before Court

2. The finding of the Learned High Court Judge and the Learned Magistrate

that the appellant was not the owner of the caterpillar at the time of taking it

into custody, is erroneous

Page 4 of8

3. The Learned High Court Judge erred in, law by rejecting the documents 'P I'

to 'P28' stating that the documents were not produced before the Learned

Magistrate when the appellant gave evidence

4. The Learned High Court Judge misapplied the findings of the case of

'Wijeyakoon V. Wijeyakoon (1986) 2 Sri L.R 325, to the facts of this case

5. The Learned High Court Judge misinterpreted section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance

6. The Learned High Court Judge and the Learned Magistrate failed to

...... judicially evaluate the evidence placed before them with regard to the

ownership of the said caterpillar, thus erred in law

7. The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by rejecting the documents

produced before him without evaluating the same in a positive manner

As per the evidence of the appellant, he had purchased the caterpillar for a sum of

Rs. 2,800,000/= upon obtaining a leasing facility from a Leasing Company. The

appellant testified that the caterpillar was used for agricultural and constructional

purposes and the 3(a) accused was the driver of the vehicle. On the date of

incident, the appellant had released the vehicle to construct a roadway on hire and

in the afternoon, the appellant got to know that his vehicle had been taken into

custody for clearing and digging soil in a Reserve Forest.

I wish to consider grounds ofappeal I to 3 and 5-7 together. I observe that all these

grounds address the questions as to whether the Learned High Court Judge and the

Learned Magistrate erred in determining the ownership of the said caterpillar and

whether the Learned High Court Judge erred in law by rejecting the documents

'Pl' to 'P28', produced before him.

Page 5 of8

At the vehicle inquiry held in the Magistrat~'s Court, the appellant submitted an

invoice marked as 'Xl ' which included the details of the said caterpillar. It is

observed that the said invoice was dated 08.10.2015 whereas the offence was

committed on 07.10.2015. Therefore the Learned Magistrate was of the view that

the appellant did not prove to the satisfaction of Court that he was the lawful owner

of the caterpillar on the date of the offence. The Learned Magistrate further

observed that even though the appellant testified that he bought the caterpillar on a

leasing facility, any Leasing company did not claim the said vehicle in the inquiry.

"-Therefore the Learned Magistrate proceeded to confiscate the vehicle since the

appellant failed to prove his ownership. As per the order of the Learned High Court

Judge, the appellant submitted documents 'PI ' to 'P28', to the High Court which

were not submitted at the stage of inquiry in the Magistrate's Court. The Learned

High Court Judge refused to consider aforesaid fresh material and made the

following observation;

The Learned SSC for the respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

'respondent') submitted that the Learned High Court Judge in any event could not

have entertained the documents 'PI' to 'P28', since section 6(b) of the High Court

of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 has no applicability to a

revision application of this nature. As per aforesaid section 6, the High Court in

Page 6 of 8

exercise of appellate jurisdiction may furthyr receive and admit new evidence

additional to, or supplementary of, the evidence already taken in the Court of First

Instance. Therefore, it is understood that the High Court may receive new/fresh

evidence only in exercising its appellate jurisdiction but not in revisionary

jurisdiction. Since the purpose of the revisionary powers is to correct any

procedural errors and/or failure of justice occurred in lower Courts, allowing fresh

evidence at the stage of revision application would certainly defeat such purpose.

Therefore, I am of the view that both the Learned High Court Judge and the

..... Learned Magistrate made their orders well within law and therefore the aforesaid

grounds of appeal of the appellant must fail.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the High Court Judge

misapplied the findings of the case of 'Wijeyakoon V. Wijeyakoon (1986) 2 Sri

L.R 325, to the instant case. I observe that the Learned High Court Judge referred

to the case of 'Wijeyakoon' for the purpose of justifying his decision to reject fresh

evidence at the stage of revision application. Since the Learned High Court Judge's

decision to reject fresh evidence is sound in law as I have already mentioned, there

had been no misapplication.

In the case of Mariam Beebee V. Seyed Mohamed [68 NLR 36] it was held that,

"The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite independent

of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this court. Its object is the

due administration of justice and the correction of errors, sometimes

. committed by this court itself, in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice ... "

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and others [2004] 1 Sri L.R 284, it was

held that,

Page 7 of 8

"In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience of court. "

Considering above, I am of the view that there had been no positive miscarriage of

justice, in the instant case, which warrants the invocation of the revisionary powers

..... of this Court. Therefore I affirm the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

25.06.2018 and order of the Learned Magistrate dated 02.1 0.2017.

Accordingly this appeal is hereby dismissed.
