M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

The Petitioner above named is pleading by a Writ of Mandamus for a

Derequisition order derequisitioning the property which was requisitioned

under Section 10 (1) of the Co-Operative Societies (Special Provisions) Act,

No. 35 of 1970 published Government Gazette No. 212/7 of 21st July 1972 for

the temporary use of the 1st Respondent in 1972 (marked as P5).

The Petitioner is the present owner of a land and building depicted as Lot 3 in

Plan marked P4 appended to the Petition and morefully described in the

schedule to the Petition under and by virtue of a Deed of Gift marked P1.

When the father of the Petitioner was the owner, on or about 31st of July 1972,

by Gazette Notification marked P5, the said land and building were

temporarily requisitioned for the 1st Respondent Cooperative Society by then

Minister of Internal Trade in terms of Section 10 (1) of the Co-Operative

Societies (Special Provisions) Act.

The Petitioner, specifically stated in paragraph 6 of the Petition that, the land

and building owned by the Petitioner was temporarily requisitioned as

aforesaid for the 1st Respondent Society for the purpose of operation a bakery

in order to manufacture and distribute bakery products preventing black

marketing of bakery products in the area and on the 30th August 1972 L. R. P.

Banda, the Secretary of the 1st Respondent Society took possession of the

3

said land and building for and on behalf of the 1st Respondent. He further

stated that the land and building were requisitioned temporarily in view of the

urgency of matter till permanent arrangements were made by construction of

a building for the 1st Respondent Society.

The Petitioner further stated that the 1st Respondent Society initially did not

pay even rent (or any form of compensation) for many years and on

representations made to the Member of the Parliament in his area at the time,

and on his request the 1st Respondent paid rent (compensation).

He further stressed that, after demise of his father, the Petitioner, by way of

letters personally and through his Attorney-at-Law, (P8-dated 30th August

1985, P9-dated 18th August 1986) requested the Minister of Food and

Cooperative to derequisition the said land and building, but however, no steps

were taken in that regard,

Pursuant to the documents marked P17A, P17B, P18, and P19, it is clear

that, when the 1st Respondent Society commenced their purported

construction of an additional building on the said land and premises and

making structural changes thereto, the Petitioner intensely objected to the

said constructions. Therefore, the Petitioner by his Attorney-at-Law sent

letters dated 4th April 2013 request the 2nd and 3rd Respondents respectively

to stop the constructions and to derequisition the said building.

It is further revealed from the Petition that, having heard the above demands

of the Petitioner, the Assistant Commissioner of Cooperative Development

(Audit and Investigation), by letter dated 23.06.2013 informed the

Coordinating Secretary of the 2nd Respondent that the Petitioners building

had been legally acquired by the 1st Respondents Society (vide documents

marked P20-P22). Furthermore, by letter dated 24.03.2014, the Assistant

Commissioner of the Cooperative Development (Audit and Investigation) had

requested, the Provincial Commissioner of Cooperative Development

Sabaragamuwa Province, to forward a report to the 2nd Respondent since the

4

1st Respondent Society was within the Provincial jurisdiction and on response

the same by a letter dated 11.06.2014 the Provincial Commissioner of

Cooperative Development, inter alia that the building legally acquired by the

1st Respondent Society (vide P23 & P24).

In this application, it was the contention of the Petitioner that although the

requisitioning was on a temporary basis as provided by the authorities

concerned, acting mala fide and arbitrarily, continuously kept on permitting the

1st Respondent Society be in possession of the Petitioners land and building.

The contention of the Petitioner mainly rest on on Section 10 of the Co-

Operative Societies (Special Provisions) Act.

Thus, Sections 10 (1)-(4) are noteworthy:

(1) The Minister may by Order (in this Act referred to as a

"requisitioning Order") published in the Gazette, requisition, with

effect from such date as shall be specified in the Order, any

immovable property in order that it may be temporarily used by a

principal society for the purposes of any business of such

society.

(2) Before a requisitioning Order takes effect the Minister may from

time to time, after consultation with the Registrar, alter, by Order

published in the Gazette, the date on which such requisitioning

Order takes effect.

(3) A requisitioning Order shall have the effect of authorizing the

Registrar, with effect from the date specified in the Order, to

take possession of the property specified in the Order and to

use such property temporarily for the purposes of any business

of such principal society.

5

(4) Where any property is requisitioned by a requisitioning Order,

the Minister may, by Order (hereinafter in this Act referred to as

''derequisitioning Order") published in the Gazette, derequisition

such property with effect from such date as shall be specified in

the derequisitioning Order

In the light of the above provisions, the Petitioner further submitted that, in

gross defines of the said law, the 1st Respondent Society kept on using the

said land and building in a permanent manner when it had a legal as well as

amoral duty to take preliminary steps to hand over possession of the property

back to its owner by getting it derequisitioned.

The Petitioner further submitted that according to the Statement of Objections

filed by the 2nd Respondent, in paragraph 9 (i), he stated that the said land

and building had been acquired, therefore, the Petitioner strenuously

countered that this is a clear misdirection and misunderstanding of the

provisions in Section 10 of the said Co-Operative Societies (Special

Provisions) Act.

Counsel for the Petition, in the written submission stated that the word may

is used in sub section 10 (4) in referring to the act to be exercised by the

Minister. It is an accepted and well established principle of law that in

appropriate circumstance, the word may should be construed as shall or

must. Further, they are fittingly referred the Indian case of MOHMEDMIYA

MOHAMAD SADIK VS. STATE OF GUJARAT [(1975) 16 Guj LR 583] and

stated that when such a discretionary power is vested in an authority, the

authority would be bound to exercise that power, and the word may

conferring discretionary power has to be read as must, except in those

cases where there are grounds for not exercising such power.

It was the contention of the 2nd & 3rd Respondents that the issues in the

instant application to be weighed in deciding whether to issue an order

derequisitioning the property is that the 1st Respondent still uses premises as

6

a bakery and has established a business and has renovated the premises

after a substantial investment. Although Section 10 (1) of the Act states that

the property will be requisitioned temporarily, Section 10 (4) vests the

discretion on the Minister to issue a derequisitioning order. They further stated

that there is no time frame set out nor conditions to be fulfilled in order issue a

derequisitioning order. Moreover, State Counsel for the Respondents has

invited an important fact that, an offer was made in open court for the

Petitioner to sell the premises at todays market price since he has not utilised

the premises so that financial compensation can be made but the Petitioner

refused to consider this offer and even to obtain a valuation.

However, finally, Counsel for the Respondent, took up the position that, the

derequisitioning is a discretion vested with the Minister and the circumstances

of all parties must be considered, therefore, the Petitioner does not have a

statutory right for derequisitioning thus is not entitled to a Mandamus.

Its clear that, under Section 10 (1) of the Co-Operative Societies (Special

Provisions) Act the Minister has the power to requisition any immovable

property by publishing an order to that effect in the Gazette. The purpose of

such requisition is to allow the property to be temporarily used by a

principal Society for the purposes of any business of such Society

Furthermore, Section 10 (4) of the same Act also empowers the Minister to

derequisition any such property by following the same procedure.

Thus, there could be no question with regard to the Ministers competence to

issue a derequisitioning order. However, this Court needs to be determined

(as submitted by the Respondents) is whether the Ministers power is

amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court Sections 10 (1) and Section 10

(4) say that the Minister may issue a requisitioning and derequisitioning

order. The text of the Act does not contain any express guidelines regulating

the exercise of the discretion. The issuance of the order therefore is a matter

that has been left to the discretion of the Minister. Where power is conferred

by law to exercise it in a given factual situation, it may either be a duty or a

7

privilege [See: Aluwihare PC, J. in SC APPEAL NO. 177/2015, SC Minutes

dated 31.08.2018]. Generally, it is only if there is a duty that the repository can

be compelled to act by a writ of mandamus. If there is only a discretion

(privilege) to act, the writ cannot compel the person to act.

However, I am of the considered view that, it is a fundamental principle in

Administrative Law that no discretion is unfettered and absolute in the

public sphere..

H. W. R. Wade in his work endorses as follows:

Statutory power conferred for public purposes is conferred as it

were upon trust, not absolutely - that is to say, it can validly be

used only in the right and proper way which Parliament when

conferring it is presumed to have intended. Although the

Crown's lawyers have argued in numerous cases that

unrestricted permissive language confers unfettered discretion,

the truth is that, in a system based on the rule of law, unfettered

governmental discretion is a contradiction in terms. The real

question is whether the discretion is wide or narrow, and where

the legal line is to be drawn. For this purpose, everything

depends upon the true intent and meaning of the empowering

Act.

(Administrative Law, 5th Ed., page 353)

Therefore, I further hold that, even if the empowering statute does not

expressly require any jurisdictional fact to be present for the exercise of

power, it will be held invalid if the public authority has acted in total

disregard for the purpose for which such discretion/power was vested in

him.

8

In these circumstances, this Court observes that the requisition had been

made for a temporary use of the 1st Respondent Co-operative Society and

even after 47 years the building still remains as requisitioned property.

Therefore, I proceed to issue a writ of mandamus directing the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents forthwith to derequisition the land together with the buildings

thereon, requisitioned by order 63 published in the Gazette of the Republic of

Sri Lanka dated 21st July 1972 bearing number 212/7 and the 1st Respondent

to hand over free and vacant possession of the land and premises to the

Petitioner.

Application allowed.
