Indula Ratnayake SC for the Plaintiff-Appellant

Geoffrey Alagaratnam P.C with Senuri de Silva for the 1st Defendant-Respondent

21.09.2018

The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff") instituted

this action on 13.08.1990 against the 1st Defendant-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as "the 1st Defendant") and the 2nd Defendant in the District Court jOintly and

severally averring that:-

a. The 1st Defendant was functioning as a broker at the material time.

On or about 10.08.1987, the Plaintiff called for tenders in the form marked PI for the

sale of coconuts. Clause 3.8 in PI provided that "if the brokering firm does not make

payments within the stipulated periods or if the buyer does not remove the nuts within the period

speCified in the contract any loss incurred by the Coconut Research Board (CRE) should be bome

by the brokeringfirm".

b. The 1st Defendant made an offer to the Plaintiff by document P2 (p.37) wherein the

1st Defendant stated that it was in a position to negotiate the sale of coconuts in the

quantities and the prices stated therein. The Plaintiff averred that this offer was

accepted by a letter dated 20.08. 1987 marked P3-(p.38).

c. Prior to the document P3 on 14.08. 1987, the 1st Defendant acting as a broker sold the

coconuts on behalf of the Plaintiff to the 2nd Defendant by contract marked P4.

d. As the 1st Defendant failed to effect payment and collect the coconuts, and 1st

Defendant and 2nd Defendant having thus violated the contract entered into (P4),

the Plaintiff was compelled to sell the coconuts to a y d party at a lesser value-para

8 &: 9 of the plaint p.33.

2

e. As a result of the breach of contract by the Defendants, the Plaintiff suffered losses

in a sum of Rs.l53,7 45/85 and thus a cause of action arose to the Plaintiff to sue them

to recover the said sum.

The 2nd Defendant did not file proxy and thus the case was fixed ex parte against the 2nd

Defendant.

The 1't Defendant filed an amended answer and it set forth its position thus:-

a. The 1't Defendant was only a broker and as such was not liable on the contract

entered into between the Plaintiff (seller) and the 2nd Defendant (buyer).

b. The document PI has no relevance to the transaction in question and in any event

does not bind the 1't Defendant.

c. Document P4 which is admittedly the contractual document and upon which the

Plaintiff's purported cause of action is based expressly excludes the 1't Defendant

liability in the event of any breach by the buyer and the action cannot be maintained

against the 1't Defendant.

d. The Plaint of the Plaintiff was prescribed in law.

The learned Additional Disttict Judge by his judgment dated 16.03.2000 held against the

Plaintiff and dismissed the case against the 1't Defendant on the ground that the cause of

action was based on P4 and that 1't Defendant who acted as broker at the matetial time

was not a party to P4 and not liable upon breach of P4 by the 2nd Defendant. However, the

learned Additional Disttict Judge further held that the 2nd Defendant was liable for the

breach of P4. Accordingly he ordered that the amount prayed for by the Plaintiff and legal

fees be paid by the 2nd Defendant.

Aggrieved by the judgment of the Additional District Judge of Colombo the Plaintiff has

preferred this appeal to set aside the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge

that was entered in favor of the 1't Defendant.

In order to ascertain the correctness of the decision of the District Court it becomes

necessary to draw attention to the evidence led in this case.

The Evidence before the District Court

One M.R.P.S. Liyanagama, an Assistant General Manager of the Plaintiff Board and

DJ.S.N. Nalliah of M!s Daniel and Company testified on behalf of the Plaintiff and marked

in evidence documents P-I-PI4.

The 1st Defendant did not adduce any evidence. However the 1st Defendant cross examined

the Plaintiff's witnesses.

Plaintiff's cause of Action is based on the contract P4

Upon a perusal of the plaint it is quite clear that the Plaintiff's cause of action was

premised upon the document P4.

The Plaintiff states in paragraph 6 of its plaint that the 1st Defendant, a brokering firm on

behalf of the Plaintiff sold the 4th quarter produce of the Rathmalagara Estate consisting

of 173,200 coconuts to the 2nd Defendant by contract bearing No.107!737 and date d

14.08.1987, which was marked P4.

Paragraph 9 of the Plaint further states that in terms of contract P4 the Plaintiff ought to

have received Rs.433,814.04 and that as a result of the breach of P4 and the resale od

coconuts, the Plaintiff received a sum of Rs.153,462.67 less than what it should have

received.

Paragraph 10 reiterates this by stating "in consequence of the Defendants' breach of the

contract P4, the Plaintiff suffered damages in a sum of Rs. 153745.67".

Paragraph 12 addressing the cause of action states:-

"as a result, the Plaintiff states that a cause of action has arisen to the Plaintiff to recover the said

sum together with costs jointly alld scverally from tile Defendants."

Upon a perusal of the plaint it becomes very clear that the cause of action to recover

moneys claimed is based on the alleged breach of contract P4 by the 1st Defendant.

4

This position is further strengthened by the evidence of. P.S. liyanagama who admits at

page 10 of the proceedings of 15.10.1998 that the contract upon which the cause of action

was based on the contract P4-(p.76).

Furthermore in re-examination (p.12) of the same proceedings (p.78 of the brief) the

witness again admits to a question from his OW'll counsel at follows:-

Q: My learned friend suggested to you in cross examination that the Plaintiff seeks

relief in terms of contract P4 (shoW'll P4) has the Plaintiff sought relief in terms of

P4?

A: Yes

Thereafter one could see the Counsel for the Plaintiff posing a leading question to the

witness as if in a bid to show that the Plaintiff was relying on both PI and P4.

Paragraph 5 of the Petition of Appeal mirrors this attempt:

"the Plaintiff marked Pl, P2, P3, P4 which were documents showing contractual nature of the claim

of the Plaintiff and P5-P14 which were the other pertinCllt documents."

The learned President's Counsel for the 1st Defendant-Respondent contended that this is

a new position which was not taken up in the plaint nor was evidence led to such effect

and therefore the attempt to expand the basis of the cause of action in Appeal cannot be

countenanced.

Plaintiff cannot approbate and reprobate

The Plaintiff relies on contract P4 for the relief it seeks. The corollary would then follow.

The Plaintiff must either accept the entire contract P4 or reject it in its entirety. The law

does not permit a person to take benefit of a document and at the same time repudiate the

the document or any part of it as may be beneficial for his case. This is encapsulated in the

popular expression-one cannot blow hot and cold.

In the case of Ceylon Plywoods Corporation v. Samastha Lanka G.NS.M &: Rajya

Sanstha Sevaka Sangamaya (1992) 1 Sri LR 157 Sarath SIva,]. at p.163 states as follows:-

5

"The workmen by making their application to the Labour Tribunal were attempting to circumvent

the terms and conditions of the circular after having received the benefits due upon it. A legal

procedure in the nature of an application to the Labour Tribunal in terms of Section 3lB (1) cannot

be resorted to for such a purpose. The doctrine of approbate and reprobate (quad approbo and

non reprobo) is based on the principle that no person can accept and reject the same instrument."

This equitable principle has been reiterated in a number of English cases including

Barclays Bank Trust Co. Ltd v. Bluff 1981 3 All ER 232 and in Bardam v. Evans 19361KB

202 at p.2ll. In his dissenting judgment Greer LJ in Bardam states as follows:-

"It was put by one of my brethren on the ground that a man is not entitled to reprobate that which

he has already approbated. In my view, that principle has no application to this case, because it is

based on this, that a man may not at one moment take an advantage of someagreementor some fact

and at a later moment when it suits him reprobate that which he has approved."

On this reasoning if the Plaintiff rejects P4 as their contractual basis, there is no cause of

action and their action should be dismissed. On the other hand if the Plaintiff accepts P4

as they have done in the pleadings and evidence, then they cannot reject any part of the

contract and are bound to accept the whole contract.

A perusal of the contractual document brings out an important aspect.

Exemption of liability of the 1't Defendant by P4

The contract P4 specifically exempts liability of the 1't Defendant under the contract in

the event of breach of same by the buyer. Under the margin note 'Delivery' the contract

specifically states, 'The seller holds the rights to re-sell the nuts if not removed within the stipulated

period and any differe11ces in the price wi II have to be bome by the buyer."

Thus the contract P4 specifically exempts the 1't Defendant from liability in the event of a

breach by the buyer and it is the buyer alone who undertakes to bear the loss arising from

differences in price if the seller is required to re-sell the goods in the event of a default on

the part of the buyer.

6

The Plaintiff attempts to rely on PI in holding the Defendants liable for the loss arising

from the re-sale of the goods to the third party. This is on the basis that PI dated 01.06.1984

related to the conditions upon which the tender procedure was effected. Clause 3.8 in PI

provided that, "if the brokeringfirm does not make payments within the stipulated periods or if the buyer

does not remove the nuts within the period specified in the contract any loss incurred by the coconut

research Board (eRE) should be borne by the brokeringfirm"-p.35.

P4 the contractual document has not in any way referred to PI or subjected it to the terms

and conditions set out in PI in terms of liability in the event of default. In light of this

ambiguity, P4 the contractual document upon which the cause of action is based stands

alone and should be given effect to.

By P4, the agent has dropped out of the transaction and no liability can be imposed upon

the 1st Defendant for breach of contract on the part of the 2nd Defendant.

The Plaintiff cannot now shift the cause of action away from P4

The Civil Procedure Code and the precedents have unequivocally established that once a

Plaintiff pleads in its plaint a particular set of facts as its cause of action, it cannot in the

course of the trial attempt to alter or vary the cause of action.

The second explanation to Section 150 of the Civil Procedure Code states as follows:-

"The case enunciated mllst reasonably accord with rhe party's pleading i.e. plaint or answer, as the

case may be. And no party can be allowed to make at the trial a case materially different from that

which he has placed on record, and which his opponent is pre/Jared to meet .... "

This principle has been endorsed in Thalwatte v. Somasunderam 1996 BAL] vol.Vl Part

II and 14 and Uvais v. Punyawathie (1993) 2 Sri L R 46 at page 52.

The Plaintiff before District Court sought to raise as Issue No.1 the question of whether

the 1st Defendant made an offer by P2 and whether it was accepted by the Plaintiff by letter

P3. Furthermore in evidence Plaintiff sought to establish that the terms of the tender PI

is the basis upon which the 1st Defendant made the offer P2 and thereby attempted to make

PI part of the contract. As the learned President's Counsel for the pc Defendant-

7

Respondent submitted, this approach would be tantamount to an attempt to avoid the

admitted contractual obligations set forth in P4 and exclusion clause contained therein

and instead rely on a purported contract arising by P2 and P3.

I hold that having made out that P4 is the contractual document, it does not lie in the

mouth of the Plaintiff to peg its cause of action on P2 and P3.

P2 and P3 read together cannot constitute a contract by and between the Plaintiff

and the 1st Defendant

The learned State Counsel argued that the scheme of tender PI is the document upon

which the parties intended to contract for same to be binding on the 1st Defendant. I must

state that PI is not Signed nor is it accepted by the 1st Defendant in any manner as

containing any contractual terms upon which the 1st Defendant is bound. Secondly

neither is PI incorporated in the contract P4 upon which the cause of action is based.

In the circumstances, If PI is a component part of the contract, it would be incorporated

as an implied term of contract. The onus lies on the Plaintiff to have displayed the precise

manner in which the pt Defendant agreed to the terms contained in PI. However, the

Plaintiff during the trial before the District Court has failed to prove how PI was

incorporated as part of the contract nor how it was brought to the attention of the pt

Defendant. It has to be noted that PI is dated 01.06.1984 and the contract which is in

dispute was entered into August 1987 after a lapse of more than three years since Pl.

On an application of the contractual principles it is clear that a contract cannot be entered

into by way of an exchange of P2 and P3.

According to the Plaintiff, the pt Defendant responded to a notice which called for tenders

and was published by the Plaintiff. Issue No.1(a) raised by the Plaintiff goes as follws:

"Did the Plaintiff call for tenders for sale of the 4th quarter coconut yield ofRathmalgama Estate by notice

of tender dated lO.08.l987?"

Firstly, this issue describes a notice of tender which is not PI. Secondly in order to even

remotely infer that PI was part and parcel of the particular Notice of Tender, reference

8

should be made to PI in the Notice of Tender. However the Plaintiff has not proved that

PI was part and parcel of the notice of tender. The Plaintiff has merely sought to allege

that the tender was in accordance with the scheme PI dated three years previously.

The failure to produce and mark the Notice of Tender must lead the Court to draw an

adverse inference against the Plaintiff in answering the question as to whether the tender

notice was based on PI. The illustration (f) to Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance states

as follows:-

"evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced, be unfavourable to the persoll who

withholds it."

The Plaintiff had alleged that the document 'P2' is an "offer" made by the 1st Defendant.

However 'P2' does not refer to the document PI in any manner whatsoever or to any other

specific notice of tender and even if P2 can be construed to be an offer, it does not bind the

1st Defendant to the terms of PI. If this position is correct as per Contract Law the notice

of tender would constitute an "Invitation to Treat" as it were a public notice calling for

further negotiations. Anson's Law of Contract 29th Ed. P 33 describes an Invitation to treat

as one that contemplates further negotiations to take place and furthermore if it is a

statement or act of this nature, it is not intended to be binding. Therefore in any event the

1st Defendant cannot be bound by the notice of tender as it is not an offer which is definitive

of the binding contractual terms. In Rule 7 of the Restatement of the English Law of Contract

by Andrew Burrows, it is stated that the following are usually invitations to trear and not

offers-

(a) The display of goods for sale

(b) An advertisement of goods for sale'

(c) An invitation to tender

In another codification of contract law-Contract Rules-Decoding English Law Neil Andrews in

Article ]0 states that an invitor requesting tenders does not normally commit himself to

award a tender to any of the invitees-see ] Cartright, Formation and Variation of Contracts

(London, 2014), 2-24.

9

Anson's law of Contract 29th Ed. P 33 defines ~Offer" as foUows ~An Offer is an intimation

by words or conduct of a willingness to enter into a legally binding contract, and which in

its terms expressly or impliedly indicates that it is to become binding on the offeror as

soon as it has been accepted by an act, forbearance, or return promise on the part of the

person to whom it is addressed to."

Therefore P2 would not constitute an offer as is understood in the law of Contract. The

law distinguishes between an offer that is capable of being accepted and a mere statement

by way of quoting a price. In the case of Harvey v. Facey (1893) AC 552 court held that

even where the Plaintiff had written "will you sell us Bumper Hall Pen Telegraph lowest

price," and the Defendant replied lowest price for Bumper Hall Pen 900 pounds, this

statement by the Defendant was held to be only an indication of price and not an offer that

can be accepted.

Similarly, in Clifton v. Palumbo 1944 2 AER 497 the court held that the Defendant's

statement "I am prepared to offer you my lythem Estate for 600,000 Pounds was held not

to constitute an offer".

Relying on the above authorities it was argued that the 1st Defendant's letter of 14.08.1987

(P2) which states simply that "and we are pleased to advise you that we are in a position

to negotiate sales as follows ... " is not an offer but only an indication of the possible

negotiable price for the coconuts and in fact it is not even a confirmed price.

This argument is irresistible and supportable in contract law and by that analogy if P2 is

not an offer, then the Plaintiff's letter P3 cannot constitute an acceptance of P2.

Furthermore, in any event P3 makes no reference to PI but only to a letter dated 17.06.1984.

There was no evidence led as to the nature of the contents of this letter dated 17.06.1984

which has neither been produced nor marked in evidence.

Further P3 cannot be foisted as part of the contract where P4 is clear.

Even if it is submitted that P2 constitutes an offer, it is observed P2 is dated 14.08.1987. P2

is admitted to be a contractual document by the Plaintiff where the broker has bound the

10

2nd Defendant (buyer) and the Plaintiff in contract. For a contract to exist it is axiomatic

that both an offer and acceptance are essential ingredients.

It is contradictory for the Plaintiff to rely on P3 which was issued on 20.08.1987. After P4

the contract was concluded to Signify acceptance. It is even more contradictory as P3

states that, "kindly submit contract documents within a week along with a remittance of

10% of the contract value".

Therefore no contract has been formed by and between the parties by an exchange of P2

and P3. On the evidence it is more reasonable to conclude that P4 is the contract upon

which the Plaintiff relies upon as P3 cannot add fresh terms to a concluded contract as

admitted by the witness of the Plaintiff in page 12 of the proceedings dated 14.08.1987.

Thus as per the terms of P4 the 1st Defendant is excluded from any liability.

In a nutshell the follOwing salient elements emerge.

a. The 1st Defendant being a broker and not having expressly and or impliedly

undertaken to be bound by the terms of document PI, is not liable in law for the

default of the buyer introduced by him.

b. The Plaintiff's case is based on P4, as borne out by the Plaint itself and the

evidence and documents. The Contract P4 expressly exempts liability of the 1st

Defendant and holds the 2nd Defendant (buyer) responsible for the Plaintiff as

his principal for defaults of the 2nd Defendant.

c. The Plaintiff cannot approbate and reprobate the contract P4 and must therefore

accept the clause excluding liability of the 1st Defendant.

d. No proof had been adduced as to how document PIon which the Plaintiff seeks

to rely can be associated with the contract P4 as it is not referred to in P2 or P3

and as P4 contradicts PI.

e. The Plaintiff cannot in any event now seek to base his cause of action on an

agreement other than P4.

11

In the circumstances I hold that the Plaintiff did not make out a case of breach of contract

against the 1st Defendant and the learned Additional District Judge of Colombo carne to

the right decision by dismissing the action of the Plaintiff against the 1st Defendant in his

judgment dated 16.03.2000.

I therefore affirm the judgment and dismiss the appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellant.
