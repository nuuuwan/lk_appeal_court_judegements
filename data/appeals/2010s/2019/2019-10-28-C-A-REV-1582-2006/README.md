Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is a partition case. The 19A and 22nd defendantone and

the same, namely, K.B. Somawathi (hereinafter the

petitioner)filed this revision application seeking to set aside

the order of the learned District Judge of Avissawella dated

02.03.2006 whereby the application of the petitioner made

under section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code to rectify the

Judgment delivered by the District Court on 29.02.2000 was

refused.

The background to this application is briefly as follows: The

plaintiff filed this action in the District Court by plaint dated

31.03.1983 to partition the land described in the schedule to the

plaint among the plaintiff and the 1st-17th defendants. The

petitioner did not file a statement of claim. At the trial, the

petitioner was represented by an Attorney-at-Law and the case

was settled. The 4th and 6th defendants gave evidence and the

learned District Judge delivered the Judgment in open Court.

This happened on 29.02.2000.1 Thereafter, Interlocutory Decree

has been entered in terms of the Judgment and the commission

has been issued to prepare the final plan. As seen from the

Journal Entry No. 103, the proposed final partition plan has

been sent to Court in September 2005.

1 Vide proceedings dated 29.02.2000.

It is significant to note that, between the date of the Judgment

and the date of the proposed final partition plan, there was more

than 5 years and 6 months, and the case was called in open

Court a number of times, but the petitioner did not state that

there is a clerical or arithmetical mistake in the Judgment.

After the receipt of the proposed final plan and when the Court

gave a date (in terms of section 35 of the Partition Law) for

consideration of the proposed scheme of partition, the petitioner

revoked the earlier proxy and filed a new proxy and made the

application under section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code to

correct the Judgment stating that it is not in consonance with

the evidence led at the trial.2

In the Judgment the plaintiff has been allotted an undivided

share of the land and the 5th-22nd and 31st defendants each

undivided 1/8th share. The Judgment also describes how the

improvements shall go to the parties.

By this application, the petitioner states that, according to the

pedigree of the plaintiff, the plaintiff is only entitled to an

undivided 3/20 share and the other defendants mentioned

above are entitled to each 17/20 share and the plantation shall

also be given accordingly.

I have no doubt that this application does not come under

section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code read with section 25 and

79 of the Partition Law.

2 Vide JE No.104 and the application of the Petitioner dated 07.10.2005.

Section 189 allows the Court to correct any clerical and

arithmetical mistake in any Judgment or order arising from any

accidental slip or omission. In the facts and circumstances of

this case, there is no such mistake that has occurred due to

accidental slip or omission. The case was reportedly settled and

evidence was led and the Judgment was delivered instantly

wherein soil rights of the parties and entitlement to

improvements including the plantation were decided in open

Court. This happened in front of the petitioners former

Attorney-at-Law.

If the petitioner was not agreeable to the fractional shares

decided upon by Court, it would have been pointed out to the

learned Judge, then and there, as it was a Judgment delivered

upon a settlement. Otherwise, when he obtained a copy of the

proceedings, if she later realized that there was an arithmetical

mistake in the calculation of shares, and also in the

apportionment of the plantation, she should have, through her

former Attorney-at-Law informed the Court to correct that

mistake. She does not need to retain a new Attorney-at-Law to

tell it to Court after more than 5 years from the date of the

Judgment.

On the other hand, if it was a mistake, it is difficult to

understand why none of the other defendants or their Attorneys-

at-Law did not realize it until the petitioner realized it more than

5 years from the date of the Judgment. It is unbelievable that

none of the 31 defendants did not get proceedings of that day for

more than 5 years from the date of the Judgment.

Although the petitioner has referred to section 25 of the Partition

Law, which requires the District Judge to investigate title to the

land to be partitioned; when the case is settled, that requirement

is no more applicable. Settlements in partition cases are not

prohibited or obnoxious to the Partition Law provided (a) all the

persons who have right, share or interest to, of, or in the land to

be partitioned have been made parties to the case; and (b) all of

them participate in the settlement.3 When the case is so settled,

the case is decided not on the pedigrees set out in the pleadings

or investigation of title, but on the agreement reached among the

parties, which may or may not be completely contradictory to

the pedigrees set out in their pleadings.4

The learned counsel for the petitioner contends that settlements

in partition cases are possible only if the Court has investigated

the title of each party. The requirement of investigation of title

to the land of each party and entering the Judgment on

settlement reached among the parties are, in my view,

irreconcilable. The end result as to fractional shares (a) upon an

investigation of title and (b) upon compromise reached among

the parties, is practically, almost always, different. If it is the

same, there is no necessity to have a compromise as the

Judgment can then straightaway be entered on investigation of

title.

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the application of the

petitioner, but without costs.
