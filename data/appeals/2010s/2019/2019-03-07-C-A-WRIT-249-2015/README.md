Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: J.C. Weliamuna, P.C., for the Petitioner.

Sumathi Dharmawardena, D.S.G., for the

Respondents.

Decided on: 06.03.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash by way of

writ of certiorari the decision of the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal marked P11 dated 12.03.2015 whereby the Tribunal

refused to ante-date the petitioners appointment to the post of

Director (Extension and Training) of the Department of

Agriculture with effect from 24.10.2008; and to compel the

respondents by way of writ of mandamus to do it.

There is no dispute that the petitioner had been a public officer

since 1977 attached to the Department of Agriculture holding

various positions. When he was a Deputy Director, he was

appointed as the Acting Director (Extension and Training)

effective from 24.10.2008 for three months. Then he was

appointed as the Additional Director (Extension and Training)

from 03.11.2008, and confirmed in the post of Director

(Extension and Training) on 09.06.2010 with effect from

24.11.2009. His plea is to ante-date his appointment in the post

of Director (Extension and Training) effective from 24.10.2008,

i.e, from the date he was appointed as the Acting Director of the

said post.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner and the learned

Deputy Solicitor General for the respondents agreed to dispose

of argument by way of written submissions. Written

submissions of both parties were filed together with no right of

reply. Hence heavy responsibility on the Court.

The pivotal argument of the learned Deputy Solicitor General for

the respondents taken up in the written submission is that in

view of section 8(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act,

No. 4 of 2002, the order delivered by the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal is final and conclusive thus cannot be questioned in a

Court of Law. I am unable to agree with this submission.

Administrative Appeals Tribunal was created by Article 59 of the

Constitution:

59(1) There shall be an Administrative Appeals Tribunal

appointed by the Judicial Service Commission.

(2) The Administrative Appeals Tribunal shall have the

power to alter, vary or rescind any order or decision made

by the Commission.

(3) The constitution, powers and procedure of such Tribunal,

including the time limits for preferring of appeals, shall be

provided for by law.

Section 8(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act reads as

follows:

A decision made by the Tribunal shall be final and

conclusive and shall not be called in question in any suit or

proceedings in a court of law.

This is a statutory ouster clause, and not a constitutional ouster

clause. Ouster clauses contained in statutes, as a general rule,

do not oust the writ jurisdiction conferred on Courtsin Sri

Lanka, on the Court of Appeal by Article 140 of the Constitution.

There is a presumption in favour of judicial review and Courts

have throughout the history shown their great reluctance to

accept ouster clauses at face value. The tendency of Courts has

been to give ouster clauses a restrictive interpretation as much

as possible so as to preserve their jurisdiction to review

administrative decisions. The leading English case of Anisminic

Ltd v. Foreign Compensation Commission (1969) AC 147 provides

a striking illustration of this tendency. It is generally

understood that the ouster/preclusive/finality clauses are there

to prevent appeals and not to prevent judicial review. Those

clauses do not and cannot prohibit the Court of Appeal from

exercising its writ jurisdiction to look into the jurisdictional

issues of the decisions of the administrative bodies or tribunals.

In St. Joseph Stock Yards Co. v. United States (1936) 298 US 38,

Brandeis J. stated that:

The supremacy of law demands that there shall be

opportunity to have some court decide whether an

erroneous rule of law was applied and whether the

proceeding in which facts were adjudicated was conducted

regularly.1

Professor Wade in his monumental workAdministrative Law,

9th Edition, at page 713 states:

Many statutes provide that some decision shall be final.

That provision is a bar to any appeal. But the courts refuse

to allow it to hamper the operation of judicial review. As

will be seen in this and the following sections, there is a

firm judicial policy against allowing the rule of law to be

undermined by weakening the powers of the court.

Statutory restrictions on judicial remedies are given the

narrowest possible construction, sometimes even against

the plain meaning of the words. This is a sound policy,

since otherwise administrative authorities and tribunals

would be given uncontrollable power and could violate the

law at will. Finality is a good thing but justice is a better.

If a statute says that the decision or order of some

administrative body or tribunal shall be final or shall be

final and conclusive to all intents and purposes this is held

to mean merely that there is no appeal: judicial review of

legality is unimpaired. Parliament only gives the impress

of finality to the decisions of the tribunal on condition that

they are reached in accordance with the law. This has

been the consistent doctrine for three hundred years. It

safeguards the whole area of judicial review, including

(formerly) error on the face of the record as well as ultra

vires.

Under the sub-heading Shall not be questioned clauses,

Professor Wade at page 717-718 inter alia states:

Wide enactments designed to oust the jurisdiction of the

courts entirely in respect of all remedies have come to be

6

known as ouster clauses. However they are worded, they

are interpreted according to the same principle.

The law as now settled by the House of Lords is that these

ouster clauses are subject to exactly the same doctrine as

the older no certiorari clauses, namely, that they do not

prevent the court from intervening in the case of excess of

jurisdiction. Violation of the principles of natural justice, for

example, amounts to excess of jurisdiction, so that where a

minister refused an application for citizenship without

giving the applicant a fair hearing the Privy Council

invalidated his decision notwithstanding a statute

providing that it shall not be subject to appeal or review in

any court. AG v. Ryan [1980] AC 718

Section 3(4) of the Land Redemption Ordinance, No. 61 of 1942

provided that The question whether any land which the Land

Commissioner is authorised to acquire under subsection (1)

should or should not be acquired shall, subject to any regulations

made in that behalf, be determined by the Land Commissioner in

the exercise of his individual judgment; and every such

determination of the Land Commissioner shall be final.

In considering of this section, in the case of Ladamuttu Pillai v.

The Attorney General (1957) 59 NLR 313 the Supreme Court

stated that when a statute provides that a decision made by a

statutory functionary shall be final or final and conclusive, the

words final and final and conclusive do not have the effect of

ousting the jurisdiction of the Courts to declare in appropriate

7

proceedings that the decision of the public functionary, when he

has acted contrary to the statute, is illegal.

Basnayake C.J. at page 329 stressed the point with vigor and

force in the following terms:

When an Ordinance or an Act provides that a decision

made by a statutory functionary to whom the task of

making a decision under the enactment is entrusted shall

be final, the Legislature assumes that the functionary will

arrive at his decision in accordance with law and the rules

of natural justice and after all the prescribed conditions

precedent to the making of his decision have been fulfilled,

and that where his jurisdiction depends on a true

construction of an enactment he will construe it correctly.

The Legislature also assumes that the functionary will keep

to the limits of the authority committed to him and will not

act in bad faith or from corrupt motives or exercise his

powers for purposes other than those specified in the

statute or be influenced by grounds alien or irrelevant to the

powers taken by the statute or act unreasonably. To say

that the word final has the effect of giving statutory

sanction to a decision however wrong, however contrary to

the statute, however unreasonable or influenced by bad

faith or corrupt motives, is to give the word a meaning

which it is incapable of bearing and which the Legislature

could never have contemplated. The Legislature entrusts to

responsible officers the task of carrying out important

functions which affect the subject in the faith that the

officers to whom such functions are entrusted will

8

scrupulously observe all the requirements of the statute

which authorize them to act. It is inconceivable that by

using such a word as final the Legislature in effect said,

whatever determination the Land Commissioner may make,

be it within the statute or be it not, be it in accordance with

it or be it not, it is final, in the sense that the legality of it

cannot be agitated in the Courts. No case in which such a

meaning has been given to the word final was cited to us.

The word final is not a cure for all the sins of commission

and omission of a statutory functionary and does not

render legal all his illegal acts and place them beyond

challenge in the Courts. The word final and the words

final and conclusive are familiar in enactments which

seek to limit the right of appeal; but no decision of either

this Court or any other Court has been cited to us in which

those expressions have been construed as ousting the

jurisdiction of the Courts to declare in appropriate

proceedings that the action of a public functionary who has

acted contrary to the statute is illegal.

Section 18(1) of the Medical Ordinance, No. 26 of 1927, as

amended, reads as follows:

Every order or decision of the Medical Council under this

Ordinance shall be subject to appeal to the Minister whose

decision shall be final.

In construing this provision, in Wijerama v. Paul (1973) 76 NLR

241 it was held that:

9

Notwithstanding that the decision of an inferior tribunal is

by a statute made final in the manner of section 18 of the

Medical Council Ordinance, certiorari can still issue for

excess of jurisdiction or for error of law on the face of the

record or on the ground of bias or violation of the principles

of natural justice. In the present case, there was error of

law on the face of the record. Although the Medical Council

did not give reasons for its decision, it maintained a

complete record of its proceedings and incorporated all the

relevant evidence. There was no evidence in support of the

charge that the letter written by the respondent to the editor

of the newspaper amounted to an advertisement by the

respondent of his professional skill. In the circumstances,

the decision of the Medical Council should be quashed.

Regulation 55 of the Emergency (Miscellaneous Provisions and

Powers) Regulations, No. 6 of 1971, published in Government

Gazette of August 15, 1971 provided that Section 45 of the

Courts Ordinance (which conferred jurisdiction on the Supreme

Court to issue writs of habeas corpus) shall not apply in regard to

any person detained or held in custody under any emergency

regulation.

In Hidaramani v. Ratnavale (1971) 75 NLR 67 the majority of the

Supreme Court held that regulation 55 is intended to remove the

courts jurisdiction to issue a writ of habeas corpus only in

respect of a lawful detention under any emergency regulation

and not otherwise. In other words, regulation 55 will not apply

to the case of a person unlawfully detained under an invalid

10

detention order made in abuse of the powers conferred by

regulation 18(1).

In Abeywickrema v. Pathirana [1986] 1 Sri LR 120 at 156,

Sharvananda C.J. opined that Ouster clauses do not prevent the

court from intervening in the case of excess of jurisdiction.

The parameters of the phrase excess of jurisdiction is so wide.

That should not be confined to the narrow question whether the

administrative body or tribunal had jurisdiction to inquire into

the matter. There may be a number of instances where despite

the administrative body having jurisdiction to embark upon the

inquiry, in the course of the inquiry, it does or omits to do

something of such a nature as to make the decision a nullity.

That may include the administrative body making a decision

which it has no power to make. It may have given the decision

in bad faith. It may have in good faith misdirected itself in

construing vital documents. It may have taken irrelevant

matters into consideration and ruled out relevant matters in the

process. It may have failed in the course of the inquiry to

comply with the rules of natural justice such as violation of audi

alteram partem rule. This list is not exhaustive. These are all, in

broader sense, jurisdictional issues.

In Gunasekera v. De Mel, Commissioner of Labour (1978) 79(2)

NLR 409 at 426 the Supreme Court held that:

Lack of jurisdiction may arise in different ways. While

engaged on a proper inquiry the tribunal may depart from

the rules of natural justice or it may ask itself the wrong

questions or may take into account matters which it was

11

not directed to take into account. Thereby it would step

outside its jurisdiction.

I hold that section 8(2) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunals

Act does not operate as a blanket prohibition on the Court of

Appeal to exercise writ jurisdiction over the decisions of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

The second argument of the learned Deputy Solicitor General is

that the petitioner after three months of acting in the post of

Director (Extension and Training), was appointed to cover up

duties in the said post from 24.01.2009 to 13.11.2009, and

cover up duties is only a departmental arrangement not

falling within the definition of appointment in terms of section

1.1 of Chapter I of the Establishments Code, and therefore ante-

dating the appointment is contrary to the provisions of the

Establishments Code.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General has quoted 13:7 in Chapter II

of the Establishments Code to show the difference.

13:7 No additional remuneration is payable unless an

officer has been appointed by the Appointing Authority to

act in a post or to attend to the duties of a post. Any

Departmental arrangement to cover up the duties of a

vacant post will not entitle the officer covering up duties, to

additional remuneration.

The fact that the petitioner was appointed to cover up duties in

the said post from 24.01.2009 to 13.11.2009 is factually

incorrect. Such a position has not even been taken up by the

12

Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the impugned order. The

mistake has been done by the petitioner himself in paragraph 7

of the petition. In fact, during that period the petitioner was not

covering up duties but attending to the duties of the post of

Director (Extension and Training).

This has correctly been stated by the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal in its order in the following manner:

By letter dated 12.08.2011 the Additional Secretary

(Administration) on behalf of the Secretary to the Ministry of

Agriculture sought the approval of the PSC to appoint the

Appellant to act in the post of Director (Extension and

Training) from 24.10.2008 to 23.01.2009 and subsequently

to be appointed to attend to the duties in the post, in

addition to his permanent post of Additional Director

(Extension and Training). (Annexure IV) Hence by letter

dated 15.09.2011 the PSC granted approval to appoint the

Appellant to (act in) the post of Director (Extension and

Training) from 24.10.2008 to 23.01.2009 (a period of

approximately 3 months) and subsequently from

24.01.2009 to 26.04.2011 (a period of approximately 2

years and 3 months) to attend to duties in the post.

(Annexure V)

This is supported by paragraph 6 of R1 and paragraph 2(I) of R2,

which are documents filed by the respondents themselves with

their objections.

If an officer is appointed to attend to the duties of a post, in

terms of section 12:3 of Chapter VII of the Establishments Code,

13

such an officer should be paid two thirds of the additional

remuneration he will receive had he been appointed to act in that

post.

The second argument of the learned Deputy Solicitor General

fails.

The third and final argument of the learned Deputy Solicitor

General is that according to section 1:10 of Chapter II of the

Establishments Code The Appointing Authority should not ante-

date an appointment on any grounds without the authority of the

Director of Establishments, and the petitioners appointment as

the Director (Extension and Training) cannot be ante-dated to 24th

October 2008 since the petitioner has not received the authority of

the Director of Establishments to backdate his appointment as

Director (Extension and Training).

It is on this reason alone the Administrative Appeals Tribunal

dismissed the appeal of the petitioner.

As the Appellant has not received the authority of the

Director of establishments to backdate his appointment as

Director (Extension and Training) we are of the view that

the appeal of the Appellant to ante-date his appointment as

Director (Extension and Training) to 24.10.2008 cannot be

permitted and thus the appeal of the Appellant is hereby

dismissed.

This argument of the learned Deputy Solicitor General/the

above finding of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is factually

incorrect.

14

The complete section 1:10 of Chapter II of the Establishments

Code reads as follows:

1:10 The Appointing Authority should not ante-date an

appointment on any grounds without the authority of the

Director of Establishments.

1:10:1 Application to do so should be made by the

Appointing Authority through the Secretary to the Ministry

to the Director of Establishments, with reasons. The

following conditions too require to be satisfied.

1:10:2 There has been a substantive vacancy in the post

from the date to which the appointment is proposed to be

ante-dated.

e.g. The post of an officer on leave prior to retirement does

not become vacant until his retirement actually takes effect.

1:10:3 On the date to which it is proposed to ante-date the

appointment, the officer was fully qualified for appointment

to the post in terms of the Scheme of Recruitment applicable

on such date.

1:10:4 The officer was performing all the duties of the post

continuously from such earlier date on an acting

appointment made by the Appointing Authority by a letter of

appointment duly issued to such effect.

1:10:5 The selection for the substantive appointment was

made in terms of the Method of Recruitment laid down in

the Scheme of Recruitment.

It is clear from section 1:10:1 above that it is the duty of the

Appointing Authority (and not the officer) through the Secretary

15

to the Ministry to write to the Director of Establishments seeking

authority to ante-date an appointment. But both the learned

Deputy Solicitor General and the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal appear to have gone on the basis that it is the duty of

the petitioner officer to get the approval from the Director of

Establishments, which is incorrect.

By R7which is a document tendered by the respondentsit is

clear that the Secretary to the Ministry has written to the

Appointing Authoritythe Public Service Commission seeking

approval to ante-date the appointment stating in particular that

the petitioner officer has satisfied all the conditions enumerated

in section 1:10 of Chapter II of the Establishments Code.

Then the next question is whether the Appointing Authority has

obtained the authority from the Director of Establishments.

Before the Public Service Commission was constituted, the

Cabinet of Ministers was the Appointing Authority. As seen

from R6a document tendered by the respondents

themselvesat that time when the application for ante-dating

was made to the Cabinet of Ministers by the Minister of

Agriculture, the following recommendation has been made:

The above Memorandum (dated 07.09.2010 by the Minister

of Agriculture on Backdating of the date of appointment to

the post of Director Extension and Training Department of

Agriculture) was considered along with the observations of

the Minister of Finance and Planning and the report dated

27.06.2012 by the Director General of Establishments

addressed to the Secretary to the Cabinet. After

16

discussion, it was decided to recommend to the Cabinet to

instruct the Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture to take up this

matter with the Public Service Commission, since the matter

comes under the purview of the PSC.

From the above it is clear that: (a) the Cabinet of Ministers

referred the matter to the Public Service Commission not on any

other reason but because at that time the Public Service

Commission has been constituted; (b) the Director of

Establishments has sent the report dated 27.06.2012 to the

then Appointing Authoritythe Cabinet of Ministers.

What is the recommendation of the Director of establishments

on that matter? The recommendation of the Director of

Establishments/Minister of Public Administration, according to

circle page 75 of P10, tendered by the petitioner with the

petition, in summary, is that he has no objections for ante-

dating the appointment provided the officer has satisfied the

conditions of the Establishments Code. (

.

.) According to paragraph 11 of the petition, this

document was a part of the record before the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal, which has not been disputed by the learned

Deputy Solicitor General.

Then it is clear that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has

misdirected itself on primary facts when it dismissed the

petitioners appeal on the basis that the Appellant has not

17

received the authority of the Director of establishments to

backdate his appointment as Director (Extension and Training).

Furthermore, the petitioner has tendered documents marked

P12(a)-P12(h) with his counter affidavit to prove, Dr. A.A.L.

Amarasinghe, another officer similarly circumstanced as the

petitioner, whose appointment as the Director (Field Crop

Research and Development) was ante-dated by a decision of the

Cabinet of Ministers when the Public Service Commission was

defunct, over two years to the time he was appointed originally

to the post on acting basis. The learned Deputy Solicitor

General has not disputed it.

For the aforesaid reasons, I quash the decision of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal dated 12.03.2015 by certiorari

and direct the Tribunal by mandamus2 to allow the appeal of the

petitioner by ante-dating the petitioners appointment to the post

of Director (Training and Extension) effective from 24.10.2008.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

2 In Methodist Trust Association of Ceylon v. Divisional Director of Education of Galle, CA/WRIT/192/2015 decided on 08.01.2019 I held that It is a myth that mandamus can only be issued against natural persons. Mandamus, like any other prerogative writ, can be issued against natural, juristic or non-juristic persons including tribunals, corporations, public bodies, public officials identified by their official designations provided the other requirements to issue mandamus are fulfilled.
