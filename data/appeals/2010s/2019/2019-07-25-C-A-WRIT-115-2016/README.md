Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner has filed this application seeking to quash by writ

of certiorari the decision to terminate his services from the Sri

Lanka Army referred to in P10; and to compel the respondents

by writ of mandamus to pay his salaries and pension from the

date of suspension of his services until the due date of

retirement.

The petitioner has been enlisted to the Sri Lanka Army as a

solider on 14.09.1990. By June 2001, he had been promoted to

the rank of a corporal. On 24.06.2001 he had been deployed at

the checkpoint in the Technical Junction, Maradana. Whilst

being so deployed, he had participated in raiding a nearby lodge

with a police constable, which is clearly and admittedly outside

the purview of his duty, and obviously done with an ulterior

motive. During the course of that unofficial raid, a Tamil lady in

that lodge had been arrested and brought to the checkpoint and

allegedly raped. He admits participating in the unwarranted

raid, but denies rape. Upon the complaint of that lady, the

petitioner and some police constables who had been on duty in

that checkpoint had been remanded by the Magistrates Court

pending investigations, and later released on bail. Thereafter

the petitioners services have been suspended from 01.12.2001.

After non summary inquiry in the Magistrates Court, they had

been indicted before the High Court for abduction and rape

and the petitioner for abduction. However as the prosecutrix

was not forthcoming to give evidence, they have later been

acquitted by the High Court on 26.08.2013.

It is the position of the petitioner that his contract service in the

Army came to an end on 13.09.2012 after 22 years of service,

and therefore he is entitled to back wages and pension.

In paragraph 25 of the petition, the petitioner admits that his 12

year service ended on 13.09.2002, and 22 years of service is

required for pension. He did not have 22 years of service, and

not even 12 years. His services were suspended before

completion of 12 year service. In paragraph 26 he says that his

request to lift the suspension and to allow him to serve in the

Army for another 10 years was turned down.

His main complaint is, according to the petition, that no inquiry

was held before termination of his services. R5, the inquiry

notes, tendered by the respondents with the objections, belies it.

According to R5, there had been an inquiry to which the

petitioner has participated. It is also clear from R5, at that

inquiry, the victim Tamil lady had not participated because that

lady had been on remand upon execution of a warrant (may be

due to being absent to give evidence in the Magistrates Court).

However at the end of the inquiry it has been proposed to

reinstate the petitioner if the petitioner has been exonerated by

the Civil Court. The petitioner now relies on R5 to claim that he

is entitled to be reinstated as he was acquitted by the High

Court. The petitioner cannot approbate and reprobate. On the

one hand he denies inquiry being held. On the other he relies

on the inquiry report.

In any event, the Commander of the Army is not bound to act on

that observation or recommendation. The Commander of the

Army by order dated 05.11.2012 has dismissed him from service

on disciplinary grounds.

According to R3, after 12 year enlistment as a soldier, another

maximum period of 12 years for re-engagement is at the

recommendation of the Commanding Officer subject to appeal to

the Commander of the Army. The petitioner, as I said earlier,

before completion of his initial enlistment for 12 years, got

remanded and thereafter charged in the High Court upon

indictment for an offence which attracted both national and

international attentionvide R10-P12.

According to R11 and R12, the Supreme Court in a

Fundamental Rights violation application has decided that the

aforementioned Tamil ladys fundamental rights have been

violated by the aforesaid acts and ordered compensation to the

victim.

Pending determination of the High Court case, his 22 year

service has expired. However he has served less than 12 years

at the time of his services were suspended. By R12 it seems

that the petitioner is also a respondent to that Fundamental

Rights case.

It is also relevant to note that the petitioner together with others

was acquitted not after trial but due to the failure of the

prosecutrix to be present in Court to give evidence, which is

common in rape cases due to various factors.

The decision of the Commander of the Army to dismiss the

petitioner from service on disciplinary grounds is justifiable.

Writ is a discretionary remedy. The facts and circumstances of

this case do not warrant exercising that discretion in favour of

the petitioner merely because he was acquitted by the High

Court.

I dismiss the application of the petitioner but without costs.
