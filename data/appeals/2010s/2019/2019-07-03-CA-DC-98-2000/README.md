JUDGMENT ON

K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J.

22.02.2019 by the DefendantlRespondent

03.07.2019

01. Plaintiff Appellant (Appellant) instituted the above numbered action in the

District Court of Kuliyapitiya against the Defendant Respondent

(Respondent) on i h June 1994, seeking a declaration of title to the land more

fully described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint, to eject the Respondent there

from and for damages.

02. Respondent filing answer claimed for prescriptive title over the land. After

trial, the learned District Judge delivered her judgment in the Respondents

favour stating that the Respondent has prescriptive title to the land in suit

over the Appellant.

03. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, Appellant lodged the instant appeal.

Although, the petition of appeal has urged 17 grounds of appeal, grounds

can be summarized into three.

1. The judgment of the learned District Judge is perverse and not m

accordance with the evidence adduced at the trial.

2. The learned District Judge has failed to consider that there was no overt

act evident, for the court to find that the Respondent has gained

prescriptive title over the land in suit.

2

3. The learned District Judge erred when she found that the Respondent has

gained prescriptive title to the land in suit.

04. Parties at the trial admitted that in terms of the final decree in the partition

case No. 5082 in District Court Kurunegala, the Appellant was allotted lot C

and that the Respondent was allotted lot B of the plan No. 4078 of the

licensed surveyor D.D. Gunasekera.

05. It was evident that the above lot No. C in plan No 4078 is depicted in plan

No 2414 of the licensed surveyor R. B. Navaratne and that the portion of the

land in dispute which is described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint is lot No.

01 of the said plan No.2414 which was marked as P3.

06. Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Appellant and the Respondent

are siblings. Defendant in his evidence had said that he had no intention to

have possession adverse to the Appellant with regard to lot C of plan No.

4078. Counsel contended that Defendant has failed to show any overt act

adverse to the Appellant to gain prescriptive title over the land in suit.

07. Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the dispute between the parties is

a boundary dispute and that the legal remedy would have been an action for

demarcation of boundaries. He further submitted that according to the

Appellant, the encroachment had been in 1988 and that the Appellant had

slept over his rights for 6 years. It is the contention of the counsel that as it is

a boundary dispute, prescription would not apply and that the Plaintiff would

only be entitled to compensation and not ejection.

08. It is an admitted fact that the Appellant became the owner of Lot C of plan

No. 4078 and that the Respondent became the owner of lot B of the same. It

3

is clear that lot No. 01 of plan P3 which is the portion of land in dispute is a

part of the said Lot C of plan No 4078.

09. Evidence of the Respondent was that about two years after the survey was

done in the partition case, he erected the fence according to the survey of

plan No. 4078 and he continued to possess the land as it is (including the

portion of land in suit). However, in his evidence he had clearly admitted

that he never had any intention to encroach into the land belonged to his

brother, the Appellant. He further said that he never possessed the land

belonged to Appellant illegally or by force as mentioned in his answer.

(Page 83 of the Court record).

10. On the evidence of the Respondent himself it is clear that he had no

intention to encroach into or adversely possess the lot C of plan No 4078

that belongs to the Appellant.

11. However, there had been a dispute over a jack tree and parties have settled it

by sharing the value equally. According to the Appellant, that had been in

1988.

12. When the parties are close relatives, the party who claims prescriptive title

over the other, will have to show that his possession was hostile to the real

owner and that it was adverse to the owner after a definite time of an overt

act.

13. In case of L de Silva V. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

S.C.1176 B.R.A 364 80 N.L R page 292, His Lordship Justice Sharvananda

(as he then was) said:

"The principle of law is well established that a person who

bases his title in adverse possession must show by clear and

4

unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile to the real owner

and amounted to a denial of his title to the property claimed. In order

to constitute adverse possession, the possession must be in denial of

the title of the true owner. Where there is no hostility to or denial of

the title of the true owner there can be no adverse possession. In

deciding whether the alleged acts of the person constitute adverse

possession, regard must be had to the animus of the person doing

those acts, and this must be ascertained from the facts and

circumstances of each case and the relationship of the parties.

Possession which may be presumed to be adverse in case of a

stranger may not attract such a presumption, in the case of persons

standing in certain social or legal relationships. The presumption

represents the most likely inference that may be drawn in the context

of the relationship of the parties. The Court will always attribute

possession to a lawful title where that is possible. Where the

possession may be either lawful or unlawful, it must be assumed, in

the absence of evidence, that the possession is lawful. Thus, where

property belonging to the mother is held by the son, the presumption

will be that the enjoyment of the son was on behalf of and with the

permission of the mother. Such permissive possession is not in denial

of the title of the mother and is consequently not adverse to her. It will

not enable the possession to acquire title by adverse possession.

Where possession commenced with permission, it will be presumed to

so continue until and unless something adverse occurred about it. The

onus is on the licensee to show when and how the possession became

adverse . ... "

5

14. His Lordship went on to say:

" ... Continued appropriation of the income and payment of

taxes will not be sufficient to convert permissive possession to adverse

possession, unless such conduct unequivocally manifests denial of the

perimeter's title. In order to discharge the onus, there must be clear

and affirmative evidence of the change in the character of possession.

Evidence must point to the time of commencement of adverse

possession. Where parties were not at arm's length, strong evidence

of a positive character is necessary to establish the change of

character. JJ

15. In case of Podihamy V. Elaris {1988} 2 Sri L.R. 129 Court said:

" ... In viewing the claim of the r t Defendant based upon

prescriptive possession one must not lose sight of the very important

fact that the parties are close relatives who had been living in amity

during earlier times which therefore rendered it necessary for the rt

Defendant to show some positive act suggesting ouster as a starting

point for prescriptive possession to commence. . .. JJ

16. As observed in paragraph 09 of this judgment, the clear evidence of the

Respondent was that he never had any intention to encroach into the land

belonged to the Appellant. The dispute that was settled over a jack tree was

also in about year 1988 according to the Appellant. Therefore, the

Respondent has failed to prove that he possessed the land in suit adversely to

the Appellant after an overt act 10 years prior to the institution of this action

in the District Court. Hence, the Respondent has failed to prove that he has

6

gained prescriptive title to the land in suit over the Appellant. The learned

District Judge has therefore erred when she answered the issues in favour of

the Respondent on the prescription.

17. The contention of the counsel for the Respondent that this is a boundary

dispute and that prescription is not relevant, is untenable. The position taken

by the Respondent by his answer was that he had gained prescriptive title to

the land and issues were also raised on that basis. He is not entitled to

change the character of the action at this stage.

18. In the above premise, I find that the grounds of appeal urged by the

Appellant have merit and accordingly the judgment of the learned District

Judge dated 14.03.2000 is set aside.

Appeal allowed with costs.
