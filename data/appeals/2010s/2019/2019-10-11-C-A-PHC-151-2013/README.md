Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner Divisional Secretary of Kundasale filed this

application in the Magistrates Court of Teldeniya under section

5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, No. 7 of 1979,

as amended, to eject the Respondent from Lot 17 of the

Preliminary Plan No. 2381 prepared by the Surveyor General.

The Respondent took up the position that his predecessor in title

became the owner of the land depicted in Plan 879 prepared by

Surveyor H. Panabokke by virtue of the Decree entered in

District Court Kandy Case No. 6007/L in 1964, and thereafter

the judgment-creditor in that case gifted the land to his children

by Deed No. 5319 in 1965, and they in turn transferred the land

by Deed No. 12149 in 1970 to the Respondents father-in-law,

Jenudeen Buhardeen, who was the original Respondent in the

connected Case No. CA/PHC/140/2013 and therefore this is not

a State Land, but a Private Land, from which he cannot be

ejected under the said Act. After the death of Jenudeen

Buhardeen, his daughter, who is also the wife of the

Respondent, has been substituted as the Substituted

Respondent in the other case.

This case is directly connected to CA/PHC/140/2013 where the

Judgment was delivered just now. In both cases, objections,

submissions, counsel etc. are all same. The only difference is, in

this case, (a) the disputed land is Lot 17 of the same Plan No.

2381 and (b) the Respondent (Abdul Hameed Mohammed Razik)

is the husband of the Substituted Respondent in the other case.

There is no necessity to repeat the reasons given in the other

case here.

For the same reasons, the Judgment of the High Court is set

aside and the order of the Magistrates Court is restored. No

costs.

K.K. Wickremasinghe, J.

I agree.
