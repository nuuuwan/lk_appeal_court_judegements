The leave to appeal application has been preferred against the order of the Board of

Quazis dated 14.09.2013 and on the question of leave, both Counsel made both oral

and written submissions.

This was originally an application made by a wife (the Applicant'Respondent~

Respondent) for lying,in,expenses. The ~uazj of Kinniya, in an order dated 23.01.2010

awarded her a sum of Rs.83,000/, payable by the husband (the Respondent~Petitioner~

Petitioner).

When one peruses the record before the learned ~uazi, one could observe a number of

attempts made by the ~uazj to have the husband (the Petitioner before this Court)

present himself for an inquiry but on his failure to get him down despite notices, the

~uazj had gone ahead with an ex parte inquiry and made his order dated 23.01.1983

awarding the wife (Respondent before this Court) a sum of Rs.83,OOO/' after having

heard her. These are applications made under Section 47(1) of the Muslim Marriage and

Divorce Act and the ~uazj thereafter had moved the Magistrate's Court, Trincomalee for an

2

enforcement. It is under Section 64 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act that the

~uazi seeks orders for enforcement via the relevant Magistrate's Court.

If there is a material error in the certificate filed by the ~uazi, it may be returned to the

~uazi for appropriate action and if necessary parties may also be directed to appear

before the ~uazi and the proceedings before the Magistrate's Court may be adjourned for

a future date until the corrected certificate is filed~see the effect of the proviso to Section

66.

The learned Magistrate, Trincomalee, on receiving the certificate had acted under the

proviso to Section 66 and permitted the Petitioner to re~open the case before the ~uazi.

The application for enforcement remained adjourned till 21.0S.2010.

The Petitioner avers that he was present before the ~uazi on 08.0S.2010 and though the

~uazi recorded proceedings, and made the same order, he refused to issue certified copies

of the proceedings. Apart from this mere ipse dixit, there is no proof whatsoever that the

Petitioner was ever present before the ~uazi on the 08.0S.2010.

This Court does not see any evidence to support the assertion that this was brought to

the notice of the Magistrate on 21.0S.2010. There are no certified copies of the

proceedings had in the Magistrate's Court in Trincomalee to ascertain whether a

complaint was brought home to the notice of the learned Magistrate, since it is the

learned Magistrate who had directed the ~uazi to re~open the proceedings in the ~uazi

Court application bearing No.S262/09. The Magistrate should have been apprised of the

intransigence of the ~uazi if there was such refusal. What became of the MC proceedings

is not known. This question arises because the Petitioner was due to have appeared in

the Magistrate's Court on 21.0S.2010. The absence of proceedings pertaining to the

Magistrate's Court, Trincomalee casts doubt on" the question whether the Petitioner

appeared at all in the Magistrate's Court on 21.0S.2010.

Instead the Petitioller [lctitioned the Board of '2!.uazis to have the order made by the ~uazi

on 08.05.2010 set aside.

This was a revision application made to the Board of ~uazis in terms of Section 62(1) of

the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act No.13 of 1951 as amended read with Rule 4 of the

5th schedule to the Act.

The Board of '2!.uazis by its order dated 14.09.2013 dismissed the application for revision,

whilst holding that the order issued to the learned ~uazj of Kinniya to recall the

application and certificate for enforcement filed in the Magistrate's Court of Trincomalee

was vacated. The learned '2!.uazi of Kinniya was ordered to take necessary steps according

to the provisions of law.

It is against the order of the Board of ~uazis dated 14.09.2013 that the Petitioner has

sought leave to appeal. The Board of '2!.uazis has in their order lamented the absence of a

number of documents material to the revision application before it. The following

documents, the Board of ~uazis states, were not before them.

1. A copy of the application and certificate for enforcement made by the learned

~uazj of Kinniya to the Magistrate, T rincomalee.

2. The learned Magistrate's order dated 01.04.2010 that the '2!.uazi must re~open the

proceedings.

This becomes material in view of the assertion of the Petitioner that he tendered a true

copy of the MC proceedings dated 01.04.2010 to the learned ~uazi on 15.04.2010.

3. The Petitioner speaks of a refusal on the part of the learned ~uazi, Kinniya to issue a

certified copy of the order made on OS.05.2010. There was no evidence manifesting

this refusal.

The Board of ~uazis in their order dated 14.09.2013 has pinpointed the aforesaid

infirmities. Even the further remedy of setting aside the initial order of the ~uazi on

23.01.2010 has been sought rather belatedly only in the counter objections before the

4

,~.

Board of ~uazi\ The failure to produce so much of the record as would be necessary to

undl:rstancl the nrJcr to be revised and to place it in its proper context has always been

material in revisionary applications and that principle seems to have led to the dismissal

of the revision application filed by the petitioner before the Board of ~uazis-see David

Appuhamy v. Yassassi Thero (1987) 1 Sri.LR 253 and Mary Nona v. Fransina (1988) 2

Sri. LR 250-cases that focused on revision application to the Court of Appeal. This Court

too has not been furnished with material documentation that would have expatiated the

case of the Petitioner.

What is dispositive of the matter is the observation made by the learned Chairman of the

Board of ~uazis. He states that the learned ~uazi of Kinniya is ordered to take necessary

steps according to the provisions of law to recover the lying-in-expenses which had been

made payable by the Petitioner. The Respondent has been driven from pillar to post not

being able to recover her long overdue lying in expenses owing to these efforts which

have not been though properly and legally taken and in the circumstances this Court is

not inclined to grant the Petitioner leave to appeal in this matter. I must confess that

there were no exceptional circumstances in the case of the Petitioner that would have

shocked the conscience of the Board of ~uazis for its exercise of revisionary jurisdiction.

The same consideration would weigh with this Court.

Accordingly the order of the Board of ~uazis dated 14.09.2013 is affirmed and this

application for leave to appeal is refused.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this order to the Board of ~uazis and the

learned ~uazi of Kinniya to take steps according to law to recover the lying in expenses

that are due to the Respondent from the Petitioner.
