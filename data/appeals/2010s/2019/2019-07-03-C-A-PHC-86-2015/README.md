Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioners filed this application against the respondents in the

High Court seeking a mandate in the nature of writ of mandamus

compelling one or more or all of the respondents to release the

petitioners from the combined service of drivers of the North

Western Provincial Public Service and absorb them to the Ministry

of Health of the said Province. The High Court refused to grant the

relief. This appeal by the said petitioners is from that Judgment.

Drawing attention of the Court to P1-P6, the petitioners say that

they were given a legitimate expectation that they would be

recruited as drivers of the Ministry of Health of the said Province

and not to the Combined Service of the Drivers of the North

Western Provincial Public Service.

However they admit that they were given appointments as Drivers

of Class II(b) in the Combined Service of the Drivers of the North

Western Provincial Public Service, and not as Drivers of the

Ministry of Health. The former is not a closed service whereas the

latter is. These appointment letters have been given by the Chief

3

Secretary of the Province on 01.01.2007. The petitioners have

accepted those appointments made by letters marked P7(1)-(14).

The petitioners state that (a) they made several requests to the 1st

and 2nd respondents to release them from the Combined Service to

the Health Ministry, and (b) then they were informed that it would

be rectified when their services would be made permanent. There is

no documentary proof to support either of them. The respondents

in their objections deny both those matters. When facts are in

dispute, needless to say that, mandamus cannot go. This Court

has no wherewithal to look into the accuracy of those assertions

and then make a suitable order. This Court will decide whether or

not to issue mandamus on the facts which are undisputed.

Thereafter the petitioners have been made permanent in the same

post, i.e. Drivers of Class II(b) in the Combined Service of the

Drivers of the North Western Provincial Public Service, effective

from the date of appointment, i.e. 01.01.2007. This has been done

by the Chief Secretary of the Province by letters marked P9(1)-(12)

issued in 2010 and 2011.

The petitioners have filed this application in the High Court in

2012.

When the respondents deny that they promised the petitioners that

the petitioners would be absorbed to the Health Ministry from

Combined Service when permanent appointments are made, I need

hardly emphasize that the petitioners are clearly guilty of lashes

when they decided to invoke the writ jurisdiction of the Provincial

High Court to challenge the appointment letters issued in 2007, in

the year 2012. Writ is a discretionary remedy and will not be

4

available to those who are dormant in their conduct to claim what

they think is legally entitled to them.

This leads me to consider whether the petitioners are legally

entitled to the relief which they say denied to them by the

respondents. To issue mandamus, the petitioners must show that

they have a legal right, with the corresponding legal duty on the

part of the respondents, to be absorbed to the Health Ministry from

Combined Service, which has unreasonably been withheld by the

latter.

I have no doubt that there is no such right accrued to the

petitioners and there is no such duty to be performed by the

respondents.

The petitioners cannot have legitimate expectation of being

confirmed in any post other than the post to which they have been

initially appointed.

The petitioners have also drawn the attention of the Court to

P10(1) and (2) to say that two other individuals similarly

circumstanced were recruited in 2007 straight as Drivers to the

Health Ministry. It is not clear on what basis those two were so

recruited and also they are not parties to this application at least

for notice. That might give rise to a cause of action to file a

fundamental right application on discrimination but that will not

create a legal right in favour of the petitioners for this Court to

compel the respondents by mandamus to absorb the petitioners to

the Health Ministry as Drivers.
