Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioners are followers of a religion known as Jehovahs

Witnesses. The matter in issue concerns of construction of a

religious hall, peculiar to that religion, known as Kingdom Hall.

It is the contention of the petitioners that, first, the 1st

respondent Pradeshiya Sabha granted the approval to construct

the said building by P8 dated 14.11.2014 (read with P4(a), P5(a),

P5(b) and P15), but later, by P11 dated 05.05.2015, suspended

the said approval, which is ultra vires.

Accordingly, the petitioners filed this application seeking (a) to

quash P11 by way of writ of certiorari; and (b) to compel the

respondents by way of writ of mandamus to allow the petitioners

to continue with the construction; and (c) to prevent the

respondents by way of writ of prohibition from interfering with

the construction of the said building.

According to P11, approval for construction has been suspended

due to protests by the people of the area who have inter alia

given a letter of protest with about 150 signatures, which has

been tabled before the Pradeshiya Sabha on 29.04.2015. The

Chairman on behalf of the Pradeshiya Sabha has not cancelled

the approval but only suspended it until recommendations are

obtained from the relevant institutions.

What are the relevant institutions to obtain recommendations

from? This is stated in P6, which is the application tendered by

the petitioners to the Pradeshiya Sabha, seeking the approval for

the construction of the religious building. The Chairman of the

Pradeshiya Sabha, as seen from Page 4 of P6, has, on

14.11.2014, specifically mentioned that, as this is a religious

3

construction, the Pradeshiya Sabha has no objection to the

construction after obtaining the recommendation from the

Ministry of Religious Affairs.

It is important to note that P8, which the petitioners heavily rely

on, is also of the same date, i.e. 14.11.2014, and signed by the

same Chairman. Simply stated, P6 and P8 have been issued on

the same day by the same officerthe Chairman of the

Pradeshiya Sabha. Therefore those two documents are

inseparable and shall be read and understood together.

This has been suppressed by the petitioners in the petition. This

is a material fact, nay the main fact, which goes to the root of

the matter. Between P6 and P8, it appears that, some

unconnected and irrelevant documents have been introducedI

do not know why?1 The petitioners have not acted with

uberrima fides, and that itself warrants dismissal of the

application in limine.

It is clear that after P6, the petitioners did not obtain the

recommendation for the construction from the Ministry of

Religious Affairs, and it appears to me that it has not been

obtained up to now.

It is this recommendation which was referred to by the

Chairman in P11 dated 05.05.2015. This is made amply clear

by looking at P12, written by the Chairman on the following day,

i.e. on 06.05.2015, to the Divisional Secretary whereby the

Chairman informed the Divisional Secretary that he has sent the

relevant application to the Divisional Secretary on 04.03.2015 to

1 As seen from page 2 of P6, the application has been tendered on 24.10.2014. P7 is a document dated 17.02.2014. Also there is no relevancy of the List of Names of the Jehovahs Witnesses filed before P7.

obtain the approval for the construction from the Ministry of

Religious Affairs. A copy of this letter has been marked by the

respondents as 1R3.

The respondents have, with their objections, tendered a

circular/letter dated 02.09.2011 issued by the Secretary to the

Ministry of Buddhasasana and Religious Affairs marked 1R1

whereby the Divisional Secretaries and Local Bodies have been

informed to obtain approval from the that Ministry before

granting permission to construct religious buildings in order to

maintain religious harmony among the general public in the

area and to avoid conflicts on different religious beliefs/faiths.

In paragraph 2 of R1, it is stated that the approval from the

Ministry shall be obtained through Form 01. P6 referred

to above, as seen from page 1, is Form 01. That means,

the petitioners had been aware of the procedure although they

now say insisting approval from an unknown Ministry is ultra

vires.

If the petitioners challenge 1R1 issued by the Secretary to the

Ministry of Buddhasasana and Religious Affairs, the Secretary to

the Ministry of Buddhasasana and Religious Affairs shall be a

necessary party. But he is not a party to these proceedings.

Without giving him a hearing, 1R1, cannot, in any event, be

declared null and void.

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the application of the

petitioners with costs.
