M. M. A. Gaffoor, J.

This is an appeal from the judgment of the learned District Judge of

Mathugama in respect of a partition action bearing Case Number 1071/P.

The Plaintiff Respondent (hereinafter referred to as Plaintiff) instituted the

above action seeking to partition the land called Pathirage Kumbura Owita

alias Panichanmulle Owita depicted in Plan Number-946 dated 05.09.1983

prepared by N. Kularatne Licensed Surveyor mentioned as Lot 1 & 2 and

marked as X at the trial and produced which is in file of record.

The 1st Defendant-Respondent in his Statement of claim admitted the claim of

the Plaintiff. The 2nd Defendant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as 2nd

Defendant) in his statement of claim stated that Lot 2 depicted in Plan

Number 946 dated 05.09.1983 prepared by N. Kularatne Licensed Surveyor is

in extent of 3 Roods and 28 Perches was owned by A. D. Baron by prescriptive

3

possession after him, his son Ebrahim and after Ebrahim, his son - the 2nd

Defendant has possessed the specified land more than 10 years without any

interruption and disturbance.

He also claimed for plantation made and looked after by him in the specified

land Lot 2 depicted in Plan Number 946 dated 05.09.1983 prepared by N.

Kularatne Licensed Surveyor.

After the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge delivered judgment

in favour of the Plaintiff on 27th July 1995.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the 2nd Defendant-Appellant has

preferred this appeal to set aside the judgment dated 27th July 1995 and to

allow the appeal.

In this appeal, the Plaintiff submitted that the land described in the schedule

to the plaint was received by him through paper title and prescriptive title. In

the amended plaint of the Plaintiff, it is to be observed that the title starts

from 1905 and by way of government permit No. 40953.

It is to be noted that all the paper title and deeds were produced before the

Trial Judge and admitted without any objections. And also the evidence of the

witnesses on behalf of the Plaintiff were consistent and supports the position

of the Plaintiff.

The 2nd Defendant stated in his statement of claim that he had inherited the

land from his father Ebraham after his demise. But during the trial, he had

4

admitted that his father Ebraham was alive and their inheritance was

continued from their grandfather Baron Appuhamy. Therefore, it is fairly clear

that the 2nd Defendants statement is contradicted and no proper evidence

neither witnesses were produced before the Trial Judge.

It is my careful observation that the retired Grama Niladari Mirihana

Kankanamge Gunapala who gave evidence on behalf of the 2nd Defendant was

unaware of the details and the names of the land and the nature of the facts.

Further, the 2nd Defendant took up a position that he acquired the prescriptive

title to the specified land from 1963. However, this Court is in a firm view that

a mere statement of prescription cannot be considered as a valid prescriptive

title to a property.

In Juliana Hamine Vs. Don Thomas [59 NLR 546] at page 548.

Apart from the use of the word possess, the witness called by

the plaintiff did not described the manner of possession.

In Alwis Vs. Perera [(1919) 21 NLR at page 326] Bertram C. J. stated that,

I wish very much that District Judges I speak not particularly,

but I possessed or we possessed or we took the procedure,

would not confine themselves merely to recording the words, but

would insist on those words being explained and exemplified.

5

In Sirajudeen Vs. Abbas [(1994) 2 SLR 365] the Supreme Court has observed

thus:

As regards to the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere

general statements of witnesses that the plaintiff possessed the

land in dispute for a number of years exceeding the prospective

period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse

possession necessary to support a title by prescription, it is

necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific facts and

the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by court

In De Silva Vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue [80 NLR 292]

Sharvananda J. clearly and deeply observed that,

the principle of law is well established that a person who

bases his title in adverse possession must show by clear and

unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile to the real

owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property

claimed. In order to constitute adverse possession, the

possession must be in denial of the title of the true owner. The

acts of the person in possession should be irreconcilable with the

rights of the true owner; the person in possession must claimed

to be so as of right as against the true owner. Where there is no

hostility to a denial of the title of the true owner there can be no

adverse possession.

6

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the learned District judge has well

analyzed the facts, evidence, and witnesses of the case and carefully

examined the title and correctly held with the Plaintiff.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of

the learned District Judge.

Therefore, I dismiss the appeal without cost.

Appeal dismissed.
