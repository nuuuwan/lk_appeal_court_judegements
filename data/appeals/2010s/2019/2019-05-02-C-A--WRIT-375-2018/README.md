Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner who had joined the Sri Lanka Army in January 1985 is currently

serving as a Major General. In March 1995, while serving as a Major, the

Petitioner had been charged with being absent without leave from the Special

Forces Training School at Maduru Oya for a period of 5 days. Upon the

Pet~tiO-ner -pleading- guilty to the said charge, he had- been severely

reprimanded and his salary and allowances for 5 days had been forfeited.

According to the Curriculum Vitae of the Petitioner annexed to the petition

marked 'Pla', the Petitioner had received his regular promotions thereafter

and had been promoted to the rank of Temporary Major General in January

On 29th June 2016, Major General N.J.Walgama, Military Secretary attached to

the Army Headquarters had issued the document annexed to the petition

marked 'P18' under the heading, 'Policy decision on AWOL 2 Officers'.

According to 'P18', the concurrence of the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army

had been granted to implement the policy contained therein, with effect from

1st July 2016, on all Officers of the Sri Lanka Army who had been absent

without leave before 20th May 2009.

1 Letter dated 1ih February 2016 issued by the Military Secretary confirming the appointment has been annexed to the petition marked 'P14',

1 AWOL is the acronym for 'Absent without leave',

3

In terms of paragraph 14 of 'PiS', Officers in the rank of Temporary Major

General, who are holding the appointment of a General Officer Commanding

and who has been absent without leave for a period under 14 days, such as the

Petitioner, "should not be considered for further command or instructor

appointments ..... Such Officers should retire on completion of maximum

permissibl~period-in-tne-f-a-n-k of Major GeneraL"

Dissatisfied with 'PiS', the Petitioner had submitted a Redress of Grievance

(RaG) to the 1st , Respondent Commander of the Sri Lanka Army on 15th

September 2016, through the Colonel of the Gajaba Regimene, who, in

forwarding the said ROG to the 1st Respondent, had stated as follows:

"Further, I have no doubt that his reputation as a capable officer with a

professional outlook is known to all his superior officers in the Army,

therefore, such an officer is an asset to the Army.

In light of the above, it is presumed that you would certainly realise that

his residual service is beneficial to the organisation and the country.

Hence, I earnestly request that his appeal be favourably considered

please."

It is the position of the Petitioner that inspite of reminders sent to the Military

Secretary in July 20174, to HE the President in August 20175 and to the

3 The ROG has been annexed to the petition marked 'P19',

5 Letter dated 10

th August 2017 annexed to the petition marked 'P21' ,

Secretary, Ministry of Defence in November 20176, the Petitioner is yet to

receive a reply to his ROG. This Court observes that the Petitioner has

submitted two further appeals to HE the President in February 20187 and

September 20188 but that, apart from referring the said letters to the 3rd

Respondent, Secretary, Ministry of Defence, no action has been taken on the

purported grievance of the Petitioner. The effect of the long delay in

addressing tpe ROG of the Petitioner is that in te-rms E>f~P-1S', -the Petitioner

has not been given any Command positions after April 2017.

It is in these circumstances that the Petitioner filed this application in

November 2018, seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

aforementioned paragraph of 'PiS', in so far as it relates to the Petitioner. The

Petitioner's complaint to this Court was that 'PiS' was not only illegal in that

matters purportedly relating to discipline and promotions were sought to be

effected by means other than by way of regulations under the Army Act but

also that the policy was irrational and unreasonable and sought to be

implemented with retrospective effect.

This application was supported for notices on ih February 2019. This Court,

being of the view that the Petitioner has established a prima facie case and

also having observed that although 'PiS' was issued in July 2016, it was to

apply only to those Officers who had been absent without leave prior to 20th

May 2009, issued notices on the Respondents.

By way of a motion filed on 22nd February 2019, the Attorney-at-Law for the

Petitioner brought to the attention of this Court that four Officers who are

senior to the Petitioner are due to retire by end April 2019 and that the

application of 'P18' to the Petitioner will deprive the Petitioner from holding

any command positions. Accordingly, the Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioner

moved that the learned President's Counsel appearing for the Petitioner be

permittee tEl> suppor-t fOF-the-+nteFim relief prayed for- in tl=le petition. This

Court, having afforded the Respondents an opportunity of filing Limited

Statement of Objections, considered the application for interim relief on 25th

March 2019.

In the Limited Statement of Objections as well as during the course of the oral

submissions and in the written submissions, the learned Senior State Counsel

appearing for the Respondents has taken up the following preliminary

objections and moved that this application be dismissed in limine in view of

the said objections:

1) That Article 35 of the Constitution acts as a bar to the Petitioner

maintaining this application as the relief sought by the Petitioner has a

direct bearing on a decision which is to be taken by HE the President.

2) The Petitioner has failed to pursue administrative relief, as provided for in

Section 32 of the Army Act;

3) The Petitioner is guilty of laches and delay;

6

4) The Petitioner has suppressed material facts, especially the fact that the

Petitioner had been absent without leave in 2002.

What constitutes a preliminary objection has been considered by this Court in

Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya vs Sri Lanka Ports Authority and another9 and has

subsequently been expanded by this Court in Sarath Ar:adarahennadi vs ole

Police Stati~>n, Sigifiy~o:- Accor-dinglv, an ebjeetion mtJst- have- the foHowing

attributes if it is to constitute a preliminary objection:

"(I) A preliminary objection is a matter that can be decided without

going into the merits.

(II) A preliminary objection can be on a pure question of law such as a

patent lack of jurisdiction. It can also be a mixed question of fact and

law as well as a question of fact alone but, only in situations where

there is ex facie either no dispute or a frivolous dispute on the

fundamental facts that are being urged before the Court and

contained in the pleadings that have been filed.

(III) A preliminary objection must be distinguished from an objection on

any point of law, which can be raised at any part of the trial unlike

the preliminary objections, which by its nature is expected to be

raised at the beginning of the proceedings prior to the beginning of

the arguments in the case./I

This Court is of the view that the matters at I, 2 and 3 above involve an

examination of the facts of this case, which can only be done at a full hearing

and after having afforded the Respondents an opportunity of filing

comprehensive Statement of Objections. They cannot be classified as

preliminary objections in accordance with the criteria laid down in the above

case. Furthermore, any determination of the said issues at t~is stage would not

only be prematu-~e-b-yt-'--(;a.A-be to the detrimeJt of the Respondent-5~- ep&iaJLy_

since the Respondents have only filed a brief limited Statement of Objections.

However, given the fact that this Court is exercising its discretionary powers,

this Court is of the view that in considering this application, this Court is

entitled to consider at this stage the conduct of the Petitioner, which is the

fourth objection raised by the learned Senior State Counsel. In this regard, the

Respondents have submitted that the Petitioner does not have an

unblemished and exemplary record of service, as claimed by the Petitioner. In

support of this statement, the Respondents have submitted that the

Petitioner, while following an Infantry Captain's Career Course in the USA in

2001, had been arrested by the Parker County Sheriff's Office of Texas on

charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and had been absent

without leave for 118 days from the said Course. The Petitioner had been

warned over this incident and asked to pay the course fee of Rs. 65,000 in

addition to not being considered for overseas courses for three years. The

Petitioner has however annexed to his Counter affidavit marked 'A', the

proceedings of the Army Advisory Board, which he claims had been

communicated to him in 2002, which reads as follows:

8

liThe Board discussed in detail the events leading for Lt Col M N A

Dharmaratne RWP RSP psc GR to be AWOL while following the Infantry

Captains Career Course in USA. Instructions were sought from the D legal

and it was observed that the Officer was acquitted as he was not found

guilty of any charges. Further the Officer was unable to report for duty as

he was held by the US Immigration Authorities on expiry of his visa, once

being a-cqu-it-tee-afld-f'ele-a-secl from- the Poliee- eu-s-t0cl~ The- Board also

decided that as the Officer was acquitted, he should be granted leave for

the period held in custody.

The Board decided that the Officer should not be penalised in his future

military career for the above and to be considered for promotion and

higher appointments in due course."

The Respondents in their limited Statement of Objections as well as the

learned Senior State Counsel in the written submissions have confirmed that

the 'AWOL was cancelled as per the Advisory Board decision dated

14.12.2002.' In these circumstances, this Court is unable to hold that the

statement in the petition that the Petitioner had an unblemished and

exemplary record of service is false or that the failure to disclose an incident

from which he had been exonerated by the Sri Lanka Army itself is a

suppression or misrepresentation of a material fact. It is rather disturbing that

the Respondents have raised this issue in view of the final paragraph of the

said decision that lithe Officer should not be penalised in his future military

career for the above ... "

9

Being of the view that the scope of this inquiry should be limited to the interim

relief prayed for by the Petitioner, this Court will now consider whether the

interim relief should be issued. In doing so, this Court would bear in mind the

following observation by Chief Justice Neville Samarakoon in Billimoria v.

Minister of Lands and Land Development & Mahaweli Development and two

othersll:

, 1

"It would not be correct to judge such orders in the same strict manner as

a final order. Interim orders by their very nature must depend a great deal

on a Judge's opinion as to the necessity for interim action."

In Duwearachchi and another vs Vincent Perera and others12 this Court

considered the application for an interim order in the light of three essential

considerations:

a) Will the final order be rendered nugatory if the petitioner is successful?

b) Where does the balance of convenience lie?

c) Will irreparable and irremediable mischief or injury be caused to either

party?

The decision in Duwearachchi has been consistently followed by this Court in

several cases including in Ceylon Tobacco Company PlC vs Hon. Maithripala

Sirisena, Minister of Health and others13, Tokyo Super Cement Company

another.17

The Petitioner is 54 years of age and is due to retire in April 2020. After the

incident in 1995, the Petitioner has been granted his promotions and has been

able to reach the highest rank that an officer other than a person who

becomes the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army can aspire to. The Petitioner

has also held command positions from 1996 until he was declared ineligible by

'PiS' in 2017. This fact alone demonstrates that the Petitioner had the

maturity, character, integrity and loyalty required to hold such positions, which

are the criteria the Army Board of Officers have identified an officer should

possess in order to be selected as the Colonel of the Regiment or the Colonel

Commandants.18 The Petitioner has annexed several documents to

demonstrate that the Petitioner was entrusted positions of responsibility

during the last stages of the military operations and that he carried out his

duties as Special Forces Brigade Commander in a satisfactory manner. Thus, in

the ordinary course of events, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the

Petitioner would have been granted further command responsibilities until his

retirement. It is therefore clear to this Court that the reason why the Petitioner

is being deprived of such responsibilities is the policy in 'PiS'.

18 The decision of the Army Board of Officers dated 4th December 2017 has been produced by the Respondents marked'R8'.

11

As observed earlier, the Petitioner has challenged the said policy in 'P18' on

the basis of inter alia illegality and irrationality. So far, this Court has not been

presented any material, either in 'P18' itself or in the Limited Statement of

Objections of the Respondents that would rebut the arguments of the

Petitioner. This Court has also not been provided with any explanation so far as

to wh-y 'P18' is to apply only to those who were absent without leave prior to -----2ath May 20Q9 but not thereafter. Thus, in the event this Court finally holds-

with the Petitioner but, if by that time the Petitioner has retired, the final

order that would be delivered by this Court would be rendered nugatory. As

Chief Justice Samarakoon said in the case of Billimoria19 the Petitioner "will be

left holding an empty decree worthless of all purposes."

Would the Respondents, the Sri Lanka Army or the country at large suffer by

having a person such as the Petitioner holding command positions? It is

observed that the Respondents have not taken up the position in their limited

Statement of Objections that the Petitioner is not worthy of holding any

command positions. Other than the issue relating to the Petitioner being

absent without leave in 1995, the Respondents have not cited any other

incident which would demonstrate that the Petitioner does not have the

maturity, character, integrity and loyalty to hold command positions. On the

contrary, the Petitioner has been awarded the Rana Wikrama Padakkama in

1991, the Weera Wikrema Vibushanaya in 2016 and has been recognised by

the then Commander of the Sri Lanka Army for his contribution to end

terrorism as evidenced by 'P7,.20 It is infact appropriate to quote the citation in

'P7' at this stage:

As recently as September 2016, the Colonel of the Gajaba Regiment to which

the Petitioner belonged had stated that the Petitioner is an asset to the

Army.21 In this background, the only conclusion that this Court can reach is that

there is certainly no damage that would accrue to the Respondents or to the

Sri Lanka Army by the Petitioner being entrusted with command

responsibilities,

On the other hand, the effect of this Court refusing to issue the interim relief

but the Petitioner eventually turning out to be the victor would be that in the

interim, the Petitioner not only has been denied the opportunity of holding

command responsibilities but would be subject to ridicule in a hierarchical

system that exists in the Sri Lanka Army where despite being the 11 tli most

senior Officer, the Petitioner is deemed not suitable to hold a command

position. In these circumstances, it is clear that not only does the balance of

convenience lie in favour of the Petitioner, he would also suffer irreparable or

irremediable mischief and injury, if this Court does not issue an interim order

staying the operation of 'P1S'.

In t-Ae a-eove circumstances, it is the view of this Court that the interests of

=~ju ...... stice __ woli~ b~ best served by issuing an interim order as prayed- -fur - ~I+

paragraph (j) of the prayer to the petition, until the final determination of this

application, staying the operation of 'P1S' in so far as it relates to the

Petitioner.

Given the urgency on the part of all parties to conclude this application as

expeditiously as possible, this Court, while directing the parties to file their

pleadings as early as possible, would endeavour to give priority to conclude

this case at its earliest.
