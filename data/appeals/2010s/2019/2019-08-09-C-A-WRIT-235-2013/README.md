Janak De Silva J.

According to the Petitioner this application relates to land and premises at 8/2 Kandalama

Junction, Dambulla known as Millagawatte which was gifted to his paternal grandfather

Moragolla Undiralalage Piyasena by deed of gift (PI). Upon the death of the said M.U. Piyasena

the land was occupied by the father of the Petitioner M.U. Buddhadasa who passed away in 2006

(P2) after which the said premises were occupied by the Petitioner and his family and his siblings

M.U. Kusumawathie, M.U. Dharmapala and M.U. Sugathadasa.

The Petitioner states that the said land and premises were acquired by the State by order

published in the Gazette bearing no. 300/14 dated 08.06.1984 (P4) under the proviso to section

38(a) ofthe Land Acquisition Act as amended (Act).

The Petitioner claims that although the land was acquired by the State it remained in the

possession of the Petitioner and other co-owners and that it has not been used for any public

purpose, no compensation has been paid and that representations has been made from time to

time that the said land will be divested or in the alternative that alternative land from the vicinity

will be provided which created a legitimate expectation in the Petitioner. However, by letter

Page 3 of 10

marked Pll dated 18.07.2013 the Petitioner has been asked to demolish the buildings standing

on the premises.

The Petitioner prays for the following relief:

(a) A writ of certiorari quashing the decision in the letter marked Pll and rendering the said

decision null and void and of no force or avail in law;

(b) A writ of certiorari quashing the order made under section 38(a) of the Act marked P4;

(c) A writ of mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to revoke the vesting order acting

under section 39(1) of the Act; or in the alternative

(d) A writ of mandamus compelling the Respondents to grant the Petitioner suitable

alternative land and premises.

Writ of Certiorari Quashing Decision in Pl1

The Petitioner seeks to quash the decision in Pll by which the Petitioner was requested to

demolish the buildings standing on the relevant land and premises failing which the Urban

Development Authority was to demolish them. The writ is sought essentially on the legitimate

expectation said to have been created in the Petitioner that the said land vesting order will be

revoked or in the alternative land will be provided.

In Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service [(1985) A.C. 374, 408-9] Lord

Diplock stated that for a legitimate expectation to arise, the decision :

"must affect [the] other person ..... by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which

either (i) he had in the past been permitted by the decision maker to enjoy and which

he can legitimately expect to be permitted continue to do until there has been

communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has been

given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from the decision-

maker will not be withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of advancing

reasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn." (emphasis added)

Page 4 of 10

Such legitimate expectations may arise where a public authority has made a clear, unqualified

and unambiguous representation to a particular individual that it will act in a particular way.

The burden is on the individual to demonstrate that an unqualified, unambiguous and

unqualified representation was made [Clive Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law, 5th Ed., 248

(South Asian Edition)].

The Petitioner relies on document marked P7 in particular P7A where it is stated that certain

lands, which according to the Petitioner includes the land in issue, should not be acquired for the

Dambulla Sacred Area Development Project. This purported decision is said to have been made

by Janaka Bandara Tennakoon, Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government. However,

he was not at that the Minister of Lands and did not have power to give such a representation.

An ultra vires representation should not be binding on the body which made it as it would entirely

destroy the whole doctrines of ultra vires and separation of powers which are related. In

Robertson v. Minister of Pensions [{1949} 1 K.B. 227) Lord Denning used the doctrine of estoppel

to give relief to an individual who had relied on an unlawful representation. However, the House

of Lords in Howell v. Folmouth Boat Construction Co. [{1951} A.C. 837) disapproved of Lord

Denning's remarks relating to an ultra vires assurance and its legal consequences.

In Regina v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, Ex Parte M.F.K. Underwriting Agents Ltd. and others

[(1990) 1 WLR 1545 at 1573) Judge J. states that "No legitimate expectation could arise from an

ultra vires relaxation of the relevant statute by the body responsible for enforcing it."

The principle that the court will not give effect to a legitimate expectation where to do so would

involve the decision-maker acting contrary to law is fundamental [Attorney-General of Hong Kong

v. Ng Yuen Shiu [1983) 2 AC 629 at 638; R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, Ex parte

Coughlan (2000) 2 WLR 622 at 647, 651, 656; R v. Secretary of State for Education and

Employment, Ex parte Begbie (2000) 1 WLR 1115 at 1125, 1132}].

In Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) Ltd. vs. Director General of Customs [{2005} BLR 24) the

Supreme Court held that the representation must be intra vires for there to be a legitimate

expectation.

The Petitioner also relies on document marked P8 which is a letter written by Janaka Bandara

Tennakoon, then Minister of Lands and Land Development. However, it does not contain any

holding out by the Minister of Lands.

Quashing of Order made under the Proviso to Section 38(0) of the Act (P4)

In Fernandapu/le v. Minister at Land and Agriculture [79(11) N.L.R. 115 at 119] the legal position

applicable to the instant case was stated by the Supreme Court as follows:

"If one looks at the entire Act two main powers are given to the Minister. They are:

1. The power to decide whether the land is required for public purpose

and to direct that it be acquired, and

2. Whether there is an urgency compelling the immediate possession

being taken of the land and to direct that possession be taken.

As pointed out earlier, the former decision is by enactment (section 5(2)) made

conclusive and therefore removed from scrutiny by the Courts. The latter has not been

so treated and it is legitimate to hold that the legislature did not intend to remove the

Court's power of scrutiny." (emphasis added)

However, the Supreme Court held that while an order by the Minister under the proviso to

section 38 of the Land Acquisition Act can be made only in cases of urgency, it is however a

matter for a Petitioner who seeks the remedy by way of Certiorari, to satisfy the Court that

there was in fact no urgency and his application cannot succeed should he fail to do so. Hence

the burden of proof is on the Petitioner to adduce evidence that there was no urgency and if he

fails to do so, his application must be dismissed. This then is the ambit of the inquiry before this

court.

The learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that for 30 years since the land was acquired

by the State nothing has been done on it and that this fact itself proves that there was no urgency

which justified an order been made under the proviso to section 38(a) of the Act.

Page 6 of 10

The acquisition order No. 123 of 1984 (P4 pages 2A to 4A) refers to 33 different lots which were

admittedly acquired for the Dambulla sacred area development as reflected in P7A item 10 which

is a document relied on by the Petitioner. P4 deals with 33 different parcels of land. Admittedly

the Petitioner is not the owner of all 33 lots. Hence in any event a writ of certiorari as prayed for

by the Petitioner cannot be issued to quash the whole of P4.

The evidence shows that development work has been carried out on parts of the land so

acquired. In those circumstances, merely because no such development work was done on the

land occupied by the Petitioner for more than 30 years does not necessarily mean that there was

no urgency in taking possession of the total land reflected in P4.

On the other hand, the lapse of over 30 years from the making of P4 also shows that there has

been undue delay on the part of the Petitioner in impugning P4.

In Sarath Hulangamuwa v. Siriwardena, Principal, Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo 5 and 5 others

[(1986) 1 Sri.L.R. 275] it was held that certiorari being a discretionary remedy will not be granted

where there was delay in seeking the remedy.

In Jayaweera v. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and another [(1996) 2 Sri.L.R.

70] Jayasuriya J. held:

" A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a Writ of Certiorari is

not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine.

Even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has discretion to deny him relief having regard

to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all valid impediments

which stand against the grant of relief."

In that case relief was refused since there was a delay of over two and half years since making

the order challenged.

Page 7 of 10

In Jayarathne v. Wickremaratne and Others [(2003) 2 SrLL.R. 276] it was held that even when the

Petitioner is entitled to the relief on grounds of error of law, the Petitioner is guilty of laches

which stands against the grant of relief by way of writ of certiorari. In this case, the Court

specifically came to a finding that the decision impugned in that application was irrational,

arbitrary and unreasonable. Yet the relief was refused since the application was made to Court 7

years after the impugned decision.

Hence, I hold that the Petitioner is in any event not entitled to a writ of certiorari quashing the

order made under section 38(a) of the Act marked P4 for reasons of delay.

Writ of Mandamus Compelling Revocation of The Vesting Order

Section 39(1) of the Act vests the Minister in charge of Land with the power to revoke a vesting

order made under section 38 of the Act if possession of the land has not actually been taken for

and on behalf of the State.

Although document R1 indicates that the constructive possession of the land in dispute has been

handed over to the Urban Development Authority it is not in dispute that actual possession is not

with the State and hence it is arguable that a revocation of the vesting order is at least in theory

possible.

But there are two questions which in my view must be addressed by Court namely whether the

Minister has a discretion in deciding whether to revoke the divesting order and secondly whether

revocation of the whole vesting order is possible where the vesting order relates to several lots

of lands and the possession of some of which have been taken over by the State.

I am minded only to consider the second question in the instant case and leave the other question

to be considered in the future in an appropriate case with the benefit of a full argument by

parties.

Page 8 of 10

The acquisition order No. 123 of 1984 (P4 pages 2A to 4A) refers to 33 different lots which were

admittedly acquired for the Dambulla sacred area development as reflected in P7A item 10 which

is a document relied on by the Petitioner. The evidence shows that development work has been

carried out on parts of the land so acquired which shows that possession has been taken over by

the State. The prayer is for the revocation of the order P4 and not only the part dealing with the

land claimed by the Petitioner.

In Kingsley Fernando v. Dayaratne and Others [(1991) 2 SrLL.R. 129], which was quoted with

approval in Mendis v. }oyaratne, Minister of Agriculture, Lands and Forestry [(1997) 2 SrLL.R.

215], this Court held that in a divesting what is contemplated is a complete reversal of the status

quo ante and not a piece-meal divesting of particular portions of a land that is vested. Hence the

application for a divesting of a particular portion of the land that is vested was held to be

untenable and that mandamus cannot issue. It was further held that the divesting has to relate

to the entire extent covered by the vesting Order.

The same rationa le applies in the case of revocation of the vesting order under section 39(1) of

the Act. This section refers to revoke "the vesting order". "The vesting order" is a reference to

the complete vesting order made under the proviso section 38(a) of the Act. However, that

cannot be granted in this case as the evidence is that possession of some of the lots of land in P4

has been taken over by the State and development work carried out. Therefore, the writ of

mandamus compelling the revocation of the vesting order must be denied.

Writ of Mandamus Compelling Grant of Suitable Alternative Land

It is trite law that to issue a writ of mandamus there must be a public or statutory duty. [De Alwis

v. De Silva (71 N.L.R. 108); Weligama Multi Purpose Cooperative Society Ltd. v. Chandradasa

Daluwatta (1984) 1 SrLL.R. 195; Hakmano Multi Purpose Cooperative Society Ltd. v. Ferdinanda

(1985) 2 SrLL.R. 272; Piyasiri v. People's Bank (1989) 2 SrLL.R. 47; Sannasgala v. University of

Kelaniya (1991) 2 SrLL.R. 193 and Samaraweera v. Minister of Public Administration (2003) 3

SrLL.R. 64].

Page 9 of 10

The Act does not establish a duty on the part of the State to provide alternative land for land

acquired by the State. There is a statutory duty to pay compensation for the land acquired. As

such no writ of mandamus will lie to compel the Respondents to grant the Petitioner alternative

land and premises.

For all the foregoing reasons, the application is dismissed without costs.

However, this Court makes direction that the 2nd Respondent or the relevant acquiring officer

shall take immediate steps to pay compensation according to law for any land acquired

consequent to P4. The payment of compensation must be completed within 6 months of the date

of this judgment.
