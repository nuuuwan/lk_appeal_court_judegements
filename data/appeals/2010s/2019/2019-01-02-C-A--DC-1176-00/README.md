Before E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, J

Counsel Manohara de Silva, P.e. for the Defendant. Navin Marapana for the Substituted- Plaintiff - Respondent.

Decided on 28.12.2018.

E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, J

The Plaintiff in the Case No. 626/L of the District Court, Marawila filed his Plaint

dated 12.08.1993 seeking the demarcation of the common boundary between lot

Nos. C 2 and C 3 depicted in plan bearing No. 6616 dated 10.10.1963 drawn by V.F.

Warnakulsuriya, Licensed Surveyor. The said plan was marked as P2 during the

tria I.

The Plaintiff's position was that he became the owner of the aforesaid lot No. C2,

which is morefully described in the pt schedule to the Plaint, by Deed No. 2865

dated 11.01.1965, which was marked as P1 at the trial. The Plaintiff had further

stated in his plaint that the Defendants own and/or possess Lot C3 of the aforesaid

plan, which is morefully described in the second schedule to the Plaint. The Plaintiff

averred in his plaint that the fence existed between the aforesaid two lots was

completely obliterated by the damaging acts of the Defendants. Thus, the Plaintiff's

position was that a cause of action has accrued to him to file an action to get the

common boundary demarcated. In their answer, the Defendants took up the

position that the 1st Defendant, who was deceased by the time they filed the

answer, was the owner of Lot No. C 3 by virtue of deed No. 2706 dated 21.10.1963,

which was marked as P5 at the trial. The Defendants had further stated that the

3

1st Defendant was in possession of Lot Nos. C2 and C3 as one land and cultivated

them with coconut and other crops. The Defendants' position was that the Plaintiff

was never in possession of Lot C2 but it was the 1st defendant who was in the

possession of the said Lot C2 and thus, they claimed prescriptive title to Lot C2.

The Plaintiff and a Police constable U. Jayasinghe testified on behalf of the Plaintiff

while the 1A Defendant and 6 others gave evidence on behalf of the Defendants at

the trial. The learned District Judge delivered his Judgment dated 21.12.2000 in

favour of the Plaintiff and this appeal has been preferred against the said Judgment

by the 1A Defendant - Appellant.

The 1A Defendant - Appellant ( hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant

in this judgment) argues that the Plaintiff Respondent (Sometimes referred to as

the Plaintiff in this judgment) could not have filed an action for demarcation of

boundaries and the proper action that should have been filed is one of declaration

of title and ejectment. The Appellant further argues that they have proved title to

the Lot C2.

In support of his arguments the Appellant has brought this court's attention to the

flowing authoritative text and the decisions of the Superior Courts.

a) Walter Pereira in Laws of Ceylon, 2nd Edition 1913 at page 204. ---

"wherever the boundaries of land belonging to different owners had become

uncertain/ whether accidently or through the act of the owners or of some third

person/ an action for definition and settling them was provided by the Roman

Dutch Law. The onus of proof of the essential facts in such an action was on the

Plain tift/

4

b) Leelawathie Hamine Vs Gunasiri (1989) 1 SLR 322: - Where it was held that

an action for definition of boundaries lies only where parties are admittedly

the owners of contiguous land and the common boundary between the two

land has become uncertain. When the dispute is to lots, the appropriate

remedy is an action for declaration of title and ejectment.

c) Maria Vs Fernando 17 NLR 65 - Where it was held that an action for defining

and settling boundaries is provided for by the Roman Dutch Law whenever

the boundaries of land belonging to different owners had become uncertain,

whether accidently or through the act of the owners or some third person.

The onus of proving the essential facts in such an action was on the Plaintiff,

but the action was not allowed to one co-owner against another when a

boundary of the common property and one of a property belonging

exclusively to one of the co-owners had become "mixed up".

d) Jacolis Appu Vs David Perera 69 NLR 548 - Where it was held an action for

definition of boundaries presupposes that the parties to the action are

admittedly owners or occupiers of contiguous lands.

Since the Appellant disputes the Plaintiff's title to Lot C2 by claiming prescriptive

title to it along with Lot C3 as one land, the Appellant appears to be bringing forth

an argument that, at the time of filing the plaint, there were no two contiguous

lands owned by two different individuals to file an action to demarcate a common

boundary.

It is my considered view that this argument can hold water only if the Appellant can

prove that the Defendants including the Appellant have prescriptive title to Lot C2

as averred in the answer. The Plaintiff has stated in his plaint that Lot C2 belongs

5

to him by the deed marked as Pl. As per the deeds marked as P1 and PS, it appears

that the Plaintiff's title to lot C 2 as well as the 1st Defendant's title to lot C3

originate from the same source, namely Dona Eugenia Hamine of Marawila.

Respective paper title to the said lots were established by the Plaintiff by marking

the said deeds during the trial. No objections were reiterated against the said deeds

at the conclusion of the Plaintiff's case or when they were marked during the trial.

Thus, they prove respective paper title of the Plaintiff and Defendants to the

adjoining lots, namely C2 and C3.

The Appellant rely on the purported prescriptive possession of the 1st Defendant

who is now deceased but as per the police statement (P4), which was made by the

1st Defendant on 19.08.1992, that was only about 1 year before the date of the

plaint, the pt Defendant had described the land as a co-owned land. The said

statement(P4) was made in response to the police complaint made by the Plaintiff

with regard to the removal of the fence constructed by the Plaintiff. The position

of the 1st Defendant in the said statement was that the land in issue is a co-owned

land and the fence erected by the Plaintiff was removed by some other persons.

The pt Defendant has further stated in the said statement(P4) that the Plaintiff had

got the fence removed to implicate the 1st Defendant and his son to the dispute. It

must be noted that 1st Defendant has not stated that the title to the land was only

with him and the Plaintiff had no right to erect a fence on that. The 1st Defendant's

position that he possessed the land as a co-owner stands against any claim of

prescriptive right claimed by the Defendants in their answer. As the 1st Defendant

has not refused the Plaintiff's right to the land in that statement (P4), it seems that

the purported co-ownership he referred to there in the said statement was one

with the Plaintiff. Anyway, the position taken up by the Defendants in their answer

6

and while leading evidence was not based on co-ownership to the land in question

but on prescriptive title of the 1st Defendant which was not reflected in the

aforesaid statement (P4) made by the pt Defendant himself approximately 1 year

prior to the filing of the plaint. On the other hand, it must be noted that the

Defendants themselves have suggested while cross examining the Plaintiff that the

fence with concrete poles was erected after demolishing the fence that existed

there previously (vide page 95 of the brief). This too is contrary to the position

taken by the Defendants that they possessed the land as one land for a long period.

Though the lA defendant has stated that the Defendants possessed the land, due

to the position taken by the pt Defendant in his statement to the police(p4), it

cannot be presumed that the said possession, even if it is true, was an adverse one.

When prescriptive claim of the Defendants fails, the deeds marked as Pi and P5

confirm that the pt Defendant and the Plaintiff got respective title to contiguous

two lots, namely C2 and C3 and as per the schedules of those deeds, those lots are

not undivided portions but divided portions of lands with exclusive identity. Hence

defeating the Defendants' stance, the Plaintiff had established that there are two

contiguous lots, namely C2 and C3 which belong to two different individuals,

namely the Plaintiff and the pt Defendant as at the date of filing the Plaint.

The Appellant attempts to argue that the Plaintiff failed in proving that there

existed a common boundary which was obliterated by a subsequent event. The

Plaintiff's position was that there was a stick fence separating the relevant lots and

he replaced it with a fence made of concrete poles which was removed by the

Defendants on the same date it was erected causing him to make the police

complaint marked as P3. As mentioned before, even while cross examining the

7

Plaintiff, the Defendants have suggested that there was a fence before erecting the

fence with concrete poles which was removed by the Defendants. However, it is

my considered view, having bought the lot (3 as per the description of boundaries

referred to in the schedule to the deed No. 2706 marked as PSI the Defendants or

the Appellant cannot, while relying on the same deed, state that there did not exist

a boundary as per the Plan No. 6166, since they have bought the lot (3 by accepting

its metes and bounds as per the schedule in the said deed. Furthermore the p t

Defendant in his Police statement had not stated that the fence erected by the 1st

Defendant and removed by some other persons, was a new introduction to the

land. In P3, the police complaint made by the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff had clearly

stated that he renewed the existing fence with concrete poles and barbed wires.

Even the Appellant in his evidence has admitted that the Plaintiff on two occasions

fixed the fence with sticks but the 1st Defendant removed them. Furthermore, the

Defendants' stance that they possess the two lots as one land too supports the

position that the common boundary was obliterated at the time the plaint was

filed. These facts on balance of probability support the view that there had been a

common boundary separating the two lots. Since the boundaries are described

according to a plan, there is no doubt that the boundary separating lot (2 and ( 3

is ascertainable.

At this moment, I would like to refer to the following decisions of the superior

courts with regard to Actio Finium Regundorum i.e. actions for the definition of

boundaries.

8

Ponna Vs Muthuwa 52 NLR 59 'The common Law remedy of an action for definition

of boundaries presupposes the prior existence of a common boundary which has

been obliterated by some subsequent event. It cannot be sought for the purposes

of creating on some equitable basis a line of demarcation which had never been

there before. /

Deeman Silva Vs Silva and others (1997) 2 SLR 382

"An action for definition of boundaries lies only to define and settle boundaries

between adjacent owners/ whenever the boundaries have become uncertain

whether accidently or through the act of the owners or some third party. The

Plaintiff must come into Court stating (1) that an ascertainable common boundary

previously existed on the ground and (2) that such boundary had been obliterated

subsequentlyN

"If there was no ascertainable boundary to be redefined this action (Actio Fenium

Regundorum) should have been terminated. The action should have been then

under the circumstances one of 'dec/a ration of title/ and not definition of

boundaries.'/

Somawathie and others Vs. lIIangakoan (2013) 1 SLR 94 "The action for definition

of boundaries/ known to Roman Dutch Law as Actio Fenium Regundorum lies

whenever the boundaries between the lands of adjacent owners have become

uncertain either by chance or by the act of adjoining owners or of the third party.

(Voet/ Pandects Book 10 title 1 section 1 (a)}. This judgment has referred to the

aforesaid two judgments Ponna Vs Mutuwa and Deeman Silva Vs. Silva."

9

The decisions referred to above in this judgment indicate that to bring forth a

successful action to demarcate boundaries following ingredients should be

present;

1. Two contiguous lands belonging to two different owners

2. An ascertainable boundary that existed previously but subsequently

obliterated due to act or acts of the owner or owners or a third party or by

some other manner.

A careful perusal of the plaint reveals that the Plaintiff has averred that;

l.The lots C2 and C3 belong to him and the Defendants respectively.

2.The common boundary is shown in plan no.6616 of V.F. Warnakulasuriya,

licensed surveyor.

3.The fence that separated the aforesaid two lots does not exist due to the

acts of the Defendants.

4.Therefore the Plaintiff has a cause of action to get the common boundary

between the aforesaid two lots demarcated.

Hence, the plaint contains all necessary ingredients to file an action for the

demarcation of boundaries.

As shown before, the Defendants' claim for prescriptive title must fail. It was

also shown before that the Plaintiff has proved the defendants' title to lot C3

and the Plaintiff's title to lot C2 by submitting the relevant deeds.

As mentioned before, the Plaintiff has proved on balance of probability that

there was a common ascertainable boundary which is obliterated

subsequently.

Hence, it is my considered view that there was a proper cause of action for

the Plaintiff as the owner of lot C2 to get the common boundary demarcated

10

and he has placed sufficient evidential materials before the learned District

Judge to get the judgment in his favour.

However, the Appellant challenges the impugned judgment on another

ground. As per the proceedings dated 29.02.1996, twelve issues were

framed by the parties and when the case was taken up for trial on

28.01.1997, parties agreed to accept the issues so framed on 29.02.1996 and

continue with the trial. Nevertheless, six further issues were raised on behalf

of the Defendants on that date making the number of issues totaling up to

18. The learned District Judge in his judgment has stated that on 29.02.1996,

six issues have been framed on behalf of the Plaintiff and six issues on behalf

of the Defendants. However, the learned District Judge in his judgment has

listed issues nos.l to 6 framed by the Plaintiff on 29.02.1996 and the six

further issues raised by the Defendants on 28.01.1997 and answered only

the said twelve issues. Therefore, the learned District Judge has failed to

answer the six issues framed on behalf of the Defendants on 29.02. 1996. It

is true that, as per the section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code, the judgment

shall contain the points of determination, the decision thereon and the

reasons for such decisions. The failure to answer the aforesaid six issues is

definitely a defect in the judgment. However, the proviso to the article

138(1) of the constitution states that no judgment, decree or order of any

court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or

irregularity which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

11

Some of the issues which were not answered by the learned District Judge

mainly relate to the prescriptive title of the Defendants to lot ( 2 (vide issues

nos. 6,9, and 11 framed on 29.02.1996 but wrongly numbered as 7, 10, and

12). As mentioned before the Defendants' claim for prescriptive title to lot (

2 must fail. On the other hand, the reasoning of the learned District Judge

contained in the body of the judgment too confirms that the learned District

Judge was not of the view that the Defendants have prescriptive title to the

lot ( 2. Therefore, even if he answered the aforesaid issues, he would have

answered them in the negative. Therefore, it is my considered view that the

failure to answer aforesaid issues nos.6, 9 and 11 has not prejudiced the

substantial rights of the parties.

Issue nO.8 (wrongly numbered as 9) framed on 29.02.1996 relates to

whether there was a boundary separating lot ( 2 and lot ( 3. However, issue

no. 4 (wrongly numbered as 5) was raised on the same point and the learned

District Judge has answered that in the affirmative. Therefore, failure to

answer the said issue cannot prejudice the parties since the same point has

been answered under issue no.4.

The issue nO.l0 (wrongly numbered as 11) raised on 29.02.1996 relates to

the improvements and plantation in the land in question. The failure to

answer this issue would have affected the rights of the Defendants only if

the Plaintiff is entitled to take a writ of execution to dispossess the

Defendants. This is an action to demarcate the boundary between lot (2 and

lot (3. The Plaintiff has not filed this action based on a cause of action of

unlawful encroachment or possession. Therefore, the Plaintiff is entitled only

12

to take a writ out to fix the boundary but not to take the possession of any

part of the land if he is dispossessed by the Defendants.

As per the proceedings dated 23.09.1997 the Plaintiff has admitted that the

possession of the land is not with him from 1992 (vide page 89 of the brief).

Though the Plaintiff was successful in proving his case to get the common

boundary demarcated, this court observes that he has not joined any other

cause of action such as unlawful encroachment or possession by the

Defendants. Therefore, he is not entitled to take out a writ of possession

other than a writ to demarcate the common boundary. While making the

said remarks, this court dismisses the appeal filed by the 1A Defendant

Appellant without costs.
