Samayawardhena, J.

This is a partition action. After trial the learned District Judge

pronounced the Judgment dated 17.07.1995. After coming into

strong findings of fact on devolution of title followed by

answering of the issues raised at the trial, the learned District

Judge has in the last part of the Judgment directed the plaintiff

to tender to Court the schedule of shares prepared in terms of

the Judgment. It is noteworthy that no party including the 15th

defendant appealed against that Judgment.

The parties have not agreed to the proposed schedule of shares

tendered by the plaintiff stating that it has not been prepared in

terms of the Judgment. Thereafter the Court has invited all the

parties including the 15th defendant to tender proposed

schedules of shares for the Court to take a final decision.

Accordingly, in addition to the plaintiff, several defendants

including the 2nd, 10th, 11th through their Attorneys have filed

their proposed schedules of shares prepared in terms of the

Judgment. It is significant to note that the 15th defendant did

not file a proposed schedule of shares. Having considered

everything, the learned District Judge has accepted the

proposed schedule of shares tendered by the 10th defendant as

the correct one prepared in conformity with the Judgment. It is

against this order dated 23.02.2000 the 15th defendant has filed

this final appeal.

It is my considered view that this appeal is misconceived in law

warranting dismissal of it in limine as there is no right of appeal

against the impugned order, which is not the Judgment of the

case. The Judgment was delivered about 5 years before the

impugned order. If the 15th defendant was dissatisfied with the

3

order of the District Judge accepting the schedule of shares of

the 10th defendant, he ought to have come before this Court by

way of leave to appeal and not by way of final appeal. In

Puwalawathie Perera v. Somaratne [2004] 1 Sri LR 119

Udalagama J. dismissed the appeal in limine in similar

circumstances.

A schedule of shares on the face of it at most could form

only a part of an interlocutory decree. Even if one was to

consider an interlocutory decree to be final, such

interlocutory decree would not consist only of a schedule of

shares and would by no means be a complete interlocutory

decree having the effect of a final judgment.

The impugned order is admittedly an interlocutory one

attracting the provisions of section 754(2), as the trial judge

had only to "decide shares" and he accepted the "shares"

filed by the plaintiff-respondent by the impugned order.

The gravamen of the argument of the learned counsel for the

15th defendant-appellant before this Court is that the District

Judge was in grave error delegating his judicial function to the

parties to prepare and tender schedule of shares and on that

ground alone the Judgment is rendered a nullity. I find myself

unable to subscribe to that view.

It is very easy for an appellate Judge to summarily set aside a

Judgment of a long-drawn-out partition action at the stroke of a

pen. But, in my view, that is not justice.

Whilst emphatically emphasizing that it is the bounden duty of

the District Judge to prepare the schedule of shares and to

incorporate it as an integral part of the Judgement, in an

4

exceptional case where the District Judge has obtained the

assistance of the Attorneys of the parties to work out a schedule

of shares in terms of the specific findings of the Judgment,

especially when the Judgment has been pronounced not by him

but by his predecessor, the District Judge, in my view, does not

delegate his judicial powers as long as he takes the ultimate

decision. After all, that is whatassisting the Court in the

dispensation of justicethe Attorneys, as officers of the Court,

do right throughout the case.

This view of mine is fortified by the following observation of T.S.

Fernando J. in Wijesundera v. Herath Appuhamy (1964) 67 CLW

63 at 64:

A statement of shares is a documentwhich, incidentally,

finds no recognition in the Partition Ordinancethat is

submitted by one or more of the parties or their proctors for

the convenience of the judge in the entering of the partition

decree. The submission of such a statement cannot, in my

opinion, make any difference to the duty of the judge to

satisfy himself that the statement of shares is in conformity

with the judgment already pronounced.

In Thomas Singho v. Cornelis (1967) 74 NLR 109 at 112 Siva

Supramaniam J. observed:

However irksome the task may be, it is the duty of a trial

Judge in a partition action to determine precisely the share

to which each party is entitled. This is not a duty which a

Judge is entitled to delegate to a Proctor for one of the

parties. If, on the basis of the findings, a statement of

shares is submitted by one of the parties for the assistance

5

of the Judge, such a statement should be assented to by all

the parties or their Proctors before it is accepted. As was

observed by T. S. Fernando S.P.J., in Wijesundera v. Herath

Appuhamy and others (1964) 67 CLW 63 at p. 64, the

submission of such a statement cannotmake any

difference to the duty of the Judge to satisfy himself that

the statement of shares is in conformity with the judgment

already pronounced.

The learned counsel for the 15th defendant has drawn the

attention of this Court to the Judgment of Basnayake C.J. in

Memanis v. Eide (1960) 59 CLW 46 in support of his argument.

However the facts of that case are distinguishable from those of

the instant case in that in Memanis case the learned Judge has

mechanically adopted the schedule of shares filed by the

Attorney for the plaintiff (as seen from the following passage of

the Judgment) whereas it is not so in the instant case.

In his judgment the learned Judge says: Plaintiffs Proctor

will file a schedule of shares, which when filed will form

part and parcel of this judgment and there is schedule of

shares filed which he has adopted in entering the

interlocutory decree. Section 25 of the Partition Act, No.16

of 1951, provides that the Judge shall examine the title of

each party and shall hear and receive evidence in support

thereof and shall try and determine all questions of law

and fact arising in that action in regard to the right, share

or interest of each party to, of, or in the land to which that

action relates, and shall consider and decide which of the

orders mentioned in section 26 should be made. In the

instant case there had been no determination of the shares

6

of the parties as required by the partition Act. It is the

share so determined by the Judge that the court is required

to enter in the interlocutory decree. The course taken by the

learned District Judge is contrary to the provisions of

section 25 of the partition Act.

In the instant case, the schedule of shares had to be finalized

not by the Judge who pronounced the Judgment but by his

successor. He considered the schedules of shares tendered by

Attorneys of the parties and decided the schedule of shares

tendered by that of the 10th defendant is in conformity with the

Judgment already pronounced. It is the Judge who has taken

the ultimate decision. I see no illegality in it. Therefore the

argument of the learned counsel for the 15th defendant that the

District Judge erred by delegating his judicial function to parties

to prepare and tender schedule of shares and therefore the

Judgment of the District Court shall be set aside does not

comment itself to me.

The 15th defendant cannot now canvass the findings of the

Judgment. If he was not in agreement with the Judgment

pronounced in 1995, he could have appealed against the

Judgment at that time.

I dismiss the appeal with costs.
