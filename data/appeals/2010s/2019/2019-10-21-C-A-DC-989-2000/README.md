Decided on: 16.10.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff filed this action in the District Court to partition the

land described in the schedule to the Plaint among the Plaintiff

and the 1st-12th Defendants. The 13th and 14th Defendants later

intervened. After trial the learned District Judge entered

Judgment as prayed for by the Plaintiff. Hence this appeal by

the 13th and 14th Defendants.

In this case, there is no dispute regarding the corpus, but there

is a dispute regarding the pedigree. By looking at the

statements of claim, the dispute regarding the pedigree was: the

2nd-6th, 13th and 14th Defendants on the one hand, and the

Plaintiff and the rest of the Defendants on the other.

According to the Plaint filed in 1987, the two original owners of

the land were Punchi Nilame and Mudiyanse, and their rights

devolved on the Plaintiff and the 1st-12th Defendants by way of

deeds and inheritance. Those deeds have been marked at the

trial.

The 2nd-6th and 13th Defendants in their statement of claim filed

in 1989 stated that the two original owners were Punchi Nilame

and Mudalihamy (not Mudiyanse). However, when the 14th

Defendant filed a separate statement of claim in 1994, he agreed

3

with the Plaintiff to say that the original owners were Punchi

Nilame and Mudiyanse alias Mudalihamy.

The 2nd-6th and 13th Defendants in their statement of claim set

out, to some extent, the devolution of title to share of the

land, and then state that they all became entitled to the balance

share by prescription. It is difficult to understand how they

claim prescriptive rights to undivided shares. However, it is

interesting to note that, in the prayer to the statement of claim,

they have sought only dismissal of the Plaintiffs action.

It is relevant to note that the 2nd-6th Defendants fall within the

pedigree of the Plaintiff, and the Plaintiff has given shares to

those Defendants in the Plaint.

The 14th Defendant in the prayer to his statement of claim seeks

share of the whole land. This is not possible according to his

own pedigree set out in his statement of claim.

Thereafter, at the trial, the 2nd-5th, 13th and 14th Defendants

have raised one set of issues. The said issues Nos. 14-23 are

confusing and contradictory. For instance, by issue No. 16 and

18, they ask undivided rights to the land according to their

pedigree. But in the joint statement of claim of the 2nd-5th and

13th Defendants, they do not clearly state how many shares each

of them is entitled to. It may be recalled that in the prayer to

the statement of claim, they have only asked for the dismissal of

the action. According to the statement of claim of the 2nd-5th

and 13th Defendants, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants have no rights

by inheritance as they have transferred their rights to the 5th

Defendant by way of a deed. Hence it is irresponsible to ask the

Court to give shares to all the contesting Defendants including

4

the 2nd and 3rd Defendants as pleaded in the plaint. By issue

No.19 they say that they are entitled to the whole land. By issue

No.23 they say they have prescribed to the land. What the said

Defendants expected from the District Court was not clear.

At the trial, on behalf of these Defendants, only the 14th

Defendant has given evidence. It is significant to note that, in

the cross examination, he has admitted the Plaintiffs pedigree

and his title deeds.1

Out of the 2nd-6th, 13th and 14th Defendants, the 2nd-6th

Defendants fell within the pedigree of the Plaintiff, and except

the 13th and 14th Defendants, the 2nd-6th Defendants all got

shares in the Judgment. The 2nd-6th Defendants appear to be

satisfied with the Judgment as no appeal has been filed against

the Judgment. Only 13th and 14th Defendants filed the appeal.

Learned Counsel for the 13th and 14th Defendants in his written

submission has pointed out some minor defects in the long

pedigree of the Plaintiff. The pedigree in this case is not

straightforward. Whilst accepting the original owners, the

contesting Defendants also came out with a different pedigree.

When there is a complex pedigree in a partition case, it is not

possible to set out in the plaint comprehensively, and establish

at the trial with a high degree of proof, a perfect pedigree with no

defect whatsoever. After a full trial, it is easy to the District

Judge and the Appellate Court to summarily dismiss the action

stating that the Plaintiff has failed to prove the pedigree by

clinging on one or two defects. That is not justice. The pedigree

in a complicated partition case shall be understood as a whole,

and minor defects, shall, as far as possible, be reconciled,

1 Vide pages 201-206 of the brief.

5

provided they do not go to the root of the pedigree, keeping in

mind that the objective in filing the partition action is to end co-

ownership. The duty of the Plaintiff in a partition action is to

present a comprehensive pedigree to the best of his knowledge

and ability. This observation of mine shall not be treated as a

licence to present incomplete pedigrees in partition actions

through carelessness and indifference.

In Jane Nona v. Dingiri Mahatmaya2, Sirimane J. stated:

It is the duty of a plaintiff in a partition action to set out to

the best of his knowledge and ability a full and

comprehensive pedigree showing the devolution of title with

reference to all the deeds of sale on which title is alleged to

have passed. In view of the very far reaching consequences

of a decree under the Partition Act, a Court should not

assist a plaintiff who either through carelessness or

indifference does not place before the Court evidence which

should be available to him.

In my view, the learned District Judge cannot be found fault

with accepting the Plaintiffs pedigree in preference to the one

unfolded by the 2nd-6th, 13th and 14th Defendants.

Appeal of the 13th and 14th Defendants is dismissed but without

costs.
