When this matter was taken up on 31" May 2019, the learned President's

Coumel appearing for all parties moved that this Court pronounce its

judgment on the wntten submissions that had already been tendered on

behalf of the parties

The Petitioner, who is .1 registered Trade Union under the Trade Unions

Ord 'na nce No . 14 of 1935, has fil ed thiS application, \eeking inter alia a Writ of

Certlonrt to qua sh th~ 'alIenatIon' of land made by the f' Respondent, Srt

2

Lan ka Ports Authority (SLPA) to the 2

nd Respondent, Serendib Flour Mills

(Priva te) Limited, by way of Deed of Lease No. 67, annexed to the petition

marked 'P13' .

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The 1" Res pondent has been incorporated in terms of the Sri Lanka Ports

Authority Act No. 51 of 1979, as amended (the Act) . Its objects and powers

have been set out in Sections 6 and 7 of the Act, respectively. The Petitioner

states that in early 1999, the Board of Investment (BOI) entered into an

agreement with a com pany known as Galle Flour M ills (Private) Limited for the

establishment of a flour mill at the Port of Galle. Subsequently, the said

company had intimated to the Government of Sri Lanka that the viability of the

said project would be contingent upon the factory being moved to Colombo.

The Peti tioner states further that a meeti ng was held on 11 'h May 2000

between the officials of the 1" Respondent and the investors of the proposed

project to discuss the possibility of releasing land for the flour milling .project

from the Port of Colombo and that, as reflected by the minutes of the said

meeting annexed to the petition marked 'P18', the Chairman of the 1"

Responrlent had informed the investors that due to shortage of land within the

Port of Colombo, the 1" Respondent is unable to release the requested land.

According to the Petitioner, there is a scarcity of land within the Port of

Colombo for use b'l t hl~ 1'" Respondent for Port related activity and the I"

Res ')oncient had in fact Identi fi ed the need to purcha se as much as 40 acres of

land In the VIClnlt'/ of th,' Port of Colombo In order to efficiently perform its

co rf' ope'riltlo n;

J

It is in the above background that the 1" Respondent had entered into the

afo remen tioned lease ag reement marked 'P13' on 12'h July 2001 with the 2

nd

Respondent. This Cou rt has examined 'P13' and observes that the tenure of

the lease is 30 yea rs and that the annual lease rental is the Sri Lanka rupee

equ iva lent of US Dollars 99,469.50. The Petitioner has pointed out that certain

Clau se~ of 'P13' are not in the best interests of the 1" Respondent and can

have a long term impact on the financial viability of the 1" Respondent. It is the

position of the Petitioner that (a) the execution of the said lease agreement is

not necessary for the exercise of the powers, and performance of the duties of

the 1'.1 Respondent, (b) is not within the statutory objects and duties of the 1"

Respondent, and therefore is ultra vires the powers of the 1" Respondent.

It is the position of the 1\1 Respondent that the Government of Sri Lanka had

decided in principle to permit the establishment of a flour milling project

within the Port of Co lombo and that in terms of the agreement that the 2nd

Respondent had entered into with the BOI, the 2

nd Respondent was eligible to

receive a land w ith in the Port of Colombo for the establishment of the said

project. The 1" Respondent had stated further that 'P13' was executed only

after du e consideration of all matters and in keeping with Government policy.

It h a~ been submitted further that the 1'" Respondent has leased out land

within the Port of Colombo on previous occasions, a fact which has not been

disclosed to this Cou rt by the Petitioner.

The "c, ponc!ent, h,lV' t~ken up sever;]1 objections with rega rd to the

milln ld lrlilbd,ty of Ih,', ,l ppl'Cililon Of the sa id obJection s, there are two

obJ' (t lf) r1 S Ihal thl ', C(Jurf would like to con'" der at the outset, as thiS Court IS

of th, VI "W thilt thl' "lid "b)p'CtI Onc, go to th' root of Ihls case

The first objection relates to the delay on the part of the Petitioner in invoking

the jurisdiction of this Court. Th e Superior Courts of this country have

con Sistently held that a petitioner seeking a discretionary remedy such as a

Wri t of Certiorari mu st do so without delay and that where a petitioner is

guil ty of delay, such delay must be explained to the satisfaction of Court. To

put it differently, unexplained delay acts as a bar in obtaining relief in

discretionary remedies, such as Writs of Certiorari and Prohibition .

In Biso Menika v. Cyril de Alwisl Sharvananda, J (a s he then was) set out the

rationale for the above proposition, in the following manner:

"A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot be

held to be a Writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. But exercise

of this discretion by Court is governed by certa in well accepted principles.

The Court is bound to issue a Writ at the instance of a party aggrieved by

the order of an inferior tribunal except in cases where he has disentitled

himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his own conduct, like

submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or waiver...... The

proposition that the application for Writ must be sought as soon as injury

is cau sed is merely an applica tion of the equitable doctrine that delay

defea t> equity and the longer the injured p er ~ o n sleeps over his rights

Wi thou t any rCilsonilb le excu ~e the cha nces of his success in a Writ

An ,lpplic;ltlnn for a Writ of Ce rtiorari

.~ r. ' " r , ';1' r . : f f " " I I l ... l "'1-'

should be filed within a reasonable time from the date of the Order which

the applican t seeks to have quashed."

In Jayaweera v. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and

another! this Court held as follows:

"the Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a

writ of certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter

of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the

cou rt has a discretion to deny him relief having regard to his conduct;

delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction are all valid impediments

which stand against the grant of relief."

In Seneviratne v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and another), the Supreme Court,

adverting to the question of long dcla y, held as follows:

"I f a person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law

refused afterwards to lend him any assistance to enforce his rights; the law

both to punish his neglect, nom leges vigilontibus, non dormientibus

~ ulJveniunt: and for other reasons refu ses to assist those who sleep over

their rights and are not vigilant."

In Issadeen v. The Commissioner of National Housing and others5

Bandaranayake J, dealing with a belated application for a Writ of Certiorari

held as follows :

"It is however to be noted that delay could defeat equity. Although there

is no statutory provision in this country restricting the time limits in filing

an application for judicial review and the case law of this country is

indicative of the inclination of the Court to be generous in finding 'a good

and valid reason' for allowing late applications, I am of the view that there

should be proper justification given in explaining the delay in filing such

belated applications. In fact, regarding the writ of certiorari, a basic

characteristic of the writ is that there should not be an unjustifiable delay

in applying for the remedy".

The above judgments clearly illustrate two very important matters. The first is

that an application for iI Writ must be filed without delay. The second is that

where there is, on the face of the application, a delay, such delay ~ust be

explained to the satisfaction of Court.

As observed earlie r, 'P13' was executed on 12fh July 2001 whereas this

application had been filed only on 10th March 2004 . Thus, on the face of it,

the re is considerable delay in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court as this

applica tion has been filed almost three years aher the document that is sought

to be qUilshed has been executed .

7

Very interestingly, in paragraph 8 of the petition, the Petitioner had stated as

follows :

"The Petitioner states that in late 2001, several trade unions, which had a

substantial number of members in the employee of the 1" Respondent,

including the Petitioner, became aware that a portion of land within the

Sri Lanka Ports Authority had been leased to the 2nd Respondent."

Thus, on its own admission, the Petitioner was aware by late 2001 of the fact

that the 1 '1 Respondent had leased a land within the Port of Colombo to the 2nd

Respondent. The Petitioner has however offered an explanation for the delay

in paragraph 9 of the petition, where the Petitioner states that the said lease

agreement had been entered into discreetly and that details of the lease were

not available to it. The Petitioner proceeds to state in paragraph 13 of the

petition that, "if the facts behind the grant of the Deed of Lease No. 67 were

made known to it, the Petitioner itself would have filed a similar Application."

Although the Petitioner states so, when this Court reads the rest of the

petition, and more specifically the averments in paragraphs 14-51 of the

petition, it becomes abundantly clear to this Court that the Petitioner had full

knowledge of what was taking place with regard to the execution of the lease

agreement 'P13', at or about the time that the said events took place. How

else can one explain the knowledge on th e part of the Petitioner of the details

given In the petition, which facts have been affirmed to in the affidavit of the

Secretilry and Treasurer of the Petitioner who claims to have p6!rsonal

knowledge of the fa r.t; plt>ilded therein.

8

Furthermore, the Petitioner is a trade union consisting of employees of the 1"

Respondent. It is therefore hard to accept that the Petitioner and its members

were not aware of the details of the said project or the execution of 'P13' or

tha t they had no means of obtaining the relevant details.

Assuming that the Petitioner did not have the detai ls relating to 'P13', the

most reasonable course of action to have been adopted would have been for

the Petitioner to have requested the 1" Respondent for the details of 'P13'.

This Court must observe at this stage that the Petitioner has not adduced any

material to demonstrate that it requested the 1" Respondent to provide any

details relating to 'P13' or that it took any other steps to obtain such material,

nor has the Petitioner averred as to how or when it eventually obtained the

details and materials that enabled it to file this application. This Court is

therefore not satisfied with the explanation offered by the Petitioner.

The issue of delay has been raised by the 2nd Respondent in paragraph 4 of its

statement of objections, while the 1" Respondent has raised the i,ssue of

laches in paragraph 3 (d) of its statement of objections, This Court has

examined the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Petitioner and observes

that except for a bare denial, the Petitioner has not offered any other

explanation in its counter affidavit as to why it did not invoke the jurisdiction

of th is Court soon after the execution of 'P13' .

There are two other rievelopments that took place between the execution of

'P13' and the filinp, of this applic;ltion, which contradicts the explanation

offered by the Pe titioner for the delay The first IS the admission by the

Petitioner thilt the Jathlka Sevaka Sa ngam,1ya, a tracie union registered under

q

the Trade Union Ordinance had filed CA (Writ) Application No. 589/2002 in

March 2002 seeking to quash 'P13, 6. The Petitioner has admitted in paragraph

12 of the petition that the application filed by the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya in

March 2002 was given wide publicity in the media and that the Petitioner

came to learn of the circumstances behind the granting of the Deed of Lease

No. 67 by the 1" Respondent to the 2

nd Respondent in circumstances that were

far from the objects of the 1 <t Respondent. This demonstrates that the

Petitioner could have obtained the relevant details as such details were now in

the public domain . If this be so, why is it that the Petitioner did not invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court soon thereafter? No explanation has been offered by

the Petitioner in this regard.

Even if the explanat ion of the Petitioner that the execution of 'P13' was done

discreetly is accepted, the Petitioner's own admission that wide publicity was

given to the filing of the application by the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya

demonstrates that the Petitioner had knowledge of 'P13', including its terms

and conditions by March 2002. This application has been filed in Mar~h 2004,

which is after a period of almost two years.

This Court is therefore in agreement with the submission of the learned

President's Counsel for the 1'" Respondent that by its own admission, the

Petitioner ought to h;JVe invoked the jurisdiction of this Court at least around

March 2002 .

The second development that took place between the executio n of 'P13' and

the ftllnR of thi'; application, IS th e dllclosure by the Petitioner that two veteran

10

trade union leaders had filed CA (Writ) Application Nos. 937/2003 and

947/ 2003 against the lit and 2nd Respondents to thi s application, seeking the

identical relief.7 It is the submission of the learned President's Counsel for the

1" Respondent that filing of this application seeking relief which is identical to

the relief sought in the said two applications is an abuse of process. While this

Court is of the view that multiple suits in respect of the same matter are best

avoided, without burdening the ju stice system, what is important is the fact

that the Petitioner had knowledge of this issue even in 2003 but chose not to

do anything until March 2004.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner is guilty of

laches and that the explanation offered by the Petitioner cannot be accepted

by this Court. The Petitioner must therefore bear full responsibility for the

delay and the con sequences thereof. This Court is therefore in agreement with

the s<Jid submission of the learned President's Counsel for the lit Respondent

and upholds the sa id objection, with the necessary result being that this

application ought to be dismissed in limine.

The next objection that this Court would like to consider is an objection raised

by the learned President\ Counsel for the 2'''1 Respondent that the Petitioner is

guilty of suppression of material facts.

The suppression that the learned President's Counsel for the 2'''1 Respondent is

referring to IS the felc t tha t in the past the 1;' Respondent has given on lease

several other lilnds ';Ituat ed within the Port of Colombo to other parties. The

1 1

2

nd Respondent has produced a series of such lease agreements, details of

wh ich are given below:

Document Date Extent Lessee Period Lease

Number Rental per

annum

2RS 01.1 2.1987 3R 26.18P Ceylon Grain USD

Company Ltd.

The Petitioner, wh ile not disputing that it has not disclosed such fact, has

submitted that the non-disclosure must relate to a material fact. This Court is

in agreement that the non disclosure or the suppression must be of a material

fact . What is material would however depend on the facts and circumstances

of each case. When one considers the complaint of the Petitioner carefully, it is

clear thilt apart from the vires of the tran saction, the main allegation of the

Petitioner ic, that the t

1 Hesponden t does not have suffi cient space within the

Port of Colombo for Its core activities and therefore leasi ng out land in a

surreptitious rTliln ner caU'ies a severe financial loss to the 1" Respondent. In

this b.lckground . the fact that the 1'1 Respondent has entered into the said

lea<.e ~ 2r eement 'i In the past In respect of land wlth lJ1 the Port of Co lombo is a

12

material fact wh ich the Petitioner ought to have disclosed to this Court. This

Court is also of the view that the Petitioner ought to have explained to this

Court, as part of its obligation to disclose all material facts fully and frankly,

why it did not challenge the previous lease agreements.

It is the view of this Court that the objection relating to suppression too must

be considered in the background of the Petitioner being a trade union of port

employees. This Court has examined the above lease agreements and finds

that the lands referred to therein have been given out for specific projects,

which projects are apparent for everyone to see. An explanation, even if

tendered, that it wa s not aware of such leases cannot thus be accepted.

Once the said objection was taken, the Petitioner had a duty to offer an

explanation in its counter affidavit as to why it did not disclose the above lease

agreements in its petition, which the Petitioner has not done. Even if an

explanation was offered that the execution of several previous agreements

does not make 'P13' legal, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner o~ght to

have made such deciMation, especially in view of the allegation made by the

Respondents that this application has been filed for a collateral purpose and is

a collusive action with the 3'd Respondent, who is a competitor of the 2nd

Respondent with a flour milling com plex within the Harbour of Trincomalee,

and whose subsidiary. Ceylon Grain Elevators Ltd . has already been allocated

land within the Port of Colo mbo . ~

Our Courts have m nslstently held that a party invoking the Writ jurisdict~on of

this (OIJrt muq come With cleiln hands ilnd utmost good faith . In W.S.

1 3

Alphonso Appuhamy vs Hettiarachchi and another9, the Supreme Court held

as follows:

"The necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be

placed before the Court when an application for a writ or injunction is

made and the process of the Court is invoked is laid down in the case of

The King v. The General Commissioners for the Purposes of the Income

Tax Acts for the District of Kensington- Ex-parte Princess Edmond de

Pol ignacIO Although this case deals with a writ of prohibition the

principles enunciated are applicable to all cases of writs or injunctions. In

this case a Divisional Court without dealing with the merits of the case

discharged the rule on the ground that the applicant had suppressed or

misrepresented the facts material to her application. The Court of Appeal

affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court that there had been a

suppression of material facts by the applicant in her affidavit and

therefore it was justified in refusing a writ of prohibition without going

into the merits of the case. In other words, so rigorous is the necessity for

a fu ll and truthful di ~ closure of all material facts that the Court would not

eo into the merits of the application, but will dismiss it without further

examination."

The Supreme Court in Liyanage & another v Ratnasirl, Divisional Secretary,

Gampaha & Others 11 Citing the ca se of Jayasinghe v The National Institute of

Fisheri ~s and Nautical_Engineering (NIFNE) and Others

l} has held as follows:

(I' i !J : . n .1Rfl "]0',1;, , nl uf;' ''r...l~: n:) lon/IiI r ll Q ]71

"The conduct of the petitioner in withholding these material facts from

Court shows a lack of uberrimae fides on the part of the petitioner. When

a litigant makes an application to this Court seeking relief, he enters into a

contractual obl igation with the Court. This contractual relationship

requires the petitioner to disclose all material facts correctly and frankly.

This is a duty cast on any litigant seeking relief from Court.

In Fernando, Conservator General of Forests and two others vs. Timberlake

International Pvt. Ltd. and another13, the Supreme Court, having held that the

conduct of an applicant seeking Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus is of great

relevance because such Writs, being prerogative remedies, are not issued as of

right, and are dependent on the discretion of court, stated as follows:

"It is trite law that any person invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal for obtaining prerogative relief, has a duty to show

uberrimae fides or ultimate good faith, and disclose all material facts to

this Court to enable it to arrive at a correct adjudication on the issues

arising upon th is application."

In the above circumstances, this Court is in agreement with the submission of

the lea rned President's Counsel for the 2

nd Respondent that the Petitioner is

guilty of suppressing a material fact and is of the view that this application

ought to be dismissed In limine.

For purposes of completeness however. thl, Cou rt wou ld like to co nsider the

grievanre of the I'ptlt loncr that th e execu tion of 'P13' is ultra vires the powers

~,f ," r ( ' II 'j r Of I, ,l~r f1 '''In! ,',,,., f 2 ~ . I' t' i.fJlr'

15

of the 1" Respondent. Before embarking on that task, this Court must observe

that it is common knowledge that the establishment of industries within Port

areas takes place not only in Sri Lanka but worldwide and that cement and

flour industries have been in operation within the Ports of Colombo and

Trincomalee for many years prior to 'P13' .14

While the objects of the 1" Respondent have been set out in Section 6 of the

, Act, its powers are 'set out in Section 7, with Section 7(1)(a) of the Act reading

as follows:

"Subject to this Act, the Ports Authority may exercise all or any of the

following powers: to acquire/hold, take on lease, to give on lease, hire,

pledge and sell or otherwise dispose of any movable or immovable

property."

Thus, it is clear to this Court that the l 't Respondent has the power to enter

into lease agreements in respect of lands belonging to the l 't Responde~t, and

this Court is of the view that the decision of the l 't Respondent to execute

'P13' is not ultra vires its powers. The learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court to the provisions of Sections

74 and 7S of the SLPA Act, the relevant portions of which reads as follows:

Section 74: "The Ports Authority may in accordance with such rules as may be

made by the Authority enter into such contracts as are necessary for the

discharge of its functions .... "

- -------

16

Section 75: "Any company or other body of persons may, notwithstanding

anything to the contrary in any written law or instrument relating to its

function s, enter into and perform all such contracts with the Ports Authority as

may be necessary for the exercise of the powers and performance of the

duties of the Authority."

This Court observes further that although Section s 74 and 75 of the Act

empowers the SLPA to enter into contracts as may be necessary for the

exercise of the powers and performance of the duties of the 1'1 Respondent,

Section 7(1)(a) does not impose such a restriction with regard to the power of

the 1'.1 Respondent to give on lease lands belonging to it. It is not the function

of this Court to insert such a requirement to Section 7(1)(a) and impose

artificial fetters on the powers of the 1" Respondent not intended by the

legislature. This Court therefore does not agree with the Petitioner that the

insertion of the word s, "subject to this Act" at the commencement of Section

7(1) means that the aforementioned wording in Sections 74 and 75 would

apply and that a lease agreement can only be entered 'as may be necessary for

the exercise of the powers and performance of the duties of the 1'1

Respondent' .

In the above ci rcum<;tances, this Court does not see ilny legal basis to issue the

Writs of Certiorari ilnd Prohibition prayed for. This application is accordingly

dismissed, without c o ~ts.
