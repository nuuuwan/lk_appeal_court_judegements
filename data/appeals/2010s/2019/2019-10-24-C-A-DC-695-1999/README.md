Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The two plaintiffs filed this action against the two defendants seeking

declaration of title to the land described in the schedule to the plaint,

ejectment of the defendants therefrom, and damages. The

defendants, father and son respectively, filed a joint answer seeking

dismissal of the action. After the trial, the learned District Judge

dismissed the plaintiffs action. Hence this appeal by the plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs claim was based on deeds marked at the trial. However,

the District Judge has not convinced that the transferors of those

deeds had title to transfer such rights based on inheritance.

Conversely, the claim of the defendants was based on prescriptive

possession. The issues raised by the defendants at the trial were based

on prescription. I cannot accept the argument of the learned counsel

for the plaintiffs that Since the 1st defendant not claimed the prescriptive title

by his answer dated 01.10.1975 and the 2nd defendant not relied by the deed of

transfer 2508/1974, defendants claim to prescriptive title failed. It is trite

law that, once the issues are raised, pleadings recede to the

background. By way of issues, both the defendants claimed

prescriptive title to the land in suit.

The plaintiffs in paragraph 10 of the plaint dated 03.07.1975 expressly

state that the defendants are in unlawful possession of the land, which

belongs to them since 1967. The 3rd issue raised by the plaintiffs is

also to that effect. That means, the plaintiffs categorically admit the

defendants (prescriptive) possession since 1967. Why 1967? That is

3

because the plaintiffs deed marked P8 was executed in 1967 (and the

other deed marked P10 was executed in 1971). It is on that basis, the

plaintiffs in the plaint, in my view, state that the defendants are in

unlawful possession of the land from 1967. However, the 1st plaintiff

in evidence has admitted that that even before 1967, the defendants

were in possession of the land.1

One the one hand the plaintiffs have failed to prove paper title to the

land as the right of inheritance has not been established to the

satisfaction of the learned District Judge. On the other hand, the

defendants have established prescriptive title to the land.

Hence I am not inclined to interfere with the conclusion of the

learned District Judge.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
