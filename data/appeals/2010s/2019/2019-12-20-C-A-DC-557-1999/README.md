the 14A and 18A Defendant-Appellants.

the 21A Defendant-Respondent.

Argued on: 09.12.2019

Decided on: 17.12.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 14A and 18A defendant-appellants (appellants) filed this

direct appeal against the order of the learned District Judge of

Kegalle dated 07.07.1999, whereby the proposed scheme of

partition suggested by the Court Commissioner, depicted in plan

marked 21V1, was accepted over the alternative plan tendered

by the appellants marked 14V1.

In the first place, this appeal shall be dismissed in limine,

inasmuch as under section 36A of the Partition Law, No. 21 of

1977, introduced by the Partition (Amendment) Act, No.17 of

1997, no appeal, except by leave of the Court of Appeal first had

and obtained, lies against an order made after the inquiry into

the final scheme of partition.

It is common ground that the impugned order is one such order

made under section 36 of the Partition Law.

Section 36A of the Partition Law reads as follows:

Any person dissatisfied with an order of the Court made

under section 36, may prefer an appeal against such order

to the Court of Appeal, with the leave of the Court of Appeal

first had and obtained.

Without prejudice to the said finding, let me now consider the

merits of the appellants claim.

The Court Commissioners plan marked 21V1 is at page 317 of

the appeal brief. According to that plan, the appellants Lot is

Lot No. 13, and the Lot allotted to the contesting 21A defendant-

respondent (respondent) is Lot No. 14.

According to the report of the Court Commissioner at pages 319-

320 of the appeal brief, the 2nd appellant (18A defendant) has,

pending partition, transferred his rights to the land to the 1st

appellant (14A defendant); and the 1st appellant has, through

his mother Jeen Nona, requested the Court Commissioner to

allot the portions of the two appellants together, including the

wells marked M and N, and the buildings marked O, P,

Q, R (in the plan marked 21V1). The appellants do not

contest the contents of the said report.

The appellants have made the same request, i.e., to include the

wells marked M and N, and the buildings marked O, P,

Q, R to their Lot, to their private surveyor who prepared the

alternative plan marked 14V1, which is at page 351 of the

appeal brief.

The private surveyor in the said alternative plan has suggested

three Lots be given to the appellants Lot 14 separately and

Lots 15 and 16 together.

Lot 13, which lies between Lots 14 and 15, has been suggested

to be given to the respondent. In addition to Lot 13, the

respondent has been given Lot 17, which is depicted in a

separate place in the alternative plan.

The surveyor who prepared the alternative plan at the request of

the first appellant, has stated in his evidence that Lot 17 should

be necessarily given to the respondent as the respondents

buildings are in the said Lot.

The respondents share has been given in two separate places.

So has the appellants share.

In my view, this causes inconvenience to the appellants as well

as the respondent.

The appellants could not have been given the Lot extending up

to the corner of the western boundary of the Commissioners

plan, because the well marked M had to be given to the 1st

appellant, at his request.

At the argument, although the learned Presidents Counsel for

the appellants informed the Court that the appellants do not

want the well marked M, the 1st appellant has, as I said earlier,

informed his surveyor, Mr. Ranatunga, who prepared the

alternative plan, of the necessity to include the well marked M

to his Lot. Vide the evidence of Mr. Ranatunga at pages 201-202

of the appeal brief. In fact, Mr. Ranatunga has given the said

well marked M to the appellants in a separate Lot. This is

because extending the Lot of the appellants up to the western

boundary to include all the plantation to the appellants on the

one hand, and including the said well which lies to the east of

the corpus into that Lot on the other, is not practically possible.

Where improvements have been effected, that portion of the land

on which the improvements stand should, as a general rule, be

allotted, on a partition of the land, to the co-owner who has

made the improvements. Nevertheless, in terms of section 33 of

the Partition Law, that shall be done so far as practicable and

not as an inflexible rule. If such inclusion of all the

improvements renders a fair and equitable division impossible,

the Court can deviate from the general rule. A bona fide

improver, in such circumstances, is not without a remedy. He

can claim compensation as provided in the Partition Law.

Section 33 runs as follows:

The surveyor shall so partition the land that each party

entitled to compensation in respect of improvements

effected thereto or of buildings erected thereon will, if that

party is entitled to a share of the soil, be allotted, so far as

is practicable, that portion of the land which has been so

improved or built upon, as the case may be.

As seen from the Commissioners report, the appellants had not

given any prominence to the plantation when the Commissioner

went to the land to prepare the final scheme of partition.

The main grievance of the appellants, according to the petition of

appeal and the objections filed before the District Court against

confirmation of the Commissioners plan, is the inadequacy of

compensation for their plantation, which has now fallen into Lot

14 in plan 21V1, allotted to the 21A defendant.

However, at the argument, the learned Presidents Counsel for

the appellant stated that the appellants do not contest the

impugned order of the District Court on inadequacy of

compensation. The learned Presidents Counsel did not address

the issue of compensation at all during the course of his

submissions.

The appellants surveyor has not shown any enhanced method

of calculation of compensation payable to the appellants instead

of the one suggested by the Court Commissioner in his report,

which includes the Schedule of Appraisement and Summary of

Distribution. Vide pages 332-346 of the appeal brief.

There is no complaint that the scheme of partition suggested by

the Court Commissioner is in violation of the Interlocutory

Decree.

Given the facts and circumstances of this case, the finding of the

learned District Judge that the Commissioners plan marked

21V1 is more acceptable than the alternative plan tendered by

the appellants marked 14V1, is not unreasonable.
