The Petitioner-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court to have the judgments of the

High Court and the Magistrate's Court dated 10/12/2015 and 03/0112011,

respectively, to be s~t aside, inter alia, on the basis that the Court has disregarded

the fact that the Respondent has not been in possession of the disputed land, 2

months prior to the said dispossession.

The Appellant contends that the learned Magistrate came to an erroneous

conclusion by stating that the Appellant has failed to give an exact date of

3

dispossession, which is a requirement in terms of Section 68(3) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act (Act).

In Mohamed Shareef Nazar v. Asoka Jaya/a/ Karunanayake, (CAl74107

Revision), the Court held that,

"In this respect, it appears that the learned Magistrate has misdirected

himself that it is imperative to reveal the exact date of dispossession.

Having considered the contention of both counsel, I am of the view that

to construe Section 68(3) as requiring the revelation of the exact date of

dispossession leads to absurdity and would render the scheme in part

VII of the PCP A hopelessly meaningless. On a perusal of the documents

and the affidavits, it appears that the Petitioner has revealed the date of

dispossession with reasonable precision and is entitled to be considered

for restoration of possession under Section 68(3). "

The Appellant contends that having decided that the learned Magistrate was

misdirected in law when making the said order, the decision of the learned High

Court Judge to have decided the case under Section 68(1) of the said act is

erroneous.

In Punchi Nona v. Padumasena and others (1994) 2 SLR 117 at page

121, this Court held that,

"Section 68(1) of the Act is concerned with the determination as to who

was in possession of the land on the date of the filing of the information

to Court. Section 68(3) becomes applicable only if the judge can come

to a definite finding that some other party had been forcibly

dispossessed within a period of 2 months next preceding the date on

which the information was filed. "

4

Under Section 68 of the Act "---it shall be the duty of the judge of the

Primary Court holding the inquiry to determine as to who was in possession of the

land or the part on the date of the filling of the information under Section 66 and

make order as to who is entitled to possession of such land or part thereof"

The Respondent contends that the land in dispute called "Hiriliyaddage

Kekunagaha" is a potion of Anaankaragalahena which is a state land, in

possession of his father for well over 40 years and continued to be in possession of

the said land where coconut plants and other crops were grown, identified as the

part marked "X" in the sketch produced by the police officer at the inquiry. The

said contention of the Respondent has been substantiated by affidavits and the

police inquiry report produced before the learned Magistrate.

According to the affidavits submitted by Daslin Wijesekara Niriella,

marked V4 and document marked V6, long term possession by the Respondent to

the land in dispute is clearly established. It is observed that the Appellants have

5

not challenged the said evidence before the police officer mqumng into the

dispute.

In terms of Section 68( 1) of the Act, the learned Magistrate is obliged first

to determine as to who was in possession of the land or the part on the date of

filing of the information under Section 66. According to the facts in evidence,

there is no doubt that it was the Respondent who was in long term possession of

the disputed land and at the date of filing of the information.

In Punch; Nona vs. Padumasena and others (1994) 2 SLR 117, Court held

that, Section 68(1) of the Act is concerned with the determination as to who was in

possession of the land on the date of filing of the information in Court and that

Section 68(3) becomes applicable only if the Judge can come to a definite finding

that some other party had been forcibly dispossessed within a period of 02 months

next preceding the date on which such information was filed.

Therefore, the provision in Section 68(3) of the Act has no application to

the facts of the instant case.

I do not see any illegality in the order given by the learned Magistrate in

deciding this case in terms of Section 68( 1) of the Act to deterinine as to who was

in possession of the land on the date of filing of the information in Court.

,

6

Accordingly, I am of the view that in terms of Section 68(1) of the said Act

the Respondent has established uninterrupted and unchallenged possession to the

land in question at the time of filing the information to Court.

In the circumstances, I have no reason to disagree with the said findings of

the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly, the application is dismissed with costs

fixed at Rs. 10,0001-.
