Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner Divisional Secretary of Kundasale filed this

application in the Magistrates Court of Teldeniya under section 5

of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, No. 7 of 1979, as

amended1, to eject the Respondent from Lots 15 and 16 of the

Preliminary Plan No. 2381 prepared by the Surveyor General2.

The Respondent took up the position that his predecessor in title

became the owner of the land depicted in Plan 8793 prepared by

Surveyor H. Panabokke by virtue of the Decree entered in District

Court Kandy Case No. 6007/L in 19644, and thereafter the

judgment-creditor in that case gifted the land to his children by

Deed No. 5319 in 19655, and they in turn transferred the land by

Deed No. 12149 in 19706 to the Respondent (Jenudeen

Buhardeen); and therefore this is not a State Land, but a Private

Land, from which he cannot be ejected under the said Act.7

As the Respondent, in terms of section 9 of the Act, did not

produce a valid permit or other written authority of the State,

which allows the Respondent to be in possession or occupation of

the land, which, in the opinion of the Petitioner being the

Competent Authority, a State Land8, the learned Magistrate made

the order of ejectment under section 10 of the Act.

Being dissatisfied with that order, the Respondent has filed a

revision application before the High Court of Kandy. The High

Court has set aside the order of the learned Magistrate basically

relying on the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Senanayake v.

Damunupola9, which was a writ application originally filed before

this Court challenging the Quit Notice issued under section 3 of

the Act.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment of the High Court, the

Divisional Secretary has filed this revision application before this

Court.

Let me begin with the following general observation. There is a

difference between (a) challenging the decision of the Competent

Authority under section 3 of the Act by way of a writ of certiorari

and (b) challenging the order of ejectment made by a Magistrate

under section 10 of the Act. As I will explain later, the scope of the

inquiry before the Magistrate is circumscribed strictly to two

8 Vide Act No. 29 of 1983 whereby inter alia section 5(1)(a)(ii) and (iv) of the Principal Act was amended to substitute for the words application is State land, of the words application is in his opinion State land, and application is in unauthorized possession or occupation of the words application is in his opinion in unauthorized possession or occupation, and to make changes accordingly in the Application to be filed in Court in Form B set out in the Schedule to the Act. 9 [1982] 2 Sri LR 621

matters, and he has no jurisdiction to go beyond what has been

mandated by the Act. The Act particularly states that the

Magistrate shall not call for any evidence in support of the

Application, which shall be made in the Form prescribed by the

Act. Hence, in my view, it is unfair by the Magistrate, to set aside

by the Appellate Court, the order of the Magistrate as an erroneous

one on totally different grounds. Then the Act shall be amended to

widen the scope of the inquiry before the Magistrate. In my view, if

the Respondent wants to challenge the decision of the Petitioner

(Competent Authority), that shall be done in a properly constituted

writ application, and not by way of an appeal filed against the

decision of the Magistrate.

Be that as it may, the central issue in this case revolves around

the Judgment in Senanayake v. Damunupola (supra) wherein it

was held that:

The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act was not meant

to obtain possession of land which the State had lost

possession of by encroachment or ouster for a considerable

period of time by ejecting a person in such possession.

Section 3 should not be used by a competent authority to eject

a person who has been found by him to be in possession of a

land where there is doubt whether the State had title or where

the possessor relies on a long period of possession.

Let me first emphasize that a case is only an authority for what it

actually decides in the unique facts and circumstances of that

case. Facts in each case differ and so do the decisions.

5

In Gunaratne Menike v. Jayatilaka Banda10, G. P. S. de Silva, C.J.

remarked:

The principle laid down in a decision must be read and

understood in the light of the nature of the action, and the

facts and circumstances the Court was dealing with.

In Mary Beatrice v. Seneviratne11 Senanayake J. quoted with

approval the following pertinent observation of Lord Halsbury in

the House of Lords case of Quinn v. Leathem.12

[T]hat every judgment must be read as applicable to the

particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the

generality of the expressions which may be found they are not

intended to be expositions of the whole law, but governed and

qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such

expressions are to be found. The other is that a case is only

an authority for what it actually decides. I entirely deny that it

can be quoted for a proposition that may seem to follow

logically from it. Such a mode of reasoning assumes that the

law is necessarily a logical code, whereas every lawyer must

acknowledge that the law is not always logical at all.

Coming back to the main matter under review, I will first deal with

the first part of what was held in Senanayake v. Damunupola.

It was the firm view of the Supreme Court in that case that the

State Lands (Recovery Possession) Act was not meant to obtain

possession of land which the State had lost possession of by

10 [1995] 1 Sri LR 152 at 157 11 [1997] 1 Sri LR 197 at 203 12 [1901] AC 495 at 506

encroachment or ouster for a considerable period of time by ejecting

a person in such possession.13

It was enacted to make provision for the recovery of

possession of State lands as defined in the Act from persons

in unauthorised possession or occupation thereof and matters

connected therewith or incidental thereto. It is clear that this

Act was intended to obtain an order of ejectment from the

Magistrate's Court where the occupation or possession was

unauthorised. Where a person is authorised to occupy or

possess State Land which includes buildings, and where the

authorisation has come to an end or has ceased to be of any

force or effect, his occupation or possession becomes

unauthorised.14

A purposive examination and interpretation of this Law shows

that it was enacted to get back possession of State land which

had been given to a person on a contractual footing and where

there was an obligation to vacate and give up possession or

occupation on the happening of some event as a necessary

consequence.15

Accordingly, the Supreme Court stated that, if a person has

encroached upon a State Land without any permission or

authorization and has continued such possession for a long time,

the State shall resort to Crown Lands Encroachments Ordinance16

and not to the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act as the

13 At page 628 14 At page 627 15 At page 628 16 Chapter 465 of the Legislative Enactments of Ceylon (1956).

7

latter Act is meant to summarily get back possession of State Land

from an overholding licensee. If I may quote the very words used

by the Supreme Court to get back possession of State land which

had been given to a person on a contractual footing17.

The Supreme Court explained that point in this manner:

The Crown Lands Encroachments Ordinance (Chap. 465) as

amended by Act No. 7 of 1954 has clearly provided for

situations of this nature. Section 2 provided that where there

is an alleged encroachment of land where persons who having

entered upon or taken possession of land which belong to the

Crown or which prior to entry or taking possession, was in the

possession of the Crown, information of such encroachment

could be laid before the District Court. The District Court if

satisfied that the persons against whom the information had

been laid had entered upon or taken possession of the land

without the permission of the Government, could make an

order for delivery of possession. This Ordinance has provided

a very summary or speedy procedure to eject such persons.

However, section 7(c) of this Ordinance permitted the rebuttal

of the presumption that the land belongs to the State on proof

inter alia of uninterrupted possession for not less than 30

years. The State had not chosen to proceed under this

Ordinance, to obtain a summary order from the District Court

for delivery of possession of the land on the basis that the

land belonged to the State and had been encroached upon.

The Respondent had decided to proceed under the newly

enacted State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 17 At page 628

8

1979 without considering its applicability or otherwise to the

facts established at the end of his inquiries.18

It is significant to note that, after this Judgment, the legislature

amended the Principal Act to remove any lingering doubts and to

make it clear that encroachment upon State Land is also covered

by unauthorized possession or occupation stated in the Act, which

the Supreme Court thought would not have been the intention of

the legislature. By Act No. 29 of 1983, section 18 of the Principal

Act, which is the interpretation section, was amended to include

the following:

unauthorized possession or occupation except possession or

occupation upon a valid permit or other written authority of

the State granted in accordance with any written law, and

includes possession or occupation by encroachment upon

state land.

Then it is clear that the first part of what was held in Senanayake

v. Damunupola that The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

was not meant to obtain possession of land which the State had lost

possession of by encroachment or ouster for a considerable period of

time by ejecting a person in such possession is no longer binding

as the Law was amended subsequent to the Judgment.

Hence I hold that the learned High Court Judge erred in relying on

Senanayake v. Damunupola to set aside the order of the learned

Magistrate.

18 At pages 626-627

9

This leads me to consider the second part of what was held in

Senanayake v. Damunupola, which is, Section 3 should not be

used by a competent authority to eject a person who has been found

by him to be in possession of a land where there is a doubt whether

the State had title or where the possessor relies on a long period of

possession.

In Senanayake v. Damunupola, there was a serious doubt whether

the said land belonged to the State or whether it had vested in the

Municipal Council of Kandy19, and the learned Deputy Solicitor

General who appeared for the State had conceded that the Plan did

not establish that the Lots in dispute were road reservations or

lands belonging to the State20. The Supreme Court therefore held

that This procedure [laid down in the Act] could not be availed of

where it is not clear that the land in respect of which the right or title

of the State was doubtful or in dispute.21

However, in the present case, there is no doubt, as far as the State

is concerned, that the land in dispute is a State Land.

The Divisional Secretary has tendered a true copy of the Surveyor

Generals Plan No. 2381 and the Tenement List compendiously

marked as P922 to show that Lots 15 and 16 of that Plan, which is

the land described in the Schedule to the application for ejectment,

are State Lands. A true copy of the Surveyor Generals Plan No.

2714 mentioned in Plan No. 2381 with the Tenement List has been

19 At page 626 20 At page 625 21 At page 628 22 Pages 67-68 of the Brief.

10

tendered as P1023. The Petitioner Divisional Secretary has also

tendered to the High Court with his Statement of Objections a

letter sent to the Divisional Secretary by the Senior Superintendent

of Survey to say that upon resurveying the land with the aid of the

old fixations, it was confirmed that Lot 16 in Survey Generals Plan

No. 2381, which is in possession of the Respondent, is a State

Land24.

Section 21 of the Survey Act, No. 17 of 2012, enacts that:

Any cadastral map, plan or any other plan or map prepared in

accordance with the provisions of this act or any written law

purported to be signed by the surveyor general or officer

acting on his behalf and offered in evidence in any suit shall

be received in evidence and shall be taken to be prima facie

proof of the facts stated there in and shall not be necessary to

prove that it was in fact signed by the Surveyor General or an

officer acting on his behalf, nor that it was made by his

authority, nor that the same is accurate until the evidence to

the contrary shall have first been given.

Section 83 of the Evidence Ordinance is to the same effect:

The Court shall presume that maps, plans, or surveys

purporting to be signed by the Surveyor-General or officer

acting on his behalf were duly made by his authority and are

accurate; but maps, plans, or surveys not so signed must be

proved to be accurate.

23 Pages 69-71 of the Brief. 24 Page 40 of the Brief. Lot 15 is described as rock.

11

Conversely, the Respondent has not taken any steps to

superimpose his Plan No. 879 on Lots 15 and 16 in the Surveyor

Generals Plan No. 2381 to convince, whatever it is worth, that the

lands depicted in both Plans are the same.

Hence the direction of the learned High Court Judge that, if the

Divisional Secretary wants to eject the Respondent from the

subject land on the basis that it is a State Land, he shall get the

Surveyor General to survey the land with notice to the Respondent

in order to distinguish the State Land from the Respondents

Private Land, and then file a case in the Magistrates Court under

the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act to eject the

Respondent from the State Land25 is in my view indefensible.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Respondent before this

Court took up three new positions in challenging the order of the

Magistrates Court and defending the Judgment of the High Court.

(a) The Decree entered by the District Court constitutes

written authority of the State

(b) Failure to hold an inquiry by the learned Magistrate

vitiates entire proceedings

(c) Divisional Secretary is not a Competent Authority

I will now deal with them in order.

Section 9 of the Act reads as follows:

25 Vide page 6 of the High Court Judgment at page 122 of the Brief.

12

9(1) At such inquiry the person on whom summons under

section 6 has been served shall not be entitled to contest any

of the matters stated in the application under section 5 except

that such person may establish that he is in possession or

occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other written

authority of the State granted in accordance with any written

law and that such permit or authority is in force and not

revoked or otherwise rendered invalid.

(2) It shall not be competent to the Magistrate's Court to call for

any evidence from the competent authority in support of the

application under section 5.

According to section 9, the only defence the Respondent can take

is that he has a valid permit or other written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law. The learned

Presidents Counsel strenuously submits that the Decree entered

by the District Court of Kandy in Case No. 6007/L in favour of the

Respondents predecessor is a written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law as the District Court

being an institution established by law and thus an authority of the

State exercising the judicial power of the people including

adjudication of disputes.

I regret my inability to agree with that argument. Notwithstanding

the District Courts have been established in accordance with Law,

the Judgments handed down by such Courts cannot be

encapsulated within the meaning of written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law.26

26 Cf. Urban Development Authority v. Wijayaluxmi [2006] 3 Sri LR 62 where a List of Persons selected for allotment of lands by the Divisional Secretary was

13

In any event, there cannot be any dispute that the persons bound

by a Judgment delivered by a District Court in a Land Case are the

parties to the case and their privies. No third parties are bound by

such a Judgment. According to the copy of the Decree tendered

marked X relied upon by the Respondent to claim ownership to the

land27, the litigation had been between two individual private

parties, and the State is not a party to that case. Hence the State

is not bound by that Judgment. Therefore that Judgment cannot

be used to say that the Respondent is the rightful owner of the

land against the State.

The next argument of the learned Presidents Counsel is that, in

terms of sections 8-10 of the Act, it is mandatory for the Magistrate

to fix the matter for the inquiry, and as this has not happened in

this case, the proceedings are a nullity.

In the first place, there was no such application made before the

Magistrates Court asking the matter to formally fix for inquiry in

order to lead oral evidence.

Section 6 of the Act requires the Magistrate to issue summons on

the person named in the application to appear and show cause

why he shall not be ejected from the land in suit. If he fails to

appear, according to section 7, the Court shall forthwith issue an

order of ejectment. According to section 8, if he appears and states

that he has cause to show, the Magistrates Court may proceed

forthwith to hear and determine the matter or may set the case for

inquiry on a later date. At such inquiry, in terms of section 9, only

considered not to be a written authority of the State as contemplated in section 9 of the Act. 27 Page 219 of the Brief.

14

what he can show is that he has a valid permit or other written

authority of the State granted in accordance with any written

law.28 Section 10 explains when the Magistrate can make the

order of ejectment after such inquiry.

Merely because the word inquiry is used in those sections, it is

clear by reading those sections contextually that conducting a full

trial was never the intention of the legislature. If that was the

intention, as stated in section 8, the Magistrate cannot proceed to

hear and determine the matter forthwith. It is not mandatory that

the Magistrate shall fix the matter for the inquiry for oral evidence

to be led. What the Magistrate shall do is to give the person

summoned a fair opportunity to satisfy the Court that he has a

valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in

accordance with any written law. The person so summoned

cannot be allowed to convert it into a full-fledged trial, which will

defeat the intention of the legislature.

As the Supreme Court stated in Senanayake v. Damunupola, The

scope of the State Land (Recovery Possession) Act was to provide a

speedy or summary mode of getting back possession or occupation

of State land as defined in the Act29.

The Respondent in the present case, without any complaint, has

shown cause against an order of ejectment being made by way of

an affidavit supported by documents marked X1-X8. No prejudice

whatsoever has been caused to the Respondent by not fixing the

matter for the inquiry. The inquiry has been disposed of by way of

28 Aravindakumar v. Alwis [2007] 1 Sri LR 316 at 319 29 At page 628. Vide also Muthuvelu v. Dias [2004] 2 Sri LR 335 at 339, Nirmal Paper Converters (Pvt) Ltd v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority [1993] 1 Sri LR 219 at 223, Gunaratne v. Abeysinghe [1988] 1 Sri LR 255 at 262.

15

affidavit evidence, which is entirely in consonance with the scheme

and purpose of the Act. Accordingly, I reject that argument.

The last argument of the learned Presidents Counsel is, in terms of

section 18, competent authority used in relation to any land

means the Government Agent, an Additional Government Agent or

an Assistant Government Agent of the District in which the land is

situated, and therefore the Divisional Secretary Kundasale has no

locus standi to file this application. In terms of the Transfer of

Powers (Divisional Secretaries) Act, No. 58 of 1992, in any Law the

expression Government Agent occurs, it shall be substituted by

Divisional Secretary, and the functions of Government Agents are

required to be exercised by Divisional Secretaries.30 I see no merit

in that argument.

For the aforesaid reasons, the Judgment of the High Court is set

aside and the order of the Magistrates Court is restored. In the

circumstances of this case, no order is made as to costs.
