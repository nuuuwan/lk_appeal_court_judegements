Decided on: 28.01.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The six petitioners filed this application seeking to quash by way

of certiorari the Agrarian Development Officer appointments

given to the 34-38, 40-42, 44-47, 49, 51-53, 55, 58, 59, 61, 62,

67-69, 71-74, 76-80, 82, 83, 86-94, 98, 99, 101-103, 105-107

and 109 respondents (hereinafter the contesting respondents)

by the 1st respondent-Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development; and to compel the 1st respondent by way of

mandamus to appoint the petitioners to the said post.

It is common ground that the petitioners and the said contesting

respondents were employees in the Department of Agrarian

Development/Services at the material time, but the position of

3

the petitioners is that the said respondents were not, according

to the scheme of recruitment marked 33R2, holding

Departmental Posts in the Department of Agrarian Service to

be eligible to be appointed as the Agrarian Development Officers.

By looking at the early journal entries and the proceedings, it is

absolutely clear that the petitioners were about to withdraw the

application upon the 1st respondent agreeing to appoint the

petitioners also as the Agrarian Development Officers as there

were existing vacancies.1 However, it appears to me that, upon

the advice of the State, unfortunately, this undertaking has later

been withdrawn by the 1st respondent.2

The State has filed The statement of objections of the 1-29th, 33rd

and 121st Respondents dated 11.06.2016 to the application of

the petitioners. However, in the body of the said purported

statement of objections, they support the application of the

petitioners and state that grave prejudice has been caused to the

petitioners by the said appointments because the contesting

respondents at the material time belonged to a different Service

known as Development Officers Service, whose appointing

authority is the Director General of Combined Services, and

therefore did not hold Departmental Posts in the Department of

Agrarian Services as required by the Scheme of Recruitment.

But, in the prayer to the statement of objections the said

1 Vide the journal entries dated 02.07.2015, 04.09.2015, 08.10.2015, and the proceedings dated 23.10.2015, 19.11.2015. Also see the motion of the Attorney-at-Law of the petitioners dated 06.10.2015 whereby the Attorney-at-Law has moved to withdraw the application on that undertaking. 2 Vide the motion of the Attorney-at-Law of the 1-3, 30-33 respondents dated 16.11.2015 and the attachment thereto marked X.

4

respondents pray to make an order which is appropriate having

regard to the facts and circumstances of this case!

Notwithstanding these purported objections have been filed by

the State on behalf of 1st-29th, 33rd and 121st Respondents, I do

not find (subject to correction) in the docket a single proxy being

filed by or on behalf of any of those respondents.

Further, in terms of Rule 3(7) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules of 1990, although A statement of objections

containing any averments of fact shall be supported by an

affidavit in support of such averments, only the 33rd respondent-

the Secretary to the Public Service Commission-has filed an

affidavit only on his behalf and not on behalf of himself and the

other respondents.

In the said purported statement of objections and the affidavit of

the 33rd respondent, it has inter alia been accepted that the

appointing authority for the post of Agrarian Development

Officer is the Public Service Commission, and the Public Service

Commission had delegated the power of appointment to the 1st

respondent under Gazette Extraordinary bearing No. 1733/52

dated 25.11.2011.

According to the said statement of objections and the affidavit of

the 33rd respondent, prior to issuing the letters of appointment

to the contesting respondents, the 1st respondent has sought

clarifications both from the Public Service Commission and the

Director General of Combined Services (as there was an

uncertainty) whether the contesting respondents can be

regarded as officers holding Departmental Posts in the

5

Department of Agrarian Services to be accommodated under the

40% category. However, the Public Service Commission has not

replied to that letter but the Director General of Combined

Services has by 33R7 informed the 1st respondent that as the

contesting respondents have not been absorbed to the

Development Officers Service, the positions held by the

contesting respondents in the Department of Agrarian

Development shall be considered as Departmental Posts and

only those to whom letters of appointment had been issued by

the Director General of Combined Services shall be taken as

belonging to the Combined Service.

Then in paragraph 28 of the purported statement of objections,

it is stated that Accordingly, the 1st respondent had based on

this view expressed by an appointing authority to a different

service, issued letters of appointment to the 53 respondents.

This is reiterated by the 33rd respondent in paragraph 31 of his

affidavit. As I stated earlier, the 1st respondent has neither filed

a proxy nor filed an affidavit confirming the fact that he issued

the impugned letters of appointment only based on the view

expressed in 33R7, which he now thinks erroneous. The 33rd

respondent cannot in his affidavit affirm that the 1st respondent

had based on this view expressed by an appointing authority to a

different service, issued letters of appointment to the 53

respondents, which is hearsay. An affidavit cannot contain

hearsay evidence.3 If that is the stern position of the State, I

cannot understand why the State did not take an affidavit from

the 1st respondent to that effect.

Then in paragraphs 30 and 31 of the purported statement of

objections it is stated that:

Since the appointing authority for the post of Agrarian

Development Officer is the PSC, this matter was referred to

the PSC for its views after this application was filed.

The PSC had called for observations from the 121st

respondent (the Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture) and the

1st respondent and had also held discussions with both

Respondents prior to confirming the position that the 53

Respondents did not qualify as Departmental Officers in

terms of clause 7.3.2 and that their appointment by the 1st

Respondent had been made contrary to the applicable SOR.

Is this course of action correct and permissible? I think not.

Firstly, there is no point in getting views from the Public Service

Commission after this application was filed as the case has to

be decided according to the status quo prevailed at the time of

the institution of the action.

In this regard, I must also add that, I fail to understand why the

views of the Director General of Combined Services, whom the

respondents state is the appointing authority of the contesting

respondents4, were not taken in this regard.

It is also significant to note that the petitioners who have taken

extra troubles to make every conceivable party as respondents to

this application, did not make the Director General of Combined

4 Vide paragraph 24 of the purported statement objections, and pages 3, 6 of the written submissions of the petitioners.

7

Services a party to this application despite the petitioners

stating that the said decision/view of the Director General of

Combined Services is wrongful.5

Secondly, and more importantly, according to Article 60 of the

Constitution, once the powers are delegated (such as in this

case), the Public Service Commission shall not, while such

delegation is in force, exercise or perform its functions or duties

in regard to the categories of public officers in respect of which

such delegation was made.

The Public Service Commission cannot sit in judgments on the

decisions made by such officer to whom powers have been so

delegated unless there is an appeal to it by an aggrieved public

officer in respect of an order relating to a promotion, transfer,

dismissal or disciplinary matter (sans appointments).6 The issue

here is regarding appointments, and also there was no such

appeal from the petitioners as aggrieved public officers.

This leads me to consider the valid preliminary objection taken

up by the learned Presidents Counsel for the 86th respondent,

Mr. Weliamuna, that the impugned decision of the 1st

respondent is immune from judicial review under Article 140 of

the Constitution in view of the ouster clause contained in Article

61A of the Constitution, and therefore this Court lacks

jurisdiction to look into the complaint of the petitioners

necessitating to dismiss the application of the petitioners in

limine.

5 Vide page 4 of the written submissions of the petitioners. 6 Vide Article 58 of the Constitution.

8

Article 61A of the Constitution reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions of Article 59 and of Article 126, no

court or tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire

into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call into question

any order or decision made by the [Public Service]

Commission, a Committee, or any public officer, in

pursuance of any power or duty conferred or imposed on

such Commission, or delegated to a Committee or public

officer, under this Chapter or under any other law.

When this objection was stressed during the course of the

argument by the learned Presidents Counsel for the 86th

respondent, the learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for

the respondents remained silent. When the Court insisted that

the Court wishes to know the standpoint of the State in that

regard, the learned Deputy Solicitor General in the limited

written submissions filed on behalf of the 1st to 33rd

Respondents states that these Respondents state that since the

jurisdiction of Your Lordships Court has been ousted by Article

61A, Your Lordships Court has no jurisdiction to determine the

matter. Accordingly, the application of the Petitioners may be

dismissed in limine.

It is the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners that

there is no blanket immunity and the power or duty referred to

in Article 61A shall be lawfully exercised if it is to be protected

by Article 61A. The learned counsel says that according to

Article 57(1) of the Constitution, when delegating powers of the

Public Service Commission, the delegated authority shall

9

exercise such powers subject to such conditions and procedure

as may be determined by the Public Service Commission, and

the decision of the 1st respondent is violative of the Rules 16, 17

and 29 of the Procedural Rules of the Public Service Commission

published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1589/30 dated

20.02.2009.

Rule 16 states that any acts or decisions made in excess of the

limit of delegation shall be null and void. Rule 17 says that the

decisions made by the delegated authority on the instructions or

influence or orders of any one other than the Commission shall

have no effect. Rule 29 states that all appointments in the

public service other than casual and substitute appointments

shall be made in accordance with the service minute or scheme

of recruitment of the respective post.

Assuming that the 1st respondent has exceeded his powers and

acted in violation of the Rules 16, 17 and 29 of the Procedural

Rules of the Public Service Commission, who can look into that

matter and grant reliefs? In terms of Article 61A of the

Constitution, only the Supreme Court in the exercise of the

Fundamental Rights jurisdiction in terms of Article 126 can do

it.

The learned counsel for the petitioners has cited Ratnasiri v.

Ellawela7 and Katugampola v. Commissioner General of Exercise8

to argue that even if a party is duly vested with delegated power

by the Public Service Commission, if the said party proceeds to

act outside the authority given, those acts are not protected by

7 [2004] 2 Sri LR 180 8 [2003] 3 Sri LR 207

10

Article 61A, and therefore this Court has jurisdiction to look into

the matter. I am unable to agree.

In Ratnasiri v. Ellawala (supra) Marsoof J.9 stated:

Our courts have held that Article 55(5) [which was replaced

by Article 61A after the 17th Amendment] would be of no

effect if the order is made by an officer who does not have

legal authority to do so. In such cases our courts have held

that the decision of the relevant authority is null and void

and the preclusive clause in the Constitution is no bar to

review. For instance in Abeywickrema v Pathirana [1986] 1

Sri LR 120 in the context of the alleged termination of

service through acceptance of a letter of resignation, the

Supreme Court observed at page 155 of the judgment that if

the particular officer to whom the letter was addressed had

no legal authority to make an order with respect to it, Article

55(5) did not bar a challenge of the order made by that

officer. In Gunarathna v Chandrananda de Silva [1998] 3

Sri LR 265 where a public officer was sent on compulsory

leave by the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, and the

power to do so was vested in the Public Service Commission

which had not delegated such power to the Secretary to the

Ministry of Defence, the Court of Appeal held that the

purported order of compulsory leave was ultra vires and

could be reviewed by court despite the ouster clause. In

Kotakadeniya v Kodithuwakku and others [2000] 2 Sri LR

175 the Court of Appeal once again held that the ouster of

jurisdiction by Article 55(5) was of no effect to shut out the

9 At 199-200

11

jurisdiction of court to review an order of transfer of a

Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police made by the

Inspector General of Police, as the latter had no power or

authority delegated by the Public Service Commission to

transfer an officer belonging to that rank.

In Katugampola v. Commissioner General of Exercise (supra)

Tilakawardena J.10 stated:

This aforesaid Article 55(5) and 61A of the said amendment

precluded the correctness of a decision being investigated

into upon except by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, which

had sole jurisdiction to inquire into this matter. No claim

has been made in this case by the petitioner to the fact that

the person who made the promotion had no legal authority

to make such decision. In other words, the only grounds

upon which the writ jurisdiction could be sought under

circumstances where a challenge was being made

regarding the promotion (and/or appointment, transfer etc.)

was where the person who made the impugn decision did

not have any legal authority to make such decision.

(Abeywickrema v. Pathirana [1986] 1 Sri LR 120,

Gunaratne v. Chandrananda de Silva [1998] 3 Sri LR 265,

Kotakadeniya v. Kodituwakku [2000] 2 Sri LR 175) In

considering the writ jurisdiction of this Court, it is important

to observe that Article 140 of the Constitution stipulates

that the Court of Appeal may issue writs "subject to the

provisions of the Constitution". Therefore the ouster clauses

contained in ordinary legislation would not effectively

10 At 210-211

12

restrict or preclude the jurisdiction granted by Article 140 of

the Constitution. Nevertheless the restriction contained in

Article 55 (5) and the Amended Article 61 A as these are

ouster clauses stipulated in the Constitution itself, the

powers of this Court would be restricted by these provisions

contained in the Constitution. It was held in the case of

Atapattu v. People's Bank [1997] 1 Sri LR 208,

Bandaranayake v. Weeraratne [1981] 1 Sri LR 10 at 16

that the ouster clauses contained in the Constitution would

bar jurisdiction that has been granted within the

Constitution and would therefore such ouster clause

adverted to above would be a bar to the entertaining of writ

applications to invoke the writ jurisdiction by this Court.

Accordingly, this Court holds that the ouster clause

contained in Article 61 A of the Constitution precludes the

jurisdiction of this Court and grants exclusive jurisdiction to

the Supreme Court to hear and determine all such matters

envisaged within the scope and ambit of such Article. In

these circumstances, the person aggrieved by the decision

would have to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court

to inquire into the matter in terms of Article 126 of the

Constitution as a violation of a fundamental right.

What was decided in those two cases and many other cases11

was that the preclusive clause contained in Article 61A of the

11 Vide also inter alia Chandrasiri v. Attorney General [1989] 1 Sri LR 115, Migultenne v. Attorney General [1996] 1 Sri LR 408, Wijayananda v. Post Master General [2009] 2 Sri LR 318, the recent Judgment of the Supreme Court in Ranasinghe v. Secretary, Ministry of Agricultural Development and Agri Services (SC Appeal 177/2013, SC/CA/SPL/LA/44/2013 decided on 18.07.2018.

13

Constitution is no bar if and only if the impugned order has

been made by a public officer who had no legal authority to

make such a decision.

The complaint of the petitioners is not that the 1st respondent

did not have legal authority to make those impugned

appointments but in doing so the latter exceeded his authority

or acted outside his authority. This they ought to have been

canvassed by invoking the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the

Supreme Court, and not by invoking the writ jurisdiction of this

Court.

I uphold the preliminary objection taken up by the learned

Presidents Counsel for the 86th respondent and dismiss the

application of the petitioner but without costs.
