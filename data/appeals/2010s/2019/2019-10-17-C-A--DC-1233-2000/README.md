This an appeal against the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Galle dated

08.03.2000.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (Plaintiff) by original plaint dated 11.12.1975 [Appeal Brief page 91]

sought to partition the land called "Mahagederawatta" alias "Mahawatte" alias

"Hegodayamullewatte" alias "Gamagewatte" situated at Thalpe Pattuwe in the District of Galle

about six acres in extent.

The Plaintiff pleaded that the original owner of the corpus was one Don Mathes who is said to

have gifted 1/30 share in the corpus the donee of which cannot be ascertained. Don Mathes died

leaving as heirs 8 children who each became entitled to an undivided 29/240 shares in the corpus.

It was further averred that one Thoronis who was one of the children of the deceased Don

Mathes had transferred his 29/240 shares to one Marthenis by deed no. 2459 dated 06.12.1927

and the said 29/240 shares was later purchased by one Pedris upon Fiscal's Conveyance in D.C.

Galle case no. 17808/CR by deed no. 586 dated 16.08.1938. The said Pedris transferred the said

29/240 shares to the Plaintiff by deed no. 201 dated 09.03.1951.

At the conclusion of the trial the learned Additional District Judge of Galle allotted the following

shares to the Plaintiff and 1st Defendant amongst other parties to the action:

Plaintiff - 7015680/58060800

1st Defendant - 6041280/58060800

The 1" Defendant appeals on the following grounds:

(1) No proper identification of corpus

(2) No proper evaluation of the evidence regarding prescriptive right claimed by the 1st

Defendant against the Plaintiff

Page 14 of 20

Identification of Carpus

Section 25(1) of the Partition Law requires the court to examine the title of each party and hear

and receive evidence in support thereof. It has been consistently held that it is the duty of the

Court to examine and investigate title in a partition action, because the judgement is a judgement

in rem. In Gnanapandithen and anather v. Ba/anayagam and another [(1998) 1 Sri.L.R. 391 at

395] G.P.S. De Silva c.J. explained this duty as follows:

"Mr. Samarasekera cited several decisions which have, over the years, emphasized the

paramount duty cast on the court by the statute itself to investigate title. It is unnecessary

to repeat those decisions here. For present purposes it would be sufficient to refer to the

case of Mather v. Thomotharam Pillai (2) decided as far back as 1903, where Layard, CJ.

stated the principle in the following term: - "Now, the question to be decided in a partition

suit is not merely matters between parties which may be decided in a civil action; ...

The court has not only to decide the matters in which the parties are in dispute, but to

safeguard the interests of others who are not parties to the suit, who will be bound by

a decree for partition ... "Layard, CJ. stressed the importance of the duty cast on the

court to satisfy itself "that the plaintiff has made out a title to the land sought to be

partitioned, and that the parties before the court are those solely entitled to such land."

(emphasis added). "

An investigation of title is impossible unless and until the identity ofthe corpus is first established.

It is trite law in partition actions that the trial judge is under a "supervening duty to satisfy itself

as to the identity of the corpus" [Wickremaratne v. A/penis Perera [1986] 1 Sri LR 190 at 199].

This is because "clarity in regard to the identity of the corpus is fundamental to the investigation

of title in a partition case." [Sopinona v. Pitipanaarachchi and two others (2010) 1 SrLL.R. 87 at

105].

The 1st Defendant submitted that the corpus to be partitioned in the present case has not been

correctly and properly identified due to the following reasons:

(i) The plaint identified the corpus to be six acres in extent [Appeal Brief page 96]

Page 15 of 20

(ii) The Preliminary Plan No. 302 marked X identified the corpus as A.3 R.l P. 23.4 [Appeal

Brief page 174]

(iii) In Plan No. 338 prepared by the same surveyor marked Y the extent of the corpus is

identified as A. 3 R. 3 P. 10.2 [Appeal Brief page 173]

(iv) In the Surveyor Report of Preliminary Plan (marked Xl at paragraph 53) the Surveyor

states that it is difficult to decide whether the land surveyed is the land sought to be

partitioned [Appeal Brief page 152]

The 1st Defendant further submitted that even certain boundaries in the plaint and Preliminary

Plan do not tally. In particular the eastern boundary in terms of the plaint is supposed to be

"Madangaha addara owita or madangaha addara" whereas in terms of the Preliminary Plan the

eastern boundary is shown as "Madangaha addara owita or madangaha addara" and "Ambagaha

pittaniya" [Appeal Brief page 174]

The learned counsel for the Substituted 1st Defendant-Appellant (Appellant) relied on the

decisions in Brampy Appuhamy v. Menis Appuhamy (60 N.L.R. 337), Richard and Another v. Seibel

Nona and Others [(2001) 2 SrLL.R. 1] and Sopaya Silva v. Magilin Silva [(1989) 2 SrLL.R. 105].

In Richard and Another v. Seibel Nona and Others (supra) Court accepted as the land to be

partitioned a larger land than the land sought to be partitioned as given in the plaint. It is in this

context that it was held that the Court had failed to decide on the corpus. It was further held that

in the event of any party seeking to have a larger land to be made the subject matter of the

action, Court shall specify the party to the action to file in Court an application for the registration

of the action as a Lis Pendens affecting such larger land and the Court shall proceed with the

action as though it has been instituted in respect of such larger land after taking necessary steps

under sections 16, 17, 18, and 29 of the Partition Act.

In Sopaya Silva v. Magilin Silva (supra) the plaintiff filed plaint to partition a land of 8A 3R 29P in

extent and Lis Pendens was registered in the folios where the deeds for this land were registered.

When the Commission was taken out the surveyor surveyed an extent of 11 AR 1 - P 33. No

contest was raised about the registration of the Lis Pendens. At the trial the contest was resolved

Page 16 of 20

and evidence led accordingly. The learned District Judge dismissed the case holding that the Lis

pendens was wrongly registered. This Court held that:

(1) It was not open to the District Judge to dismiss the case on the point of wrong

registration of the Lis pendens - a point on which there was no contest and no argument

was heard. It is a violation of natural justice.

(2) The Lis pendens being registered in the folios where the deeds of the Sand described

in the plaint were registered was correctly registered.

(3) On receipt of the surveyor's return which disclosed that a substantially larger land

was surveyed the District Judge should have decided on one of the following courses

after hearing the parties:

(i) to reissue the Commission with instructions to survey the land as described to

the plaint. The surveyor could have been examined as provided in section 18(2)

0) the Partition Law to consider the feasibility of this course of action.

(ii) to permit the Plaintiffs to continue the action to partition the larger land as

depicted in the preliminary survey. This course of action involves the amendment

of the plaint and the taking of consequential steps including the registration of a

fresh Its pendens.

(iii) to permit any of the Defendants to seek a partition of the larger land as

depicted to the preliminary survey. This course of action involves an amendment

of the statement of claim of that defendant and the taking of such other steps as

may be necessary in terms of section 19(2) of the Partition Law.

(4) The surveyor under section 18(1){a) (iii) of the Partition Law must in his report state

whether or not the land surveyed by him is substantially the same as the land sought to

be partitioned as described in the schedule to the plaint. Considering the finality and

conclusiveness that attach in terms of s. 48 (1) of the Partition Law to the decree in a

Page 17 of 20

partition action, the Court should insist upon due compliance with this requirement by

the surveyor.

Hence in that case as well the land sought to be partitioned was larger than the land described

in the plaint.

On the contrary in this case while the land described in the plaint was about six acres in extent

the land that was partitioned is A. 3 R. 3 P. 10.2 in extent. Therefore, the facts of this case are

distinguishable from Richard and Anather v. Seibel Nana and Others (supra) and Sopya Silva v.

Magilin Silva (supra).

In Brampy Appuhamy v. Menis Appuhamy (supra) the surveyor surveyed a land of which two

boundaries did not tally with the description of the land given in the schedule to the commission.

It is in this context that court held that the surveyor has not duly executed his commission and

went on to state that where the surveyor is unable to locate the land, he must report that fact to

court and ask for its further directions. Brampy Appuhamy v. Menis Appuhamy (supra) was

decided under the then Partition Act No. 16 of 1951.

In the present case Licensed Surveyor W. Ranasinghe executed two commissions to survey the

corpus. Preliminary Plan No. 302 (X) was prepared after a survey done on 25th and 26th August

1976. That contained three lots of land identified as 'q', 'qo and 'q,' containing a total of A.3 R.

1 P. 23.4 in extent. The second survey took place on 14th March 1977 which resulted in Survey

Plan No. 338 (Y) which contained four lots of land identified as 'q', 'qJ', 'q,' and 'q1' containing a

total of A.3 R. 3 P. 10.2 in extent. The learned Additional District Judge held that the corpus to be

partitioned consists of lots of land identified as 'q', 'qo' and 'q,' in Preliminary Plan No. 302 (X)

and lot 'f11' in Survey Plan No. 338 (Y). It is observed that the Surveyor has in his report of Plan Y

stated that lots 'q', 'qo' and 'q,' in Preliminary Plan No. 302 (X) is the same as lots 'q', 'qo' and

'q,' in Plan No. 338 (Y) [Appeal Brief page 164).

Page 18 of20

It is after the preparation of these two plans that the 1" Defendant filed his answer on 07.11.1977

[Appeal Brief page 100]. There he admits that lots 'q', 'q~' and 'ql' in Survey Plan No. 338 (Y)

should be the corpus in the partition action while claiming that lot 'qt' therein must be excluded

from the corpus.

Nowhere in the answer did the 1" Defendant assert that a larger land should be part of the corpus

sought to be partitioned. In this context section 642 (1) of the Administration of Justice Law No.

25 of 1975 is relevant which states that where a defendant in a partition action avers that the

plan of the land surveyed does not correctly depict the land described in the plaint, he may apply

to the Court to issue a commission to the surveyor to whom the commission for the preliminary

survey was issued to survey the extent of land referred to by that defendant.

Indeed the 1" Defendant did make such an application as a result of which a new commission

was issued to Licensed Surveyor W. Ranasinghe [Appeal Brief pages 154-5]. It directed the

Surveyor to include the land that has been omitted as pOinted out by the 1" Defendant. The

second survey which took place on 14th March 1977 which resulted in Survey Plan No. 338 (Y)

was as a result of this new commission.

But the 1" Defendant did not show the land that was excluded but should now be included. All

what he had pointed out is that lot 'qt' in Survey Plan No. 338 (Y) should be included in the corpus

to be partitioned while lot 'q{ therein should be excluded. Even if that is done the total extent

of the corpus to be partitioned does not increase to six acres as set out in the plaint. Thus the 1"

Defendant has failed to act as required by section 642 (1) of the Administration of Justice Law

No. 25 of 1975.

In fact, before the commencement ofthe trail (proceedings of 03.03.1978, Appeal Brief page 180)

Counsel for the 1" Defendant submitted to Court that only a portion of the land had been shown

to the Surveyor at the time of the preliminary survey. The learned District Judge directed the 1"

Defendant to take steps. But as pOinted out by the learned counsel for the Appellant the 1"

Defendant did not take steps and the case proceeded to trial.

Page 19 of 20

I further observe that no points of contest were raised on the corpus being a smaller portion of

land to that set out in the plaint. It is apposite to also refer to section 642(5) of the Administration

of Justice Law No. 25 of 1975 which states:

"642(5) A discrepancy between the description of the land surveyed and depicted in the

preliminary plan and the description of the land set out in the schedule to the plaint shall

not by itself affect the plaintiff's right to maintain the action."

In fact, points of contest nos. 5 and 6 proposed by the 1st Defendant clearly suggests that the

corpus consists of the four lots depicted in Plan No. 338 (Y).

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that it is not open to the 1st Defendant now to claim that a larger

portion of land should form the corpus sought to be partitioned.

Prescriptive Claim

The 1st Defendant claims that although Marthenis executed deed no. 586 transferring his rights

to Pedris who by deed no. 201 transferred the land to the Plaintiff, the said deeds were not acted

upon and that the 1st defendant was in possession of Marthenis' share. It is on these facts that

the 1st Defendant seeks to establish a prescriptive claim against the Plaintiff.

In Juliana Hamine v. Don Thomas (59 N.loR. 546 at page 548) loW. De Silva AJ. held:

"The paper title being in the 2nd and 3rd defendants, the burden of proving a title by

prescription was on the plaintiff."

I have given careful consideration to the evidence supporting the claim of prescriptive title of the

1st Defendant. I hold that he has failed to establish his claim and that the learned Additional

District Judge was correct in rejecting this claim.

For all the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned

Additional District Judge of Galle dated 08.03.2000.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
