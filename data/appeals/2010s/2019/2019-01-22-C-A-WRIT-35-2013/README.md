Arjuna Obeyesekere, J.

The Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision taken by the 1st and 2nd

Respond~nts to cancel the approved building plan issued to the Petitionerl ,

as reflected in the documents annexed to the petition marked 'Plla' and

'Pllb" --,

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st and 2nd Respondents to

demolish the boundary wall constructed by the Petitioner, as reflected in the

documents annexed to the petition marked 'P14a' and 'P14b';

c) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to grant approval to the

applications submitted by the Petitioner, seeking approval for the boundary

wall erected by the Petitioner.

When this matter was taken up for argument on 19th July 2018, the learned

Counsel appearing for all parties moved that this Court pronounce judgment on

the written submissions that would be tendered by the parties. Accordingly, when

this matter was mentioned on 23rd November 2018 for judgment, this Court

informed the parties that it required clarifications on matters arising from the

written submissions. On 7th December 2018, the learned President's Counsel

appearing for the 1st and 2nd Respondents informed Court that the 1st and 2nd

1 A copy of the approved building plan has been annexed to the petition, marked 'pS' .

3

Respondents are agreeable to withdraw the letter marked 'Plla' in so far as it

relates to the withdrawal of the building permit annexed to the petition marked

'P7'.2 The learned Junior Counsel for the Petitioner informed this Court that since

the filing of this application, the boundary wall erected by the Petitioner has been

partially demolished on an order of the learned Magistrate of Nugegoda. Thus,

while the n~cessity for this Court to adjudicate on the Writs of Certiorari prayed

for may not arise, the only issue that remains for the consideration of this Court is

the Writ of Mandamus' prayed for.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner is the owner of a land situated within the limits of the 2nd

Respondent, Boralesgamuwa Urban Councit having purchased the said land in

January 2005. He states that the survey plan relating to the said land, annexed to

the petition marked 'P3' had been approved in 2004 by the Kesbewa Pradeshiya

Sabha, which was the relevant local authority at that time. The Petitioner states

further that he made an application to the Boralesgamuwa Sub Office of the

Kesbewa Pradeshiya Sabha on 22nd November 2005 seeking approval for the

building plan annexed to the petition marked 'PSI to construct a house on the said

land. By a letter annexed to the petition marked 'P6', the Chairman of the

Kesbewa Pradeshiya Sabha had informed the Petitioner that the building plan

submitted by the Petitioner can be considered once the following conditions are

complied with :

2 The building permit 'P7' sets out the terms and conditions subject to which the building plan 'PS' has been approved.

3. JCa Q)Jdo~ ~(5 ~ (1~r;& ~)(5)Q) g~ .

The Kesbewa Pradeshiya Sabha had granted approval for the said building plan

; 'PS' on 28th June 2006, subject to the conditions set out in the building permit

'P7'.

This Court thus observes that the building plan 'PS' submitted by the Petitioner

and approved by the K~.sbewa Pradeshiya Sabha did not include the construction

of the boundary wall of the house.

The Petitioner states that he commenced construction in March 2008 and had

initially built the foundation of the house. By letter dated lih March 2008

annexed to the petition marked 'PSa', the 2nd Respondent informed the Petitioner

as follows:

By a further letter dated 3rd April 2008 annexed to the petition marked 'pg', the

1st Respondent had informed the Petitioner as follows:

Although the Petitioner had denied that he was engaged in an illegal construction,

the 1st Respondent, by a letter dated 30th April 2008 annexed to the petition

marked 'Plla,3, had informed the Petitioner as follows:

Thus, it is clear to this Court that the dispute between the Petitioner and the 2nd

, Respondent r~volved around the construction of the boundary wall blocking the

drain carrying rain water. The Petitioner's position was that the .disputed part of

the boundary wall was built by connecting two columns which had formed part of

the approved building plan 'PS'. The Petitioner thus submitted that he had

permission to build the disputed part of the boundary wall between the said two

columns.

The position of the 2nd Respondent was that there was a drain situated on the

boundary of the land belonging to the Petitioner and that no construction can be

done on this boundary in a manner that would obstruct the drain and the free

flow of rain water. The 2nd Respondent contended that the construction of the

boundary wall on the said drain was therefore illegal. The 2nd Respondent stated

further that the 2nd Respondent has not granted approval to the Petitioner to

construct a boundary wall around his premises. The Petitioner has however

disputed this assertion of the 2nd Respondent that there was a drain on the land.

The 2nd Respondent has also submitted that the previous owner of the said land

had given an undertaking that she has no objection to the disposal of rain water

of a neighbour through an underground drain running alongside the land now

owned by the Petitioner. This Court observes that the existence of a drain either

alongside or beneath the Petitioner's land is disputed between the parties and, as

7

this Court cannot go into disputed questions of fact, this Court cannot make any

determination with regard to the existence of a drain or on the legality of the

construction of the boundary wall.

The Petitioner states that in February 2009, he had submitted an application

seeking approval for the said boundary wall, but that the 2nd Respondent, by

letter dated 30th March 2009 annexed to the petition marked 'P13', had refused

to approve the said plan, for the following reasons:

"e)z;S d@c.o ~z;cx.o> qOOo fIl)o65 >6 mldoc.o qes>~ ~Pk)tD ~fIl)O qz;lD

~z;e)65, >6 m>doc.o" ~ej q~z;lDc.o Q@fIl ~z;@c.o ~es>>eDz:e ~oo 2009/03/24 ~es>

oz;e)lD Qz;@g cng~e)~ lDo!i'rlco ~e) ~C3eS ~65e) SD."

Bya letter dated 31st March 2009, annexed to the petition marked 'P14a,4, the 1st

Respondent had informed the Petitioner that legal action would be taken against

the Petitioner unless the illegal construction of the boundary wall was stopped

and the illegal construction was removed.

The 2nd Respondent had thereafter filed action in the Magistrate's Court of

NugegodaS seeking to demolish the illegal construction and by an order delivered

on 26th November 2010, the learned Magistrate had granted the application of

the 2nd Respondent. It was submitted by the Petitioner that the order of the

learned Magistrate was executed on 23rd October 2014 and that the boundary

4 It is observed that the letter dated 30

th April 2009, annexed to the petition 'P14b' is identical to the letter marked 'P14a',

5 Case No, 12162,

wall had been demolished. In these circumstances, this Court observes that the

necessity for this Court to consider the granting of a Writ of Certiorari sought by

the Petitioner to quash 'P14a' does not arise as the boundary wall has already

been demolished.

The Petitioner has complained to this Court that the cancellation of the whole of

the building plan 'PS' on the basis that a boundary wall had been built on the

drain is illegal and arbitrary. It appears to this Court that the building permit 'P7'

can only be cancelled if there is a violation of the terms and conditions thereof.

Although it was contended on behalf of the Respondents that the obstruction of

the drain by the construction of the boundary wall thereon is in violation of

Clause 76 of the building permit 'P7', it does not appear that condition No.7 of

'P7' deals with the situation that has arisen. Clause 7 is limited to the disposal of

rain water, waste etc that is collected on the premises and cannot be extended to

the rain water coming down the road. However, in view of the undertaking given

by the learned President's Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Respondents that 'Plla' will

be withdrawn, the necessity for this Court to consider the legality of 'Plla' and

'Pllb' does not arise.

After the order of the learned Magistrate was delivered, the Petitioner had made

an application on 2ih December 2011 annexed to the petition marked 'P29'

seeking approval to construct a boundary wall. It appears to this Court that the

2nd Respondent had not processed this application, inspite of reminders by the 3rd

Respondent to act in terms of the law.

6 Condition No. 7 of 'P7' reads as follows: "~lS d@c:l, ~~ d@c:l, ~i;!l ~~ ~! ~t c:.~~ ~~ ~~eD

I!CS Cll~re <!@Q ~cS ~<! QcuQ~"'Cll ~~ 8S~@rm !:feB Cll~ g~ ."

9

The Petitioner has therefore sought a Writ of Mandamus directing the

Respondents to grant approval to the said application submitted by the

Petitioner7, seeking approval of the 2nd Respondent to construct the boundary

wall. As observed earlier, the boundary wall has been demolished by an Order of

the learned Magistrate after the filing of this application and hence, the question

of this Court directing the 2nd Respondent to approve an illegal construction as

well as a wall that does not exist anymore, does not arise. For this reason, this

Court does not see any legal basis to issue the Writ of Mandamus prayed -for by

the Petitioner. However, the Petitioner is entitled to make a fresh application to

the 2nd Respondent seeking approval to construct a boundary wall in accordance

with the law.

For the reasons set out in this judgment, this Court formally issues a Writ of

Certiorari quashing the decision reflected in 'Plla' and 'Pllb' cancelling the

approval granted to the building permit IPS'. For the avoidance of doubt, this

Court wishes to emphasise that it is not interfering with the observations in the

said letters with regard to the obstruction to the drain. This Court makes no order

with regard to costs.
