o I. 1st and the 2nd Accused Appellants (Appellants) were charged with another

three accused in the High Court of Matara for the offence of murder. At the

end of the prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge acting in terms of

section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, acquitted the other 3

accused and after conclusion of the defence case, found the Accused

Appellants guilty of murder as charged, and sentenced them to death on

13.02.2004. In appeal, Court of Appeal set aside the said conviction and

ordered trail de novo. After the fresh trial was conducted against the two

Appellants, the learned High Court Judge delivering the Judgment on

2

16.09.20 IS, convicted both Appellants and sentenced them to death. The

instant appeal is against the said judgment of the learned High Court Judge

Matara, dated 16.09.2015. Appellants have urged the following grounds of

appeal;

01. The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by failure to

judicially evaluate contradictions marked by the defence in the proper

context, which cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case with

regard to the credibility of the purported solitary eyewitness, and

thereby the conviction is bad in Law.

02. Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by failure to apply the

established legal principles to evaluate the testimony of the solitary

eyewitness, that was not a sterling quality but full of contradictions,

which should not have been acted upon to convict the Accused

Appellant for a capital punishment charge, and thereby caused

miscarriage of justice.

03. Learned High court Judge completely misdirected himself by failure

to evaluate the police evidence, which is completely in conflict with

the police testimony and the documentary evidence marked before the

court, and it clearly cast a doubt on the integrity of the police

investigation, and thereby the conviction is bad in Law.

04. Learned High court Judge misdirected himself by failure to consider

the defects in the police investigation, since the integrity of the police

officers were assailed by the Accused Appellants and the accusations

are well founded on the face of the record if duly observed by the

Learned High Court Judge, and thereby caused a miscarriage of

Justice.

3

05. Learned High court Judge misdirected by accepting the police version

as true while rejecting the defence version, when there is visible

conflict of evidence on the face of the record, and thereby the

prosecution has failed to establish the case beyond reasonable doubt.

06. Learned High court Judge misdirected himself by failure to consider

that the prosecution star witness was not corroborated by any

evidence, except for the false police evidence which is clear from the

record it self, and thereby the conviction is bad in Law.

07. Learned High court Judge misdirected himself by ignoring the

contradiction on the basis that, those were made by typographical

mistakes by the recorders, is not the legal mean to assess and evaluate

the contradictions, when a prosecuting counsel is well within the law

to correct if those were typographical errors or any other before

reaching the judgment of the case, and thereby failure to have a legal

approach on deciding the defects of the record caused miscarriage of

justice.

02. Prosecution heavily relies on the evidence of the sole eye witness Nagodage

Priyantha (PW I). According to his evidence, he had gone to his brother's

(deceased) house with his family that evening. Deceased had wanted him to

stay back to dinner. I-Ie then had accompanied the deceased to the boutique

close by to buy ' papadam' . While the deceased had bought 'papadam', he

had bought a cigarette. According to him, as he did not want the deceased to

see him smoking, he had been following the deceased. The distance between

him and the deceased had been about 45 feet. Time had been around 6.10

p.m. When he tried to unlock his push bicycle, he had heard the deceased

shouting' q8 G'''' @O 8lG'''';d' q <5'lZS)i)J '. When he looked that side, he had

4

seen the 2nd Appellant holding the deceased from the neck, and the 1

51

Appellant stabbing the deceased once. He said that the lighting at that time

was not very good, but he identified the Appellants. Then the Appellants had

run away.

03. He had gone and held the deceased. He had shouted for his father. Then the

father had come. When he wanted his father to get a vehicle, his father had

told him that, three sons of the 2nd Appellant is not letting him go. Later he,

with his father and one Nishantha, had taken the deceased to the hospital,

where the deceased was pronounced dead.

04. Counsel for the Appellants submitted that, the testimony of the sole eye

witness Priyantha is not credible and should not be relied upon. The learned

Trial judge although has considered the contradictions marked in the

evidence, the reasons for relying on his evidence cannot be accepted.

05. It is the contention of the counsel for the Respondent that, the learned Trial

Judge has considered the evidence properly and given reasons for accepting

the same. Counsel further submitted that, no contradictions were marked

between the evidence given in this trial and the previous trial, but only on

the police statement and this trial. There was no reason for the witness

Priyantha to implicate the Appellants, as he did not have any enmity with

the Appellants.

06. Evidence of a sole eye witness has to be given careful consideration. If the

evidence of the sole eye witness is found to be credible, Court can convict

an accused on the testimony of the single eye witness. However, on his

5

evidence, if the Court finds that his presence at the crime scene is doubtful,

or if it is doubtful that he has seen the crime being committed, and then it is

unsafe to record a conviction based on the testimony of such a solitary eye

witness.

07. [n case of Wijepa/a V. AG /2001} J Sri L.R. 46 al page 57 Ismail J. said;

'Senaralne who was the sole eye witness has thus been cross

examined on vital aspects relating to the incident, and doubt has been

raised in regard to his presence at the scene . ... Evidence of a single

witness, if cogent and impressive, can be acted upon by a Court, but,

whenever there are circumstances with suspicion in the testimony of

such witness, then corroboration may be necessary. ,

08. No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof

of any fact, and therefore, it is permissible for a court to record and sustain a

conviction on the evidence of a solitary eye witness. But, at the same time,

such a course can be adopted only if the evidence tendered by such witness

is cogent, reliable and in tune with probabilities and inspires implicit

confidence. By this standard, when the prosecution case rests mainly on the

sole testimony of an eye witness, it should be wholly reliable. (Joseph V.

State of Kera/a, /2003/1 SCC 465).

[n line of above case law precedents, the testimony of PW I, who is the

brother of the deceased in the instant case, has to be subjected to deeper

scrutiny.

09. There were six contradictions marked in the evidence of PW I. Contradiction

V I is where PWI in his statement to the police had said that, the 2nd

Appellant stabbed with a pole. There is no evidence to the effect that, any of

6

the Appellants were carrying a pole. It is obvious that, it may well be a

mistake of the stenographer, although it had escaped the mind of the State

Counsel to bring it to the notice of the Court, even at the time of the final

submissions were made. The evidence of the PW I was that, the 2nd

Appellant held the deceased.

10. Contradictions V3 and V4, in my view, would not go to the root of the case.

However, contradictions V4, V5 and V6 would affect the credibility of the

witness. V5 and V6 are connected to each other, and can be considered

together. The incident had taken place on 14th April 2000. PWI had made a

statement to the police on the same day at II p.m. Following day, on the

15th, PWI had given evidence at the inquest before the learned Magistrate.

In his statement to the police, PW I had clearly stated that, after the

Appellants stabbed the deceased, 3'd,4th and 5th Accused who were the sons

of the 2nd Appellant, had come running to the 2nd Appellant and asked

':5lJ2siGzsi, 8,G~ wB~?'. Then they had gone towards their house. PWI denied

stating so to the police. PW I in his evidence, while denying stating that to

the police, said that, he did not see anyone other than the Appellants. When

he was questioned about what he had told the police, to circumvent the

situation, he said that he heard the 3,d, 4th and the 6th accused asking the 2nd

Appellant, but did not see them. When the portion of his statement was read

to him, he again changing his earlier position and said that, he cannot

remember whether he said that to the police. Again, he denied telling that to

the police.

II. It is obvious that, he did not see the 3''', 4 th, and 5th Accused, but had told the

police as if he saw them, to implicate them. The learned Trial Judge has

failed to appreciate that, and in his judgment has said that, the counsel for

7

the Appellants had not allowed the witness to answer, when it was obvious

that PW I had tried to implicate the 3 rd, 4th and 5th accused by telling the

police that they were there, which is far from the truth. Even in re-

examination, the State Counsel had not even attempted to clarifY the

position. Therefore, PW I is not a credible witness, on whose evidence alone

it is unsafe to convict the Appellants. Recovery of a knife in tenns of section

27 of the Evidence Ordinance from the 151 Appellant, cannot be considered

as sufficient corroboration to convict the Appellants on the charge.

12. The best person to corroborate the evidence ofPWI is his father, who came

immediately to the scene. PW I in his evidence also said that, the sons of 2nd

Appellant had prevented his father from getting a vehicle to take the injured

to the hospital. However, Court on 03.12.2012, had released the father of

PW I, who was PW2, on the request of the prosecution, that they would not

call him.

13. In case of The Queen V. V.P.Julis 65 NLR 505, Court discussed the

applicability of the maxim 'falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus '. It was also

followed in case of San!araweera V. AG 11990/ 1 Sri L.R. 256. Court held

in 'Julis' that, in applying the maxim, it must be remembered that, all

falsehood is not deliberate. Errors of memory, faulty observation or lack of

skill in observation upon any point or points, exaggeration, or mere

embroidery or embellishment, must be distinguished from deliberate

falsehood. Nor does it apply to cases of conflict of testimony on the same

point between different witnesses.

14. Court further said; ' The maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus', is not an

absolute rule which has to be applied without exception in every case, where

a witness is shown to have given false evidence on a material point. But

8

when such evidence is given by a witness, the question whether other

portions of his evidence can be accepted as true, should not be resolved in

his favour, unless there is some compelling reasonfor doing so . ... "

I S. In the instant case as r said before, PW I had given a false statement to the

police to implicate 3rd, 4t", and st" Accused. He denied giving such statement

to the police. Further, I do not find any compelling reason to accept his

evidence on other points, when he had clearly tried to falsely implicate some

of the family members of the 2nd Appellant. Therefore, it is unsafe to convict

the Appellant on the sole evidence of PW I, who is an unreliable witness.

Hence, I find that the grounds of appeal I, 2, and 6 have merit.

Appeal allowed.

1st and the 2nd Appellants acquitted of the charge.
