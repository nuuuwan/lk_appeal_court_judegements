Decided on: 21.03.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner, according to the petition, had been in possession

of the State land relevant to this case, i.e. Lot 2997 in Step (iii)

in Nuwaragampalatha East, Anuradhapura, with a permanent

house constructed in it, until she was unlawfully dispossessed

by the deceased husband of the 4th respondent in 1999. She

says that this dispossession took place when she was

hospitalized after a motor traffic accident on 06.07.1999.

Thereafter several inquiries have unsuccessfully been held by

the 2nd respondent Provincial Land Commissioner to settle the

matter between the petitioner and the deceased husband of the

4th respondentvide inter alia P10, P12. Then the petitioner has

complained to the 1st respondent the Commissioner General of

Lands, who, after an inquiry, has, by P16 dated 12.01.2012,

decided to divide the land into two20 perches eachand give

the land to both of them. The petitioner has filed this

application on 08.01.2016 about 4 years after the said decision

seeking to quash P16 by way of writ of certiorari and to compel

the 1st-3rd respondents to issue a Permit in respect of the entire

land by way of writ of mandamus.

The petitioner, in my view, does not tell the truth regarding her

assertion on unlawful dispossession. According to her, she

had been living on the land (with her family) when she met with

an accident on 06.07.1999. According to the Diagnosis Card

marked P6, she had been hospitalized only for two days, i.e.

from 06.07.1999-08.07.1999. If the deceased husband of the 4th

respondent forcibly entered into the possession of the land as

the petitioner now says, she would have definitely complained it

to the police and thereafter the police would have filed a Section

3

66 Application under the Primary Courts Procedure Act if they

could not have settled the dispute. There is no police complaint

up to now.

Even though the petitioner alleges to have been dispossessed in

1999, she has written to the 2nd respondent Provincial Land

Commissioner and the 3rd respondent Divisional Secretary more

than 10 years after the alleged dispossessionvide P7-P9 dated

05.08.2009 and 07.07.2010. If she was unlawfully

dispossessed, would she have waited for 10 long years?

More importantly, even in P7-P9, she does not talk a word about

unlawful dispossession by the late husband of the 4th

respondent. In P7 and P8 she says that during the time she was

ill, it had been given to somebody else to look after, but they

stake a claim to the land; and in P9 she says that one

Chandrakanthi Kelegama is living in the premises with her

family as tenants.

It is the position of the 4th respondent that they came into

possession of the land in 1999 not unlawfully but peacefully

upon payment of money to the petitioners husbandvide

paragraph 4 of P14 and P17.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, that version is more

probable than that of the petitioner.

If the petitioner had not been truthful to the Court, she is not

entitled to succeed even if there are some matters favourable to

her. Writ is a discretionary relief. The party seeking a

discretionary relief shall act in uberrima fides and come to Court

with clean hands.

The petitioner has participated in the Land Katchcheri held in

1998 to regularize the unauthorized occupants of the State

Landsvide P11. However she (together with her husband) has

thereafter in 1999 surrendered possession to the 4th respondent

(and her late husband).

The petitioner cannot, in the facts and circumstances of this

case, base his case on P11 and P13 on the ground of Legitimate

Expectation. In any event, the decision of the 1st respondent

Commissioner General of Lands in P16 supersedes any other

earlier findings. P16 decision was made by the Commissioner

General of Lands upon the complaint made to the Commissioner

General by the petitioner herself by P15B. There exists no

statutory duty on the part of the Commissioner General to grant

a Permit to the petitioner in respect of the entire land, which the

former has withheld to perform unreasonably. Hence

mandamus cannot be issued to that effect.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed. No costs.
