A.H.M.D. Nawaz,j.

Murshid Maharoof with F.A. Mohamed for the

Plaintiff~ Appellant

Sobitha Rajakaruna DSG for the rt, 2nd and 3rd

Defendant~ Respondents

31.08.2018

The Plaintiff~Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff") instituted

this action against the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and the 4th Defendant seeking damages jointly and

severally in a sum of Rs.2S0,000/~ for alleged damage caused to his lorry bearing No.42

Sri 7326 on 21.01.1993. The plaint dated 14th December 1993 averred, inter alia the

following:

On the day in question his lorry which had been let on a contract of hire was

transporting Albizzia logs belonging to one Senaratne. Upon a suspicion of an illegal

transportation of timber, the vehicle was stopped at Elkaduwa junction and those in the

lorry were taken into custody and the driver of the lorry was ordered to drive the lorry all

the way to the Elkaduwa police post. What happened at the police post becomes

material for the resolution of the issues in the case. The plaint further averred that the

driver of the lorry was ordered to stop the vehicle opposite the Elkaduwa police post and

thereafter the driver and the others were summoned inside the police post for

questioning.

It was at this stage that the 4th Defendant~Respondent who was on duty providing

security at the police post moved the lorry and as he drove the vehicle negligently, it ran

down a precipice and the lorry was destroyed. The District Court of Matale held the 4th

Defendant~Respondent liable, whilst declaring that 1st Defendant (Attorney~General),

2nd Defendant (LP. Sumanadaasa) and 3rd Defendant (P.C. Sarath Wijeratne) had no

3

vicarious liability. So the issue before this Court is whether the 4th Defendant acted

within the scope of his employment or he had acted outside. The Court has held that he

had acted outside the scope of his employment and therefore the 4th Defendant alone was

liable. It is against this finding that the Plaintiff~Appellant has appealed.

The evidence led in the case has to be evaluated in order to ascertain whether the finding

of the learned District Judge reached the right decision on vicarious liability.

A servant is said to have acted in the course of his employment in the following cases:~

1. When he does a wrongful act authorized by the master, e.g., if a master engages a

servant to assault a man, the master must be liable for the act committed by the

servant.

2. When the servant does in a wrongful and unauthorized manner an act authorized

by his master.

"In every case where it is sought to make the master liable for the conduct of his servant,

the first question is to see whether the servant was liable. If the answer is 'yes', the

second question is to see whether the employer must shoulder the servant's liability". Per

Lord Denning M.R. in Young v. Edward Box & Co. Ltdl

On the question of 'in the course of employment' the test set out by Sir John Salmond in

his textbook on tort has been commonly used by the Courts:~

"It is clear that the master is responSible for the acts actually authorised by him; for liability

would exist in this case, even if the relation between the parties was merely one of agency, and not

one of service at all. But a master, as opposed to an employer of an independent contractor, is

liable even for acts which he has not authorised, provided that they are so connected with acts

which he has authorised that they may rightly be regarded as modes ~ although improper modes ~

of doing them. .. 'On the other hand if the unauthorised and wrongful act of the servant is not so

connected with the authorised act as to be a mode of doing it, but is an independent act, the master

1(1951) 1 T.L.R. p. 789 at p. 793 4

is not responsible; for in such a case, the servant is not acting in the course of his employment, but

he has gone outside of it. As is often the case, the principle is easy to state but difficult to apply".2

A master becomes liable for the acts done by a servant, only in the event the servant

acted "in the course of his employment" or "within the scope of his employment". The

question whether the servant was acting within the scope of his authority is in every

case a question of fact-see Marsh v. Moores. 3 The dividing line which separates the acts

which fall within the scope of the servant's authority from those which fall outside is

never rigid; it is flexible and has to be decided having regard to all the facts and

circumstances of each case.

The basis of liability of a master appears to be the same in English law. Watermeyer c.].

in the case of Feldman (Pty) Ltd v. MaU,4 pointed out that, " ..... the expression" scope of

employment" is apt to be misleading, unless one is alive to the fact that the words "scope

of employment" are not equivalent to "scope of authority". One is apt, when using the

expression "scope of employment" in relation to the work of a servant, to picture to

oneself a particular task or understanding or piece of work assigned to a servant, which

is limited in scope by the express instructions of the master, and to think that all acts

done by the servant outside of or contrary to master's instructions are outside the scope

of his employment: but such a conception of the meaning of "scope of employment" is too

narrow. Instructions vary in character, some may define the work to be done by the

servant, others may prescribe the manner in which it is to be accomplished: some may

even indicate the end to be attained and others the means by which it is to be attained.

Provided the servant is doing his master's work or pursuing his master's ends he is acting

within the scope of his employment even if he disobeys his master's instructions as to the

manner of doing the work or as to the means by which the end is to be attained .....

Consequently, a servant can act in disobedience of his master's instructions and yet

render his master liable for his acts".

41945 S.A.L.R. (A.D.) 733 5

During the examination in chief of the 4th Defendant, there is evidence that because the

driver of the lorry who gave him the key prior to his moving the lorry. This shows that no

superior officers who were present at the time commanded him to move the lorry. The

unassailed testimony of the 4th Defendant was that the key was never handed over to him

by any of the officers who were on duty at the time of the occurrence of the incident.

In the course of the formal evidence given by an Assistant Superintendent of Police

Sumana Bandara, he marked in evidence an out,of,court statement made to him by the

4th Defendant. This out,of,court statement had been recorded for the purpose of holding

a disciplinary inquiry against the 4th Defendant. The officer who recorded the out of

court statement made by the 4th Defendant was himself giving evidence of what he heard

from the 4th Defendant about the incident and the statement clearly demonstrates that

the 4th Defendant acted on his own in taking the driver's seat and moving the lorry before

it went down the precipice'see the statement marked as IV2. This is a comprehensive

statement in which the 4th Defendant describes as to how he wanted the lorry to be

shifted to a location where the lorry would not obstruct anyone. When he embarked on

that exercise, he felt that the lorry had no brakes and he shouted out for the driver

whereupon the driver too got into the driver's seat and tried to stop the lorry which had

begun its downward slide.

Thus this statement contains a slew of admissions which are admissible against the 4th

Defendant under Sections 17(1), 18(1) and 21 of the Evidence Ordinance. These

admissions are no doubt capable of being rebutted by the maker of the admissions in

terms of Section 31 of the Evidence Ordinance which states that admissions are not

conclusive proof of the matter is admitted, but they may operate as estoppels under the

provisions hereinafter contained. The expression "the provisions hereinafter contained" will

include Section 115 of the Evidence Ordinance. If the admissions are not rebutted by

contrary evidence, needless to say they become conclusive proof. So when there is no

rebuttal of the fact of taking over the vehicle and moving it when the precipice is close at

hand, the negligence of the 4th Defendant is conclusive. There is evidence on the record

6

..

that the 4th Defendant was only authorised to guard the police post. Upon his own

admissions in his extra curial statement, it is quite clear that he had undertaken the

activity of getting into a lorry and driving it, maybe for a laudable objective of parking it

at a safe haven without the lorry becoming an obstruction, but needless to say, he could

have accomplished this task by requesting the driver of the lorry to perform this activity.

The above would not fall within Salmon's test in order to render the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Defendants liable. Salmon's test is to the effect that a master, 'is liable even for acts which

he has not authorised, provided they are so connected with acts which he has authorised,

that they rightly be regarded as modes, though improper modes,of doing them'. In my

view the close connection test as evidenced by cases such as lister v .Hessey Half would

not render the t\ 2nd and 3rd Defendants in this case vicariously liable for the act of the

4th Defendant, when he had gone too far to be acting in the course of his employment in

having driven a lorry too close to a precipice.

There is also the unchallenged evidence of Police Inspector Karunaratne of Matale Police

that the principal duty of the 4th Defendant was to provide security to the police post.

The act of the 4th Defendant in driving the lorry was entirely unlawful and this unlawful

act could hardly come within the scope of his employment. There is evidence that the 4th

Defendant kept aside his weapon before he got into the lorry to drive it. This activity is

prohibited by the regulation of the Sri Lanka Police Rules. According to the Regulation

of the Sri Lanka Police Rules, a weapon could be kept aside only during lunch hour or in

illnesses and it is mandatory to record such movement in the record books. This evidence

remains uncontradicted and unchallenged.

Thus it is clear that the 4th Defendant was in breach of his obligations under the Police

Regulations and the 1S\ 2nd and 3rd Defendant'Respondents could not be in pari delicto

with the 4th Defendant on that score.

In the circumstances I find that the judgment of the learned District Judge dated 24th

July 2000 cannot be faulted for taking the view that the tt to 3rd Defendant'Respondents

5(2002) 1 AC 215. 7

.

were not vicariously liable for the act of the 4th Defendant. So I would affirm the said

judgment and proceed to dismiss the Appeal of the Plaintiff~Appellant.
