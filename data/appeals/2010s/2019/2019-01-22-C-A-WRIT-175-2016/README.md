Counsel: Nagananda Kodituwakku for the Petitioner.

Respondents.

Decided on: 16.01.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner imported a consignment of Ayurvedic products

including Thalsukiri (Palm Sugar) in March 2016. Admittedly,

he did not misdescribe the goods in terms of quantity,

description, value etc. in the Cusdec1 and Commercial Invoices

presented for the Customs for the purpose of clearing the

goods.2 Nevertheless, he was imposed a penalty (as opposed to a

payment of a levy) in a sum of Rs.2.5 million under section 47 of

the Customs Ordinance, No. 17 of 1869, as amended, because,

according to the 1st and 3rd respondents, the petitioner, in order

to avoid payment of cess (tax) imposed on commodities under

HS Code3 17029090, which is the correct HS Code for

Thalsukiri, fraudulently declared an incorrect HS Code, i.e.

17022000, in the Cusdec. The petitioner filed this application

seeking to quash the said order of the 2nd respondent marked P4

by way of certiorari and to compel the 1st and/or the 2nd

respondent to refund the said amount so recovered.

It is noteworthy that notwithstanding the impugned order

sought to be quashed was admittedly made by the 2nd

respondent, only the 1st and 3rd respondents filed objections to

the application of the petitioner.

The petitioner was without legal assistance when the said

penalty was imposed. Just five days after the said penalty was

paid4, he, through an Attorney-at-Law, tendered an Appeal

marked P6 under section 2 of the Customs Ordinance to the 1st

respondentThe Director General of Customsto revise the said

order stating inter alia that he was not given a fair hearing and

there is no specified Commodity Classification for Thalsukiri and

therefore there is a confusion about the correct HS Code for the

said commodity.

This appeal has not reached a finality, as according to the

respondents, the petitioner was not co-operative.5 Conversely,

the petitioner states that as the Director General of Customs

referred the appeal to the very same officers whom the petitioner

complained to have abused their authority to deny him a fair

hearing, he came before this Court seeking relief.

It is common ground that there is no specified Commodity

Classification for Thalsukiri. Therefore (as the petitioner has

informed the Director General of Customs by P6) the importers

including the petitioner had imported Thalsukiri under Other

category of which the HS Code is 17029090. However, after the

Government introduced cess on the commodities falling into that

HS Code (17029090) from 2013, they have successfully6 started

importing Thalsukiri (Palm Sugar) under the category Maple

Sugar and Maple Syrup of which the HS Code is 17022000,

until the petitioner was, for the first time in March 2016,

accused of for committing a fraud by declaring an incorrect

Commodity Classification Code for Thalsukiri in the Cusdec.7

On what basis do the respondents state that the correct HS

Code for Thalsukiri is 17029090? That is on the basis that the

petitioner has, one time before the introduction of cess, imported

Thalsukiri under that HS Code as seen from Cusdec marked

R17, and he also admitted in his statement R12 that the correct

HS Code for Thalsukiri is 17029090. That, in my view, cannot

be the yardstick to decide the correct HS Code for Thalsukiri.

The contention of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for

the respondents that the correct HS Code for Thalsukiri is

17029090 was proved to be unacceptable by P8 tendered by the

6 The fact that it was successfully done is corroborated by paragraphs 22(viii), 22(xv) of the statement of objections of the 1st respondent, R19, paragraph 30 of the written submissions of the respondents dated 10.07.2018. 7 As seen from R1 and R2, after imposing the penalty on the petitioner, the respondents have charged another importer with the same offence.

petitioner with his counter affidavit. According to

P8Classification Ruling obtained by the petitioner after filing

this application from the Deputy Director of Customs for the

Director General of Customsthe correct HS Code for Thalsukiri

is 17029029 and not 17029090. As seen from P9, the petitioner

has thereafter imported a consignment of Thalsukiri under that

HS Code (i.e. 17029029) under Cusdec No.13800.8

However, the respondents are not prepared to accept that the

correct HS Code for Thalsukiri is 170290299 although they admit

that Nomenclature Committee is the correct place to refer to

when there is a question of Commodity Classification10, and P8

Classification Ruling on Thalsukiri has been given by the

Nomenclature Committee.11 That means, at the moment there

are three HS Codes for Thalsukiri: (a) HS 17029090according

to the 2nd and 3rd respondents12, and also according to the

petitioner at one point of time13; (b) HS 17022000according to

the petitioner from 200414; and (c) HS 17029029according to

the Deputy Director of Customs for the Director General of

Customs.15 It is therefore clear that the correct HS Code for

Thalsukiri is yet to be decided. Hence the impugned order made

8 P9 has been tendered with the written submissions of the petitioner dated 10.10.2018 with a copy to the Hon. Attorney General as seen from the Registered Postal Article Receipt attached therewith. 9 Vide paragraphs 40, 41 of the written submissions of the respondents dated 10.07.2018 and paragraphs 27-29 of the further written submissions of the respondents dated 12.10.2018. 10 Vide paragraph 23 of the written submissions of the respondents dated 10.07.2018. 11 Vide paragraph 27 of the further written submissions of the respondents dated 12.10.2018. 12 Vide P4. 13 Vide R17. 14 Vide R19. 15 Vide P8.

on the premise that the correct HS Code for Thalsukiri is HS

17029090 is erroneous on the face of the record.

In the cases cited by the learned Senior DSG for the respondents

in his written submissions, there was no issue regarding the

correct HS Code as in this case. Hence those cases are

distinguishable.

In that backdrop, the principal submission made by the learned

Senior DSG for the respondents on the footing that this is not a

commodity classification dispute but a dispute regarding the

declaration of a wrong HS Code is unsustainable as there is no

certainty about the correct HS Code. No sooner had the

petitioner obtained legal assistance than he put the Commodity

Classification in issue.16

The argument that the petitioner before the cess was introduced

once imported Thalsukiri under HS Code 17029090 and

therefore that is the correct HS Code is baseless.

Let me now deal with the broader question of denial of a fair

trial. In response to what the petitioner states that he was

denied by the 3rd respondent to have legal representation at the

inquiry17, the 3rd respondent admits that the petitioner met him

and requested that he be permitted to have legal representation

to defend his case, but thereafter without legal representation

gave P3 stating that he was prepared to pay the penalty.18 It is

16 Vide P6 and P7. 17 Vide paragraphs 14 and 15 of the petition. 18 Vide paragraph 14 of the statement of objections of the 3rd respondent and the corresponding paragraph of the affidavit.

7

unbelievable, in my view, that the petitioner gave P3 voluntarily

without any inducement or promise.

In the unique facts and circumstances of this case, I am inclined

to accept the submission of the learned counsel for the

petitioner that the petitioner was not given a fair hearing before

the impugned order was made by the 2nd respondent. In fact, it

is the position of the petitioner that he was never produced

before the 2nd respondent by whom the impugned order was

made against him,19 which has not been denied by the

respondents up to now. That probably may be the reason why

the 2nd respondent decided not to file objections to the

petitioners application. If a fair hearing has been denied, that is

a good ground to quash the impugned order by certiorari.

(Multipurpose Co-operative Society, Madawachchiya v.

Kirimudiyanse [2011] 1 Sri LR 135)

For the aforesaid reasons, I quash the order contained in P4 by

way of writ of certiorari and compel the 1st respondent by way of

mandamus to refund the sum of Rs. 2.5 million recovered from

the petitioner. The 1st respondent shall pay a sum of

Rs.25,000/= as costs of the action to the petitioner.
