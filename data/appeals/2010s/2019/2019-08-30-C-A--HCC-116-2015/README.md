o I. The Accused Appellant (Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Kuliyapitiya on one count of Rape punishable under section 364 (I) of the

Penal Code. After trial, the Appellant was convicted and was sentenced to

12 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25,0001-. Appellant was

also ordered to pay a sum of Rs. 150,000/- with a default sentence of 2 years

rigorous imprisonment. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the

sentence, the Appellant preferred the instant appeal on the following

grounds. Grounds of appeal as submitted in the petition of appeal are;

2

.'

I. That the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the facts and the

law submitted in the case.

2. That the learned Trial Judge has not considered the legal principles on the

defence of consent in a case of rape.

3. That the learned Trial Judge has analyzed the short comings of the

defence without considering the probability in the version of the

prosecutrix.

4. That the learned Trial Judge instead of analyzing the defects in the

prosecution case, has narrated the evidence for the prosecution and

analyzed the same in such a manner that the defence has to prove their

case beyond reasonable doubt.

5. That the learned trial Judge had erred, when he found medical evidence

as corroborative evidence when the defence of consent was taken by the

Appellant.

02. I have carefully considered the evidence adduced at the trial, judgment of

the learned Trial Judge, and the submissions made by counsel for the

Appellant and the Respondent.

03. Prosecution relies on the evidence of the prosecutrix who is the sole eye

witness. The evidence of the prosecutrix (PWI) was that, the Appellant's

house had been about 300 meters away from her house. She had been a

divorcee and was 22 years old. She used to borrow books on economics

from the Appellant. On the day of the incident, when she was going to a

class passing the Appellant's house, the Appellant had asked her to return a

3

book that she had already borrowed from him. When she went to return the

book, the Appellant had dragged her into his house from the back door,

assaulted her, and had raped her. As she was having her menses that day,

blood had spilt on the mat that was on the bed. Appellant had raped her

twice. Appellant also had threatened to kill her if she revealed the incident to

anyone. She had got dressed and gone home. Without telling her father

about the incident, she had gone to her mother who was in the market near

the bus stand, and had told her. Thereafter, she had gone to the police station

with her father, and had made a complaint. She was also examined by a

doctor. It was also evident that the Appellant was a graduate in economics

and was a member ofPradeshiya Sabha.

04. The defence taken by the Appellant right throughout the case was that, he

had consensual sex with PW I .

05. Learned President's Counsel for the Appellant submitted that, it is unsafe to

convict on a charge of rape on the uncorroborated evidence of the alleged

victim. That is not the law as it is. If the evidence of the alleged victim is

cogent, acceptable, and if the victim is found to be trustworthy, then Court

can act upon her evidence without corroboration. A victim in a case of rape

cannot be treated as an accomplice to the crime. If her evidence is not

acceptable or doubtful, then the Accused is entitled to get acquitted.

4

06. Sexual offences are often committed in isolation, not in public. Hence,

seldom you get eye witnesses to the crime other than the victim. In case of

Sunil and Another V. AG 19861 Sri L.R 230, Court said:

'1t is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of

a woman victim of a sex offence, but if her evidence is convincing,

such evidence can be acted on even in the absence of corroboration. '

07. In case of Bharwada Bhoginbltai Hirjibltai V. State of Gujarat [1983) AiR

753, [1983) SCR (3) 280, Indian Supreme Court observed:

'Corroboration is not a sine-quo-nonfor a conviction in a rape

case. 1n the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of a victim

of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding

insult to injury. Viewing the evidence of the girl or the woman who

complains of rape or sexual molestation with the aid of spectacles

fitted with lenses tinged with doubt, disbelief or suspicion, is to justify

the charge of male chauvinism in a male dominant society. '

08. This observation is relevant to the Sri Lankan context as well. In the above

premise, it is clear that an accused in a case of rape can be convicted on the

uncorroborated testimony of the victim, provided her evidence is cogent

acceptable, and if the Court is convinced that she is telling the truth.

09. It is the contention of the counsel for the Appellant that, according to the

medical evidence adduced at the trial, there had been no injuries suggestive

5

, "

of a recent sexual intercourse visible in the vagina. If there was any recent

sexual intercourse, therefore, was more likely to have occasioned with

physical and mental preparedness.

I O. The Medical Officer (PW5) who examined PWI clearly had stated that,

there can be instances where vaginal lubricating fluids can be produced even

without physical or mental preparedness for sexual intercourse. He said that,

at the time of menstruation it can happen. (Pages 161 - 164 of the appeal

brief). He further said that, chances of getting injuries when having sexual

intercourse during menstruation is less. It is evident and not in dispute that,

PWI was having her menses at the time when the accused had penetrative

sexual intercourse with her. Therefore, the absence of injuries in her vagina

alone, cannot be taken as PW I had consensual sexual intercourse with the

accused.

II. Counsel for the Appellant further submitted that, although PW 1 said that she

was assaulted on her face by the Appellant, doctor who examined did not

observe any injuries. PW5 in his evidence said that, PW 1 complained of

pain on the left side of the face and when he examined she felt pain. (Page

160 of the brief). History given to the doctor by the PWI shows that she had

been consistent in her evidence.

12. Act of resistance for sexual intercourse defers from person to person. Some

may physically resist, struggle, or even bite. Some may scream. Some may

6

,',

silently suffer after showing the disapproval, because they do not want to

show the public what had happened, It is common knowledge that, in our

society, most of the time the victim woman is also partly blamed by the

society, Even after the act of sexual assault, women think twice before a

complaint is made, due to the social stigma that the woman would have to

undergo, Merely because she did not scream, she did not bite the accused, or

she did not run without clothes to the road looking for help, one cannot say

that she consented to the sexual intercourse, Court will have to take all the

evidence before taking into consideration when deciding whether the

complainant consented or not

13, Counsel for the Appellant invited the Court to consider the omission that,

PW I had not told to the police that she told the Appellant that she would

send the book through her father. PWI had made the complaint to the police

the same day without any delay, The police officer who recorded the

complaint said that, PW I came to the police station with the father.

However, she had not recorded the statement of the father, the same day,

Like when answering the questions put to her in cross examination in Court,

PW I cannot be expected to tell every minute detail in the statement to the

police, Also, the above omission does not go to the root of the case and

would not affect the credibility ofPWI ,

14, The learned Trial judge has given good and sufficient reasons as to why the

contradiction marked as VI would not affect the credibility of PWI,

7

,

Evidence of the PWI, Father (PW3) and Mother (PW2) makes it clear as to

how the matter was reported to police. Hence, the contradiction marked V2

from the evidence of PW3, would have no adverse effect to the case for the

prosecution.

15. Counsel for the Appellant has submitted that, the father of the PWI would

have played havoc, if he found that his only daughter was raped. As an

ordinary villager, his calm behavior negates the possibility of forced sexual

intercourse, he submitted. This argument is untenable. The Appellant was a

Pradeshiya Sabha member of the area. PW3 who is the father of the victim is

an ordinary villager. In today's context, it is quite natural that an ordinary

villager cannot go and fight with a political figure of the area. Mother and

Father of the PWI had correctly decided that, PWI should immediately go

and make the complaint to the police which was the more sensible decision

other than going to the Appellant's house and fighting with him.

16. Counsel for the Appellant further submitted that, when a woman visits a

man who lives alone in a house several times, the inference that can be

drawn is that she consented to sexual intercourse. Counsel also submitted

that, PWI had gone to the Appellant's house from the back yard, when in

fact she could have gone from the front gate. PW I had clearly explained as

to why she had to visit the Appellant. Undisputedly, she had been borrowing

books from the Appellant. Evidence of the sister of the Appellant who

testified on behal f of the defence clearly shows that, the Appellant being a

8

politician had built a room behind the house to meet general public who

come to visit him. All the people from the village who come to get help

from him, come to the room behind the house. That was the evidence

produced by the defence. Therefore, it is nothing unusual for the PWI to go

behind the main house to meet the Accused. Submission that the PWI went

from the backside of the house because she consented to sexual intercourse,

is untenable.

17. It is also the contention of the counsel for the Appellant that the productions

including the mat was identified by the PWI , as it had been frequently used,

that suggests consensual sexual intercourse. It is evident that those

productions were taken into police custody in the presence of PW 1. Police

have gone to investigate the crime scene with PWI, where police had taken

the productions. Therefore, PWI could have easily remembered the identity

of the productions.

18. It is the contention of the Appellant that, the learned Trial judge has rejected

the defence erroneously. In that, Counsel submitted that, the learned Trial

Judge has rejected the dock statement on the basis that the motive of the

PWI that was mentioned in the dock statement was not put to the PWI

when she gave evidence. Further, it is submitted that the evidence of the

sister of the Appellant to the effect that she had demanded the PWI not to

visit the Appellant, was not challenged.

9

, .

19. These were never put to the PW1 by the defence in cross examination when

she gave evidence. If these were put to her, she could have had the

opportunity to explain, admit or deny. This issue was discussed in so many

decided cases by Superior Courts.

20. In case of Saman Singh V. State of Panjab AIR SC (iii) 3652 at 3656,

Indian Supreme Court held:

" It is a rule of essential justice that, whenever the opponent has

declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross

examination, it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue

ought to be accepted."

This was sighted with approval In case of Bobby Mathew V. State of

Karnataka [2004J 3 Cri L.J. page 3003. This was followed in case of M.

Gunasiri alias Jinasiri and Others V. Republic of Sri Lanka CA 16612013,

04.03.2009, by his Lordship Sisira de Abrew J.

21. In case of Maddumage Indrajith Fernando V. Hon Attorney General CA

5912004,31.01.2007, His Lordship Justice Ranjith Silva said:

"The accused in his dock statement had stated that the

deceased hurled filth at him. This was not suggested to the eye

witness. When he gave evidence, and the eye witness had no

opportunity to refute or admit such allegations. Therefore, it is not in

the mouth of the accused to take up a position which was not put to

the prosecution witness. Had the counsel for the accused done so, the

10

witness could have denied that fact. The accused did not put that to

the witness because he feared the truth. If that was the position of the

accused, then the prosecution was deprived of eliciting evidence to

prove that the accused was making a baseless proposition. "

22. In the instant case, the Appellant failed to put to PWI that there was an issue

between the Appellant and PWI that day about a marriage proposal to the

Appellant. In the above premise, the learned Trial Judge was entitled to

reject that evidence of the Appellant on that issue. The learned Trial Judge

also has given good and sufficient reasons for rejecting the evidence of the

defence.

23. As I mentioned before, the PWI has made the complaint to the police the

same day. Complaint being recent also shows that, the PWI had been

consistent, which enhances her credibility.

24. As an alternative ground of appeal, counsel submitted that, the learned Trial

Judge has failed to comply with the mandatory provision stipulate under

section 195 (e) (e) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. On perusing the

Court record of the High Court, it is obvious that the Accused had opted a

non-jury trial. On 29.09.2011, the day the indictment was served on the

Appellant, the learned Trial Judge in the journal entry in his own

handwriting has said that, the Accused informed that he does not need a jury

trial. Again on 03.06.2015, when the succeeding Judge continued with the

case, the Accused had opted to a non-jury trial. Counsel had appeared for

11

.

the Appellant on both occasions. Therefore, this alternative ground of appeal

is baseless.

25. For the aforementioned reasons, I find that the grounds of appeal urged by

the Appellant, are void of merit and should be dismissed. I affirm the

conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellant by the learned High

Court Judge.

Appeal dismissed.
