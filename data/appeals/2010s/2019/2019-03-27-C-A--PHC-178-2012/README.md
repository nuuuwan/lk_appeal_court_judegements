Janak De Silva J.

This is an appeal against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the Southern Province

holden in Galle dated 18.12.2012.

The Officer-in-Charge of the Galle Police Station filed a report on 05.11.2004 in the Magistrates

Court of Galle in terms of section 66(l)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act (Act). The report

stated that there was a dispute affecting land between the pt, 3rd, 4th Respondents-Petitioners-

Page 5 of 9

Appellants (Appellants) and the father of 2A Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent)

indicating an imminent breach of peace and sought appropriate orders from court.

After hearing parties, the learned Magistrate held that although the Appellants were in

possession of the land in dispute on the date information was filed namely 05.11.2004, they had

unlawfully dispossessed the Respondent from the said land on 06.09.2004. Accordingly, he made

order directing that the Respondent is entitled to possession of the land in dispute.

The Appellants filed a revision application in the High Court of the Southern Province holden in

Galle which was dismissed. Hence this appeal.

The main contentions of the Appellants are:

(1) There was no identification of the corpus

(2) The learned Magistrate erred in failing to conclude that the Appellants were in possession

of the land in dispute even prior to two months from the date proceedings were instituted

namely 05.11.2004

In this appeal Court must consider the correctness of the order of the High Court. It is trite law that

existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court selects the cases in

respect of which the extraordinary method of rectification should be adopted, if such a selection

process is not there revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of every litigant

to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision Application or to make an appeal in situations

where the legislature has not given a right of appeal [Amaratunga J. in Dharmaratne and another

v. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd. and another [(2003) 3 SrLL.R. 24 at 30]. The learned High Court

Judge has correctly identified the legal principle and held that the Appellants had failed to

establish exceptional circumstances.

Therefore, in this appeal, Court must consider whether the learned High Court Judge erred in

concluding that the Appellant has failed to establish exceptional circumstances.

Identity of Corpus

In an application of this nature it is incumbent on the Magistrate to ascertain the identity of the

corpus as section 66(1} of the Act becomes applicable only if there is a dispute between parties

affecting land. A Magistrate should evaluate the evidence if there is a dispute regarding identity

of the land. [David Apuhamy v. Yassassi There (1987) 1 Sri.L.R. 253].

The learned counsel for the Appellants submits that the learned Magistrate had erred in

identifying the land in dispute without any reference to the plans relied on by parties.

In an inquiry under Part VII of the Act, the learned Magistrate does not have the benefit of a

commission issued by court in identifying the land in dispute. He has to proceed on the

documentary evidence tendered by parties which may include plans referred to in the deeds

relied on parties. In this exercise the sketch prepared by the Police will play an important role

unless a party alleges and establishes that the Police have acted partially towards one of the

parties.

In the instant matter, the learned Magistrate has correctly used both plans tendered by parties

as well as the sketch prepared by the Police and identified the land in dispute. There are no

exceptional circumstances arising on this point.

Forcible Dispossession

The learned Magistrate held that the Appellants were in possession of the land in dispute on the

date information was filed namely 05.11.2004. He then went on to examine whether the

Appellants came into possession by dispossessing the Respondent within a period of two prior to

the filing of information. The learned Magistrate concluded that the Appellants did so on

06.09.2004 and it is this conclusion that the Appellants seek to assail in this appeal.

The Appellants submit that the learned Magistrate erred in arriving at this conclusion based

purely on the observations of the Police Sergeant Suriyarachchi made on 07.09.2004.

The learned Magistrate held that the Respondent had constructive possession of the land in

dispute.

In Iqbal vs. Majedudeen and others [(1999) 3 Sri.loR. 213] it was held:

1. The fact for determining whether a person is in possession of any corporeal thing,

such as a house, is to ascertain whether he is in general control of it.

2. The law recognizes two kinds of possession:

(i) When a person has direct physical control over a thing at a given time - actual

possession.

(ii) When he though not in actual possession has both the power and intention at

a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing either directly or

through another person - constructive possession.

The learned Magistrate considered the following facts in concluding that the Respondent had

constructive possession:

(a) Allowing the Asian Finance Company to cut a road way from the corpus

(b) Requesting and obtaining a letter from the Municipal Council to confirm that he is the

owner of the premises bearing the assessment no. 307/32

(c) Appointing a licensee to look after the corpus

(d) Making a complaint to the Police as soon as becoming aware of the construction of a

barbed wire fence across the corpus

The Appellant submits that the learned Magistrate erred in failing to consider the following facts

which shows the 3rd Appellant having constructive possession of the corpus:

(a) 3rd Appellant was living adjacent to the corpus

(b) There was an aperture through the wall to access the corpus

(c) Erection of concrete piles on the corpus

,

I am of the view that the learned Magistrate correctly evaluated the evidence and concluded that

the Respondent held constructive possession of the corpus on 06.09.2004 for the facts in support

of that conclusion are far more compelling.

Accordingly, the learned High Court Judge was correct in concluding that the Appellant had failed

to establish exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court

Judge of the Southern Province holden in Galle dated 18.12.2012.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
