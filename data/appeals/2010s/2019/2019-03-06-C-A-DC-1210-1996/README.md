*****

M. M. A. Gaffoor, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondents above named instituted this

action in the District Court of Avissawella to partition the land called

Aliyamalahena depicted in preliminary plan No. 220 dated 07.07.1980

by the plaint dated 09.05.1979 and subsequently by amended plaint

dated 16.07.1986. The corpus is depicted in the preliminary plan No. 220

marked as X. According to the plan, the extent of the land is 2 Acres 3

Roods and 18.8 Perches.

In the District Court, it was the position of the Original

Plaintiffs that the initial owners of the land in dispute were K. K. Julius

Appu, Ranethana, Podi Nona and James Appu. Both Ranethena and

James Appu were unmarried and after the demise of both of them, K. K.

Julius Appu possessed 3/4 shares and Podi Nona possessed 1/4 shares

5

respectively. After the demise of K. K. Julius Appu, one Bandulahami

became entitled to the share of said Julius Appu and after the demise of

said Bandulahami, 1st Plaintiff Edward, 2nd Plaintiff Alice Mary, Thomas

Singho and Rosalin Nona became entitled to the said property in dispute

by inheritance (it is further revealed by the Plaintiffs that, said Rosalin

Nona had a Diga marriage, as a result of which she entitled to the 1/4 of

the said property in dispute).

According to the Plaintiff, said Thomas Singho had died

issueless. Therefore, the remaining 3/4 shares of said Thomas Singho

were divided among the (1st and 2nd) Plaintiffs.

One Illukpitiyage Davith Appu became entitled to the 1/4

shares of the sad Podi Nona and the said Illukupitiyage Davith Appu by

virtue of Deed of transfer bearing No. 1307 dated 28.05.1012,

transferred the said shares to one John Alexander Marambe. After the

demise of said John Alexander Marambe, his son Francis Marbe became

entitled to the said share and said Francis Marambe by virtue of Deed

No. 2479 dated 07.11.1913 had transferred an undivided half shares out

of 1/4 to Noihami (1/8 shares). Further, the Plaintiffs stated that Said

Noihami transferred a 1/3 shares out of 1/8 shares to the 1st Plaintiff and

another 1/24 shares to the 2nd plaintiff.

Therefore, it was the position of the Plaintiff-

Respondents that according to the pedigree, the 1A Plaintiff-Respondent

entitled to 9/24 shares and the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent is entitled to

3/24 shares of the said land in dispute.

6

The 5th Defendant-Appellant filed a statement of claim

wherein it was contended that by virtue of an amicable partition entered

into by and between the co-owners of the corpus in dispute long prior to

the institution of this action, co-ownership had ceased and divided

possession of the defined allotments had commenced (according to

Survey Plan No. 99, marked as 5V6). His position was that, in any event,

he had exclusively possessed certain divided allotments of land as owner

to the exclusion of others and had thus acquired a prescriptive title

thereto.

The learned District Judge by her judgment dated

02.10.1996 held that the 1A Plaintiff-Respondent had established the

pedigree set out in the plaint and had ordered to partition the land in

dispute disallowing completely the prescriptive possession of the 5th

Defendant. The learned District Judge had allotted the shares as follows:

a. 1A Plaintiff-Respondent : 189/504 b. 2A Plaintiff-Respondent : 63/504 c. 1st Defendant : 126/504 d. 4th Defendant : 45/504 e. 6th Defendant : 21/504 f. 13th Defendant : 21/504 g. 16th Defendant : 14/504

Unallotted : 25/504

Being aggrieved by the said judgment dated 02.10.1996,

this appeal preferred by the 5A and 13th-16th Defendant-Appellants to

set aside the judgment of the District Court.

7

It is seen from the case record that only the Plaintiff-

Respondents have relied on a pedigree for the entire corpus and

devolution therefrom on the basis of that pedigree, the 1A Plaintiff-

Respondent had given evidence in support of his case.

It is to be noted in this case that the 5th Defendant-

Appellant was made a party to the case on the basis that he, without any

manner of right or title, was residing on the said disputed land and he

claimed exclusive rights to the buildings and the plantations in lots 1 and

3 depicted in the preliminary plan X.

In this appeal, it was the conjoint position of the Appellants

that the Plaintiffs-Respondents were duly not proved their title to the land.

Whilst the 5th Defendant-Appellant has taken another position that, he came

into the possession of the land in dispute in 1951 with the execution of Deed

No. 168, dated 17.05.1951 by his parents and siblings. Therefore, it is clear

that the 5th Defendant endeavoured to prove his prescriptive title which was

disallowing by the learned District Judge.

It is an important fact that all the deeds and documents

produced in this action support the pedigree of the plaintiffs and devolution

therefrom, deeds marked as 5V8, 5V11 and 5V12 are in support of the

Plaintiff-Respondents title and pedigree in this case (vide page 569, 582 and

586 of the appeal brief).

Further, I observed that the 5th Defendant-Appellant whilst

giving evidence on 21.11.1995 had stated in his examination-in-chief that

Edward, the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent (now deceased) was a co-owner and

another occasion he had further testified and admitted that he entered the

8

corpus on a deed bearing No. 168 and that transferors are not owners in

terms of the pedigree of the Plaintiff-Respondents (vide page 201-203 and

212-213 of the appeal brief).

It was the contention of the 5th Defendant-Appellant

that, by virtue of an amicable partition entered into by and between the

co-owners of the corpus in dispute long prior to the institution of this

action, co-ownership had ceased and divided possession of the defined

allotments had commenced.

In contrast, it was the strong position of the 1B Plaintiff-

Appellant that, prior to the institution of this partition action, the said land in

dispute was not amicably divided among the parties. He revealed an

important fact that the schedule of the deed marked as P7 (also marked as

6V2) does not comply with the schedule of the survey plan No. 99 (5V6). The

Deed P7 was executed after the institution of this action. Therefore, he is in a

position that the parties had considered the said land in dispute as a land

which had not been amicably divided.

Counsel for the 1B Plaintiff-Respondent further stated that

the Deed No. 1615 marked as 1V1 (vide page 497 of the appeal brief) was

executed on 20.03.1979; but the schedule of the said deed reveals a fact that

only undivided shares of the land sought to be partitioned had been

transferred. In these circumstances, Counsel for the 1B Plaintiff-Respondent

submitted that the contention of the 5th Defendant-Appellant that the co-

ownership of the parties to the land in dispute ceased from 1956 is obviously

false. I do not see any conundrums in these submissions.

It also seen from the entire proceedings that even though

the 5th Defendant-Appellant relied on the partition plan No. 99, he has failed

9

to call a single witness who was an attentive party to the said plan, to strength

his position.

It is in these circumstances, I am of the view that the

Appellants do not show a proper reason or a grave legal discrepancy to

interfere with the findings of the learned District Judge.

This Court being an Apex Court does not wish to interfere

with several factual positions dealt with by a trail judge who is in a position to

see and evaluate the entire evidence led before him. Unless perverse orders

are made by the lower Courts it would not be in order for a Superior Court to

interfere with the original factual matters.

Accordingly, I proceed to dismiss the appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
