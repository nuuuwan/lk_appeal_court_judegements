The officer in charge of the Galgamuwa Police filed an information in the

Magistrates Court of Galgamuwa, in terms of the provisions contained in Section

66(l)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, (hereinafter referred

to as the Act) over a disputed right of way between the 1st Party Respondent-

Respondent-Petitioners (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioners) and the 2nd Party

Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent).

The learned Magistrate by order dated 09/07/2014, held that the roadway depicted

as Lot 250, is a private road used by the Petitioners and therefore, is entitled to the

uninterrupted exclusive use of the roadway. By order dated 1711112016, the

learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala, allowing a revision application against

the said determination held that, the Respondent is entitled to a servitude of right

of way over the disputed road. It is the said order that the Petitioner is seeking to

canvass in this application.

The Petitioners contends that they acquired a prescriptive right to a 6 feet

wide roadway marked as Lot No. 250 of the final village plan No. 3200 dated

19/1011992, which gives exclusive access to the Petitioners land marked Lot No.

252.

The Respondent is in possession of Lot No. 253 of the said plan and

operates a hotel in the said premises. In the affidavit filed in the Magistrates Court,

Page 3 af7

the Respondent denies that Lot No. 250 has been exclusively given to the

Petitioners to access Lot No. 252, the land owned by the Petitioners. It is also

contended that the said hotel has a separate parking lot and denies any obstruction

being caused to the Petitioners in that regard.

The learned High Court Judge has observed that the Petitioners are in

possession of Lot No. 252 of the final village plan No. 3200, dated 191t011992, by

a grant given to them under Section \9(4) of the Land Development Ordinance.

The Respondent is in possession of Lot Nos. 249 and 253 of the said fmal plan, by

a deed attested with the approval of the Divisional Secretary. The road reservation

depicted as Lot 250 in the final plan is State land which has not been given to the

exclusive use of either party. The respective parties are in agreement with the

above findings of the learned High Court Judge.

Therefore, the issue to be decided is whether the Petitioners who have no

soil rights entitled in law to have a declaration that the Respondent has no claim

for a servitude ofa right of way in terms of Section 69 of the Act.

In Ananda Saratl! Paranagama Vs. Dhammadhinna Sarath Paranagama

and another, CA (PHC) APN 11712013, A. W.A.Salam J. held that;

''In dealing with the nature of the right, a Judge of the Primary Court is expected

10 adjudicate under Section 69 of the Act, Sharvananda, J (later Chief Justice) in

the case of Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajaha 1982 Sri Lanka Law Report - Volume

2, Page 693 stated that in a dispute in regard to any right to any land other than

Page 4 of 7

right of possession of such land, the question for decision, according to Section

69(1), is who is entitled to the right which is subject of dispute. The word "entitle "

here connotes the ownership of the right. The Court has to determine which of the

parties has acquired that right or is entitled for the time being to exercise that

right. In contradistinction to Section 68 of the Act, Section 69 requires the Court

to determine the question as to which party is entitled to the disputed right

preliminary to the making of an order under Section 69(2). "

At page 11, His Lordship further held that;

"There are two ways in which an entitlement can be proved in the Primary Court.

They are:

1. By adducing proof of the entitlement as is done in a Civil Court.

2. By offering proof that he is entitled to the right for the time being. "

In Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajaha (1982) 2 SLR 693, the Court held that;

"On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land other than

right of possession of such land, the question for decision, according to section

69(1), is who is entitled to the right which is subject of dispute. The word "entitle"

here connotes the ownership of the right. The Court has to determine which of the

parties has acquired that right, or is entitled for the time being to exercise that

right. In contradistinction to section 68, section 69 requires the Court to determine

the question which party is entitled to the disputed right preliminary to making an

order under section 69(2). "

Page 5 of 7

The main object of the proceedings under Chapter VII of the Act is to

prevent any breach of peace and to restore the party entitled to the right in the

nature of a servitude or the possession of the land until the dispute is determined

by a competent Court.

It is observed that in terms of Section 69(2) of the Act, a determination in

respect of a right other than a right to possession is based on user rights acquired

by a party.

In Fernando Vs. Wickremasinghe (1998) 3 SLR 37, on an application by

the Plaintiff - Respondent to the District Court to restrain the Defendant -

Petitioner from using the same right of way, Weerasuriya, J observed with

approval, the findings in M.D.B. Saparamadu Vs. Violet Catherine Melder CA

688/42F CAM 22.03.96 that;

"where a person who enjoyed a servitude was obstructed, he could bring an

action against the person who obstructed him from interfering with the enjoyment.

of the servitude. However, it was laid down that a person who had no soil rights in

respect of a road reservation could not maintain an action for a declaration that

defendant was not entitled to a servitude of right of way over such -road

reservation. "

In Fernando Vs. Wickremasinglte (supra), his lordship also cited with

approval, 'Hall and Kellaway' in 'The Law of Servitudes' at page 2, where it is

stated that;

Page 6 of 7

"Praedial Servitudes are constituted in favour of a particular praedium and can

only pass with the land. The dominant owner cannot transfer the land to someone

else and keep the servitude for himself or vice versa, nor can he let the servitude,

or lend the use ofit to strangers apart from the land. "

In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I am of the view that the

roadway depicted in Lot No. 250 of the final village plan is a road reservation

enjoyed by the Respondent as a servitude of a right of way which cannot be

transferred to the exclusive use of the Petitioners.

For all the above reasons, I affirm the judgment of the learned High Court

Judge and dismiss this application

Application dismissed without costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

I agree.
