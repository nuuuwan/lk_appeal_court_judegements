ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The appellant was indicted by the Hon. Attorney General before the

High Court of Colombo for committing theft of two security cameras

belong to Fisheries Corporation and causing mischief to its security camera

system under the Offences against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 and

also for the theft of two mobile phones from two of its employees under

the Penal Code.

After trial, the appellant was found guilty to all four counts by the

High Court and was sentenced to four year terms of imprisonment in

respect of the offences that are committed under the Public Property Act

with a fine, three times the value of the damage to the property of

Government, coupled with a default term of two years. He was also

sentenced to serve a term of one-year imprisonment in respect of each of

2

the two counts of theft under the Penal Code. The trial Court made further

order that all sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the appellant

sought to challenge them primarily on the following basis that;

a. the trial Court failed to consider the identity of the appellant was

not proved by the prosecution,

b. the trial Court failed to properly evaluate the prosecution

evidence for its credibility,

c. the trial Court had convicted the appellant upon the inferences it

had erroneously drawn upon the prosecution case which was

presented upon several items of circumstantial evidence.

The prosecution evidence is the appellant, who was employed at the

Fish Processing Facility of the Fisheries Corporation at Mutwal, had

arrived at the gate of the said facility at about 2.30 or 3.00 a.m. on

07.06.2012. Witness Buddhika Kumara, the security guard who manned the

security point of the main gate, allowed the appellant in, on sympathetic

grounds at that time since the appellant claimed that he had rushed there

upon a phone call by a fellow employee who had played a practical on

him and any way he had to report to work for the morning shift. At that

time the appellant was clad in a white coloured T shirt and a pair of long

trousers. He then walked towards the rest rooms.

The security officer was instructed by the Management to let

employees in if they arrive at the facility a few hours prior to the

commencement of their respective shifts on account of their coming to

3

work from distant places. There were rest rooms available within the

facility for such employees.

Witnesses Senadheera and Chaturanga have stayed in the rest room

that night as they have arrived late in the previous evening. One of them

had left his phone for charging and the other had it on his bed. The door to

the rest room could not be locked and the witnesses have kept a table

across the door to prevent any outsider coming in during their sleep. As

they woke up in the morning at about 6.30 a.m., they found out that both

the phones have gone missing and had reported to security at 8.30 a.m.

about the loss.

Witness Kumarapperuma, the security manager of the facility, was

altered by the security guards firstly about the loss of phones and then of

the two security cameras that had been forcibly removed from the mounts

as they discovered its removal subsequently. Suspicion centred around the

appellant since his entry into the facility is unusual and the witness

decided to inspect the CCTV footage of the previous night. It was seen by

the witness that a person in a T shirt walking at 3.45 a.m. and at 3.54

removing a security camera with a rod used to shut roller shutters. At 3.56

a.m. all cameras have gone blank.

Having replayed the CCTV recordings the witness Kumarapperuma

called up the appellant to his office and questioned him. He then decided

to call Police. The Police, having arrived at the facility, again played back

the CCTV footage. They noted that the person who removed the security

cameras with a rod was wearing a necklace of a particular shape similar to

the one .worn by the appellant who was with his manager at that time.

4

He was arrested and questioned by the police along with the two

witnesses whose phones were lost.

IP Padmalal of Mutwal police investigated this incident and recorded

the statements of the appellant as well as the two witnesses. The appellant

thereafter pointed out a locker to the officer and opened it with his key and

the two missing phones were recovered from it. The locker also contained

personal belongings of the appellant. He also pointed out the place where

two security cameras were found, concealed behind an unused wooden

cupboard, close to the point they had been removed and in addition, an

iron pole used in opening roller shutters was also recovered.

The lay witnesses also saw the discovery of these items made by the

police, in the presence of the appellant.

In his statement from the dock, the appellant stated that he reported

to work at 7.30/8.00 a.m. and was called by the security manager at 10.00

a.m. in relation to the missing phones and was thereafter taken to Mutwal

police where he was assaulted with cricket poles in the night. He did not

show anything and the locker used is a common one. He was framed for

this due to his union activities and also for organising a protest campaign

against his Chairman. He claimed his innocence to the allegation.

The appellant's challenge on the identity was mounted on the

selected items of evidence where the witnesses have admitted that they

could not identify the person who was seen in CCTV footage and the

apparent inconsistency of the clothing worn by the appellant. It was also

contended that the necklace which had provided the nexus between the

5

appellant and the person who was seen on CCTV footage was not

prod uced in Court.

Learned Senior State Counsel, in her reply referred to the other

items of evidence that explained the basis on which the trial Court had

decided issue of identity against the appellant. She referred to the two

instances the appellant was seen by witnesses. Initially, the appellant had

entered the facility wearing a white T shirt with a pair of long trousers.

The fact that subsequent reference to his clothing differed from this

description could be explained as the appellant had changed into his

working attire after reporting to work. The police took charge only his

working attire and not the clothing he wore as he entered the premises

early in the morning.

Clearly there is no reasonable doubt exists as to the identity of the

appellant. The necklace and talisman were clearly referred to by the

security manager and the police officer after viewing CCTV footage and it

was found that similar necklace was worn by the appellant even at that

time. Contrary to the claim of the appellant, the necklace and the talisman

worn by the appellant at the time of his arrest was in fact produced before

the trial Court marked as P7 and P8 respectively. There was no challenge

by the appellant on this item of evidence.

The trial Court had correctly drawn the necessary and inescapable

inference that it was the appellant and none other who was responsible for

the theft of phones, security cameras and for the damage since he had the

knowledge where those items were within 8 hours of its removal. In

applying the principle enunciated by Amaratungd J in Ariyasinghe and

6

Others v Attorney General (2004) 2 Sri LR 357, to the instant appeal, there

were three ways in which the appellant could have acquired such

knowledge.

1. He acquired the said knowledge by an act done by him.

2. He saw another person disposing of the items.

3. A person who had seen another person disposing of the

items and told the appellant about it.

The circumstances justify the inference that the appellant had the

knowledge as to where the phones and security cameras were because he

himself had placed them at the places where it was subsequently

recovered. This inference is fortified with the drawing of an inference

under Section 114(a) of the Evidence Ordinance upon considering the fact

that he was with his senior officers from morning until the police arrived

there and due to that reason had no opportunity of acquiring that

knowledge during this period of time. Therefore, in all probability he

would have acquired that knowledge between the time of its removal and

prior to his arrival at the Manager's Office, thereby narrowing the time gap

to mere four hours.

Hence, the question of identity of the appellant had clearly been

proved before the trial Court by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.

In shifting the focus to the other grounds of appeal, as urged by the

learned Counsel for the appellant, this Court finds that the inconsistencies

that are highlighted off the prosecution case has no adverse effect on the

prosecution case in view of the strong case it had established before the

7

trial Court by placing several incriminating items of circumstantial

evidence that only points to his guilt.

The contention that the prosecution had failed to establish that the

appellant had entered the facility since it had failed to tender any

documentary proof has no merit since the prosecution relied on direct

evidence led through the security officers who were on duty at that time to

prove this fact. The CCTV footage was consistent with the claim of these

witnesses although it lacked clarity as to the identity of the individual.

Another point urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant is that

the evidence of PW 6 and PW8 are contradictory to each other in respect of

the colour of the T shirt. This aspect had already been considered in this

judgment in relation to the question of identity and the apparent

contradiction is not a contradiction since the appellant had changed into

his official attire after his entry into the facility.

The appellant sought to challenge the recovery of the two mobile

phones from a common locker on the basis that it is not probable for a

person to conceal stolen items in a locker which is meant for common use.

The appellant in his statement from the dock claimed that the said locker is

used commonly by several other co-workers as well. However, the

appellant when he cross-examined IP Padmalal was not consistent on this

position. Having suggested that the phones and cameras were handed

over to police by one Chandana (at p.253), the appellant, after a short while

again suggested to the same witness that those items were handed over to

police by the security manager Kumarapperuma (at p. 255).

8

IP Padmalal was emphatic that those items were recovered from a

secured locker which was under appellants control as he had the key. The

appellant's suggestion that it was commonly used one was denied by the

witness. In answer to the question as to his failure to take charge of the key

the witness replied since there were other personal belongings of the

appellant in the said locker he had let the appellant to keep its key. This

was also not denied by the appellant. PC 2963 Priyadharshana had recorded

the statement of the appellant and had participated in the recovery of the

phones and cameras. The appellant did suggest that these items were

handed over to police not by Kumarapperuma or Chandradana but by one

Rangana (at p.268). Thus, it is clear that the appellant's challenge of the

recovery of the items is done on a whimsical manner. In all, he had

suggested three names as the persons who had allegedly handed over

these items of productions to police. The appellant, however, is silent in his

dock statement over the allegation of introduction of the productions

items.

The trial Court was mindful of its responsibility in evaluating a case

presented by the prosecution on items of circumstantial evidence.

Contrary to the contention of the appellant that it had applied

Ellenborough dictum erroneously, the trial Court had at the very end of its

judgment clearly indicated that even if the appellant's case is totally

rejected due to its falsity, the prosecution had proved its case beyond

reasonable doubt.

~ ~--------------------------------------------------------------------~

This Court, after a careful consideration of the several grounds of

appeal as raised by the learned Counsel for the appellant in the light of the

totality of the evidence presented before the trial Court, finds that there is

no merit in the appeal of the appellant.

Therefore, this Court affirms the conviction and the appropriate

sentence that had been imposed on the appellant by the High Court of

Colombo.

Appeal of the appellant is accordingly dismissed.
