The officer in charge of the Kadugannawa Police filed an information in

-terms of the provisions contained in Section 66( I )(a) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, in the Magistrates Court of Kandy over a disputed

right of footway between the 2nd and 3'd Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellants) and the 1st Respondent-Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent). The learned Magistrate by

Page 2 of 5

order dated 13/0712006, held that the Respondent is entitled to acquire a right of

way as prescriptive user. A revision application to set aside the said order filed by

the aggrieved Appellants were refused by order dated 03112/2014, by the

Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy. It is the said order

that the Petitioner is before this Court seeking to canvass, in this application:

A right of way to be acquired on Prescription was discussed In

Thambapillai Vs. Nagamanipillai 52 NLR 225, where it was held that;

"it is a pre-requisite to the acquisition 0/ a right 0/ way by prescription that a

well-defined and identifiable course or track should have been adversely used by

the owner o/the dominant tenement/or over ten years. "

The Respondent claims that he together with other villagers have used the

disputed 3 feet wide roadway referred to as Gamsabha road for over a period of25

years. According to the statements recorded by the pol ice, the Appellants have

placed branches of trees to obstruct the said roadway.

To acquire a right of way by a prescriptive user there must be a land for the

beneficial enjoyment and another land over which servitude is exercisable. Tire

right of way claimed by the Respondent is to access his property that has been

allotted and acquired through a Partition action bearing No. P 9601.

In Kandaiah Vs. Seenitamby 17 NLR 29, it was held that;

Page 3 of 5

"the evidence to establish a prescriptive right of way must be pr~cise and definite.

It must relate to a define track and must not consist of proof of mere straying

across open land at any point which is at the moment most convenient. "

The police observations marked I El II confirms the existence of a 3 feet

wide road by the side of the threshing floor, 'Kamatha', and the paddy field.

Obstructions placed on the road has also been observed. The police observations

also noted a 3 feet long concrete bridge on the foot path constructed by the

Pradeshiya Sabha.

The learned Magistrate in his order has clearly stated that the 3 feet wide

footpath claimed by the Respondent is by the side of the threshing floor which

should be cleared of any obstructions. The learned Magistrate has arrived at his

conclusions based on the fact that the Respondent was an actual user. The

evidence taken into consideration in arriving at the said conclusion supports the

fact that the foot path claimed by the Respondent was not randomly used or a foot

path which runs over the property of the Appellants. There is no evidence to

suggest that the Respondent has claimed a right of way by prescription over the

intervening high lands or paddy lands. (Cornel is Vs. Fernando 65 NLR 93)

The learned Magistrate having taken into consideration the information,

affidavits and documents filed by the respective parties arrived at a just decision

that the Respondent has the right to use the foot path as claimed. In dismissing the

revision application, the learned High Court Judge has correctly concluded that the

Page 4 of 5

Appellant has failed to establish exceptional circumstances to overturn the said

order.

In all the above circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the

judgment of the learned High Court Judge ofKandy.

Application dismissed. I make no order as to costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

I agree.
