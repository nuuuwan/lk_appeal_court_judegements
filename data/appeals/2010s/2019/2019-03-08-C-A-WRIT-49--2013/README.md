He claims that during 'the conflict, while the Petitioner was still i;m infant, his

parents were forcibly removed from their property and moved to

Kokkuthoduwai. The Petitioner claims further that during the conflict he was

injured in an artillery attack where he sustained an injury to his right leg. This

Court observes that the Petitioner has not substantiated any of the said claims

with any documentary proof nor has he established how he would be affected

by the implementation of the recommendations contained in the said two

letters 'Pl' and 'P2/. --

In the exercise of the powers vested in terms of Article 33(f) of the

Constitution, the President had issued a Presidential Directive dated ih May

2009, produced by the Respondents marked 'lRl' appointing the persons

mentioned -therein as members of the "Presidential Task Force for the

Resettlement, Development and Security of the Northern Province". It is set

out in 'lRl' that the said Presidential Task Force (PTF) is being established in

order to "launch an urgent, co-ordinated and sustained effort to resettle the

internally displaced persons (and) rehabilitate and develop the economic and

social infrastructure of the Northern Province of Sri Lanka." The primary task

entrusted to the PTF was to prepare strategic plans, programmes and projects

to carry out the said tasks and primarily to re-settle the internally displaced

persons.

In July 2012, the . PT,F had appointed a Committee comprising of

representatives of various Government institutions to study . and make

recommendations relating to the resettlement of a large number of Muslim

families who were displaced from the Northern Province in 1990.3 The report

of the said Committee containing their recommendations had been presented

to the PTF in October 20124. The PTF, while agreeing with the said

recommendations, had recommended that the lands referred to in the Report

'3R3" be released depending on the necessities of the people and, very

importantly in terms of the existing procedure.s

By 'Pl', the 2nd Respondent Secretary to the PTF informed the 1st Respondent

District Secretary, Mullativu of the recommendations of the Committee. The

letter 'Pl' titled 'Release of Forest Lands for Resettlement of Muslim Families'

sets out the.~everal recommendations of the aforementioned Committee with

regard to selection of persons for the allocation of lands coming within Mannar

as well as Mullathivu and the criteria that should be applied .when selecting

persons.6 The penultimate paragraph of 'Pl~ reads as follows:

"Please consult the Land Commissioner and instruct Divisional Secretaries

to hold the Land Kachcheries on the basis of the recommendations of the

Committee. Once the actual number of landless families is identified,

please submit a request to the Forest Department for release of land at

the above places."

By 'P2' the 2nd Respondent had amended the criteria set out in 'Pl' for the

identification of families who require land for resettlement.

It is in the above factual background that the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the recommendations set out in 'Pl' and 'P2'.

5 Letter dated 22 nd November 2012 sent by the 2nd Respondent to the Secretary, Ministry of Environment, produced by the Respondents marked 'SRS'.

6 In respect of Mannar, the Committee had identified the categories of persons who are eligible to receive lands and the criteria that should be applied in selecting these persons. The Committee had however recommended that the selection of the families be done through a Land Kachcheri.

The first complaint of the Petitioner to this Court is that there is no

Constitutional or Statutory provision to establish the PTF and therefore the

purported exercise of power by the PTF is illegal. This Court observes that the

PTF was established in May 2009 and that this application has been filed only

in February 2013, which is almost 4 years after the establishment of the PTF.

The Petitioner has not explained the delay in invoking the jurisdiction of this

Court. It has~ been consistently held by our Courts that a petitioner must invoke

the jurisdiction of this Court without delay and that any delay must be

explained. The Petitioner has done neither and on this ground alone, the first

complaint of the Petitioner is liable to be rejected.

The direl=tive 'lRi'7 has been issued by the President in terms of the powers

conferred under Article 33(f) of the Constitution8, which reads as follows:

"In addition to the powers, duties and functions expressly conferred or

imposed on, or assigned to him (the President) by the Constitution or by

allY other written law" whether enacted before or after the

commencement of the Constitution, the President shall have the power

to do all such acts and things, not being inconsistent with the provisions

of the Constitution or written law, as by international law, custom or

usage he (the President) is required or authorized to do."

This Court observes that 'lRl' was issued just before the end of the conflict in

order to co-ordinate the social and economic issues that the Government

7 flRl' provides for the "appointment of a task force to take necessary steps for the implementation of the powers vested in His Excellency the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, by Article 33(f) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka."

8 Pursuant to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, similar provision is found in Article 33(2)(h).

would be faced with, after the end of the conflict. The Petitioner has not

referred this Court to the existence of any other agency that has been

entrusted with the said task. Nor has the Petitioner has not referred this Court

to any provision of the Constitution or any written law which has been violated

as a result of the issuance of the directive 'lRl'. In these circumstances, this

Court does not see any illegality with the establishment of the PTF.

, 1

The second complaint of the Petitioner is that the PTF does not have the

power to issue directions to public servants who exercise powers in terms of

legislative provisions and that the direction in 'Pi' to hold a land kachcheri to

identify the recipients is in violation of Section 3 of the Land Development

Ordinance (the Ordinance).

According to Section 3(1)(b} of the Ordinance, it is the Land Commissioner

General who is responsible for the general supervision and control of all

Government Agents and land officers in the administration of State Land. In

terms of Section 20 of the Ordinance, the selection of persons to whom State

land shall be alienated under the Ordinance shall be made at a Land Kachcheri.

This Court observes that the abovementioned powers of the Land

Commissioner General and the procedure set out for the selection of

recipients of State land have not been violated in any manner by the said

instruction provided in 'Pi'. On the contrary, 'Pi' recognizes and reconfirms

the role of the Land Commissioner General as it requests the 2nd Respondent

to "consult the Land Commissioner and instruct the Divisional Secretaries to

hold Land Kachcheries." Thus, this Court finds no merit in the second

compla int of the Petitioner.

6

The next complaint of the Petitioner is that the purported exercise of power by

the PTF is in respect of devolved powers, and is therefore unlawful. Appendix II

of List I to the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution reads as follows:

"State land shall continue to vest in the Republic and may be disposed of

in accordance with Article 33(d) and written law governing this matter.

, 1

Subject as aforesaid, land shall be Provincial Council Subject, subject to

the following special provisions -

1. State Land

1:1 State land required for the purposes of the Government in a Province,

in , respect of a reserved or concurrent subject may be utilised by the

Government in accordance with the laws governing the matter. The

Government shall consult the relevant Provincial Council with regard to

the utilisation of such land in respect of such subject.

1:2 Government shall make available to every Provincial Council State

land within the Province required by such Council for a Provincial Council

subject. The Provincial Council shall administer, control and utilise such

State land, in accordance with the laws and statutes governing the

matter.

1:3 Alienation or disposition of the State land within a Province to any

citizen or to any organisation shall be by the President, on the advice of

7

the relevant Provincial Council, in accordance with the laws governing the

matter.

It is the position of the Petitioner that the PTF is exercising authority in respect

of devolved powers which is contrary to the above provisions of the 13th

Amendment to the Constitution.

This issue has been addressed by the Supreme Court in Solaimuthu Rasu vs.

Superintendent, Stafford Estate and others9 where the Supreme Court held as

follows:

"Appendix II begins with an unequivocal opener -'State Land shall

continue to vest in the Republic and may be disposed of, in accordance

wi,th Article 33 (d) and written laws governing the matter.' This

peremptory declaration is a pointer to the fact that State Land belongs to

the Republic and not to a Province.

The notion of disposition of State Land in accordance with Article 33 (d)

and written laws governing the matter establishes beyond doubt that

dominium over all "State Land" lies with the Republic and not with the

Provincial Councils."

The Supreme Court has held further that 'it cannot be construed that the

advice tendered by the Provincial Council' in terms of paragraph 1:3 of

Appendix II binds the President, and that the power of the President to

alienate or dispose of State Land in terms of Article 33 (d) of the Constitution

9 SC Appeal No. 21/13; SC Minutes of 26

th September 2013.

8

and other written laws remains unfettered, subject to such disposal being in

compliance with the laws enacted by Parliament.

Sripavan J (as he then was), in his judgment in Solaimuthu Rasu has cited the

following paragraph from the determination of the Supreme Court in the Bill

titled "Land Ownership"1o with regard to paragraph 1:3 of Appendix II:

"By such provision the authority for alienation or disposition of the State

land within a province to any citizen or to any organisation was yet vested

with the President"

In these circumstances, this Court does not see any merit in this argument of

the Petitioner.

The Petitioner's final complaint is that the exercise of power by the PTF in

recommending that Land Kachcheris be held for the purpose of resettling

individuals in a particular community is discriminatory. Thus, his complaint is

that he has been discriminated on the basis of his ethnicity, and thereby his

fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 12(1) and (2) of the Constitution has

been violated.

As per Article 126(1)11 read with Article 1712 of the Constitution, the Supreme

Court of Sri Lanka shall have the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and

10 Special Determination Nos. 26/2003 - 36/2003; Determination dated 1ih December 2003 by Shirani A. Bandaranayake J (as she then was).

llArticie 126(1) reads as follows - The Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any question relating to the infringement or imminent infringement by executive or administrative action of any fundamental right or language right declared and recognized by Chapter III or Chapter IV.

9

determine any matters relating to fundamental rights violations and every

person shall be entitled to apply to the Supreme Court in respect of such

infringement or imminent infringement. This Court is of the view that the

Petitioner ought to have invoked the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the

Supreme Court if he was of the view that his fundamental rights protected by

Articles 12(1) and (2) have been violated. The Petitioner has not disclosed

whether he has done so nor has he disclosed the reasons for not doing so.

Be that as it may, this Court would now consider whether the Petitioner has

made out a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of his ethnicity.13

The PTF was established almost at the tail end of the conflict in order to

address the issues that the Government would be faced with in respect of

internally displaced persons, once the conflict ended. It is for this reason that

the PT~ was entrusted with the primary task of preparing strategic plans,

programmes and projects to resettle the internally displaced persons.

Although the role of the PTF extended to the settlement of all internally

displaced persons living within the Northern Province, the necessity for the PTF

to consider the plight of the Muslim community and that too, three years after

the end of the conflict, is borne out by the following paragraph of '2R2':

12 Article17 reads as follows - Every person shall be entitled to apply to the Supreme Court, as provided by Article 126, in respect of the infringement or imminent infringement, by executive or administrative action, of a fundamental right to which such person is entitled under the provisions of this Chapter.

13 Article 126 (3) reads as follows - Where in the course of hearing in the Court of Appeal into an application for orders in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari, prohibition, procedendo, mandamus or quo warranto, it appears to such Court that there is prima facie evidence of an infringement or imminent infringement of the provisions of Chapter III or Chapter IV by a party to such application, such Court shall forthwith refer such matter for determination by the Supreme Court.

10

"a large number of Muslim families who have returned to their villages

after nearly 20 years of displacement are finding it difficult to resettle as

most of them are landless.

One of the major reasons for a considerable number of families not to

take up permanent residence is landlessness."

, t

It is therefore clear that the non-availability of land to settle the internally

displaced persons was a pressing issue for the Government and that the PTF, in

keeping with its mandate, was attempting to resolve the said issue. In the

above background, this Court cannot come to the conclusion that the decision

of the PTF to address the issues of the Muslim community is unreasonable or

illegal.

This is more so when one considers the fact that the Petitioner has not alleged

that the members of the Tamil community were faced with a similar issue. Nor

has the Petitioner complained that the PTF refused to address the issues faced

by the members of the Tamil community who were faced with a similar issue

as the Muslim community. In fact, the Petitioner has not even stated that he

falls within the same category of persons whose grievances were sought to be

addressed through the recommendations of the said committee. The

Petitioner has not produced any documentary proof to establish to the

satisfaction of this Court that he or his father owned land within the Northern

Province or that they were displaced from such lands or even the fact that the

Petitioner has been prevented from returning to his land. In other words, the

Petitioner has not proved to the satisfaction of this Court that he has the locus

standi to have and maintain this application.

11

This Court must observe that the Land Commissioner General has issued

Circular No. 2013/01 titled, 'Accelerated Programme on solving post conflict

State lands issues in the Northern and Eastern Provinces' to all Divisional

Secretaries in the Northern and Eastern Provinces in January 2013. This

Circular, annexed to the petition marked 'P3A' sets out clearly the steps that

must be takf: by the Divisional Secretaries to resolve the outstanding issues of

the people living in the said Provinces with regard to State lands, irrespective

of ethnicity. Thus, a mechanism to address the grievances of all citizens

relating to State land was in place by the time this application was filed.

The fact that the Petitioner is a member of the Seruvila Pradeshiya Sabha

amply demonstrates that the Petitioner has not faced any difficulty in

returning to the Northern Province and carrying on with his life, which was the

same facility the PTF was trying to extend to members of other communities.

This Court is of the view that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that he is

similarly circumstanced as the people whose issues were sought to be

addressed by the PTF or that he was discriminated on the basis of his ethnicity.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any merit in the final

complaint of the Petitioner.

The learned State Counsel has submitted that what is contained in 'Pl' and

'P2' are mere recommendations, which are not liable to be quashed by way of

a Writ of Certiorari. This is in fact borne out by the penultimate paragraph of

'Pl' which required the 1st Respondent to "consult the Land Commissioner and

instruct Divisional Secretaries to hold the Land Kachcheries on the basis of the

12

recommendations of the Committee." Although there is much merit in the said

submission of the learned State Counsel, the necessity for this Court to

consider it does not arise in view of the finding of this Court with regard to 'Pi'

and 'P2'.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue the

Writ of Cert~~rari prayed for. This application is accordingly dismissed, without

costs.
