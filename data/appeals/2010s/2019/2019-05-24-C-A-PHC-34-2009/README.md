The 2nd party respondent-petitioner-appellant filed this appeal seeking to set aside

the order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of

Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Embilipitiya dated 01.04.2009 in Case No.

HCEIRAI24/2008 and seeking to set aside the order of the Learned Magistrate of

Embilipitiya dated 12.08.2008 in Case No. 6067/07.

Facts of the case:

The 1st party respondent-respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

'respondent') made a complaint to the Police Station on 29.05.2007, stating that

the 2nd party respondent-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

'appellant') has stored building materials in a land owned by the respondent.

Page 3 of 8

The complainant-respondent-respondent (pereinafter referred to as the

'complainant-respondent') instituted action in the Magistrate's Court of

Embilipitiya in terms of section 66 (1) (a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No.

44 of 1979. The information was reported to the Magistrate's Court by the

information filed on 14.08.2007. Both parties filed their affidavits and relevant

documents in the Magistrate's Court. The respondent filed his affidavit and

described the land in dispute in the schedule. The appellant stated that he has

stored the building materials in the land described in the schedule to his affidavit.

(Page 92 & 98 of the brief)

Thereafter both parties filed their cross affidavits. The Learned Magistrate by order

dated 12.08.2008 decided that the land described in the affidavit of the respondent

belonged to the respondent and therefore his possession to that land should not be

"" disputed by the appellant. (Page 118 of the brief)

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant preferred a revision application to

the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Embilipitiya and

the Learned High Court Judge affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate (Page

37 of the brief).

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant preferred this appeal.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted following grounds of appeal;

1. The corpus has not being identified by the Learned Primary Court Judge

which has not been rectified in the order of the Learned High Court Judge

2. Both the Learned Primary Court Judge and the Learned High Court Judge

failed to identify that there is a dispossession as per the initial complaint and

the affidavit of the appellant

Page 4 of 8

The infonnation was filed by the complainant-respondent on an alleged breach of . peace in the land and the respondent claimed the right to possess a different land . described in the sketch. The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the

Learned Magistrate misdirected in identifying this difference and ordered the land

in the schedule of the respondent's affidavit to be possessed by the respondent

disregarding the land on which the dispute had arisen as per the infonnation report.

In the case of David Appuhamy V. Yassassi Thero [1987] 1 Sri L.R. 253, it was

held that,

"Although this material was not available to the learned Magistrate at the

time he made the order complained of, on the affidavits filed it should have

been clear that the crux of the dispute between the parties was whether the

corpus w~s Benwalatalawa or Palupanasalawatte. It was, therefore,

incumbent on the Magistrate to have determined the identity of the land

which was the subject matter of this dispute ... "

In light of above it is understood that it is necessary for a Magistrate to consider

the available evidence when there is a question as to the identity of the land. It is

well settled law that this has to be done on the documents submitted by both parties

including plans of the deeds. Accordingly I observe that the ~earned Magistrate

has evaluated such documentary evidence that was tendered by parties. It appears

that the land mentioned in the infonnation report filed by the Police and the land

discribed in the affidavit of the appellant are differnet. Accordingly the Learned

Magistrate has held as follows;

" 60'e5 02 e)25) aJ~(Qe)2:5)~0'cD 92:5)J(Qc.5 q~e) 25)25f 01e)25) aJb(Qe)2:5)~ eg2:Sf253

a)b(gv2S)~ eJ8zsf ~O~ @VC) 8gCDl~2:5f 2S)O CflZS)." (Page 118 of the brief) ,

Upon perusal of the documentary evidence, I fmd that the Learned Magistrate has

come to the correct conclusion.

Learned Counsel for the respondent has submitted that the instant dispute was even

referred to the mediation board and the mediation board has issued a report stating

that the parties failed to come to a settlement.

In the case of Iqbal V. Majedudeen and others (1999) 3 Sri L.R. 213, it was held

that,

"The law recognises two kinds of possession:

(i) When a person has direct physical control over a thing at a given

time - actual possession.

(ii) When he though not in actual possession has both the power and

intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing

either directly or through another person - constructive possession. "

The Learned High Court Judge has further evaluated the documentary evidence

and concluded as follows;

"<E>wl53zsf~2:5fV25") C~ 2S)~~ q~v eZS)OZSd~ v)bd)v eCD)~ 2S)O ~25")~C)

(Page 40 of the brief)

Accordingly the Learned High Court Judge t:efused to interfere with the order of

the Learned Magistrate due to absence of exceptional circumstances. As decided in , the case of Pun chi Nona V. Padumasena and Others (1994) 2 Sri L.R. 117, the

Court is not required to investigate into title or the right to possession which is the

function of a civil Court. The Court is required to take action of a preventive and

provisional nature pending final adjudication of rights in a civil Court.

In the case of M.Roshan Dilruk Fernando V. AG [CA (PH C) 03/2016], it was

held that,

"It is settled law that the extraordinary jurisdiction of revision can be

invoked only on establishing the exceptional circumstances. The requirement

of exceptional circumstances has been held in a series of authorities. Ameen

v. Rasheed 3 CLW 8, Rastom v. Hapangama [19787-79J 2 Sri L R 225,

Cader (on behalf of Rashid Kahan) V s Officer - In - Charge Narcotics

Bureau, [2006J3 Sri LR 74, Colombo Apothecaries Ltd. and others V.

Commissioner of Labour [1998J 3 SriLR 320 are some of the authorities

where it has been emphasized that unless the existences of the exceptional

circumstances are been established in cases where an alternative remedy is

available, revisionary jurisdiction cannot be invoked. .. "(Emphasis add~d)

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and others [2004] 1 Sri L R 284, it was

held that;

"In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience of court. "

Page 7 of 8

I am of the view that the order of the Learnecj Magistrate was well within law and

there was no failure of justice, irregularity or illegality in the said order. Therefore , the Learned High Court Judge was correct in affirming the same. I see no reason to

interfere with both orders. Accordingly I affirm the order of the Learned

Magistrate of Embilipitiya dated 12.08.2008 and the order of the Learned High

Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province holden in

Embilipitiya dated 01.04.2009 in Case No. HCE1RAI24/2008.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
