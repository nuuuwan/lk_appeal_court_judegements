Decided on

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

Bimal Rajapakshe with Amrith Rajapakshe and Muditha Perera and for the Respondent-Petitioner

Chandimal Mendis and Sarasi Paranamanna instructed by Nithi Murugesu and Associates for the Applicant-Respondent

Indula Ratnayake, SC for the 2nd Respondent

05.08.2019

T

his is a matter where the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as

amended by Acts No.58 of 1981, 29 of 1983,45 of 1992 and 29 of 1987 is engaged and

filing an application in the Magistrate's Court of Nuwara Eliya, the Applicant-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as "the Applicant") invoked the provisions of the aforesaid Act

seeking an order to evict the Respondent-Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as "the Petitioner") from the relevant parcel of a state land. On 03.08.2015, the Petitioner

was ordered to show cause. After the Petitioner sought to show cause by filing written

submissions, by order dated 05.10.2015, the learned Magistrate ordered the eviction of

the Respondent-Petitioner.

This revision application has since been preferred against the said order of the learned

Magistrate.

The Respondent-Petitioner had advanced the following main objections ill the

Magistrate's Court.

a. The Applicant-Respondent is not the Competent Authority as per the provisions

of the Act to file the application.

b. The Affidavit filed by the Applicant-Respondent in the Magistrate's Court is

defective.

2

However, the Petitioner advanced the following fresh objections before this Court.

a. The quit notice and the application for ejectment do not describe the subject-

matter with reference to a survey plan or a sketch.

b. The Respondent has failed to state in regard to annexure 'C' that she IS

subjectively speaking that it is State Land.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the Petitioner could not advance

objections which had been submitted before the Magistrate's Court.

Be that as it may, in the course of the argument, the Counsel for the Petitioner informed

this Court that the Petitioner would only pursue the objection that the Applicant-

Respondent had failed to state in annexure 'C' that she was subjectively speaking that

the subject-matter was a state land.

The pith and substance of the objection

The omission of the phrase 'is in my opinion'

The Petitioner argued that the affidavit filed by the Applicant-Respondent in the

Magistrate's Court is not in accordance with From 'C' of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as amended by Act No.29 of 1983 (hereinafter referred to as

"the Act") since paragraph (II) of the said affidavit does not contain the phrase 'is in my

opinion'.

The Petitioner contended that accordingly the said affidavit is not in conformity with

Form 'C' and therefore defective.

The Respondent submitted that the quit notice issued by the Applicant-Respondent is

in accordance with Form 'A' of the Act.

The relevant provisions germane to this application go as follows:-

Section 5

1. Where any person fails to comply with Section 4(b) in respect of any quit notice

issued or exhibited under this Act, any competent authoriry (whether he is or not the

3

competent authority who issued or exhibited such notice) may make an application

in writing in the Form 'B' set out in the Schedule to this Act to the Magistrate's Court

within whose local jurisdiction such land or any part thereof is situated-

a) setting forth the following matters-

(i) that he is a competent authority for the purpose of this Act;

(ii) that the land described in the schedule to the application is in his opinion

State Land;

(iii) that a quit notice was issued on the person in possession or occupation of

such land or was exhibited in a conspicuous place in or upon such land;

(iv) that such person named in the application is in his opinion in unauthorized

possession or occupation of such land and has failed to comply with the

provisions of the aforesaid paragraph (b) of Section 4 in respect of such

notice relating to such land; and

b) Praying for the recovery of possession of such land and for an order of ejectment

of such person in possession or occupation and his dependents, if any, from such

land.

2. Every such application under subsection (1) shall be supported by an affidavit in the

Form 'C set out in the Schedule to this Act verifying the matters set forth in such

application and shall be accompanied by a copy of the quit notice.

3. Every application supported by an affidavit and accompanied by a copy of the quit

notice under the proceeding provisions of this section shall be referred to as an

"application for ejectment".

4. No stamp duties shall be payable for any application for ejectment.

Every such application under Section 5 is required to be supported by an affidavit in

Form 'C to the schedule.

4

Thus Section 5 of the Act authorizes the competent authority to make an application in

the Magistrate's Court in the event a person in unauthorized possession or occupation of

a state land fails to comply with a quit notice. Section 5(1)(a) sets out the contents of the

application whilst Section 5(2) provides that the said application should be supported

by an affidavit in Form 'C verifying the matters set forth in the application.

It has to be noted that the paragraph 2 of the affidavit though does not contain the phrase

'is in my opinion'. It is the Amending Act No.29 of 1983 that brought in the subjective

requirement of an opinion. A careful reading of Section 6(b) of the Amendment Act

No.29 of 1983 demonstrates that Form 'C has to fulfill the following requirements-a) it

has to mention that in the opinion of the competent authority, the land in question is

state land-b) in the opinion of the competent authority, the individual sought to be

evicted is in unauthorised possession. It has to be noted that the Form 'C produced

before the Nuwara Eilya Magistrate's Court by the competent authority has fulfilled the

second limb of Section 6 (b )(ii).

The objection is that the requirement in Section 6 (b) (i) is lacking as the said Form 'C

has to contain the words "in my opinion" when refening to the state land in question. Does

the absence of the words "in my opinion" vitiate the application before Court?

The Court of Appeal decision in Kandiah v. Abeykoon (1986) (3) CALR 41 was cited in

order to drive home the argument that the defective affidavit must be rejected. This was

a case where the body of the affidavit was in accordance with Form 'C of the Act as

amended, while the body of the application was in the Fonn 'B' as it was prior to the

amendment in 1983. Justice Goonewardena (with Siva Selliah, J. agreeing) held that the

papers constituting the application for ejectment should be in the statutorily prescribed

form. The Court held that, "the operation of the Act and its provisions could well have a

serious impact upon proprietary rights. Upon a construction of the statute as a whole,

the form of notice, application and affidavit had therefore to be in strict compliance with

those which the legislature has thought important enough to set out in the schedules

5

before the jurisdiction of the Magistrate to eject a person in possession could be

exercised ."

If the Amending Act has brought in the requirement of the inclusion of the subjective

opinion of the competent authority, it is my view that the legislative decree must be

followed to the letter.

It is pertinent to note that the phrase 'is in my opinion' was introduced by the amendment

Act No.29 of 1983 to the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act-the principal

enactment.

Prior to the amendment in 1983, the application and the affidavit had to provide that the

land had to be 'state land'. However, by the amendment, it was imperative for the

competent authority to submit his opinion that the land was 'state land'.

The affidavit affords evidence before the Magistrate, and the evidence has to be in

accordance with the legislative language. It is this evidence that affords the Magistrate

material that the individual is sought to be ejected from the state land. If this

requirement is missing from the affidavit, the Magistrate is not invested with jurisdiction

to embark on an inquiry to deprive the individual of his proprietary right. It is strict

compliance that has to be insisted upon when the legislature itself has prescribed the

form of the affidavit and the question of substantial compliance would not arise in these

circumstances.

So I uphold the objection taken to the validity of the affidavit and I hold that there was

no proper application before the learned Magistrate as there was no proper affidavit.

Accordingly I would proceed to set aside the order of the learned Magistrate dated

05.10.2015.

This order would not however prejudice the competent authority to initiate proceedings

via a proper application made to Court.
