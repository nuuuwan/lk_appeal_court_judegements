This is a revision application against the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of Colombo

dated 09.06.2015.

The Intervenient Petitioner-Respondent {Intervenient Respondent} was employed by a company

named Fashion Tex International {Pvt} Ltd. He made a complaint to the Complainant-Plaintiff-

Respondent-Respondent-Respondent {Complainant} that his wages had not been paid. After an

inquiry held in terms of section 3D {1} of the Wages Board Ordinance as amended {Ordinance}

the Complainant issued a certificate directing the Defendants-Petitioners-Appellants-Petitioners

{Petitioners} to pay the Intervenient Respondent a sum of Rs. 1,974,140/= as unpaid salaries.

As the Petitioners failed to comply with the said order, the Complainant filed a certificate under

Section 3D {2} of the Ordinance in the Magistrates Court of Nugegoda in the above styled action

to recover the said sum of Rs. 1,974,140/= as a fine.

The Petitioners appeared before the Magistrates Court and objected to the said application. After

inquiry, the learned Magistrate delivered order on 27.08.2013 and directed the recovery of the

said sum from the Petitioners as a fine. The Petitioners thereafter moved by way of revision to

the High Court of Colombo. The learned High Court Judge dismissed the said application and

hence this appeal by the Petitioners.

Scope of Proceedings under Section 3D (2) of the Ordinance

The Ordinance sought to regulate the wages and other emoluments of persons employed in

trades. Section 3D of the Ordinance makes provision for the recovery of arrears of wages in

certain cases. Section 3D {1} ofthe Ordinance allows the Commissioner of Labour {Commissioner}

to assess the wages or the short payment of wages of a worker on the basis of all the evidence

both oral and documentary available to him. Section 3D {2} of the Ordinance provides for the

recovery of the said sum as a fine by issuing a certificate to the Magistrate having jurisdiction.

Section 3D {3} of the Ordinance provides that the correctness of any statement in a certificate

issued by the Commissioner for the purpose of that section shall not be called in question or

examined by the court in any proceedings.

In ascertaining the scope of the proceedings before the Magistrate commenced upon a certificate

filed in terms of section 3D (2) of the Ordinance, it is permissible to consider Acts of Parliament

which are in pari materia. In Crosley v. Arkwright [(1788) 2 T.R. 603, 608, (1788) 100 E.R. 325,

328] Buller J. held that all Acts relating to one subject must be construed in pari materia.

The wording in section 3D (3) of the Ordinance is identical to the wording in section 38(3) of the

Employees' Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958 as amended (EPF Act). I am of the opinion that

the Ordinance and the EPF Act are Acts in pari materia as they deal with labour relations with a

view to safeguarding the interest of the worker.

The provisions in section 38(3) of the EPF Act was interpreted by the Court of Appeal in Attorney

Generol v. City Carriers Ltd. [(1991) 1 Sri. L. R. 227] to mean that the only permissible defences

before the Magistrate are:

(a) Employer has already paid the amount due

(b) The Employer is not the defaulter

(c) The certificate has been filed in a Court which has no jurisdiction to initiate recovery

proceedings

In the appeal the Supreme Court held in City Carriers Ltd. v. The Attorney General [(1992) 2 Sri. L.

R. 257] that the certificate in question did not contain the particulars of the sum claimed and as

such there was no certificate filed before the Magistrates Court in terms of section 38(2) of the

EPF Act and accordingly this is a matter that can be raised by the employer.

In Mohomed Ameer and another v. Assistant Commissioner of Labour [(1998) 1 Sri. L. R. 156] the

Supreme Court after a detailed analysis of the relevant provisions held that in relation to

proceedings initiated under section 38(2) of the EPF Act, two questions arise.

One is the requirement of form which addresses the question whether the certificate filed

sufficiently sets out the particulars required by section 38(2) of the EPF Act. It must name or

otherwise adequately identify the employees in respect of whom the default it alleged and that

(at least) where the default is alleged in respect of a period during which there have been changes

in remuneration and/or rates of contributions, the remuneration in relation to which the

Page 4 of 7

contributions and default has been computed must also be disclosed. Where these particulars

are not contained in the certificate filed, it results in the formal invalidity of the certificate which

is a matter that can be raised before the Magistrate.

The second question is whether the statements in the certificate filed can be challenged which is

referred to as a question relating to proof. Section 38(3) of the EPF Act prevents any such

challenge to the correctness of the statements in the certificate. Accordingly, a person

summoned before the Magistrate is prevented from assailing the certificate on such grounds.

Accordingly, where proceedings are instituted in terms of section 38(2) of the EPF Act, the

available defences for the employee summoned are as follows:

(a) The certificate is not a certificate within the meaning of section 38(2) of the EPF Act as no

proper particulars have been given in the certificate,

(b) Employer has already paid the amount due.

(c) The Employer is not the defaulter.

(d) The certificate has been filed in a Court which has no jurisdiction to initiate recovery

proceedings.

Where there are statutes made in pari materia, whatever has been determined in the

construction of one of them is a sound rule of construction for the other [Craies on Statute Law,

7 th Ed., page 139]. When enacting a new law, the legislature is presumed to have had in

contemplation the existing statues on the same subject, and to have framed its enactment with

reference thereto. This is the real basis for the rule in pari materio; and it is conducive to judicial

discipline to interpret identical provisions in two Acts which are in pari matria, in a similar manner

[Bindra, Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Ed., 845].

Page 5 of 7

Therefore, I am of the view that, where proceedings are instituted in terms of section 3D (2) of

the Ordinance, the available defenses for an employer summoned are as follows:

(a) The certificate is not a certificate within the meaning of section 3D (2) of the Ordinance

as the particulars of the sum claimed and the identification of the employee have not

been given therein.

(b) Employer has already paid the amount due.

(c) The Employer is not the defaulter.

(d) The certificate has been filed in a Court which has no jurisdiction to initiate recovery

proceedings.

The Petitioners inter alia urged the following grounds before the learned Magistrate:

(i) During the purported period of service of the Intervenient Respondent there were

other Directors

(ii) The Intervenient Respondent is not protected by the Ordinance

(iii) During the impugned period the Intervenient Respondent was not working in Sri

Lanka

(iv) There was no contract of employment between Fashion Tex International (Pvt) Ltd.

and the Intervenient Respondent

(v) Fashion Tex International (Pvt) Ltd. does not fall within the Ordinance

(vi) There as no agreement to pay the salary of the Intervenient Respondent in US dollars

None of the grounds urged by the Petitioners before the learned Magistrate fall within the

available defenses for an employer under the Ordinance. The Petitioners should have sought to

assail the certificate issued by the Complainant in appropriate proceedings where administrative

law principles apply and not in recovery proceedings forming the subject matter of this

application if their grievance is that the Complainant exceeded his powers in issuing the relevant

certificate.

The learned High Court Judge correctly held that the Petitioners should have established

exceptional circumstances to succeed in the revision application made to the High Court. They

failed to do so.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge of Colombo dated 09.06.2015.

The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 25,000/=.
