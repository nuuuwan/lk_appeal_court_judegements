Defendant-Appellants.

Plaintiff-Respondents.

Decided on: 08.05.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court to partition the

land described in the schedule to the plaint among the plaintiff

and the 1st-10th defendants. After trial the learned District

Judge entered Judgment as prayed for by the plaintiff. Being

dissatisfied with that Judgment, the 1st defendant and the 12th

defendant have filed separate appeals.

Let me first consider the 12th defendants appeal. His complaint

is that the 6th defendants rights shall devolve on him.

According to the pedigree of the plaintiffs, Hatana, the 6th

defendant, is entitled to 1/6 share of the land. Despite

summons being served, the 6th defendant did not come to Court

at any stage of the case.

When the 13th defendant was giving evidence, the counsel for

the 12th defendant has informed Court that the 6th defendants

said rights have devolved on the 12th defendant by way of deeds

and there is no contest over that matter.1 This assertion made

in open Court has not been disputed by the others. Thereafter,

the counsel for the plaintiffs has marked those deeds as 12D1-

1 Vide page 192 of the brief.

12D3 through the evidence of the 13th defendant without any

objection.2 The 1st defendant in paragraph 5 of his statement of

claim has clearly mentioned those deeds and stated that the 12th

defendant shall be made a party to the case.3 This evidence has

escaped the attention of the learned District Judge when writing

the Judgment. Hence what has been allotted to the 6th

defendant in the Judgment shall go to the 12th defendant. The

Interlocutory Decree to be amended accordingly.

Let me now consider the 1st defendants appeal.

The 1st defendant did not file written submissions. Hence this

Court will be guided by the contents of the Petition of Appeal to

understand the 1st defendants appeal.

The 1st defendant makes two points in the Petition of Appeal.

The first one is that the plaintiffs claimed title on deed P1 from

Sasira, but the 1st defendant produced deeds 1D1 and 1D2

executed in 1918 to show that Sasira had earlier transferred his

rights to some other persons. The 1st defendant in paragraph

6 of his statement of claim has named the said some other

persons as Silva and Peiris, but has not asked the said Silva

and Peiris or his successors if any to be added as parties.4 Even

in evidence the 1st defendant has stated that he was unaware to

whom the rights of Silva and Peiris go.5 Deed P1 has been

executed in 1939, and there is no clear evidence as to what has

happened between 1918-1939. Hence the learned District

Judge cannot be found fault with, when a contest has not been

raised by the successors of Silva and Peiris, for accepting deed

P1 in favour of the plaintiffs.

The second point raised by the 1st defendant in the Petition of

Appeal is that the 13th defendant in the course of the trial

produced Plan 13D1 made in 1934, and according to that Plan,

the plaintiffs cannot maintain this action as there is no common

ownership of the land because parties possessed the land as

separate lots.

The 1st defendant has never taken up such a clear position in

his statement claim or in issues raised at the commencement of

the trial.6 However after the closure of the case for the plaintiff

and at the re-examination of the 1st defendant the counsel for

the 1st defendant for the first time has raised an issue (No.26) to

say that as the corpus has been possessed by the parties as

divided portions for well over 50 years the plaintiffs cannot

maintain this action.7 This has been rightly objected to by the

counsel for the plaintiff, but the learned District Judge has

accepted that issue.8

In my view, the learned District Judge should not have allowed

that issue to be raised at that stage of the case as, on the one

hand, it causes prejudice to the case of the plaintiffs, and, on

the other, it changes the character of the 1st defendants case

presented to Court by way of his statement of claim.

If the corpus has been possessed by the parties as divided lots

for well over 50 years, the 1st defendant should have taken it in

the forefront of his statement of claim and sought dismissal of

6 Vide pages 132-133 of the brief. 7 Vide page 176 of the appeal brief. 8 Vide pages 179-180 of the appeal brief.

the action on that ground alone. He cannot suddenly realize

that important matter after the closure of the case for the

plaintiffs, and at the tail end of his evidence, and raise it as an

issue to spring a surprise to others.

Whether a case is a partition case or otherwise, a party cannot

change the character of his case as he goes along to suit the

occasion. He must present his case at the trial the way he

pleaded in his pleadings and issues raised and his opponent is

prepared to meet. (Candappa nee Bastian v. Ponnambalampillai

[1993] 1 Sri LR 184, Hildon v. Munaweera [1997] 3 Sri LR 220,

YMBA v. Abdul Azeez 1997 BALJ 7, Ranasinghe v. Somawathie

[2004] 2 Sri LR 154)

Explanation 2 to section 150 of the Civil Procedure Code reads

thus: The case enunciated must reasonably accord with the

party's pleading, i.e., plaint or answer, as the case may be. And

no party can be allowed to make at the trial a case materially

different from that which he has placed on record, and which his

opponent is prepared to meet. And the facts proposed to be

established must in the whole amount to so much of the material

part of his case as is not admitted in his opponents pleadings.

In any event, as there was no evidence that parties possessed

separate lots as different entities and all the deeds have been

executed in relation to undivided rights, the learned District

Judge has answered that issue No.26 in the negative.

I see no reason to interfere with that finding.

The 12th defendants appeal is allowed.

The 1st defendants appeal is dismissed.

No costs.
