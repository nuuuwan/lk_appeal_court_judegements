Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendant seeking a

declaration of title to the premises described in the schedule to

the plaint, the cancellation of the Mortgage Bond No. 929

marked P4 upon the plaintiff paying to the defendant moneys

due thereon, ejectment and damages. The defendant filed the

answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs action and a

declaration that the Deed of Transfer No. 928 marked P3 is null

and void. After trial, the learned District Judge entered

Judgment for the plaintiff as prayed for in the prayer to the

plaint. Hence this appeal by the defendant.

The defendant purchased the premises from one Munas for a

sum of Rs. 120,000/= by the deed of transfer marked P2 dated

09.03.1984. The defendant admits borrowing Rs. 175,000/=

from Sugath Kodithuwakku, the Chairman/Managing Director

of the plaintiff company to purchase the premises as the

defendant did not have money.1

By V5 dated 09.03.1984 marked by the defendant, it is clear

that Sugath Kodituwakku has given Rs. 150,000/= to the

defendant as a part payment of the consideration payable by

Sugath Kodithuwakku to the defendant in respect of the resale

of the premises, which was to be purchased by the defendant on

that day. The defendant by V5 has also agreed to handover the

original deed to the plaintiffs Attorney and Notary (Mr. Danny de

Silva) before 4.30 pm on that day. The handwritten

endorsement of the plaintiffs Attorney and Notary found in V5

further establishes that the Notary has received the original deed,

which was marked by the plaintiff as P2. 1 Vide the evidence of the defendant at page 180 of the Brief.

Thereafter the defendant has resold the premises to the plaintiff

by Deed of Transfer marked P3 dated 23.03.1984 for a sum of

Rs. 225,000/=.

As seen from the Mortgage Bond marked P4 of the same date,

out of that consideration, Rs. 50,000/= has been paid by cash at

the time of the execution of the deed and the balance money had

been secured by mortgaging the property to the defendant.

It is the position of the defendant that he never wanted to sell

the premises to the plaintiff, but wanted to mortgage the

premises to the plaintiff as security for repayment of the money

borrowed from the plaintiff to purchase the premises from

Munas. He says that he signed the documents (P3, P4, P10, P11

etc.) in that belief.

This evidence of the defendant has not been believed by the trial

Judge. That is not unreasonable. The defendant is a man who

had been doing a business in Panchikawatta about 30 years. At

the beginning of his evidence he has stated that he knows Tamil

and English, and can speak Sinhala.2 It is not believable a man

of that stature signing a spate of documents without knowing

what he was signing to. All the documents have been signed

before the plaintiffs Attorney and Notary, Mr. Danny de Silva,

who was not among the living at the time of the trial.

The defendants Attorney and Notary is Mr. Kabral. It is Mr.

Kabral who has attested the deed P2 from which the defendant

purchased the property from Munas. If the defendant wanted to

mortgage the property to Sugath Kodithuwakku, he could have

asked Mr. Kabral to do it. Otherwise, if he could not understand

for what he was signing, he could have shown those documents

to Mr. Kabral, who, according to the defendant, was running the

office in the same building about 10-12 yards away from Mr.

Danny de Silvas office.3

If he admittedly borrowed Rs. 175,000/= from Sugath

Kodithuwakku to purchase the property from Munas, did he

repay the money? Admittedly not. He has borrowed the money

in 1984 and the case was filed by the plaintiff 1992. Rs.

175,000/= is a substantial amount at that time. According to

the defendant, he does not know Sugath Kodithuwakku. He

knows only his brother.4 Will an unknown man lend a sum of

Rs. 175,000/= in 1984 to the defendant without any Agreement?

Both the plaintiff and the defendant were not philanthropists,

but veteran businessmen in Punchikawatta although unknown

to each other.

The learned District Judge in my view is correct to have refused

to accept V7, a self-made document by the defendant himself, to

say that he paid interest to that sum to Sugath Kodithuwakku

from time to time. Sugath Kodithuwakku has not signed V7 at

least one time acknowledging receipt of interest. Nor has he

issued a receipt. If he has paid interest, what was the interest

rate, before which date the principal sum of Rs. 175,000/=

should have been returned, where is the Agreement? There is

none. The defendants story is not believable.

If Sugath Kodithuwakku actually wanted to cheat the defendant,

as the defendant now suggests, by getting his signatures to

various documents including to the Deed of Transfer P3 and the

3 Vide the defendants evidence at page 208 of the Brief. 4 Vide the evidence of the defendant at pages 194-196 of the Brief.

5

Mortgage Bond P4, Sugath Kodithuwakku could not have

executed the Mortgage Bond P4 at all. He could have prepared

only the Deed of Transfer P3 and simply stated therein that full

consideration was paid.

The entire case depends on facts and not on law. The full trial

has been conducted before the trial Judge by whom the

Judgment has been delivered.

I see no compelling reason to interfere with the Judgment of the

District Court.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
