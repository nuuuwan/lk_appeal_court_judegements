The Respondent - Petitioner (the Petitioner) has filed this application, seeking

inter alia to revise and set aside the Order made by the Additional District

Judge of Colombo on 14th November 2002 in District Court of Colombo Case

No. 66695/Tax. A copy of the said Order has been annexed to the petition

marked 'P6'.

2

As this application deals with the power of the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue to recover taxes in default under the provisions of the Turnover Tax

Act No. 69 of 1981, as amended (the Act), it would be appropriate at this stage

to examine the powers vested in the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

under the provisions of the Act to recover such taxes in default.

In terms of the Act there shall be charged from inter alia every person who

carries on any business in Sri Lanka,l a tax in respect of the turnover made by

that person from its business, at such rate as the Minister may fix by Order

published in the Gazette. This tax is known as the (Turnover Tax'.

Section 10 of the Act, which specifies the time at which the turnover tax must

be paid and the consequences that flow from non-payment, reads as follows:

liThe turnover tax in respect of any quarter shall be paid not later than the

fifteenth day of the month following the end of that quarter. Any tax not

so paid shall be deemed to be in default and the person by whom such tax

is payable or where any tax is payable by more than one person, or by a

partnership then each of such persons and each partner in the

partnership shall be deemed to be a defaulter for the purposes of this

Act."

Section 12(1) specifies the manner in which turnover tax must be paid in

respect of imported goods, and reads as follows:

1 Turnover tax was payable during the period commencing from 13th November 1981 to 31" December 1981 and for every quarter commencing on or after l't January 1982 but prior to the date on which the Goods and Services Tax Act, No. 34 of 19% came into operation.

3

"Notwithstanding anything in this Act, there shall be charged from every

person who imports, prior to the date on which the Goods and Services

Tax Act, No. 34 of 1996 comes into operation, any article manufactured

outside Sri Lanka (not being an excepted article within the meaning of

section 8), turnover tax in respect of his turnover, whether his turnover

for any quarter is less than the amount specified in section 3 or not, at the

rates specified by the Minister under section 7 and shall be collected by

the Principal Collector of Customs."

The procedure to issue an assessment in respect of tax in default, the right of

the tax payer to appeal against such assessment to the Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue, and against such decision of the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue to the Board of Review and the right of the tax payer to have a

Case Stated to this Court are set out in Sections 13 - 19 of the Act.

Chapter XII of the Act contains provisions for the recovery of taxes which are in

default. In terms of Section 31, "any turnover tax in default shall be a first

charge (on) all the assets of the defaulter." Section 32 specifies that "where

any turnover tax is in default, the Commissioner-General shall, before

proceeding to recover such tax, issue notice in writing to the defaulter stating-

a) the particulars of such tax; and b) that action is being contemplated to

recover such tax."

Section 33 of the Act contains provisions for the recovery of the tax in default

by the sale and seizure of assets belonging to the person liable for the payment

of the turnover tax - i.e. the defaulter.

4

Section 34(1) of the Act provides for the filing of action "where the

Commissioner-General is of the opinion that recovery of turnover tax in default

by seizure and sale is impracticable or inexpedient, or where the full amount of

the tax has not been recovered by seizure and sale." Section 34(1) proceeds to

state that the Commissioner General may "issue a certificate containing

particulars of such tax and the name and last known place of business or

residence of the defaulter to a Magistrate havrng jurisdiction in the division in

which such place is situate" and that "the Magistrate shall thereupon summon

such defaulter before him to show cause why further proceedings for the

recovery of the tax should not be taken against him". In default of sufficient

cause being shown, the tax in default shall be deemed to be a fine imposed by

a sentence of the Magistrate on such defaulter.

Thus, it was within the power of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

to file action to recover the sum in default and there is no dispute between the

parties that the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue in fact had such

power.

Section 35(1) of the Act reads as follows:

"Where the turnover tax payable by any person is in default and it

appears to the Commissioner-General to be probable that any person-

(a) owes or is about to pay money to the defaulter or his agent; or

(b) holds money for or on account of the defaulter or his agent; or

5

(c) holds money on account of some other person for payment to the

defaulter or his agent; or

(d) has authority from some other person to pay money to the defaulter

or his agent,

the Commissioner-General may give to such person notice in writing (a

copy of which shall be sent by post to the defaulter) requiring him to pay

any such moneys not exceeding the amount of the tax in default to the

officer named in such notice. The notice shall apply to all such moneys

which are in his hands or due from him at the date of receipt of such

notice, or come into his hands or become due from him or are about to

be paid by him at any time within a period of three months after the date

of such notice."

Section 35(3) of the Act sets out the obligation on the part of the person

receiving such notice, and reads as follows:

"Where any person to whom a notice has been given under subsection (1)

is unable to comply therewith owing to the fact that moneys in question

do not come into his hands or become due from him within the period

referred to in subsection (1), he shall within fourteen days of the

expiration thereof give notice in writing to the Commissioner-General

apprising him of the facts."

Having laid out the applicable provisions of the Act, this Court would briefly

examine the facts of this application.

6

The Petitioner is a company registered under the provisions of the Companies

Act No. 12 of 1987. This being an application filed in 2002, the Petitioner has

not filed proof that it has been re-registered as required by Section 487 of the

Companies Act No.7 of 2007. The Respondent however has not challenged the

legal status of the Petitioner to continue with this application.

The Petitioner states that the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

instituted the abovementioned action against the Petitioner for the recovery

of turnover tax in default by filing a certificate dated 31 st August 2001 under

the provisions of the Act. The said Certificate of Tax in default has been

annexed to the petition marked 'P2'. By 'P2', the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue had sought to recover a sum of Rs. 1,281,019 being the

turnover tax due for the 3rd quarter of 1995, 1996 and 1997, together with the

penalty.

The Petitioner states that it appeared before the District Judge of Colombo on

notice and that the learned District Judge afforded the Petitioner an

opportunity of showing cause as to why further proceedings for the recovery

of taxes should not be taken. The Petitioner had accordingly done so by filing

an affidavit of one of its Directors, Mrs. Indranee Peiris, which has been

annexed to the petition marked 'P3'. The annexures to the said affidavit had

been marked 'Xl' - 'X10'.

This Court has examined 'P3' and it does not appear that the Petitioner is

challenging its liability to make the said payment. In fact, as noted earlier,

recovery proceedings are filed only after the issuance of an assessment for the

unpaid tax and the appeal process provided for in the Act has been completed.

This Court observes that the explanation offered by the Petitioner by way of

7

'P3' is as follows. Mrs. Peiris states that in terms of a notice published by the

Divisional Secretary of Kolonnawa under Section 38 of the Land Acquisition

Act, a land situated in Wellampitiya in extent of 22 acres belonging to her late

husband, Mr. H.C.Peiris had been vested in the State. Mrs. Peiris states further

that the Cabinet of Ministers had determined in 1991 that her husband should

be paid a sum of Rs. 132 million as compensation. Although an initial payment

had been made, no steps had been taken thereafter to make any further

payment.

Mrs. Peiris had stated further that the Department of Inland Revenue had sent

the following letter dated 11th July 1995 marked 'X6' to the Divisional

Secretary, Colombo:

II TAXES IN ARREARS RS. 6,554,192/-

TOURINNS OF CEYLON LTD.

Mr. H.C. Peiris has brought to my notice that compensation is receivable

by him in respect of commercial land acquired by the Government.

Acquisition Order has been gazetted in the Gazette No. 745/3 of

14/12/92. Copy of the relevant Gazette Notification is sent herewith. As

Mr. Peiris has agreed with me that the tax outstanding could be collected

from the compensation payable, I would be thankful if arrangements are

made to remit the amount of tax outstanding to the Department of Inland

Revenue.

Please note not to release any monies without referring the matter to the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue. A copy of the letter received

from Mr. H.C. Peiris is attached herewith and further a notice under

8

Section 131 of the Inland Revenue Act to collect this money as default

taxes is also enclosed herewith."

There are two matters that this Court must observe at this stage. The first is

that 'X6' is only a covering letter and that the Certificate itself, which is said to

have been annexed to 'X6' but has not been produced with 'P3' has been

issued under Section 131 of the Inland Revenue Act. The second matter is that

the defaulter of turnover tax was the Petitioner in this application, whereas

compensation was due and payable to a Director of the Petitioner. However,

what is clear from 'X6 is that the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue had

written the said letter upon being provided the relevant information by Mr.

H.C. Peiris.

Mrs. Peiris states that by a notice dated 1ih January 1999 marked 'X7', the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue had informed the Divisional

Secretary Colombo as follows:

"1983/84, 92/93 ~<:.:) ~CS Q)~ e>(5)(!OO ge>6 ~e:D OOfcl CO<!@Je:D C)el ~Se:D

@l(S)E)<:.:) ~ Ol;&"@ CS)l;C) ~ @~ oenQCS)rnot;,(5)Q ~ ~~<!t;,&l) -Ol;.

6,154,192/ - &l) ~t;,@&lS @len)<!(S)e O(;CS)l;O ~O ~l;ffi Q)l;~~oS 11)Q) .. "

This Court must observe that 'X7' relates to the payment of income tax for the

aforementioned period whereas the Certificate marked 'P2' relates to turnover

tax in default.

Mrs. Peiris states further that her husband who was the Chairman of the

Petitioner, had filed CA (Writ) Application No. 1225/2000 seeking inter alia a

Writ of Mandamus to proceed with the inquiry under Section 9 of the said Act

9

to determine the exact quantum of compensation that was due to himl and

that this Courtl by its judgment delivered on gth May 2002 had granted the

relief prayed for in the said application. She had stated further that as a result

of the said judgmentl there should be a substantial increase in the quantum of

compensation payable. In view of thisl Mrs. Peiris had informed the

Department of Inland Revenue by letters dated ih June 2000 and 6th

December 2000 marked as 'X8 1 and 'Xgl respectivelYI that the tax in default

could be recovered from the compensation payable to her.

The crux of the defence presented by the Petitioner to the District Court

therefore was that since the Department of Inland Revenue had already taken

steps by way of 'X6 1 and 'XT to secure the sums of money due to itt on account

of unpaid Turnover Tax, the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue is

estopped from taking steps to recover the same sum of money through a

recovery action filed in the District Court.

The learned District Judgel having considered the above arguments of the

Petitioner and the material presented by the Petitioner in support of the said

arguments, rejected the said defence and held by his Order marked 'P61 that

the Petitioner is liable to make the said payment to the Department of Inland

Revenue. Dissatisfied with the said Order 'P611 the Petitioner filed this

application seeking to revise and set aside the said Order.

This Court has examined the Order of the learned District Judge and observes

that the learned District Judge had overruled the objections of the Petitioner

on the following grounds:

10

(a) The two letters relied on by the Petitioner, namely 'X6' and 'X7' do not

relate to turnover tax;

(b) In any event, the validity period of such notices is 3 months, and by the

time the Certificate 'P2' was filed, the said letters 'Xl' and 'X8' had

expired; and

(c) The provisions of Section lS0(2)(c) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of

2000, which the Petitioner claimed was applicable, do not apply.

It is the position of the Petitioner that the learned District Judge erred in

respect of each of the above three positions. This Court would therefore

consider each of the above matters.

'Xl' had been issued on 1ih January 1999, under Section 131 of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979. Section 131 is identical to the provisions

contained in Section 3S of the Turnover Tax Act and can only be resorted to, to

recover income tax that is in default. 'Xl' could not have been issued in respect

of turnover taxes in default. 'X7' specifically sets out that the amount sought to

be recovered relates to the taxes in default for the years 1983/84, and

1992/93. These periods are prior to the period for which turnover tax in

default is sought to be recovered by 'P2'. This Court is therefore in agreement

with the learned District Judge that the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue had not sought to secure the payment of turnover tax by way 'Xl'.

'X6' has been issued in 1995 in respect of "taxes in arrears". While it is correct

that 'X6' does not specify what the taxes in arrears are, this Court observes

that at the time 'X6' was issued, the turnover tax in default could only have

11

been for the 3rd quarter of 1995. Thus, even if 'X6' contained a component of

turnover tax in default, it did not contain the entirety of the tax in default

specified in the Certificate 'P2'. What is significant however is that notice had

been given under Section 131 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 28 of 1979 and

not under Section 35 of the Turnover Tax Act. The fact that no reference has

been made in 'X6' to Section 35 of the Act is clear evidence that 'X6' did not

relate to turnover tax in default.

The second ground on which the learned District Court Judge had rejected the

explanation given by the Petitioner was that in any event, a notice issued

under Section 35 of the Turnover Act or Section 131 of the Inland Revenue Act

is valid only for a period of 3 months. 2

This Court is in agreement with the position of the learned District Judge that a

notice issued under Section 35 (1) of the Act is valid only for a period of 3

months from the date of issue. It is in fact logical to specify a time period as

the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue is not expected to go into deep

slumber after issuing a notice under Section 35(1). If the taxes in default which

are sought to be recovered is not forthcoming, then the Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue may pursue other modes of recovery specified in the Act.

Thus, this Court is of the view that by the time the Certificate 'P2' was filed in

2001, the notices 'X6' and 'Xl' had lapsed and there was no legal impediment

to the filing of 'P2/.

2 Vidf' Section 35(1), which specifie', that: "The notice shall apply to all such moneys which are in his hands or due from him at the date of receipt of such notice, or come into his hands or become due from him or are about to be paid b'{ him at any time within a period of three months after the date of such notice."

12

The Petitioner argues that in terms of Section 35(3) of the Act3 if the person to

whom a notice has been given under Section 35(1) of the Act4 is unable to

comply therewith owing to the fact that moneys in question do not come in to

such persons hands or become due from him within the period referred to in

Section 35(1) of the Act, he shall within fourteen days of the expiration

thereof, give notice in writing to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

apprising him of the facts. The Petitioner argues that no such notice has been

given and therefore Certificate 'P2' could not have been issued. While this

Court is of the view that the failure on the part of the recipient of a notice

under Section 35(1) to acknowledge the said notice attracts the consequences

set out in Section 35(4) of the Act, the said argument of the Petitioner cannot

be sustained in view of the finding of this Court that the validity period of 'X6'

and 'X7' is only 3 months.

The liability of the Petitioner to pay turnover taxes in default is in terms of the

Act. It is independent of any compensation that the Petitioner or its Directors

should get from the State. The provisions of the Act make it clear that the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue has been conferred with a choice of

methods by which he can recover the turnover taxes in default. It is the view of

this Court that the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue can exercise any

one or more of such methods, either singularly or collectively, in order to

secure payment of the tax in default as long as such a course of action ensures

the expeditious recovery of the taxes in default, provided of course that the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue shall not be entitled to recover more

than what is actually in default. If one method is not successful, the

l Corrc<;ponding Section In the Inland Revenue Act is Section 131(3).

Corre<;ponding Section In the Inland Revenue Act is Section 131(1).

13

III

Commissioner General is entitled in terms of the law to pursue another mode

of recovery specified in Chapter XII of the Act.

The final submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that Section

lS0(2)(c) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000 would prevent the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue from proceeding against the

Petitioner. This Court is in agreement with the learned District Judge that the

provisions of the said Act has no application where Turnover Tax is sought to

be recovered, and that in any event, the said Act applies only with regard to

income derived on or after 1st April 2000. Furthermore, the facts of this case

does not attract the provisions of Section lS0(2)(c).

The learned State Counsel has drawn the attention of this Court to the fact

that the power of revision vested in this Court can only be exercised where the

Petitioner had established exceptional circumstances and has cited the

following passage from the judgment of this Court in Dharmaratne and

Another vs Palm Paradise Cabanas Limited and Others5 where it was held as

follows:

"Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the Court

selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of

rectification should be adopted. If such selection process is not there,

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court will become a gateway of every

litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a revision application, or to

make an appeal in situations where the legislature has not given a right of

appeal."
