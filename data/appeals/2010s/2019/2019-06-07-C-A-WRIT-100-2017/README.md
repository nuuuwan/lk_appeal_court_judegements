The Petitioner is the donee of the land morefully described in the deed of gift no. 3734 dated

30.07.2016 (Pi). The Petitioner submitted an application and paid the service connection fees to

the 1st Respondent to obtain an electricity connection to the house situated on the said land (P4).

He further paid Rs. 15,960/= as the security deposit and service connection charge to the 1st

Respondent (P5).

The 11th Respondent, to whom the power has been delegated in terms of the Sri Lanka Electricity

(Amendment) Act No. 31 of 2013 to hold inquires regarding disputes that may arise in connection

with the supply of electricity, held an inquiry into the application of the Petitioner and by letter

dated July 2016 (P6) recommended to supply electricity to the Petitioners premises.

The 11th Respondent submitted his recommendations to the Public Utilities Commission as well

for the supply of electricity to the Petitioners premises which was approved (P7). However, the

Petitioner claims that he has not yet been supplied with electricity and moves that a writ of

mandamus is issued compelling the 1st to 9th Respondents to supply electricity to the Petitioners

premises.

The 1st to 9th Respondents do not dispute the material facts. They explain the circumstances

leading to the delay in supplying electricity to the premises of the Petitioner and concludes by

stating that when the 1st Respondent was attempting to install pylons in the proximity of the

Petitioner's premises, the Railways Department had objected to drawing the line across the

identified route to the premises of the Petitioner claiming that "the venue of the Petitioner forms

part of the railway reservation". They state further that the pt Respondent has temporarily

suspended the process until the matter has been resolved between the Petitioner and the

Railways Department.

Section 25(1) of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009 states that a distribution licensee shall

on any request by the owner or occupier of any premises within the Authorized Area of the

licensee connect, supply and maintain the supply of electricity to those premises and connect,

supply and maintain the supply of electricity to those premises. The word "occupier" in an act

pari materia, namely section 33(1) of the Electricity Act, No. 19 of 1950, was interpreted by

Vythialingam J. in Municipal Council of Badulla v. Ratnayake [(1978-79) 2 SrLL.R. 141] to mean a

lawful occupier and not, for instance, a mere squatter. Hence if there was any evidence that the

Petitioner is in fact a squatter on the premises to which the electricity is requested this Court

would have had to consider whether a squatter or an unauthorized occupant is entitled to obtain

an electricity connection to the land on which he is a squatter or an unauthorized occupant.

However, in the instant case the Petitioner has produced a certified copy of the order made in

M.e. Colombo Case No. 0/13210/5/14 where the General Manager Railways instituted

proceedings in terms of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act against the donor of Pl. The

said order indicates that the application of the General Manager Railways was dismissed. There

is no material before Court on whether any revision application was preferred against the said

dismissal.

In the aforesaid circumstances there is no evidence before Court to establish that the Petitioner

is a squatter or an unauthorized occupant on the land to which the electricity connection is

sought.

I see no valid legal reason for not providing an electricity connection to the Petition to the

premises described above.

Electricity is no longer a luxury but an essential matter for every citizen to lead a comfortable life.

In terms of Article 27(2)(c) of the Constitution the State is pledged to establish a Democratic

Socialist Society which includes the objectives of the realization by all citizens of an adequate

standard of living for themselves and their families and the continuous improvement of living

conditions. The pt Respondent is under a statutory duty to provide an electricity connection to

the owner or occupier of any premises within its Authorized Area provided all the legal

requirements are satisfied. Failure to perform the statutory duty of supplying electricity can be

compelled by a writ of mandamus. [G.c.A. Corea v. The Urban Council Kotte and Others (62 N.L.R.

60), Gunaratne and another v. Ceylon Electricity Board and Others (1991) 1 SrLL.R. 239].

Accordingly, this Court issues a writ of mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to supply

electricity to the Petitioners premises forthwith. The pt Respondent will pay the Petitioner a sum

of Rs. 50,000/= as costs of this case.
