M. M. A. Gaffoor, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiffs) filed the

above styled action in the District Court of Kandy seeking a declaration of title

to the land and building described in the Schedule to the plaint, to have the

Defendants ejected therefrom and to obtain an order preventing the 2nd

Defendant from handing over the said building to the 1st Defendant and for

costs.

The Plaintiffs in their joint plaint averred that,

a. The Plaintiffs were the owners of the land in suit;

b. The Plaintiffs and their predecessors in title had rented the premises in

suit to the 1st Defendant-Appellant company;

c. With the establishment of the Ceylon Transport Board (hereinafter

referred to as CTB) (the 2nd Defendant-Respondent) in or around

4

1957-1958, premises No. 76, Trincomalee Street, Kandy was

requisitioned by the CTB; and

d. The Appellant is now challenging the ownership of the Plaintiffs and

claiming rights to the premises in suit.

Whereas, the 1st Defendant-Appellant Company filing amended answer dated

25th September 1992 claimed prescriptive title to the premises in suit and

pleading inter alia that,

a. William Brothers Ltd., the 1st Defendant-Appellant Company which was

originally a partnership comprising of members of the Jayawikrama

family which had been in possession of these premises for well over 50

years;

b. The said Partnership possessed up to 1947, and thereafter, the

Company was in possession until the premises were requisitioned as

aforesaid.

After the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge of Kandy delivered

judgment on 18th June 1999, in favour of the Plaintiffs in terms of the plaint.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the 1st Defendant-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) has preferred this appeal to set

aside the judgment dated 18th June 1999.

At the District Court trail, the Plaintiffs had set out their title fully in the plaint

and stated that the 1st Plaintiffs father had given the said building bearing No.

76, Trincomalee Street, Kandy on rent to William Brothers Company which

was ran a bus and a collecting services. Thereafter, the said building was taken

over by the CTB and it was in the exclusive possession of the CTB. They further

5

stated that the said father of the 1st Plaintiff had been waiting for the CTB to

call for his title but the CTB did not do so. When he came to know that the CTB

was giving back the building he wrote to the relevant Minister by a letter

which has been marked as P7.

Although, the Appellant was submitted that no tenancy agreement, whether a

formal agreement of any other document as to the existences of tenancy had

been produced by the Plaintiffs, and the Appellant Company further stated

that the Plaintiffs have failed and or were unable to state even what the rent

that was allegedly charged by them, and they Plaintiffs failed to establish any

instances of payment of rent by or on behalf of William Brothers the

Appellant. To answer this argument, the Plaintiffs stated in the District Court

that the documentary proof on payment of rent was destroyed by fire due to

civil commotion. And they further state that at the time when the 1st Plaintiffs

evidence was recorded these issues had not been raised.

After careful perusal of the statement of claims and the answer of the

Appellant, it is clear that they had not pleaded any title; they only pointed out

few enigmas on the Plaintiff side and directly claimed for prescriptive title. In

paragraph 5, the Appellant had stated that the Appellant had given the said

building on rent for a period of 30 years and had recovered rent. However, the

Respondents position is that statement on the rent that recovered by the

Appellant is incorrect. They further stated that no payment of rent was made

by the CTB from the year 1958. It was in the year 1991 on the orders of the

CTB that the rent from the year 1958 was calculated and paid to the Appellant

after deducting the amount paid as rates and expenditure incurred in the

repairs. They also stated that this had taken place without informing the

Plaintiffs who had requested the release of the buildings.

6

It is important to note that a perusal of the Deeds marked by the Plaintiffs

show an unavoidable fact that the land and premises described in the

schedule (No. 76, earlier No. 43 &43) possessed by them in different period of

times. Therefore, this fact suggested that they have a clear paper title.

However, the only position taken up by the Appellant is that they have

prescribed to the premises claimed by the Plaintiffs.

A person who claims prescriptive title against the rightful owner who has the

paper title has a very heavy burden to prove all the requirements prescribed

in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. Mere possession over ten years is

not prescriptive possession. The possession shall be by title adverse to or

independent of that of the rightful owner. "A facile story of walking into

abandoned premises after the Japanese air raid constitutes material far too

slender to found a claim based on prescriptive title." (Sirajudeen vs. Abbas

[(1994) 2 SLR 365] per G.P.S. de Silva C. J.)

There is another important point to be noted that, Where a party invokes the

provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the

ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof

rests squarely and fairly on him to establish a starting point for his or her

acquisition of prescriptive rights." (Sirajudeen vs. Abbas [1994] 2 SLR 365 at

370. See also Chelliah vs. Wijenathan (1951) 54 NLR 337 at 342, Reginald

Fernando vs. Pabilinahamy [2005] 1 SLR 31 at 37, Mitrapala vs. Tikonis Singho

[2005] 1 SLR 206 at 211-212).

7

In all the circumstances, I am in a firm view that the Prescriptive claim of the

Appellant cannot stand. The District Judge has analyzed the documentary

evidence as per the standard of balance of probabilities and correctly held

with Plaintiffs.

Therefore, I do not wish to interfere with the judgment dated 18th June 1999.

Judgment of the District Court is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed with

costs.

Appeal dismissed.
