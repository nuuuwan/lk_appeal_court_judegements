ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (later substituted and

hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant") invokes appellate jurisdiction of

this Court, seeking to set aside an order of the Provincial High Court of

Southern Province holden in Galle, dated 23.09.2009 in case No. H.C. Galle

Rev 645/08 .

. In the said revision application, the Appellant sought to revise an

order of demolition made against him by the Magistrate's Court of Galle,

upon an application by the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent") who sought an order under

2

f I

Section 28A(3) of the Urban Development Authority Act No. 41 of 1978 as

amended. It is alleged by the Respondent that the Appellant has engaged

in development activity in a development area, namely at premises

bearing assessment No. 137, Colombo Road, Kaluwella, Galle~ without a

valid permit.

At the inquiry before the Magistrate's Court, it was asserted by the

Appellant that the building standing on said premises was destroyed by

the Tsunami of 2004 and at a subsequent stage 0.0033 Hectares of his land

was acquired for widening of the main road. He sought approval 1/ to carry

out repair work" to the damaged building, but the Galle Municipal

Council has "refused" to accept his plan for construction. He further

claimed that he "expects" to obtain the necessary approval from the

Municipal Council.

The Magistrate's Court, having noted that the Appellant himself

admitted that there was no permit for the development work he had

carried out, issued an order of demolition as sought by the Respondent.

In its impugned order, the Provincial High Court noted that the

Appellant did not claim that he did not receive the notice issued by the

Respondent dated 29.09.2006 under Section 28A(3) of the Urban

Development Authority Act or has complied with the said notice. The

Court also noted that the Appellant had no permit to engage in

3

development activity. The Court had then proceeded to dismiss his

application. The Appellant lodged an appeal against the order of

dismissal.

At the hearing of the appeal on 7.11.2018, parties indiCated their

willingness to dispose this appeal upon filing of written submissions. This

Court then allowed the parties to tender written submissions on or before

28.01.2019. However, regrettably neither party was interested in filing any

submissions and there was no motion seeking extension of time. This

Court would nonetheless consider the Appellant's appeal on its merits.

The Appellant, in the averment No. 13 in his affidavit tendered to

the Magistrate's Court, clearly admitted that he "expects" to obtain

necessary approval for the construction. The report on his unauthorised

construction indicates that the Appellant had demolished the old building

and commenced a new construction. It is also stated therein that the new

construction could not be approved since there was no prior approval

obtained from the Coast Conservation Department. The correspondence

tendered by the Appellant, in support of his affidavit also confirms this

position.

In these circumstances, this Court notes that the Appellant has

commenced and continued his development activity within a development

area without a valid permit and therefore of the view that the Magistrate's

Court has correctly issued an order under Section 28A(3) of the Urban

Development Authority Act. We are in agreement with the determination

4

of the Provincial High Court that the order of demolition is a legally valid

order and therefore the Appellant is not entitled to any relief. This is a

correct finding by the Provincial High Court, upon the material present

before it.

The appeal of the Appellant is clearly without any merit. We affirm

the orders of the Magistrate's Court and the Provincial High Court.

Accordingly, the appeal of the Appellant is dismissed with costs

fixed at Rs. 25,000.00.
