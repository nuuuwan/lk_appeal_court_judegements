This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Moneragala

dated 29.11.2000.

The Plaintiff-Appellant (Appellant) instituted the above styled action and sought a declaration of

title to the land more fully described in the schedule to the plaint, a declaration that the Appellant

is entitled to possess the said land and building, order of eviction ofthe Defendants-Respondents

(Respondents) and their agents and servants from the said land and damages.

The Appellant claimed that he had been in undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the said

land against the State and all others for a period of over 35 years and as such had obtained

prescriptive title. It was further stated that steps had been taken under the State Lands (Recovery

of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as amended (Act) in M.e. Moneragala Case No. 54018/95 against

the Appellant for the said land and an order of eviction made on 09.01.1996.

The Respondents claimed that the land in dispute is state land and denied that the Appellant had

obtained prescriptive title to the said land.

The learned Additional District Judge dismissed the action and hence this appeal.

Parties have taken up disparate positions on the nature of the action in that the Appellant claims

it is an action instituted in terms of section 12 of the Act [Additional Written Submissions dated

30.05.2019 paragraph 5] whereas the Respondents contend that it is neither a rei vindicatio

action nor an action in terms of section 12 of the Act. The learned Additional District Judge held

that it is not an action filed in terms of section 12 of the Act as the Appellant was not evicted.

Rei Vindicatio Action

Reclame or Rei vindicatio is the action which arises under the head of property. It lies for the

owner of anything movable or immovable, corporeal or incorporeal, against the possessor or,

any person who has mala fide divested him of the possession to deliver it up to the owner with

all its fruits then in existence and those which the mala fide possessor has already enjoyed, or

Page 2 of 11

might have enjoyed under the deduction, however, of the costs and charges of the possessor in

the thing [V.d.L.1.7.3J.

Marsoof J. in Lathee! v. Mansaor [(2010) 2 Sri.L.R. 333 at 350J sought to explain the origins of the

actio rei vindicatio and its contemporary expression as follows:

"Clearly, the action for declaration of title is the modern manifestation of the ancient

vindicatory action (vindicatio rei), which had its origins in Roman Law. The actio rei

vindicatio is essentially an action in rem for the recovery of property, as opposed to a

mere action in personam, founded on a contract or other obligation and directed against

the defendant or defendants personally, wherein it is sought to enforce a mere personal

right (in personam), The vindicatio form of action had its origin in the legis actio procedure

which symbolized the claiming of a corporeal thing (res) as property by laying the hand

on it, and by using solemn words, together with the touching of the thing with the spear

or wand, showing how distinctly the early Romans had conceived the idea of individual

ownership of property. As Johannes Voet explains in his Commentary on the Pandects

(6.1.1) "to vindicate is typically to claim for oneself a right in reo All actions in rem are

called vindications, as opposed to personal actions or conductions.""

Although the Appellant claimed in the plaint that he was dispossessed from the land in dispute

in evidence he admitted that he continues to be in possession of the said land despite the

Magistrates Court of Moneragala issuing an order of eviction as the said order was not enforced

[Appeal brief page 26J.

The question arises then whether the Appellant can maintain a Rei vindicatio action given that

the formulation of Voet set out earlier implies that dispossession is a requirement for such an

action. But it has been held that in an action Rei vindicatio, where the defendant contests the

plaintiff's title, but denies ouster, and no ouster is proved, there is no objection to a decree,

subject to an appropriate order as to costs, merely declaratory of the plaintiff's title to the

property claimed as against the defendant, if such title be established [Terunnanse v. Dias (7

S.c.c. 145J.

Page 3 of 11

However later in Pathirana v. Jayasundara (58 N.L.R. 169 at 172) Gratiaen J. appears to state that

dispossession is a requirement for the action to be maintained. In fact, in Theivandran v.

Ramanathan Chettiar [(1986) 2 SrLL.R. 219 at 222] Sharvananda C.J. held:

"In a vindicatory action the claimant need merely prove two facts; namely, that he is the

owner of the thing and that the thing to which he is entitled to possession by virtue of

his ownership is in the possession of the defendant. Basing his claim on his ownership,

which entitles him to possession, he may sue for the ejectment of any person in

possession of it without his consent. Hence when the legal title to the premises is

admitted or proved to be in the plaintiff, the burden of proof is on the defendant to show

that he is in lawful possession." (emphasis added)

This principle was re-stated in Luwis Singha and Others v. Ponnamperuma [(1996) 2 SrLL.R. 320].

In these circumstances, it is difficult to hold that the Appellant can maintain this action as a rei

vindicatio action as he was not dispossessed.

Contrary to the above legal position, if the Appellant can maintain such an action it is established

that an actio rei vindicatio can be brought against even the State [Le Mesurier v. The Attorney-

General (5 N.L.R. 65].

Therefore, absence of any change in this position under common law and if the position set out

in Pathirana v. Jayasundara (supra), Theivandran v. Ramanathan Chettiar (supra) and Luwis

Singho and Others v. Ponnamperuma (supra) does not reflect the correct legal position, the

Appellant can maintain an actio rei vindicatio against the State given that the State is contesting

the title of the Appellant to the land in dispute.

The question that arises then is whether the Act has changed this position in common law in that

a statute may extend the common law to cases which it did not cover, or may restrict or exclude

its operation as to cases which it did cover, or may merge it wholly in the statute law, e.g. by

codification [Craies on Statute Law, 7th Ed. (2 nd Indian Reprint 2002), 338].

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

The Act was intended to provide the State with an expeditious process to recover possession of

state land from persons in unauthorized or unlawful occupation thereof. The main Act did not

have a definition of what was meant by "unauthorized possession or occupation". The Act was

amended by State Lands (Recovery of Possession) (Amendment) Act No. 29 of 1983 and one of

the amendments was to include a new definition of the word" unauthorized possession or

occupation" to mean "except possession or occupation upon a valid permit or other written

authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law and includes possession or

occupation by encroachment upon state land".

The Act while providing the State with an expeditious method to recover possession of State land,

also provided a safeguard in sections 12 and 13 which reads as follows:

"13. Where an action instituted under section 12 by any person against the

State for vindication of title to any land from which he has been ejected under

this Act has been decided in favour of such person, such person shall be

entitled to recover a reasonable compensation for the damage sustained by

reason of his having been compelled to deliver up possession of such land."

The issue that arises for consideration is whether the above provisions extended the common

law to cases which it did not cover, or restricted or excluded its operation as to cases which it did

cover, or merged it wholly in the Act by codification.

In deciding this issue, I am mindful of certain rules of interpretation that should guide this

exercise.

Where there is a conflict between an act of Parliament and the common law, the act of

Parliament prevails. Statutes are not presumed to make any alteration in the common law,

further or otherwise than the Act does expressly declare [Bindra, Interpretation oj Statutes, 10th

Ed., page 239J. In the construction af statutes, you must not construe words so as to take away

rights which already existed before the statute was passed, unless you have plain words which

indicate that such was the intention of the legislature [per Brown L.J. in Re Cuno ((1889) 43 Ch.D.

12,17J. It is a rule as to the limitation of the meaning of general words used in a statute, that they

are to be, if possible, construed so as not to alter the common law [Craies an Statute Law, 7 th Ed.

(2nd Indian Reprint 2002), 188J.

Section 12 of the Act applies to two classes of persons, namely (i) any person who has been

ejected from a land under the Act or (ii) any person claiming to be the owner thereof.

The actio rei vindicatio can be maintained only by an owner [De Silva v. Goonetileke (32 N.L.R.

217), Pathirana v. Jayasundara (58 N.L.R. 169), Mansil v. Devaya [(1985) 2 Sri.L.R. 46], LatheeJv.

Mansaar [(2010) 2 Sri.L.R. 333J. To that extent the second category of persons in section 12 of

the Act are in any event permitted under the common law to maintain such action and therefore

that part of section 12 is merely a codification of the existing position under the common law.

Page 6 of 11

Section 4 of the prescription Ordinance permitted any person who shall have been dispossessed

of any immovable property otherwise than by process of law, to institute proceedings against the

person dispossessing him at any time within one year of such dispossession. However, this

remedy is not available to a person evicted under the Act since the eviction is by virtue of a court

order and hence by a process of law. Therefore, the first part of section 12 of the Act is an attempt

by the legislature to provide a person who is not the owner but was in possession of the land

from which he was dispossessed under the Act to institute an action. To that extent, the Appellant

may be able to claim that he comes within section 12 of the Act.

However, the Act requires both classes of persons coming within section 12 to institute the action

within six manths fram the date af the arder af ejectment. This is a modification of the common

law actio rei vindicatia in relation to an owner by providing a specific time limit by which the

action should be filed.

There is no need for ejectment to have been done for the party to institute the action as held by

the learned Additional District Judge. Any other interpretation leads to absurdity for example if

the State obtains an order of ejectment but stays its hand until six months lapse from the date of

the order of ejectment, the party ejected does not have a remedy under the Act. To that extent,

section 12 modifies the requirement of dispossession of an owner as enunciated in Pathirana v.

Jayasundara (supra), Theivandron v. Ramanathan Chettiar (supra) and Luwis Singho and Others

v. Ponnamperuma (supra).

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General further contended that section 13 of the Act limits

the relief that such a person can obtain only to damages. I have no hesitation in rejecting this

submission. If that is the correct legal position it means that merely because a competent

authority formed the opinion that a particular land is state land in terms of the Act, the ownership

of such private land passes onto the State without action taken under for example the Land

Acquisition Act to acquire the private land. I hold that in an action filed under section 12 of the

Act the owner of the land in dispute can get a declaration that he is the owner of the said land.

Page 7 of 11

Parties admitted [admission no. 3, Appeal brief page 22] that the order in M.e. Monaragala case

no. 54018/95 was made on 09.01.1996 (V3). This action was filed on 08.05.1996. Therefore, the

action was filed within the time permitted by section 12 of the Act. The Appellant arguably could

have filed the action as he claimed to be the owner. However, as the learned Additonal District

Judge correctly held he has not established his ownership for the reasons more fully set out below

and the action was correctly dismissed.

Prescription in relation to the land in dispute

The question arises whether in any event it is possible to claim prescriptive title to the land in

dispute.

During the trial, the Respondents marked in evidence as "V6" a tracing bearing no. 5/95 and parts

of FVP 172 with the tenement list [Appeal brief pages 108-110]. The land officer through whom

these documents were marked testified that the land in dispute is lot 256 of FVP 172 [Appeal

brief page 62]. This evidence was not challenged by the Appellant and as such becomes

unchallenged evidence [Edrick De Silva v. Chondrodosa De Silva (70 N.L.R. 169), Seyed

Shahabdeen Najimuddin v. Thureirotnam Nageshwari nee Sunderalingam and Others

(S.C./AppI/165/2010, S.e.M. 17.07.2013)].

The tenement list identifies lot 256 as "Reservation along Moragala Oya". These documents have

been prepared on behalf of the Surveyor-General.

Court shall presume that maps, plans, or surveys purporting to be signed by the Surveyor-General

or officer acting on his behalf were duly made by his authority and are accurate [Section 83 of

the Evidence Ordinance].

Page 8 of 11

Furthermore, as the trial took place before the repeal of the Land Surveys Ordinance section 6

therein is relevant which reads:

"If any plan or survey offered in evidence in any suit shall purport to be signed by the

Surveyor-General or officer acting on his behalf, such plan or survey shall be received in

evidence, and may be taken to be prima facie proof of the facts exhibited therein; and it

shall not be necessary to prove that it was in fact signed by the Surveyor-General or officer

acting on his behalf, nor that it was made by his authority, nor that the same is accurate,

until evidence to the contrary shall have first been given."

Accordingly, a Court can relying on "V6" a tracing bearing no. 5/95 and parts of FVP 172 with the

tenement list [Appeal brief pages 108-110] conclude that the land in dispute in this action is a

reservation along Moragala Oya. [Dehiwela-Mount Lavinia Municipal Council v. Fernando and

others (2007) 1 Sri.L.R. 293].

Section 52 of the State Lands Ordinance reads:

"No person shall, by possession or user of any State reservation after the commencement

of this Ordinance, acquire any prescriptive title to any such reservation against the State;

and neither the Prescription Ordinance nor any other law relating to the acquisition of

rights by virtue of possession or user shall apply to any such reservation after the

commencement of this Ordinance."(emphasis added)

Therefore, in any event the Appellant could not have claimed prescriptive title to the land in

dispute.

The learned counsel for the Appellant relied on Kirimudiyanse v. Attorney General (48 N.L.R. 438)

and Senanayake v. Damunupola [(1982) 2 Sri.L.R. Sri.L.R. 621] to support his proposition that the

Appellant can claim prescriptive title to the land in dispute after 30 years of possession. However,

section 52 of the State Lands Ordinance was not in issue in those cases.

Page 9 of 11

Prescription

Contrary to the legal position set out above, even if prescriptive title can be pleaded against the

State for the land in dispute, the question is whether the Appellant has proved the necessary

requirements to claim prescriptive title to the said land.

Where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat

the ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property the burden of proof rests fairly and

squarely on him to establish the starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights

[Gratiaen J. in Chellioh v. Wijenathan 54 N.L.R. 337 at 3421.

The Appellant claimed [paragraph 3 of the plaint1 that he was in possession of the land in dispute

for over 35 years. As the plaint was dated 1996 this meant that he was claiming to have

possession of the land in dispute from 1961. However, under cross-examination he testified that

he entered the land in 1965 [Appeal brief page 301 whereas H.M. Gunawansa who was called on

behalf of the Appellant claimed that the Appellant was in possession of the land from 1958 and

that he had worked for him as a labourer [Appeal brief page 341. Hence the Appellant has failed

to clearly establish a starting point for his acquisition of prescriptive rights.

The principles of burden of proof and mode of proof where a party claims prescriptive title was

succinctly stated by the Supreme Court in Sirajudeen and twa athers v. Abbas [(1994) 2 Sri.L.R.

365] as follows:

"As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general statements of

witnesses that the plaintiff possessed the land in dispute for a number of years exceeding

the prescriptive period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession

necessary to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses should speak

to specific facts and the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by Court.

One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as provided for in section 3

of the Prescription Ordinance is proof of possession by a title adverse to or independent

of that of the claimant or plaintiff. The occupation of the premises must be of such

character as is incompatible with the title of the owner."

Page 10 of 11

The Appellant has failed to adduce any evidence which supports his claim for prescriptive title

other than mere statements to state that he possessed the land in dispute. It was even admitted

by him that his wife and family lived elsewhere. There is no evidence to show of any cultivation

he has done on the land.

In this context it is important to bear in mind that prescriptive title is a means of defeating the

paper title in a party and as such great caution is required before recognising such title. In D.R.

Kiriamma v. l.A. Podibanda and 8 others (2005 B.L.R. 9 at 11) Udalagama J. adverted to some

important points to be borne in mind in considering a claim of prescriptive title:

"Onus probandi or the burden of proving possession is on the party claiming prescriptive

possession. Importantly, prescription is a question of fact. Physical possession is a factum

probandum. I am inclined to the view that considerable circumspection is necessary to

recognize the prescriptive title as undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party

having paper title. It is in fact said that title by prescription is an illegality made legal due

to the other party not taking action. It is to be reiterated that in Sri Lanka prescriptive title

is required to be by title adverse to an independent to that of a claimant or plaintiff."

Hence the Appellant has in any event failed to prove his claim of prescriptive title.

For all the foregoing reasons and subject to my conclusions on the ability to institute an action

under section 12 of the Act without dispossession, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment

of the learned Additional District Judge of Moneragala dated 29.11.2009.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
