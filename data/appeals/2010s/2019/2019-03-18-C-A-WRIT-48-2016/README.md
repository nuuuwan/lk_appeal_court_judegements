Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Decided on: 15.03.2019

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioners filed this application basically seeking a writ of

certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st respondent (Divisional

Secretary) dated 09.12.2014 marked X4 whereby the 2nd

petitioner (Wimalawathie Jayasinghe) was informed to resolve

the dispute through Court; and a writ of mandamus directing

the 1st respondent to appoint the heir of G.W. Jayasinghe as the

successor subject to the life interest of the 2nd petitioner (widow

of G.W. Jayasinghe); or, in the alternative, a writ of mandamus

directing the 1st respondent to hold a fresh inquiry to decide the

successor in terms of the provisions of the Land Development

Ordinance.

This application concerns of the question of succession under

the Land Development Ordinance. However there is no dispute

between the parties about the applicable law in that regard

(basically section 72 read with the 3rd schedule to the

Ordinance). The question is in relation to factual matters. To

be specific, who is the eldest son of Appuhamy and Ran Manike

who died basically without nomination? Is it G.W.

Jayasinghethe late husband of the 2nd petitioner or G.W.

Ariyasinghethe late husband of the 4th respondent? The

contest is between those two parties. If that question is solved,

the question of succession is solved and the whole matter ends

there.

A number of inquiries had been held and a number of orders

have been issued and suspended etc. by the 1st respondent on

this matter. Thereafter the 4th respondent to the present

application (together with her son, the 5th respondent) has filed a

writ application in this Court (CA/WRIT/326/2012) making the

3

same Divisional Secretary and the 2nd petitioner to the present

application as respondents seeking a writ of mandamus

directing the Divisional Secretary to transfer the land in issue to

the 4th respondent. That application has been dismissed by this

Court by Judgment dated 30.04.2014 on the basis that when

the facts are in dispute this Court cannot compel the Divisional

Secretary to decide in favour of the 4th respondent.

It is relevant to note that the aforesaid writ application was filed

after the inquiry before the Divisional Secretary and after his

decision that he is unable to decide on the matter. These

decisions are part of the aforesaid writ application. (The entire

case has been marked as X)

It is noteworthy that this Court did not dismiss that application

on the basis that the 4th respondent to the present application

did not prove that her late husband was the eldest son of

Appuhamy and Ran Manike or the 2nd petitioner proved that her

late husband was the eldest son of Appuhamy and Ran Manike,

but because the question of who the eldest son was still in

dispute and undecided. The situation has not changed up to

now. In that Judgment this Court has observed that the said

question could be solved by obtaining a declaration from the

District Court.

This Court cannot make a different order.

The learned counsel for the petitioners states that in terms of

the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance, District

Court is not vested with jurisdiction to decide succession. The

District Court need not decide on succession, but certainly it

4

can decide on who the eldest son of Appuhamy and Ran Manike

wasvide section 217(g) of the Civil Procedure Code.

It appears that both parties at the inquiry tendered competing

documentary evidence to establish their standpoints and the

Divisional Secretary could not come to a firm decision.

Thereafter the Divisional Secretary has suggested and the

parties have agreed to obtain a ruling on that matter from Court.

That has been approved by this Court in the former writ

application. No purpose is served by compelling the Divisional

Secretary to hold another inquiry afresh.

I dismiss the application of the petitioners. Let the parties bear

their own costs.
