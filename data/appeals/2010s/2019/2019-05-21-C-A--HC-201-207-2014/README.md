ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The 1st to 7th Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 1st to

7th Appellants) were indicted before the High Court of Panadura by the

Han. Attorney General on three counts. The 1st count of the indictment

reads that the Appellants were members of an unlawful assembly which

had the common object of causing hurt to one Hewage Kithsiri Silva alias

Mahatun on or about 14.08.2005 at Pinwatta of Panadura. The second count

reads that the Appellants were members of the said unlawful assembly

when one or more members of the said assembly caused the death of the

said Hewage Kithsiri Silva and they knew that such offence could have been

2

committed in prosecution of the said object and they continued to be in the

membership of the said unlawful assembly at the time of committing such

offence. Thirdly the Appellants were charged that they shared common

intention with others in causing death of the said Hewage Kithsiri Silva.

Upon their election to be tried without a jury, the trial commenced

with recording of their plea of not guilty. After the prosecution case was

closed all the Appellants made dock statements and called a witness on

their behalf.

In delivering its judgment, the trial Court convicted all the

Appellants for all three counts. They were imposed a term of six month

imprisonment, in respect of the 1st count while in respect of the 2nd count

the Appellants were imposed death penalty after recording their allocutus.

Aggrieved by their conviction to the indictment and imposition of

death sentence, the Appellants sought to challenge its validity by invoking

appellate jurisdiction of this Court seeking to set aside the said conviction

and sentence.

In support of the appeals of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th Appellants,

learned President's Counsel raised two primary grounds of appeal, the

scope of which he later expanded during submissions. The two grounds of

appeal that had been raised before us are as follows:-

a. the trial Court has failed to carefully evaluate the evidence of the

purported only eye witness to the incident,

b. the trial Court has erroneously rejected the evidence of the

solitary witness for the Appellants.

3

Learned Counsel for the 2nd Appellant (the 3rd Accused-Appellant as

per the docket) contended that the trial Court has erroneously convicted

him when there was no evidence of his participation to the alleged

incident by which the death of the deceased was caused.

It is appropriate that we consider the submissions of the Appellants,

in the backdrop of a short summary of evidence that had been presented

before the trial Court by the prosecution as well as the Appellants, which

exercise would undoubtedly equip us for proper appreciation of the

contention of learned Counsel for the Appellants.

The prosecution relied on the solitary eye witness to the incident, the

16 year old son of the deceased, Prasad de Silva (PW2) , as to the

circumstances under which the death of the deceased was caused and the

wife of the deceased Dilrukshi de Silva as to the circumstances that

prevailed prior to the incident which resulted in the death of the deceased

and its immediate aftermath. It also relied on the evidence of the

investigating officers and the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer who

conducted the post mortem examination on the body of the deceased.

Prasad, in his evidence claimed that he was at home reading a

newspaper and at about 1.45 p.m. a three wheeler had stopped in front of

his house. He identified the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 7th Appellants who had

'arrived in it as its passengers and the 6th Appellant as the driver. The 2nd

Appellant followed the three wheeler on foot. The 1st and 5th Appellants

have called out for the deceased to come out of the house. Prasad saw a T56

firearm with the 1st Appellant while the 5th and 7th Appellants possessed

two "small pistols". He also saw "manna" knives with the 3rd and 4th

4

Appellants. Dilrukshi, who also saw the arrival of the three wheeler had

identified the 1st Appellant with a T56 weapon, 3rd and 4th Appellants with

manna knives, 5th and 7th Appellants with pistols and the 6th Appellant

with a sword. Sensing danger, Dilrukshi responded to the calling out for

her husband by the Appellants with the explanation that her husband is

not at home and pleaded with them not to harm him. The 3rd Appellant

had thereafter peeped through the window of the front room in which the

deceased was having a nap after his lunch. The 3rd Appellant had then

alerted the 1st Appellant and the others that the deceased was there. Upon

his discovery, the deceased jumped out of the room, through a window,

and ran towards the Galle Road through neighbouring gardens and

thereby avoiding getting onto any public road.

The witnesses claimed that at this juncture the group had split into

two in their act of chasing after the deceased. Prasad claims that the 1st, 2nd

and 7th Appellants had run after the deceased while the others got into the

three wheeler and proceeded in the direction where the deceased ran.

Dilrukshi however claims all of the Appellants ran after the deceased and

she is not sure whether the three wheeler had followed the deceased's trail

or not.

Having witnessed the Appellants' act of chasing after his father,

Prasad too had run after them. He saw the 1st Appellant firing at the

deceased who was running away from his pursuers. Dilrukshi also had

heard several shots being fired as she walked with difficulty in that

direction due to the reason that she was in her last stages of her pregnancy.

The group had chased after the deceased only along the main road. At one

point of time Prasad lost sight of the deceased near the land belonging to

5

one Bindu Kumara, (who was later called as a witness for the Appellants)

which had a parapet wall at its boundary along the main road. The

deceased entered the property through its canal side boundary and the

Appellants were about 30 feet chasing behind him. The 4th, 6th and 7th

Appellants, who have arrived there at that time in the three wheeler had

joined with others. Earlier on he stated that he saw the 7th Appellant

walking with the 1st Appellant. The group then confronted the deceased

and thereafter the 1st Appellant shot at him. The deceased fell down after

the gun shot and was thereafter surrounded by the Appellants. The

witness did not see what each of the Appellants did to the deceased who

fell down after the shooting.

Thereafter, the Appellants left the scene passing the place where the

witness was. The 1st Appellant then told Prasad that they did not kill his

father. The witness at that point of time ran to the place where the

deceased was lying and saw a bleeding wound on his neck. He was joined

by his mother who arrived there after a few minutes.

Panadura Police Station received the 1st information about this

incident through a telephone call at 2.00. p.m. and had arrived at the scene

by 2.20 p.m.

IP Priyantha of Panadura Police conducted investigations and saw

Dilrukshi and Prasad at the scene. The body of the deceased was found at

No.5, Pirivena Road, Pinwatta, and the statement of its owner Bindu

Kumara Silva was recorded. A knife with a blade of 26 inches was

recovered by the officer, along with three spent casings of T56 ammunition

lying near the dead body. He inspected the front compound of the

6

deceased's house. IP Priyantha recovered two spent casings of ammunition

along the Galle Road, eight spent casings of ammunition in front of a spice

shop and a deformed bullet in front of the sub post office of Pinwatta

which had its wall damaged due to gun shots. The house near the dead

body was found also had a similar damage caused by gun shots. IP

Priyantha states that all 13 spent casings of ammunition which were

recovered by him, appeared to have been fired from a T56 rifle.

The Appellants were arrested at different times by the Police but

there were no recovery of any firearms or cutting weapons subsequent to

their arrests.

Consultant JMO Dr. Attygalle, who performed the post mortem

examination on the body of the deceased, had observed a total of 13

external injuries. Of these injuries, the rifled firearm entry wound on the

forehead had its corresponding exit wound in the neck, was termed as the

only necessarily fatal injury due to the damage it had caused to the brain.

Blackening was noted by the Consultant JMO around the said entry

wound indicating that it had been fired at close range.

Another injury termed as an entry wound, also with blackening

around it, caused by a rifled firearm was noted on the front of the chest of

the deceased with a corresponding exit wound at his back. Two superficial

cut injuries were also noted on the body of the deceased by the Consultant

JMO, in addition to another superficial stab injury located on the right

thigh. The body of the deceased also had several abrasions on its limbs.

The deceased had a full meal of rice in his stomach and it also contained a

certain amount of alcohol. The Consultant JMO expressed the opinion that

7

the cut and stab injuries, being superficial, may have been caused during a

scuffle.

The death of the deceased was due to gunshot injuries to his head

and neck.

When the prosecution closed its case, the trial Court had called for

the defence as it was of the view that all the Appellants had a case to

answer.

All Appellants made statements from the dock denying any

involvement with the death of the deceased. They also called the owner of

the property in which the body of the deceased was found. He was listed

as PW3 on the back of the indictment but was not called by the prosecution

in support of its case.

Bindu Kumara de Silva, an executive attached to a reputed private

establishment, stated in his evidence that on that day he was having his

afternoon nap after lunch, when he suddenly woke up to a sound of

firecrackers. It was initially heard by the witness as coming from a distance

but the sound of firecrackers continued thereafter indicating that it had

shifted to a closer location indicating it moved towards his house. The

witness was with his wife who was seven months pregnant with their first

child at that time. She became overtly fearful upon hearing the sound of

firecrackers and the witness had to devote his time and attention to

console her. He waited for about ten minutes to venture out to see what

the noise was about after it subsided.

8

After coming out of his house, the witness saw a few of his

neighbours who have gathered outside his property, near the gate. They

told the witness to check his vehicle for any damage that might have

caused due to the gunfire. Only thereafter the witness found the body of

the deceased lying near his vehicle. He knew some of the Appellants since

they were from the same locality but did not see any of them when he

came out of the house.

His wife was terrified upon hearing about the fatality. She

developed a condition that needed urgent medical attention. The witness

attended to his wife by seeking medical help but unfortunately due to this

condition, she eventually miscarried.

He did not see either Prasad or Dilrukshi near the body when he first

saw it although he saw them at a later point of time, upon his return after

telephoning the Police. By then there was a large crowd of onlookers who

have gathered around.

This is the summary of evidence that had been placed before the

trial Court by the parties.

Learned President's Counsel, in substantiating the first ground of

appeal that the trial Court has failed to carefully evaluate the evidence of

9

the purported solitary eye witness to the incident, relied on the following

grounds seeking to challenge his credibility;

i. Prasad who claims to have been the only eye witness to the

shooting has made his statement to the Police implicating the

Appellant only after a lapse of three months and therefore his

evidence becomes unreliable since it fails the test of

spontaneity,

11. his explanation for the delay, attributed to personal safety is

not a valid reason owing to the fact that he was residing with

his mother until the 7th day almsgiving ceremony was over

and therefore has had ample opportunity to make a detailed

statement in addition to the short statement he made in

identifying his father's body,

111. the trial Court erroneously considered his evidence given at

the inquest in accepting his evidence as truthful and reliable

when there was no material to establish that Prasad in fact

gave evidence at the inquest,

IV. the trial Court has failed to attach sufficient weight to the

omission that had been highlighted by the Appellant on the

evidence of Dilrukshi that she failed to mention in her

statement which was made on the same day of the incident,

that her son had run after the Appellants and that he did

witness the incident of shooting,

v. the trial Court has failed to consider the evidence of the Police

that they were looking for an eye witness to the incident but

found none, until Prasad made a belated statement,

10

vi. the trial Court has failed to consider the evidence of Dilrikshi

that when she reached the place of the incident Prasad was

already holding his father, but no blood was seen on his

clothing, and therefore his claim of being there at the time of

the shooting is not probable,

Vll. the trial Court has failed to consider the evidence of motive as

relied on by the prosecution in the proper perspective of the

possibility of false implication of the Appellants,

Vlll. the trial Court erroneously concluded that the medical

evidence corroborates the evidence of the eye witness since

there was no corroboration provided by the fact that the

deceased had gunshot wounds, which was obviously the case

after a bout of shooting.

In relation to the second ground of appeal that the trial Court has

erroneously rejected the evidence of the solitary witness for the

Appellants, the learned President's Counsel submitted that there was no

acceptable reason attributed by the trial Court in totally rejecting the

evidence of the only defence witness Bindu Kumara de Silva. It was also

contended that the evidence of the said witness satisfies all the tests that

are employed in evaluating credibility of witnesses and therefore the trial

Court was clearly in error in rejecting the same and thereby denying the

benefit of any reasonable doubt that might have arisen in favour of the

Appellants in respect of the credibility of the purported eye witness of the

prosecution.

11

The basis of the submission is, in view of Bindu Kumara de Silva's

evidence, that the claim of Prasad that he witnessed the shooting which

resulted in the death of the deceased becomes improbable as he was not

seen by the said defence witness when he came out of his house for the

first time after the shooting subsided. The defence witness was emphatic

that he saw the mother and son only after he returned to the place for the

2nd time after making a phone call to Police.

The 2nd Appellant's contention in support of his ground of appeal

that the trial Court has erroneously convicted him when there was no

evidence of his participation to the alleged incident which resulted in the

death of the deceased, is clearly on the footing that there was no evidence

to implicate him.

Learned Senior State Counsel in her submissions sought to defend

the conviction of the Appellants by the trial Court by its decision to act

upon the evidence of Prasad, by highlighting the fact that only two

contradictions that were marked off his evidence. Those contradictions

were on trivial matters which does not really affect his reliability as

truthful witness for the incident. The claim of belatedness and its

explanation had been considered in detail by the trial Court and in the

judgment it was clearly stated the reasons for acceptance of the testimony

of witness. Therefore, learned Senior State Counsel contended that the

challenge on the reliability of the eye witness mounted by the Appellants

is without any merit.

It is also her contention that the Appellants have made a

1/ confession" to Dilrukshi admitting their complicity to the murder when

12

they met her soon after the death of the deceased and that too on their

way back from the scene. She relied on the evidence of firing 13 shots is a

clear manifestation of the collective intention of the Appellants who

chased after him.

Having referred to the evidence presented by the parties before the

trial Court, the several grounds of appeal relied upon by the learned

Counsel for the Appellants as well as their submissions in support of them

and the submissions made in reply by the learned Senior State Counsel for

the Respondent, we believe that now is the appropriate stage to consider

them in detail.

The complaint by the learned President's Counsel that the solitary

eye witness made a belated statement which rendered his evidence

umeliable to be acted upon by a trial Court should be considered at the

outset.

It has been held in Sumanasena v Attorney General (1999) 3 Sri L.R.

137, by Jayasuriya J that;

" ... just because the witness is a belated witness

Court ought not to reject his testimony on that score

alone, Court must inquire into the reason for the delay

and if the reason for the delay is plausible and

justifiable the court could act on the belated witness."

Perusal of the judgment of the trial Court reveals that it had in fact

considered the belatedness of Prasad in making a statement to Police three

13

months after the incident, in order to determine the reason attributed for

such delay is acceptable to it or not. The witness himself admits that he

made a detailed statement after about three months, in addition to the

short statement he made when he identified the dead body prior to its post

mortem examination. The reason attributed by the witness for his delay is

that, having participated in the 7th day almsgiving of his dead father, he

took shelter in one of his relative's house at Mahawa since he felt his life

would be threatened if he was to remain in Pinwatta area thereafter.

During cross examination of Prasad, learned Counsel who defended

the 1st and 5th Appellants at the trial, it was elicited that he made a

statement to Police during post mortem examination and also gave

evidence during the inquest held on the following day after the incident.

The witness was repeatedly cross examined as to his evidence at the

inquest by all the Appellants.

The incident is dated 14.08.2005. Witness Dilrukshi stated her

statement was recorded on that day itself by the Police. Learned Counsel

for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Appellants clarified during trial that witness Prasad

made his first statement on 15.08.2005 at 4.15 p.m. and his 2nd statement

was recorded on 13.11.2005. Learned Counsel for the 7th Appellant clarified

that from the witness that inquest proceedings were also held on the

following day i.e. 15.08.2005.

There was no omission or contradiction marked off the evidence of

Prasad at the trial on his claim of identifying the Appellants and witnessing

the act of shooting upon the evidence he had given at the inquest

proceedings. Contradiction 2V1 from the inquest proceedings was marked

14

in relation to his assertion before the trial Court that his father slept in the

front room. It was suggested to him that he carne running after hearing the

gun shot and only at that point of time he did see the Appellants near his

horne.

The trial Court, in considering the admitted fact of belatedness of

Prasad in making a detailed statement to Police, accepted the explanation

provided for the delay that the witness changed his residence to Mahawa

due to threats to his life. Nonetheless the trial Court also considered the

question of truthfulness and reliability of the evidence of Prasad in the light

of the fact that there was no inconsistency highlighted off his evidence at

the inquest and the 2nd statement that had been made after three months.

We find no illegality in the said process of evaluation that had been

undertaken by the trial Court on the evidence of the sole eye witness in

assessing credibility. The trial Court in the said process could have equally

noted that the much highlighted "belatedness" does not really affect the

evidence of Prasad in the absence of any omission or contradiction with his

evidence before the trial Court and his evidence at the inquest proceedings

in implicating the Appellants. The trial Court is clearly entitled to corne to

a finding that Prasad presented a sequence of events at the inquest which is

consistent with his evidence at the trial Court in the absence of any

contradiction or omission marked by the Appellants on material points,

when they in fact have highlighted the fact that he gave evidence at the

inquest during their cross examination of the witness on other trivial

matters.

15

Coomraswamy in his Law of Evidence (Vol. II Book 2 at p. 1057)

describes the test of spontaneity in following terms:-

liThe promptness with which a witness makes his statement

to the police soon after an incident would be a point in his

favour on the ground of spontaneity. On the other hand,

the belatedness of such a statement would tend to reduce

the weight of the evidence of that witness, particularly

where there were opportunities for tampering with his

evidence. /I

Certainly, the submission of the learned President's Counsel on this

point is valid if Prasad made his statement belatedly for the first time

implicating the Appellants and when considered with the background of

admitted prior enmity among the two parties. As already noted, it is

therefore reasonable to assume, in the absence of any contradiction or

omission, that he did implicate all the Appellants in his evidence before

the inquirer into sudden deaths. It is our view that, the witness had

implicated the Appellants at the earliest available opportunity he has had

and that too before judicial proceedings where possibility of exerting

influence by a third party is minimal. Contrary to the submissions of the

Counsel, there was clear evidence, elicited by the Appellants themselves,

that the witness Prasad did give evidence before the inquirer into sudden

deaths. Hence, the trial Court did not import the reference to inquest

proceedings all by itself but was invited to consider them by the

Appellants themselves.

16

The contention of the learned President's Counsel that the evidence

of the solitary eye witness Prasad does not satisfy the test of spontaneity

therefore fails.

Whether there were threats to his life and whether it was due to

those threats he shifted residence becomes insignificant factor in favour of

the Appellants in this setting. But Prasad's conduct is consistent with the

inference that his implication of the Appellants at the inquest may have

justified entertaining such an apprehension by him and his mother. The

motive attributed to making an accusation belatedly against the

Appellants as contended by them before us, therefore also fades into

insignificance owing to this factor.

Learned President's Counsel's submission based on the evidence of

the police officer who stated that they were looking for an eye witness to

the incident but found none until Prasad made a belated statement too

loses its impact in the light of the above finding since it is clearly a wrong

"opinion" expressed by the investigating officer without having a

complete appraisal of the material available at that point of time.

Learned President's Counsel invited our attention to the omission

marked off the evidence of Dilrukshi in her failure to mention in her

statement to Police that her son, Prasad, had run after the Appellants who

were chasing behind her husband. Here too, no such omission was

marked off her evidence at the inquest. In these circumstances, the said

omission assumes lesser significance in assessing the weight of the

evidence of the eye witness; in determining the question of fact whether

17

he was there at the place of the incident to witness the shooting due to

which the death of the deceased was caused.

The failure of Dilrukshi to observe any blood on the clothing of her

son, who held the deceased, though might be relevant, could not be taken

as a factor which would taint her evidence in its entirety justifying its total

rejection as untruthful and unreliable. Given the mental condition she was

in, having placed under stressful conditions, her power of observation

may have been impaired. Her advanced state of pregnancy coupled with

the factors of an armed gang chasing after her husband few minutes ago,

the proclamation of the 1st Appellant that her husband is no more and

seeing her husband with bleeding injuries on the lap of her son are

sufficient to justify the failure of the witness to observe such details.

One of the complaints against the judgment of the trial Court by the

learned President's Counsel is that it had treated the evidence of the

consultant JMO who stated that the deceased had suffered two gunshot

wounds as an item of corroboration of the eye witness account provided

by Prasad as to the death of his father was erroneous since the witness was

fully aware that his father was fired at by his assailants.

Having perused the judgment of the trial Court, we are not inclined

to agree with the learned President's Counsel on this issue.

The context in which the above statement made in the judgment by

the trial Court is the claim by the witnesses that the deceased was fired at

repeatedly by the 1st Appellant when all of them had chased after him.

The trial Court considered the observations of damage noted on the walls

of buildings due to gun fire and the evidence relating to the recovery of

18

spent ammunition casings along the route taken by the Appellants in

support of the said sequence of events as described by the witness. The

word used by the trial Court in describing the effect of these two items of

evidence is /I Cj~JC>" instead of the word /I O)(3)got which is the generally

used term by Judges to denote the word in corroboration. This we find a

correct statement since it is consistent with the claim of the prosecution

witnesses that the deceased was repeatedly fired at and the independent

observations by the investigators supports the said claim.

In view of the above considerations, we are of the opinion that the

first ground of appeal relied upon by the learned President's Counsel, on

behalf of the Appellants (except for the 2nd Appellant) has no merit.

The second ground of appeal that had been raised by the learned

President's Counsel should be considered next. It was contended before

this Court that the trial Court has erroneously rejected the evidence of the

solitary witness for the Appellants.

In his submissions in support of this ground of appeal, learned

President's Counsel highlighted the fact that the defence witness, who

was employed as a senior executive at a reputed Company, had no reason

to suppress any evidence in relation to the incident and due to the tragedy

of losing his first child after a miscarriage as a direct result of this

incident, he would not have had any affiliation or sympathy to the

perpetrators who were responsible for the incident of shooting. However,

according to the learned President's Counsel, the trial Court has failed to

note these obvious considerations in its undertaking of the evaluation of

his evidence for credibility and reliability and thereby, arriving at an

19

erroneous conclusion that the defence witness's evidence is tainted with

partiality and therefore it should not be accepted as a truthful and reliable

account of the incident. He accordingly argued that the evidence of the

said reliable defence witness raises a reasonable doubt as to the claim of

the sole eye witness that he was there soon after the shooting was over

attending to his father, and the Appellants are entitled to the said benefit

of doubt.

The trial Court, in its evaluation of the defence witness of his

credibility, had primarily considered the probability of his assertion that

he did not even make an attempt to see what was going on in his own

garden, even though he could hear the sound like "firecrackers" for no

apparent reason. As a result of this, the trial Court had drawn an adverse

inference that the witness's claim of not seeing the incident is an

improbable one. It also inferred that his claim of not seeing any of the

Appellants there is made due to his partiality in favour of the Appellants

who were his neighbours.

In ordinary circumstances, the probable behaviour of a person who

was placed under similar circumstances as the defence witness, would be

to make at least an attempt to find out the reason for the unexpected

firecracker sound coming from his own garden at least out of curiosity ,

especially when there was no apparent threat to his own safety since he

was in his own bedroom with windows closed and curtains drawn. The

trial Court was right to consider this aspect of his evidence in applying

the test of probability when it evaluated his evidence for credibility.

Unfortunately the trial Court failed to consider the circumstances as

referred to by the learned President's Counsel, to test the defence

20

witness's evidence whether under those set of circumstances his failure to

investigate the cause for the sound is probable claim or not.

Adding to the circumstances in favour of the defence witness's

credibility, the reason attributed by him in shifting his focus to the

condition of his wife rather than the sound of firecrackers coming from

his own compound, was that the lady was terrified due to this

unexpected and sudden loud noise. The fact that the witness did not

venture to see the incident when it happened is tacitly supported by the

witness's own testimony when he said that his wife was almost petrified

when she overheard him informing the Police about the dead body found

in his garden. If the witness had even looked out of his windows and saw

the incident of shooting as it happened, it is highly unlikely that he had to

go outside to investigate. His wife was equally unaware as to what

happened just outside their home until she heard her husband reporting it

to Police. No sooner she overheard the telephone conversation, she

developed signs which required medical attention and the witness had to

attend to the urgent medical emergency on one hand and to assist the

investigation on murder that had just taken place on the other. The claim

of the witness that he did not know that a person was shot in his own

compound is further supported by his evidence that he saw few villagers

who have gathered outside his gate and told him to check his vehicle for

any damage which may have caused it due to the shooting and the body

was seen only when he went to inspect his vehicle. This supports the

witness's claim that he was totally unaware as to the murder of the

deceased up until that point of time.

21

The witness claimed when he ventured out to see what happened

after about 10 minutes since the sounds of firecracker ceased, he did not

see any of the Appellants, some of whom he already knew as individuals

from his own locality. He did not see either Prasad or Dilrukshi near the

dead body but claims to have seen them when he returned to the scene

after informing the Police and attending to his terrified wife.

It is natural for the persons who were involved with the murder to

disappear from the scene of crime without lingering around thereafter.

The absence of the Appellants at the scene therefore is a natural and a

probable occurrence. Even if the defence witness is partial towards the

Appellants, he had no reason to deny the presence of Prasad at the scene

unless he knew that Prasad is an eye witness and therefore it helps the

Appellants, if he denies his presence at the scene. It is clear from the

Police evidence that they recorded the witness's statement no sooner they

arrived at the scene. Only thereafter a statement from Dilrukshi was

recorded at her residence. Prasad implicated the Appellants only on the

following day during the inquest. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the

defence witness was privy to the existence of an eye witness to the

incident and therefore wilfully denied his presence at the scene in order

to provide a partial account of the incident in favour of the Appellants.

During cross examination of the defence witness, learned State

Counsel elicited evidence with a view not to discredit the witness, but to

explain away the delay of the witness's act of corning out of the house to

see what had happened. Not a single contradiction or omission was

marked during the lengthy cross examination by the State. There was no

suggestion by the State that he lied under oath in order to protect the

22

Appellant from punishment or that he deliberately lied by stating that he

did not see Prasad near his father's body when he came out of the house

for the first time and ten minutes after the incident of shooting.

In view of the above reasons the trial Court was clearly in error

when it limited its evaluation of the defence witness applying the test of

probability only to one aspect of his evidence and completely failing to

appreciate other probabilities. It also failed to apply the other tests on

evaluation of credibility. It has been consistently held by Superior Courts

that there should be no differentiation of evaluation of a witness's

testimony depending on the party who calls him. Both the witnesses for

the prosecution and defence must be treated equally in dealing with

evaluation of their evidence, except an accused as a witness, for he is

protected by several rules in relation to limits of his cross examination.

In the unreported judgment of this Court, Sisira Bandaula alias

Mahatun v Attorney General CA 122/2006 - decided on 09.10.2014,

where Goorneratne J. elaborated on the duty of the trial Court to evaluate

the case presented by an accused on following terms;

nIt is very unfortunate that this Court has to observe

that the trial Judge has not considered and given his

mind to the defence case properly. If there were

contradictions, it is the duty of the trial Judge to deal

with them in the same manner he dealt with the

prosecution case and decided as to whether such

infirmities go to the root of the defence case. The prime

duty of the trial Judge is to weigh the evidence

23

correctly and decide whether the defence case is capable

of creating a reasonable doubt in the prosecution

case. "

The trial Court, in its judgment did not clearly state the

"inconsistencies" that had compelled it to reject the evidence of defence

witness. In these circumstances we hold that the trial Court has acted

contrary to the principles laid down in the said judgment.

The 2nd ground of appeal raised by the learned President's Counsel

therefore has merit in it.

The said determination by this Court that the evidence of the

defence witness was wrongly rejected by the trial Court alters the case for

the prosecution significantly. The evidence of the eye witness that he went

up to the place where his father was fallen soon after the Appellants have

left becomes an unreliable claim as a result. The witness for the defence

stated in his evidence that he came out of his house after about 10

minutes since the sound of firecrackers ceased. If the defence witness's

estimation of time of ten minutes is correct, then Prasad had not reached

the body of his father for more than ten minutes. Prasad claimed that he

saw the shooting of his father from a distance about 20 meters. It is highly

improbable that he would take more than ten minutes to reach a place

only 20 meters away where his father was lying after being shot at. This

factor alone renders his claim of witnessing the incident of shooting,

which resulted in the death of his father, highly unreliable.

However, that factor does not necessarily compel a Court to

consider Prasad, a 16 year old school boy at the time, as a deliberate liar

24

who concocted a total fabrication to implicate the Appellants due to their

prior animosity since the prosecution had failed to verify the basis of the

estimation of time from the defence witness, during cross examination.

Therefore, it is our view that this is not a situation where the maxim falsus

in uno falsus in omnibus applies to his evidence.

In Samaraweera v Attorney General (1990) 1 Sri .L.R. 256 Perera J

held that:-

" In any event this maxim is not an absolute rule which has

to be applied without exception in every case where a

witness is shown to have given false evidence on a material

point. When such evidence is given by a 'witness the

question whether other portions of his evidence can be

accepted as true may not be resolved in his favour unless

there is some compelling reason for doing so.

His lordship cited the following passage from the judgment of the Court

of Criminal Appeal by T.s. Fernando J in Francis Appuhamy v The Queen

68 N.L.R. 437 in support of the said pronouncement;

"We do not think this remark can be the foundation for a

principle that the evidence of a witness must be accepted

completely or not at all. Certainly, in this country it is not

an uncommon experience to find in criminal cases

witnesses who, in addition to implicating a person actually

seen by them committing a crime, seek to implicate others

who are either members of the family of that person or

25

enemies of such witnesses. In that situation, the Judge or

jurors have to decide for themselves whether that part of the

testimony which is found to be false taints the whole or

whether the false can safely be separated from the true:"

The resultant position is that the remainder of Prasad's evidence

could be acted upon, if found reliable enough, to determine other

questions of facts, having regard to the totality of the evidence presented

before the trial Court. However, the prosecution is now bereft of any

reliable evidence as to the incidents that took place where the deceased

received his only necessarily fatal gunshot injury to his head.

In order to decide on the challenge mounted by the Appellants on

the validity of their conviction by the trial Court, this Court must then

consider the extent to which the unreliability of Prasad's evidence affects

the prosecution in establishing its case beyond reasonable doubt.

Learned President's Counsel highlighted that the trial Court had

found the Appellants guilty of 1st and 2nd counts in the indictment but

there was no finding in relation to the 3rd count which alleged that the

Appellants committed murder and are punishable under Section 296 read

with Section 32 of the Penal Code. They were sentenced also only on the 1st

and 2nd counts. This is reflected in the proceedings of 31.07.2014.

However, the trial Court, at the penultimate paragraph of its

judgment, had clearly found all the Appellants guilty to all counts

contained in the indictment (8C:lO~ qB @e)j<;.!:DJe)~()). Therefore, the

Appellants were, in effect, found guilty to all three counts by the said

judgment of Court even though they were sentenced only to two counts

26

which could probably be due to an oversight. We note that the trial Court

zhad adopted hitherto unknown procedure in pronouncing its judgment

and sentencing the Appellants.

In the judgment itself, after having found all the Appellants guilty to

all counts in the indictment, the trial Court had immediately imposed

death sentence on all of them. Then in the last paragraph of the judgment,

it had recommended the sentence of death should be carried out against all

the seven Appellants since they were guilty to a murder committed in a

cruel manner. Then in the proceedings of 31.07.2014, the Court first

imposed the sentence of six month imprisonment in respect of the 1st

count. Then the Court proceeded to pronounce its determination of the

guilt of the Appellants to the 1st and 2nd counts having already punished

the Appellants for the 1st count. The trial Court then called for the allocutus

of the seven Appellants and recorded them followed by the imposition of

death penalty for the second time.

Since it is clear that the trial Court, in its judgment had found all

seven Appellants guilty to all the charges contained in the indictment, this

Court accepts that they have been duly convicted on all three counts even

though the Court proceedings of the same day reflects otherwise, which

could clearly attributable to an oversight.

Therefore, in these circumstances this Court must consider

whether the conviction of the all seven Appellants on each of the three

counts that contained in the indictment could be maintained in view of the

fact that Prasad's evidence on the incident of shooting by the Appellants, as

27

a result of which the death of the deceased was caused, considered

unreliable for the reasons stated in the preceding paragraphs.

As already referred to at the very commencement of this judgment,

the prosecution sought to impute criminal liability on each of the

Appellants on the basis of their being members of an unlawful assembly. It

is alleged that they formed an unlawful assembly to cause hurt to the

deceased and in the same course of transaction one or more members of

the said assembly caused his death and that they knew such offence could

have been committed in prosecution of the said common object and they

continued to be in the membership of the said unlawful assembly at the

time of committing such offence.

It is therefore important to identify the applicable legal principles in

relation to the imputation of constructive criminal liability under the

concept of unlawful assembly.

Section 138 of the Penal Code of Ceylon defines the term unlawful

assembly and its different forms which are dependent on the common

object of each such assemblies. Section 146 of the said Code then imposes

vicarious criminal liability on each member of such an unlawful assembly

as it states;

"If an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful

assembly in prosecution of the common object of that

assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew to

be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every

28

person who, at the time of the committing of that offence, is

a member of the same assembly is guilty of that offence."

Dr. Gaur in his treatise titled The Indian Penal Code (13th Ed) has identified

several factors which should be established by the prosecution when it

sought to impose "constructive criminality" on an accused by invocation

of provisions of Section 149 of the Penal Code of India. These factors listed

at p. 528 are as follows;

a. there was an unlawful assembly,

b. that the accused was a member thereof at the time of committing

the offence,

c. that he intentionally joined or continued in that assembly,

d. that he knew of the object of the assembly,

e. that an offence was committed by a member of such assembly, f that it was committed;

l. in prosecution of the common object of the

assembly, or,

ll. was such, as the members of the assembly knew to

be likely to be committed in prosecution of their

common unlawful object.

Prof. Peiris in his book titled General Principles of Criminal Liability in

Ceylon notes (at p. 68) that;

" ... while section 146 introduces into our law a

principle of vicarious criminal liability this principle

has legitimate application only where the accused

29

entertains some mens rea, at least in the form of the

required awareness of a probable consequence of the

formation or continuance of the unlawful assembly,

even though the mens rea attributable to the accused

does not coincide with that ordinarily appropriate to the

offence of which he is convicted."

These being the fundamental considerations that are involved in

applying constructive criminal liability under Section 146 of the Penal

Code, we note that Dr. Gaur thereafter proceeds to consider the limitations

of the scope of Section 149, ( which is similar to Section 146 of the Ceylon

Penal Code) in imposing constructive criminal liability in the following

terms (at p.524);

" ... a person may join an unlawful assembly with an

unlawful object, but it does not necessarily follow that he

endorses all that the other members sayar do, nor is he ,

therefore, responsible for their acts of which he was not

clearly cognisant."

He further adds that;

"... the members of an unlawful assembly may have

community of object only up to a certain point, beyond

which they mere differ in their objects, and the knowledge

possessed by each member of what is likely to be committed

in prosecution of their common object will vary not only

according to information at his command, but also

according to the extent to which he shares the community

30

of object and as a consequence the effect of this section may

be different on different members of the same unlawful

assembly."

This approach in the imposition of constructive criminal liability

requires a closer examination of the evidence presented against each

member of the unlawful assembly, if a particular accused were to find

guilty to an offence, another member of such assembly had committed.

This effectively brings in a requirement of an individual treatment of each

of the accused by a trial Court.

The Supreme Court, in Bandaranaike v Jagathsena and Others

(1984) 2 Sri L.R. 397, has emphasised this point as it states that;

"In a case where there are several accused, the case against

each accused must be considered separately. Omnibus

evidence of a general character must be closely scrutinised

in order to eliminate all chances of false or mistaken

implication of innocent persons."

Divisional bench of the Supreme Court in Samy and Others v

Attorney General (2007) 2 Sri L.R. 216 reiterates this principle as their

Lordships have held;

"It is well settled law that mere presence of a person in an

assembly does not render him a member of an unlawful assembly,

unless it is something which would make him a member of such

an unlawful assembly ... in a case of this nature it will be safer to

31

look for some evidence of participation by him before holding that

he is a member of the unlawful assembly. 1/

This is an approach consistently adopted by our Courts. In

Andriyas v The Queen 67 N.L.R. 425 the Court of Criminal Appeal held

thus;

II mere membership of an unlawful assembly did not

render each member of that unlawful assembly criminally

liable for an offence committed by some other member

thereof. .. such liability arose at law when the existence of

certain other element or elements specified in section 146 of

the Penal Code had been established. 1/

In Samy and Others v Attorney General (supra) their Lordships have

added the below quoted text from Gour (11th Ed l Vol. II, p.1296) which

effectively discouraged imputation of presumptive involvement of each

member. The text reads thus;

IIWhere the evidence as recorded is in general terms to the

effect that all these persons and many more were the

miscreants and were armed with deadly weapons like guns,

spears axes etc., this kind of omnibus evidence has to be

very closely scrutinized in order to eliminate all chances of

false or mistaken implication. II

32

Divisional bench of the Court of Appeal, in Ranawaka and Others v

The Attorney general (1985) 2 Sri L.R. 210 held the view that;

" ... the offence committed must be immediately connected

with the common object of the unlawful assembly of which

the accused were members ... the act must be one which

upon evidence appears to have been done with a view to

accomplish the common object attributed to the members of

the unlawful assembly. No offence executes or tends to

execute the common object unless the commission of that

offence is involved in the common object."

A similar view was expressed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in

The King v Sellathurai 48 N.L.R. 570.

The Appellate Courts have therefore clearly laid down the

applicable principles of law in relation to imposition of constructive

criminal liability and had imposed a burden on the prosecution in

establishing its case on those terms.

If the prosecution seeks to impose constructive criminal liability

upon an accused who had been a member of an unlawful assembly, then it

was incumbent upon it to satisfy the trial Court to the required degree of

proof that such member of that unlawful assembly had shared the common

object in his mind which could be inferred from any overt act attributed to

him .

On the question of burden of proof in relation to imposition of

criminal liability under unlawful assembly, in a recent judgment of the

33

Supreme Court by the Chief Justice Dep in De Mel and three Others v

Attorney General - SC/TAB/2A-D/2017 - decided on 11.10.2018, held a

similar view when it was emphasised that;

/I it is their burden not only to establish the common

object but also to prove that the existence of the common

object is the only conclusion consistent with the facts and

circumstances existed at that point."

In Kulatunga v Mudalihamy 42 N.L.R. 331 it was recognised that the

prosecution must prove there was an unlawful assembly with a common

object as stated in the charge and not any other.

Thus, having referred to the applicable law, we now turn our

attention to consider whether the trial Court has properly applied them to

the evidence presented by the prosecution, in order to determine the

legality of the imposition of constructive criminal liability on each of the

Appellants, when it convicted them on the 1st and 2nd counts of the

indictment.

The evidence of both witnesses, Prasad and Dilrukshi are consistent

about the arrival of the Appellants in a three wheeler and that they were

armed with different types of weapons which could be used to inflict

injuries ranging from simple hurt to death of a person. The witnesses were

emphatic that they saw a T56 weapon in the hands of the 1st Appellant,

although they did describe the other fire arms which some others have

possessed as /I small pistols". There were more than five persons. They have

alighted from the three wheeler and 1st and 5th Appellants have called the

34

deceased to come out. In those circumstances, it is natural to infer, that

those who arrived at the house of the deceased, may have been motivated

by the common objective of causing same harm to the deceased.

However, none of them uttered any threatening words or displayed

any form of violence on Dilrukshi who, though sensed trouble with their

arrival, courageously met them at the entrance to her house. None of the

Appellants even made an attempt to come into the house forcibly to verify

the truth of her claim that the deceased was not at home. Instead, only the

3rd Appellant peeped through the window to the front room and informed

others that the deceased was there. It is not clear from the evidence that the

deceased, upon him being discovered by the 3rd Appellant, had jumped out

of the house through which window. Whether it was the same window or

a different one was not clarified by the prosecution. If he had jumped out

of the same window through which the 3rd AppellantL who had a pistol

with him, had peeped in then that factor is in favour of the 3rd Appellant as

his failure to use the firearm might negate any intention to cause hurt to

the deceased. The deceased, having jumped through the window had

thereafter opted to run through the adjoining garden to get away from the

Appellants and thus avoiding taking the public road and thereby offer an

easy target for the Appellants.

It is at this stage the group had split into two. Prasad claims that 1st,

2nd and 7th Appellants opted to walk while others went in the three

wheeler. Although this evidence is at variance with his mother who stated

that the group of men had run after her husband but she did not notice the

three wheeler.

35

The Appellants, although decided to chase after the deceased, kept

themselves to the public road and did not trespass on any other property

in order to pursue the fleeing deceased.

This item of evidence adds a complication to the prosecution case

as each group had less than five members each when they commenced

their chase of the deceased. Beyond this point, the eye witness account of

Prasad could not be utilised to impute criminal liability on the Appellants.

Although it is possible to infer that upon seeing the deceased fleeing from

them, the Appellants decided to mount a chase. But when the group split

into two and went in the direction of Galle Road keeping to the public

road, a question arises whether both groups had in fact chased after the

deceased as the witness claimed? Prasad's evidence that the two groups

had met thereafter at Bindu Kumara's garden. Being found that part of his

evidence unreliable, it could not be utilised to decide whether there were

more than five members of the original group who had reassembled there.

His evidence that he met the 1st Appellant after the incident of

shooting could be accepted as it is supported by his mother. Dirukshi also

met the 1st Appellant who still had the T 56 weapon in his hand, in the

company of other Appellants. The 1st Appellant told Dilrikshi that "q~.!l)

G@iil ~mcm (5)q~ @c>oB".

Both these witnesses claimed that they met the "Appellants",

apparently returning after the incident. The prosecution was content with

this omnibus reference to the Appellants and thus deprived its case of

specific details of the presence of each of the Appellants there. Prasad said

initially there were 7 Appellants while Dilrukshi said there were only 6.

36

There was no reference to three wheeler and to the person who drove it. In

the absence of specific details as to who and who were there this item of

evidence loses its reliability and weight. But there is clear and specific

reference to the 1st Appellant as to what he had in his hand and what he

said.

In effect the prosecution is therefore left only with the evidence in

relation to the initial incident at the house of the deceased and the

subsequent "return" of the" Appellants" presumably from the scene of

crime. Due to unreliability of Prasad's claim of being an eye witness the

case presented by the prosecution turns itself in to a case based on

circumstantial evidence from a case based on an eye witness account.

The deceased had received two firearm wounds inflicted on his

person upon being fired at close range. The injuries that could be

attributable to cutting weapons are merely superficial ones as per the

opinion of the Consultant JMO. Thus it creates an ambiguity whether they

are intentional or accidental. A cutting weapon was also seen lying near the

body when the Police visited the place.

The circumstances that were placed before the Court of Criminal

Appeal in Wilson Silva v The Queen 76 NLR 414 are easily comparable to

the circumstances that are highlighted before us in relation to the instant

appeal.

37

In the said case, the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to nature of

the injuries suffered by the deceased by stating that;

" ... the deceased had sustained a total of sixteen

injuries, only one of which, head injury alleged to have

been inflicted by the 3rd accused, was necessarily fatal.

The other fifteen injures, all of which were on the hand

and legs, were not necessarily fatal, even considered

cumulatively" and "The entire case for the

prosecution rested upon the evidence of an alleged eye-

witness. "

The deceased in the appeal before us also suffered only one

necessarily fatal gunshot injury to his head and other injuries could not be

considered as necessarily fatal mJunes, even when considered

cumulatively.

Having considered the evidence presented before Court,

Weeramantry J. stated that:-

liThe questions whether a person is aware of facts which

render an assembly unlawful, whether he intentionally

joins such an assembly or continues in it, and whether the

common object of the assembly is to commit an offence, are

all matters which must be determined from a series of

circumstances. The acts or omissions of each alleged

38

..

participant, the weapons used, the manner of their arrival

at the scene, their prior utterances and so to speak every

circumstance of significance in this regard would have to be

evaluated. Such a task is only possible upon the basis of

rules relating to the evaluation and assessment of

circumstantial evidence. . .. On the degree of proof required

of the sharing of a common object, the governing principles

are no different from those relating to the degree of proof of

common intention, and the authorities hereinafter referred

to, showing that such a conclusion must be an inescapable

one, would be applicable. /I

Applying these considerations to the instant appeal, it is our

considered VIew that the prosecution has failed to prove beyond

reasonable doubt as to the commencement and continuation of the

unlawful assembly which alleged to have commenced with the common

object to cause hurt to the deceased and ending with causing his death. It

also failed to prove that there were five or more Appellants who were

present up to the point of the death of the deceased. Although there were

circumstances that justify an inference that there would have been more

than one person present at the time the death of the deceased was caused,

there was no reliable evidence in relation to their identities.

As the learned Counsel for the 2nd Appellant submitted that there

were no clear and reliable evidence against each of the Appellants that they

39

were members of an unlawful assembly at any point of time which had the

common object of causing hurt to the deceased.

The mere presence of the Appellants with deadly weapons does not

necessarily give rise to the inference that they had common object of

causing hurt to the deceased since their conduct falls short of the required

degree of proof. The prosecution must prove that their common object was

to cause hurt and no other. The circumstances relates to the incident at the

house could give rise to multiple inferences that the group may have

entertained other common objects as well, such as intimidation, trespass,

abduction, in addition to hurt.

In Raut v State of Bihar 2002 Cri LJ 560, the Supreme Court, having

considered the fact that;

1/ ... It is admitted that no member of the unlawful

assembly except Bahiya Mani Raut, inflicted any

injury on the person of the deceased despite the fact

that they were allegedly armed with weapons like

lathis"

and has held that

"There is no sufficient evidence prosecution which

could prove beyond reasonable doubt that all the

appellants had a common object of committing the

crime of murder."

40

II

This determination supports our view that, in the absence of any

other evidence to justify an inescapable interference that their common

object is to cause hurt to the deceased in spite of the fact that the

Appellants were in possession of deadly weapons when they arrived at the

house of the deceased, the prosecution has failed to establish the 1st and 2nd

counts to the required degree of proof. The Appellants are therefore

entitled to be acquitted of the 1st and 2nd Counts of the indictment

presented against them by the Hon. Attorney General.

The 3rd count was levelled against the Appellants on the basis that

they shared a common murderous intention with others when causing

death of the deceased.

In considering the complicity of the Appellants under this basis of

criminal liability, a divisional bench of this Court, in its judgment of

Wijithasiri and Another v The Republic of Sri Lanka (1990) 1 Sri L.R. 56

laid down the following principles of law;

l. the case of each accused must be considered separately,

ll. that the accused must have been actuated by common

intention with the doer of the act at the time the offence was

committed,

lll. common must not be confused with similar intention

entertained independently of each other,

lV. there must be either direct or circumstantial evidence of a pre-

arranged plan or some other evidence of common intention,

41

-.

v. there mere fact of the presence of the co accused at the time of

the offence is not necessarily evidence of common intention

unless there is other evidence which justifies them in so

holding.

Returning to the evidence presented by the prosecution we must

now consider the available evidence against each of the Appellants.

It is evident that the Appellants had arrived at the house of the

deceased in a group armed with weapons. It is also evident that the 1st

Appellant was its leader since it was he with another who called out for the

deceased. It was he, to whom the 3rd Appellant reported that the deceased

was there inside the house. The evidence of Prasad is that it was the 1st

Appellant fired at the deceased as he fled from his pursuers upon being

discovered. Dilrukshi a prosecution witness and Bindu Kumara, the only

witness for the defence are consistent in their evidence that they heard a

series of shots being fired. The Police had recovered 10 spent T56 casings

along the route taken by the Appellants in their pursuit of the deceased.

They also noted damage caused to several nearby buildings due to gun

shots, a factor strongly supports the witness's description of the continued

firing whilst chasing after the deceased.

The deceased had suffered two gunshot injuries which are due to

close range firing using a rifled firearm and three spent casings of T56

ammunition were recovered lying near the body of the deceased.

It is clear that only the 1st Appellant who was in possession of a T56

weapon immediately before the firing began and he continued to possess a

T56 soon after the firing was over, as seen by Dilrukshi and Prasad. It was

42

-. . . '

the 1st Appellant who told Dilrukshi about her husband's fate when he met

her on his way back. Although she had varied as to the exact words uttered

by the 1st Appellant at different times, she was effectively conveyed the

message by the 1st Appellant that her husband is no more. The 1st

Appellant did not deny making such a statement, in his statement from the

dock and did not suggest his denial to the witness during his cross

examination of the witness on this issue.

Therefore, it is our firm view that the prosecution has placed

sufficient evidence to draw the irresistible and inescapable inference

against the 1st Appellant as the person who shot the deceased at close range

using a rifled firearm since it was only him who had a T56 firearm a

weapon which matched with the description by the Consultant JMO as the

one used in the shooting of the deceased before and after the event. His

declaration of the fate suffered by the deceased confirmed his presence at

the scene. The location of the necessarily fatal injury of the deceased

proved beyond any doubt that when the 1st Appellant fired that shot at

close range had clearly intended the death of the deceased and thereby

satisfying 1 st limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code.

In view of this reasoning we affirm the conviction of the 1st

Appellant to the 3rd count on the indictment.

However, the prosecution has failed to prove the identity of any of

the other Appellants who may have been present when the deceased was

shot at and therefore are entitled to be acquitted from the 3rd Count of the

indictment as well.

43

In conclusion we make the following orders;

i. All Appellants are acquitted from the 1st and 2nd Counts by

quashing their conviction by the trial Court to the said counts,

ii. The 2nd to 7th Appellants are acquitted from the 3rd Count by

quashing their conviction by the trial Court to the said count,

111. The 1st Appellant's conviction for the 3rd count and the

sentence of death imposed is affirmed,

iv. The appeals of the 2nd to 7th Appellants are allowed,

v. Appeal of the 1st Appellant, Yon Merenna Seeman Hewage

Nilantha Kumara Silva, is dismissed.

The relevant High Court is directed to issue a fresh warrant in line

with the orders made by this Court.
