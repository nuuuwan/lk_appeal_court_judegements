Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this writ application seeking several reliefs

against the Director General of Customs, Minister of Finance,

Secretary to the Treasury etc. on calculation of taxes and levies

in relation to importation of a Permit Vehicle. As seen from the

proceedings dated 26.10.2018, upon counsel for the petitioner

vehemently objecting another date being granted to the State to

file objections to the application of the petitioner, this Court was

compelled to refix the matter for argument on 13.11.2018

without objections being filed. Subsequent to oral submissions,

this Court granted both parties to file written submissions and

fixed the matter for the Judgment for today.

When I read the case record to prepare for the Judgment, I

realized that this is not a case which could be decided ex parte

without affording an opportunity for the State to file objections,

as the Judgment of this case, if decided ex parte in favour of the

petitioner, will confine to the two parties to the case, but might

result in grave repercussions, if applications are made by those

who are similarly circumstanced, leading to serious fiscal

implications.

This was put into writing by me on 03.06.2009 and handed it

over to the counsel for the petitioner (and the respondents) to

see whether the counsel for the petitioner is agreeable to allow

the State to file objections and refix the matter for argument.

Despite writ being a discretionary remedy, counsel for the

petitioner on 10.06.2019 informed Court that he was not

3

agreeable to that suggestion of Court and wanted the Judgment

to be delivered on the due date.

In the meantime, counsel for the petitioner has, by way of a

motion dated 04.06.2019, informed Court that:

On that day (13.11.2018) Counsel for the Respondents

appeared and made an Oral Submission which was not

limited to 45 minutes though the Court of Appeal Rules

states so. Thereafter they have given a written submission

as well against the Court of Appeal Rules with regard to

hypothetical unacceptable and untenable facts without

substantiated those facts and mixed questions of facts and

law with an affidavit. As per the Court of Appeal Rules

there is no provision for the Court to accommodate written

submissions if the Respondents have not complied with

Rules and not filed Statement of objections with an

affidavit.

What the counsel for the petitioner says is that, in violation of

the Rules, the Court allowed the Senior DSG for the respondents

to make oral submissions more than 45 minutes and thereafter

to file written submissions. It seems that counsel for the

petitioner wants the Court to disregard them. Then I am left

only with the petitioners application.

Counsel for the petitioner is very keen on strict compliance with

the Court of Appeal Rules.

I am a firm believer that (a) Rules are there not to thwart justice

but to facilitate justiceput differently, not to defeat justice but

4

to achieve justice; (b) A decision of a Court shall be based on a

fair hearing; and (c) Cases shall be decided on merits and not on

technical grounds.

However, in this case, as the counsel for the petitioner is very

particular on complete compliance with Rules, I am compelled to

see whether the petitioner in the first place has strictly complied

with the Rules.

Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules

1990 reads as follows:

Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the

exercise of the powers vested in the Court of Appeal by

Articles 140 and 141 of the Constitution shall be by way of

petition, together with an affidavit in support of the

averments therein, and shall be accompanied by the

originals of documents material to such application (or duly

certified copies thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a

petitioner is unable to tender any such document, he shall

state the reason for such inability and seek the leave of the

Court to furnish such document later. Where a petitioner

fails to comply with the provisions of this Rule, the Court

may ex mero motu or at the instance of any party dismiss

such application.

According to the said Rule 3(1)(a), a petitioner in a writ

application shall tender originals of documents or duly

certified copies thereof. The petitioner has violated this Rule.

None of the documents tendered by the petitioner along with his

petition and affidavit is an original or a duly certified copy

5

thereof. All are photocopies signed as True Copies by an

Attorney-at-Law whose identity is unknown. They are certainly

not duly certified copies. There is difference between True

Copy and Duly Certified Copy. Strictly speaking, this is

violative of Rule 3(1)(a). That Rule further says that Where a

petitioner fails to comply with the provisions of this rule, the Court

may ex mero motu or at the instance of any party dismiss such

application.

When the Court is compelled to consider the petitioners

application ex parte, Court cannot rely on photocopies signed as

True Copies by an Attorney-at-Law whose identity is unknown

to Court. The situation would have been different, if the

respondents were allowed to file objections, in which event, there

is no burden on the part of the Court to check the authenticity

of the documents.

I dismiss the application of the petitioner on the basis of non-

compliance with Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules of 1990 in that the supporting documents are

neither originals nor duly certified copies. No costs.
