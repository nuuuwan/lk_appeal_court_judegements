When this matter was taken up for argument on 1ih October 2018, the

learned Counsel for the parties moved that this Court pronounce its judgment

on the written submissions that would be tendered by the parties.

The Petitioners were serving as Sergeants attached to the Sri Lanka Police

Department at the time this application was filed, seeking inter olio a Writ of

Mandamus directing the 3rd -11th Respondents, the then Chairman and

members of the Public Service Commission to appoint the Petitioners to the

rank of Sub Inspector of Police with effect from 11th July 2007. Those who

succeeded the 3rd and the 4th - 11th Respondents as Chairman and as members

of the Public Service Commission respectively were subsequently added as the

15th -32nd Respondents, together with the Chairman and members of the

National Police Commission who were named as the 33rd - 3ih Respondents.

4

In the written submissions filed by the learned Counsel for the Pettioners, it

has been brought to the attention of this Court that other than for 61

Petitioners, the rest of the Petitioners have subsequently been appointed as

Sub Inspectors of Police.

The Petitioners state that the 1st Respondent, Inspector General of Police, by

telephone messagE-r~J-O.~ RTM 502 annexed to the petition marked 'P2' called

for applications for the promotion of serving Police Sergeants to the rank of

Sub Inspector of Police.

According to 'P2', the following qualifications were required of each applicant:

It is not in dispute that at the time the Petitioners submitted their applications,

they possessed the above qualifications, and that the Petitioners faced the

interview that was held in July 2007. The Petitioners have annexed to the

petition marked 'Pl' a table setting out the marks that each of them obtained

at the interview. This Court has examined 'Pl' and find that the Petitioners

have obtained between 47 and 61 marks.

5

The Petitioners state that those candidates who had obtained 62 marks and

above at the interview had been appointed by the 1st Respondent to the rank

of Sub Inspector. As each of the Petitioners had obtained less than the cut off

mark of 62, they were not eligible to be promoted to the rank of Sub Inspector.

Some other candidates- who were aggrieved- by the- aGove promotions had

invoked the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Writ

jurisdiction of this Court in 2007 and 2008 challenging the said promotions.

Pursuant to a settlement reached outside of Court, the petitioners in the said

cases were promoted to the rank of Sub Inspector with effect from 25th

September 2007, as borne out by telephone message No. RTM 228 dated 9th

February 2010, annexed to the petition marked 'P3'.

It appears that some other candidates who were dissatisfied with the

promotions effected by 'P3' had challenged the said promotions by way of

several fundamental rights applications filed in the Supreme Court, soon after

'P3' was issued. Having considered the submissions of the State, the Supreme

Court by its judgment delivered in SC (FR) Application No. 145/2010 on 19th

January 20121 had directed that all those petitioners who had obtained 47

marks and above at the interview be promoted to the rank of Sub Inspector.

With regard to Women Police Sergeants, the Supreme Court had observed in

SC (FR) Application No. 191/2010 that those with 59 marks had been promoted

by 'P3' and therefore, that all Women Police Sergeants who had obtained 59

1 Similar judgments have been delivered in SC (FR) Application No. 147/2010; SC (FR) Application No. 151/2010, and SC (FR) Application No. 191/2010.

marks or above at the interview should be promoted to the rank of Sub

Inspector of Police {Women},

The Petitioners filed this application on 2nd April 2013 claiming that they are

entitled to be promoted to the rank of Sub Inspector of Police, as each of them

have obtained 47 marks and above at the interview, which is the 'cut off' mark

for promotion, In tbe-caS-Of Women Police Sergeants, this mark was 59, Tbis

appears to be the basis of the Petitioners' case,

It would therefore be appropriate to consider the aforementioned judgments

of the Supreme Court relied upon by the Petitioners, which have been

produced by the Respondents marked 'R2' - 'RS', In SC {FR} Application No,

145/2010, the learned Deputy Solicitor General had informed Court that 'out

of the Officers who were promoted in terms of RTM 228 dated 9th February

2010, some officers had obtained only 47 marks and therefore the cut off mark

for the said set of promotions had been 47', The Supreme Court had therefore

observed that, "accordingly, it was clearly shown that promotions to the rank

of Sub Inspector of Police had been given to Officers who had obtained over

and above 47 marks at the interviews held in July 2007,"

The Supreme Court had thereafter held that the petitioners in the said case

and those who were promoted pursuant to 'P3' "are of the same class and

therefore there cannot be any differentiation between these two groups",

Accordingly, the Supreme Court had held that the petitioners in the said case

should be promoted to the rank of Sub Inspector of Police from the same date

as those promoted by 'P3',

7

This Court observes that in view of the submission of the State that in addition

to the petitioners in those cases, there may be other officers who would have

obtained over and above 47 marks at the interview held in July 2007, the

Supreme Court had held that the said judgment would only apply to those

petitioners who had come before the Supreme Court within one month of 'P3',

as required by Article 126(2) of the Constitution.

It is not in dispute that the Petitioners in this application have not invoked the

fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and that even this

application had been filed after a period of more than one year and two

months from the date of the said judgment of the Supreme Court, and a period

of over 3 years after 'P3' had been issued. It has been consistently held by the

Supreme Court as well as by this Court that the discretion of this Court will not

be exercised where there has been a long delay and where that delay has not

been explained to the satisfaction of this Court.

In Seneviratne v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and another2, the Supreme Court,

adverting to the question of long delay, held as follows:

"If a person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law

refused afterwards to lend him any assistance to enforce his rights; the law

both to punish his neglect, nom leges vigilontibus, non dormientibus

subveniunt/ and for other reasons refuses to assist those who sleep over

their rights and are not vigilant."

1 1999 (2) Sri LR 341 at 35l.

3 For the laws assist the watchful, (but) not the slothful.

8

This Court observes that if the Petitioners were aggrieved by 'P3', they ought

to have sought a legal remedy soon after 'P3' was issued. It is further

observed, that the Petitioners have not explained their delay in invoking the

jurisdiction of this Court and therefore, the Petitioners must bear full

responsibility for the delay and the consequences thereof.

The granting_of a Writ of Mandamus is a matter for the discretion-of Co~urt. It is

not a Writ of right and is not issued as a matter of course. In Jayaweera v.

Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and Another4 this

Court held as follows:

lithe Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a

writ of certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter

of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the

court has a discretion to deny him relief having regard to his conduct;

delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction are all valid impediments

which stand against the grant of relief."

In view of the inordinate delay in filing this application, this Court is of the view

that the Petitioners are not entitled to the discretionary remedy of Mandamus,

and for that reason, the necessity for this Court to consider if the Petitioners

have made out a case for the issuance of the Writ of Mandamus will not arise,

suffice to say that had the Petitioners fulfilled the requirements for promotion,

yet it must be effected according to t he procedure laid down in the Scheme of

Recruitment.s

5 See Anandasiri vs Premasiri, General Manager, Sri Lanka Railways rCA (Writ) Application No. 193/2007; CA

Minutes of 20th January 2012] where it was held as follows: "Even if the Petitioners have fulfilled the basic

9

This Court must note that even if the Petitioners are entitled to a Writ of

Mandamus, this Court will not exercise its discretion in favour of the

Petitioners due to the administrative inconvenience that would be caused by

granting promotions to those who have so far not been promoted, 12 years

after the interviews were held and, the consequences of granting a Writ in

such circumstances. 6 This would include issues relating to seniority,

consequential promotions, payment of back wages, adjustment of pensions in

the case of those who may have retired, others who may be similarly placed as

these Petitioners, etc. This Court is also mindful that there may be disciplinary

proceedings against some of the Petitioners, which this Court is not aware of,

especially since 6 years have lapsed since the filing of this application.

A similar view with regard to the inconvenience that could be caused by issuing

a Writ of Mandamus has been expressed by the Supreme Court in Wannigama

vs Incorporated Council of legal Education7 where the Supreme Court held as

follows:

"Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the 1st and 3rd respondents

contended that any order, which directs the Sri Lanka Law College to

admit the appellant would lead to several administrative difficulties as

there are a large number of other applicants, who have obtained higher

req uirements for promotion it has to be effected according to the procedu re laid down in the Scheme of Recruitment. The promotion depends on the cadre vacancies. A promotion cannot be claimed as of right; a mandamus is issued only if the Petitioners have a statutory right to promotion and the 1

st and 2nd Respondents have a public legal duty to enforce that right." .

6 See Venerable Dr. Paragoda Wimalawansa Thera Vs. 1. B. Wijerathna, Commissioner of Motor Traffic rCA (Writ) Application No. 1978/2004; CA Minutes of 31't March 2014J which fol lowed th e decision of the Supreme Court in Innasitamby vs Government Agent, Northern Province [34 NLR 33J where it was held that before issuing a writ of mandamus, the Court is entitled to take into consideration the consequences which the issue of the writ will entail.

marks than the appellant. Learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted

that if an order is given to admit the appellant considering fair procedure,

all those applicants, who would exceed one thousand in number, will

have to be admitted. He further contended that, the Sri Lanka Law College

is not equipped to accommodate over one thousand students in a given

batch. Accordingly, relying on the decision of Soertsz, J. in Maha Nayake

Thero, Malwatte Vihare v Registrar General,8 it was contended that the

harm to the appellant, who did not qualify for admission to the Sri Lanka

Law College is not sufficiently significant to outweigh the administrative

inconvenience that would undoubtedly follow in the event a decision is

taken to admit the appellant to the Sri Lanka Law College. In Maha

Nayake Thero, Malwatte Vihare, Soertsz, J. had stated that, " ... the writ

may be refused not only upon the merits, but also by reason of the special

circumstances of the case. The court will take a liberal view in

determining whether or not the writ will issue."

Having said that, if the marks obtained at the interview is the determining

factor for promotion, the action of the 1st Respondent in appointing persons

who have obtained less or equal marks than the Petitioners is unreasonable,

and can result in an injustice being caused to the Petitioners. Neither the

Petitioners nor the Respondents have explained if there were any special

considerations that prompted the Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law

and Order to have promoted those who obtained 47 marks at the interview

when the cut off mark for promotion was 62. In the absence of any

explanation, t his Court is of the view that the 1st Respondent and the National

Police Commission must consider why the Petitioners who had obtained either

839 NLR 186; quoting Halsbury's Laws of England.

11

equal or higher marks at the interview than those who were appointed in

terms of 'P3' are being treated differently and why the Petitioners who have

obtained the same or higher mark as those who were promoted should also

not be promoted, if the sole criterion for promotion was the-marks obtained at

the interview, and take remedial measures.

In this background, this Court directs the 1st Respondent, the Inspector General

of Police and the National Police Commission to consider carefully the

circumstances under which those who obtained lesser or equal marks than the

Petitioners at the interview held in 2007 have been appointed as Sub

Inspectors of Police, and whether the Petitioners are eligible to be promoted

to the rank of Sub Inspector of Police on the basis of the marks obtained by

them at the said interview. If the National Police Commission is satisfied that

those Petitioners who have not been promoted already are eligible to be so

promoted to the rank of Sub Inspector, it may consider their promotion to the

rank of Sub Inspector of Police, on a supernumerary basis in the event there

aren't sufficient vacancies in the cadre, with effect from a date and subject to

any other conditions to be determined by the National Police Commission.

Subject to the above, this application is dismissed. This Court makes no order

with regard to costs.
