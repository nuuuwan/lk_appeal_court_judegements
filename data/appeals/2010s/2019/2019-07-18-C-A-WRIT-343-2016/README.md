Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Nuwan Bopage for the Petitioner.

Maithree Amarasinghe, S.C., for the 1st

Respondent.

S. Gamage for the 2nd and 3rd Respondents.

Decided on: 18.07.2019

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioners filed this application seeking to quash by way of

writs of certiorari the decision of the 1st Respondent (Urban

Development Authority) dated 06.05.2014 marked X24 and the

decision of the 2nd Respondent (Municipal Council of Dehiwala-

Mount Lavinia) dated 05.06.2013 marked X20. The Petitioners

also seek a writ of prohibition prohibiting the Respondents from

preventing the Petitioners from using the premises in issue as a

business premises and also from demolishing the premises.

X1 is the application tendered to the 2nd Respondent for

alteration of an approved Plan to start a hotel in the premises.

The new Plan tendered was X3. As seen from X1, X3 and X41,

the 2nd Respondent has approved the new Plan for Commercial

Building on 18.12.2003 subject to conditions.2

Thereafter commercial building has been put up and business

commenced. The Street Line Certificate, Non-Vesting Certificate

have been issued.3 Trade licenses on yearly basis since 2005 to 1 X4 is the approved Building Permit. 2 The Mayor himself has signed X1, X3 and X4. 3 X8(i)-X8(ii).

3

conduct the hotel business4, Liquor Licenses with Sri Lanka

Tourism Development Authority Approvals5, Environment

Protection Licenses6 etc. have all been issued. The assessment

rates and the other taxes have been regularly paid.7 These facts

are undisputed.

When matters remained as such, about 10 years after the said

Building Permit for Commercial Building was issued, and the

business was in full swing, the Petitioners have received a letter

from the 2nd Respondent8 dated 05.06.2013 marked X20 stating

that the Planning Committee decided to cancel the Development

Permit No. RB/179/01 dated 18.12.2003 (X4) issued for

Commercial building since only ten feet road available to the site.

Therefore you should change use of building to Residential

purpose as per approved Building Plan.

I must straightaway state that this decision has been taken

without giving a hearing to the Petitioners in grave violation of a

fundamental rule of natural justiceaudi alteram partem.

Hence, on that ground alone, X20 shall be quashed by certiorari.

The 2nd Respondent has taken the decision X20 on the direction

given by the 1st Respondent marked 1R5 dated 06.08.20129 to

cancel the Building Permit X4 already issued.10

4 Vide X5-X7, X14(i)-X14(vi), X28. 5 X16(i)-X16(viii), X17(i)-X17(vi). 6 X18(i)-X18(iii). 7 X19(i)-X19(xxi). 8 Signed by the Engineer Planning. 9 Signed by the Director (Enforcement). 10 Vide also paragraph 11 of the Statement of Objections of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents.

4

The 1st Respondent in paragraphs 8 and 15 of the statement of

objections states that powers were delegated to the 2nd

Respondent under the Urban Development Act. Then it is clear

that the 2nd Respondent has granted approval under the

delegated power.

The 1st Respondent tendering 1R4a and 1R4b says that as this

is in the residential area, the Planning Committee of the

Municipal Council has decided not to approve the Plan for non-

residential activities/tourism inter alia because the access road

is only 10 feet wide.

Despite these infirmities, the approval for a commercial building

has later been given by X4.

The decision contained in X20 is also unclear. There is no

meaning in cancelling the Development Permit dated 18.12.2003

(X4) as clause 1 thereof says that the said Permit is valid for one

year and could be extended for another two years only. The act

permitted to be done had long been completed when X20 was

issued. There is no complaint that any of the conditions

mentioned in X4 has been violated by the Petitioners.

When that Permit was issued to construct a Commercial

Building, the 2nd Respondent knew that the width of the road

leading to this proposed building was 10 feet. Hence it is

irrational to later rescind the approval on the ground that only

ten feet road available to the site.

Irrationality is a ground to quash an administrative decision by

certiorari. (Sesadi Subasinghe-Appearing through her next friend

v. Vishaka Vidyalaya11, Perera v. Tilakaratne12, Desmond Perera

v. Karunaratne Commissioner of National Housing13)

It is not clear what was meant in X20 by as per approved

Building Plan in you should change use of building to

Residential purpose as per approved Building Plan. Building

Plan approved was for a Commercial purpose.

The Petitioners by producing X13 says that to improve the

business inter alia they obtained a 20 million loan from the

Commercial Bank by mortgaging the property and they cannot

at once convert the use of the building from commercial to

residential.

By X24 dated 06.05.2014 the 2nd Petitioner has been served

with a Notice under the Urban Development Authority Act to

inform him that he shall restore the building to the earlier

position before 29.05.2014 wherein he has (according to the 1st

Respondent), without any authorization, changed the use of the

building from residential to business. This accusation is

outrageous. The Petitioners have not without any authorization

changed the use of the building. Change of the use of the

building has been done with authorization. Whether that

authorization is legal or illegal is a different matter. That has

not been put in issue in this case. The case filed in the

Magistrates Court based on this Notice X24 cannot proceed.

I quash X24 and X20 by way of writs of certiorari as prayed for

in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer to the petition. As I have

already come to the conclusion that Magistrates Court of Mt.

Lavinia case No.9347/S/15 based on Notice X25 cannot

proceed, there is no necessity to issue a general writ of

prohibition as prayed for in paragraph (d) of the prayer to the

petition. No costs.

This shall not prevent the Urban Development Authority, if so

advised, to take fresh steps if they think that the Petitioners are

violating the Urban Development Authority Act or any other

Law. In that eventuality, the Urban Development Authority

shall give a hearing to the Petitioner before coming to any

conclusion. In such new inquiry the Petitioner cannot take up

the position that the matter is res judicata.
