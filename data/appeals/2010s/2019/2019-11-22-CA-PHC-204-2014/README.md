A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

On a certificate of enforcement issued in terms of Section 8( I) of the

Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983, the Claimant-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Respondent) instituted action against the

Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent), in

the Magistrates Court of Colombo. After inquiry, the learned Magistrate made

order to recover the sLIm due referred to in the said certi ficate as a fine. Being

Page 2 of 6

aggrieved, the 1

51 Respondent invoked the jurisdiction of the Provincial High

Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo to set aside the said order. At

the stage of proceedings, the 2nd Respondent informed the High Court that he

would not enforce the said certificate since the intervenient Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) is not entitled to the payment of gratuity

by the 151 Respondent. On the strength of the said submission, the learned High

Court Judge made impugned order dated 0411212014, preventing the enforcement

of the said order made by the learned Magistrate. An application filed by the

Appellant to intervene in the said proceedings was also not considered.

The Appellant is before this Court, inter-alia, to set aside the said order

dated 04112/2014, of the learned High Court Judge and affirm the order dated

2211112013 of the learned Magistrate or in the alternative to direct the learned

High Court Judge to add the Appellant as a party to the revision application and to

consider the action on its merits.

The State Counsel appearing for the 2nd Respondent submitted to Court that

certain documents, which were brought to the notice of the 1

51 Respondent

subsequent to the mqUiry held in the Magistrates Court revealed that the

Appellant's salary is paid through the consolidated fund and therefore, the

Appellant should be considered as a government teacher and as such would not be

entitled to the benefits under the said Act. The said documents have been tendered

to Court by motion dated 16/0912014 and 2811012014, marked XI to X8 and YI

Page 3 of 6

and Y2, respectively. The Appellant's contention is that by not considering the

documents filed by the 15t Respondent, the impugned order has caused a

miscarriage of justice.

By the impugned order dated 04112/2014, the learned High Court Judge

prevented the enforcement of the order of the learned Magistrate and did not

consider the application of the Appellant for intervention. However, the said order

was made subject to the rights of the Appellant to make representations before the

2nd Respondent for non-enforcement of the certificate. It is important to note that

the impugned order does not go into the validity of the certificate, which is

possible in proceedings before the High Court. The validity of the certificate filed

in the Magistrates Court was not in dispute.

It is submitted that the Appellant's salary was paid by the Government

through the 1st Respondent and therefore is entitled to the payment of gratuity.

However, the 15t Respondent whi Ie relying on documents marked 'Y l ' and 'Y2 '

(at pages 157 & 158 of the brief) urged that, the Appellant's salary was paid

through the Consolidated Fund of the Government and therefore, the Appellant

should be considered as a Government teacher and would not be entitled to such

payment.

The Appellant further submits that the documents marked ' B l ' and 'B2',

filed before this Court, on behalf of the Secretary Ministry of Education, clearly

Page 4 of 6

shows that the Government had no intention of considering the Appellant as a

Government teacher.

The Appellant was recruited as a teacher by the 1 Sl Respondent and was

under the authority of a manager. It is submitted that the services of the Appellant

was not transferable unlike government teachers. Therefore, except for the

payment of salary, and certain other supervisory powers, the government had no

authority over the Appellant. The Counsel for the Appellant has drawn attention to

Sections 5 and Section 7(b) of the Act and to several decided cases in support of

his contention. Further the Appellant has annexed documents marked Al to A4,

B 1 to B2, C and D in support, annexed to the written submissions filed of record.

It is observed that the said documents were not before the learned High Court

Judge at the time the impugned order was made.

The application made before this Court has sought to revise the order given

by the learned High Court Judge and to give effect to the order of the learned

Magistrate, taking into consideration the documents tendered to this Court. The

said documents were not privy to the learned High Court Judge when making the.

impugned order. Therefore, if this Court proceeds to make an order on the strength

of the documents filed at this stage, there is a strong likelihood that this Court

would be infringing upon the procedural rights of an aggrieved party to challenge

such order.

The documents filed by the Appellant in this Court, in my view, would

attract the indulgence of the High Court to visit the merits of this case in order to

consider the application for intervention.

Therefore, I set aside the impugned order of the learned High Court Judge

and direct that the Appellant be permitted to intervene in the application before the

High Court and the case to be decided on its merits.

Parties in PHC-020 1-14 have agreed to abide by the judgment in this case.

Application allowed. I make no order for costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

I agree.
