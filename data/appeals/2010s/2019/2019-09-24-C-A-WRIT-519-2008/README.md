4th September 2019

The Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the recommendation of the 1st -6th Respondents, annexed to the

petition marked 'G' by which the Petitioner was directed to:

(a) Place the 8th Respondent on salary scale A6 from 22nd June 1999 with all

allowances and other payments which are no less than of his colleagues;

(b) Pay reasonable compensation to the 8th Respondent for the full loss of

career.

3

This application was initially dismissed by this Coure on a preliminary objection

raised by the Respondents that a recommendation of the Human Rights

Commission is not liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari. On appeal, the

Supreme Court held that this Court was in error in dismissing this application

and held that "if a recommendation of a Public Body affects the right of an

individual, Superior Courts, in the exercise of their writ jurisdiction, have the

power to quash such a recommendation by issuing a writ of certiorari.,,2 Having

set aside the judgment of t his Court, the Supreme Court directed this Court to

re-hear this application on its merits.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The 8th Respondent had joined the Department of Telecommunications in 1983

as a Clerk and had been absorbed to the Petitioner company in the same

capacity. The Petitioner had been selected as an Assistant Sales Manager in

1998 and had been t ransferred to the Marketing Division on 26th April 1999.

The issue which gives rise to this application arose in August 1999, when the

Petitioner received a complaint from a customer, that the 8th Respondent had

solicited a bribe from him to provide five telephone lines and IDD facilities to

his business establishment under the premium package. The Petitioner states

that a preliminary investigation was held in respect of the said complaint, and

that the Investigation Officer, by his report annexed to the petition marked

'Pi', had arrived at t he conclusion that the 8th Respondent was "not fit to hold

the responsible position of Assistant Sales Manager" and "allowing him to

continue there would not win customers, but will bring disrepute to the

1 ~ Judgment dated 30 January 2012.

2 SC Appeal No. 215/2012; 5C Minutes of 1" March 2017, judgment by Sisira De Abrew, J.

4

company". The Inquiry Officer, while holding that "it is difficult to establish

bribery ... for bribes had not been given or taken, but the gravity of the offence

will not be reduced" had recommended that the 8th Respondent be transferred

out of the Marketing Division.

The Petitioner states that it took into consideration the recommendation in

'PI', and by letter dated 4th November 1999, transferred the 8th Respondent to

the Commercial Division with immediate effect, pending formal disciplinary

action. The Petitioner states further that it was compelled to take prompt

action in order to maintain the reputation of the company. The 8th Respondent

had however refused to report to work at the Commercial Division and about a

month later had protested against the said transfer. The formal inquiry had

commenced on 17th January 2000 and had been re-scheduled for 21st January

2000. The 8th Respondent, having attended the inquiry on the first date, had

failed to attend the inquiry on the latter date as well as on the subsequent

dates to which the inquiry had been postponed. By letter dated 18th January

2000, annexed to the pet ition marked 'P2', the 8th Respondent had informed

the Petitioner that he has made an application to the Labour Tribunal on the

basis that there has been a constructive termination of his employment by the

Petitioner and that in view of the said application, he would not be attending

the formal inquiry. The Petitioner states that the formal inquiry was

abandoned in view of 'P2'.

It is therefore observed that the incident that gave rise to the application to

the Labour Tribunal is the transfer of the 8th Respondent to the Commercial

Division.

5

By letter dated 24th April 2000, annexed to the petition marked 'P4', the 1st

Respondent, the Human Rights Commission had called for observations of the

Petitioner on a complaint filed by the 8th Respondent with the 1 st Respondent.

This Court has examined the said complaint annexed to the petition marked

'P3', and observes that the grievance of the 8 th Respondent was that,

"suddenly, I received a transfer order on 4th November 1999 stating no reason,

transferring me to Commercial Section, demoting my position/grade without

notice whatsoever, for no reason."

When the matter came up for inquiry before the 1 st Respondent on 19th June

2001, the Counsel for the Petitioner had raised a preliminary objection that the

1 st Respondent did not have jurisdiction to hear the application of the 8th

Respondent for the reason that the act complained of by the 8th Respondent

did not constitute an executive or administrative action. This Court has

examined the extensive written submissions filed by the parties3 and must

observe that the said written submissions were limited to the question of

jurisdiction and that the parties did not address the 1st Respondent on the

merits of the complaint of the 8th Respondent.

By a letter dated 3rd April 2006 annexed to the petition marked 'PIS', the 1st

Respondent had informed the Petitioner as follows:

"The Human Rights Commission rejected the preliminary objections

forwarded by the Respondent and inquired into the above matter.

3 The Written Submissions have been annexed to the petition marked 'P9' -'P14',

6

According to the report prepored by the retired Judge of the Court of

Appeal in relation to the above application, there is a violation of Article

12(1) of the Constitution. Therefore it is recommended:

i. To grant the salary scale of A6 from 22nd June 1999 and place at

appointment with all allowances and other payment which are not

less than that of his colleagues V. Niles, Neteumam and P.M. W.

Kumara;

ii. To pay a reasonable compensation for the full loss of career."

Dissatisfied by 'P1S', the Petitioner had invoked the jurisdiction of this Court by

way of CA (Writ) Application No. 1373/2006 seeking to quash 'P1S'. Apart from

the argument that the 1st Respondent had erred on the aforementioned

preliminary objection, the Petitioner had also argued that it was deprived of

an opportunity to present its case on the substantive issue of whether the

complaint of the 8th Respondent is a violation of the 8th Respondent's

fundamental rights. The said application had however been withdrawn by the

Petitioner on an undertaking given by the 8th Respondent that he was willing to

have a fresh inquiry conducted by the 1st Respondent.

By letter dated 12th March 2007, annexed to the petition marked '~', the 1st

Respondent informed the parties t hat an inquiry wou ld be held before the 6th

Respondent on 20th March 2007, thereby demonstrating the agreement of the

1st Respondent to conduct a fresh inquiry. The parties had thereafter been

7

requested to file written submissions. At the inquiry held on 24th April 2007,

the Petitioner had raised the following two preliminary objections:

a) The actions of the Petitioner are not executive or administrative acts as

contemplated by Article 17 and 126 of the Constitution and therefore the

Human Rights Commission does not have the jurisdiction to hear the

complaint of the 8th Respondent;

b) As the Labour Tribunal has decided on the complaint of the 8th

Respondent with regard to his transfer, the 1st Respondent cannot go into

the identical question.s

The 1st Respondent by its recommendation dated 3rd March 2008, annexed to

the petition marked 'G', overruled the said objections and proceeded to grant

the 8th Respondent the same relief contained in 'PIS'.

It is in the above background that the Petitioner has filed this application

seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said Recommendation of the 1st

Respondent marked 'G' . During the course of the hearing, the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that he is challenging the

decision of the 1st Respondent on four grounds. This Court will now consider

each of the said grounds.

'Annexed to the petition, marked 'D', 'E' and T.

S It is admitted between the parties that the Labour Tribunal, by its order dated 3" March 200S, annexed to the petition marked 'P29' had hpl~ that the services of the 8" Respondent had not been con'''uctively terminated by the Petjt iOi ,~..: ; oJ that the 8th Respondent had vacated his post. Thflo ... : .~I 'l"'In had accordingly been dismissed by the Labour Tribunal.

8

The first ground urged by the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner

was that Sri Lanka Telecom is not a State entity and therefore, the 1st

Respondent does not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the complaint of the

8th Respondent as the acts of the Petitioner do not amount to "executive or

administrative actions" as required by the Human Rights Commission of Sri

Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996. In order to address this issue, this Court is required

to consider whether the acts of the Petitioner which forms the subject matter

of this application, can be considered as executive and administrative actions.

The power of the 1st Respondent to look into complaints of alleged

Fundamental Rights violations is contained in Section 14 of the H4rnan Rights

Act, No. 21 of 1996, and reads as follows:

"The Comilission mo)" on its own motion or on a complaint fTlade to it by

an aggrieved person or group of persons or a person acting pn behalf of

an aggrieved person or a group of persons, investigate an allegation of the

infringe'~lent or imminent infringement of a fundamental right of such

person or group of persons caused-

(a) by executive or administrative action; or

(b) as a result of an act which constitutes an offence under the Prevention

of terrorism Act No.48 of 1979, committed by any person."

The Petitioner had originally been a Department of the Government of Sri

Lanka. Its sHtus had been changed to a Corporation known as 'Sri Lanka

Telecom' in te ~m :,: ,~f - ' . ord~ r made under the provisions of the 5 ;;.::_.: ~ dustrial

9

Corporations Act No. 49 of 1957. 'Sri Lanka Telecom' had thereafter been

converted into a public company by the name of 'Sri Lanka Telecom Limited'

under and in terms of an order made under Section 2 of the Conversion of

Public Corporations and Government Owned Business Undertakings into Public

Companies Act No. 23 of 1987. In 1997, the Secretary to the Treasury, in whose

name the shares of the Petitioner was held, had sold 35% of the shares in the

Petitioner to Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (Nne). 3.5% of the

shares of the Petitioner had been distributed amo ng the employees, leaving

the Government with 61.5% of the shares in the Petitioner. This is the position

that prevailed at the time the 8th Respondent filed a complaint with the 1st

Respondent.

Over the years, the Supreme Court has sought to define and interpret what is

meant by 'executive and administrative action'. In Hemasiri Fernando vs. Hon.

Mangala Samarweera, Minister of Posts, Telecommunication and Media and

others6, the Secretary to the Treasury, purporting to act on behalf of the

Government of Sri Lanka, removed the Chairman / Director of Sri Lanka

Telecom. In considering t he issue whether the said action was a violation of

the petitioners fundamental rights, the Supreme Court held as follows7:

"As observed earlier the Government of Sri Lanka owns 61.5% of the

shares of the company and it is the beneficial owner of 35% of the shares

held by the NTTC. Behind the veneer of the commercial company is the

State. The power of the State is conferred on the 3,d Respondent to be held

for the benefit of the public."

' (19991 1 Sri LR ~l~~ _ J . --' Ibid. at page 420.

10

In Leo Samson vs. Sri Lankan Airlines Ltd and Others8 the Supreme Court

adopted the "deep and pervasive control" test to determine whether the acts

complained of falls within the ambit of the meaning of executive and

administrative action. In Jayakody v Sri Lanka Insurance and Robinson Hotel

Co. Ltd and Others

9, the Supreme Court adopted the "agency test" to hold that

the impugned acts in that case fell within the meaning of executive and

administrative actions. The "agency test" in this case was when the

Government owns the majority of shares in a company, such a company

becomes a "state agency" and when the Government hands over the

management of such a company to minority shareholders, the acts of that

person becomes executive or administrative action.

In Prof Dharmaratne and Others vs. Institute of Fundamental Studies and

OtherslO, the Supreme Court was called upon to determine whether the

Institute of Fundamental Studies, which was a corporate body established by

Statute, was an agency or instrumentality of the State. Justice Marsoof, having

identified the several tests that have been developed to ascertain whether a

corporate body is an agency or instrumentality of the State, stated as follows:

" our Courts have applied varia us tests to determine whether a

particular person, institution or other body whose action is alleged to be

challenged under Article 126 of the Constitution, is an emanation or

agency of the State exercising executive or administrative functions.

Where the body whose action is sought to be impugned (is) a corporate

entity these tests have focused, among ather things on the nature of the

'(2001) 1 Sri LR 94. 9(2001) 1 Sri!..q ~,:"".{ . .-t~ L

'(2013) 1 Sri LR 367.

11

functions performed by the relevant body, the question whether the state

is the beneficiary of its activities, the manner of (its) constitution, whether

by statutory incorporation or otherwise, the dependence of the body

whose action is sought to be challenged on state funds, the degree of

control exercised by the State, the existence in it of sovereign

characteristics or features, and whether it is otherwise an instrumentality

or agency of the State. However, as will be seen, these tests flow into each

other."

In the recent case of Captain Channa D.L. Abeygunewardena vs. Sri lanka

Ports Authority and Othersll Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, having analysed

the development of the interpretation of "executive and administrative

actions" held as follows:

"Drawing from the aforesaid decisions of this Court and Indian decisions,

some of the identifying characteristics which show a corporate body to be

an agency or instrumentality of the State, may be collated as follows:

1. The State, either directly or indirectly, having ownership of the

corporate body or a substantial stake in the ownership of the

corporate body;

2. The corporate body performing functions of public importance which

are closely related to Governmental functions;

"SCFR 57/2016 SC Minutes of 20'" Jan uary 2017.

12

3. The corporate body hoving taken over the functions of a Department

of the State;

4. The State having deep and pervasive control of the corporate body;

5. The State having the power to appoint Directors and Officers of the

corporate body;

6. The State praviding a substantial amount of financial assistance to

the corporate body;

7. The corporate body transferring its profits to the State;

8. The State deriving benefits from the operation of the corporate body;

9. The State providing benefits, concessions or assistance to the

corporate body which are usually granted to organs of the State;

10. The Accounts of the corporate body being subject to audit by the

Auditor General or having to be submitted to the State or an official

of the State;

11. The State having conferred a monopoly or near monopoly in its field

of business to the corporate body or the State protecting such a

monopoly or near monopoly;

13

12. Officers of the corporate body enjoying immunity from suit for acts

done in their official capacity."

Having laid out the above characteristics, Justice Jayawardena proceeded to

state as follows:

"Although I have, for purposes of easy reference, set out the above list of

some of the identifying characteristics of a corporate body which is an

agency or instrumentality of the State, it is important to keep in mind that,

this list is by no means exhaustive. Further, it must be stressed that, the

presence of one or more of these identifying characteristics does not,

necessarily, lead to the conclusion that a corporate body is an agency or

instrumentality of the State. Instead, it is, usually, the cumulative effect of

some of these identifying characteristics being found in a corporate body,

which leads to the conclusion that it is an agency or instrumentality of the

State. As Bhagwati J, as he then was, emphasised in Ramana Oayaram

Shetty vs. the International Airport Authority of India12, " ..... it is not

possible to make an exhaustive enumeration of the tests which would

invariably and in all cases provide an unfailing answer to the question

whether a corporation is governmental instrumentality or agency .... lt is

the aggregate or cumulative effect of all the relevant factors that is

controlling."

This Court will now consider the position of the Petitioner in the light of the

above judgments of the Supreme Court.

12 AIR 1979 SC 1628.

14

As observed earlier, at the time the 8

t h Respondent was transferred, the

Government, through the Secretary to the Treasury, held 61.5% of the shares

in t he Petitioner.

After the sale of 35% of the shares in the Petitioner to NTT, the Government,

as t he majority shareholder had entered into a Shareholders Agreement (SHA)

with NTT, which has been annexed to the petition marked 'P2S' Clause 6.1 of

the said SHA provides that t he Board of Directors of the Petitioner shall consist

of up to ten Directors, up to six of whom shall be appointed by the

Government. Of t he said Government directors, one shall be the Chairman of

the Petitioner. In terms of Clause 7.3 of the SHA, the quorum for a meeting of

the Board of Directors shall be any four Directors present in person thereat of

whom at least two must be Government Directors. Clause 5.3 of the SHA

provided that the quorum for a General Meeting shall include the

Government.

Schedule 2 of the SHA sets out a list of items referred to as 'Restricted

Matters', which include the ability of the Petitioner to raise finance, acquisition

and sale of assets having a value in excess of USD 10m etc. Clause 7.2 of the

SHA provides that any resolution in relation to the 'Restricted Matters' shall

requ ire approval by a majority of the votes cast at such meeting of the

Directors with at least one Government Director and at least one Investor

Director voting in favour of the resolution.

When this Court considers t he above facts, it is clear to this Court that at the

relevant time, the Govern ment held t he majority of t he shares in the Petitioner

: a"''' t hrough its Directors, controlled t he Pe!i+i,:,nor.J hus, the Government was

15

'.

in control of the Petitioner, both at the Directors' level as well as at the

members level. In these circumstances, this Court ta kes the view that the acts

of the Petitioner fall within the description of 'executive and administrative'

action, and therefore this Court is not in agreement with the first submission

raised on behalf of the Petitioner, This Court is therefore of the view that the

decision of the 1st Respondent in rejecting the first preliminary objection is

correct.

The second ground urged by the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner

was that the 1st Respondent Commission made their recommendation 'G' on

the substantial issue of whether the Petitioner violated the fundamental rights

of t he 8th Respondent, without affording the parties a hearing on the merits,

which is mandatory in terms of Section 15(5) of the Human Rights Commission

Act, which reads as follows:

"No recommendation shall be made by the Commission under the

preceding provisions of this section in respect of the infringement or

imminent infringement of a fundamental right except after affording an

opportunity of being heard ta the person alleged to be about to infringe or

to have infringed such fundam ental right."

A consideration of this argument requ ires this Court to briefly re-examine the

sequence of events that led to the making of the recommendation 'G', This

Court has examined the initial complaint of the 8th Respondent to the 1st

Respondent, annexed to the petition marked 'P3', Having narrated the

relevant facts pertaining to the allegation of bribery made against him, the 8th

D~spondent states that, "But suddenlv J. ''',ro/ved a transfer order on 4th

16

. .....

November 1999 stating no reason, transferring me to S/Commercial Section,

demoting my position / grade without notice whatsoever for no reason.

protested against this arbitrary transfer and returned the order to CAG."

The 8th Respondent's complaint to the 1st Respondent was therefore two fold-

the first is that he was transferred, and the second was that he had been

demoted in the process of being transferred. The task of the 1st Respondent

was therefore to inquire into this complaint and consider whether the

fundamental rights of the 8th Respondent were infringed by this act of the

Petitioner.

Having called for and received the observations of the Petitioner,13 the hearing

before the Inquiry Officer had commenced on 31st May 2000. The preliminary

objection that the 1st Respondent does not have the jurisdiction to inquire into

the said complaint as the act complained of does not constitute executive or

administrative action was raised on 19th June 2001. The Petitioner states on a

direction made by t he Inquiry Officer, the parties had tendered written

submissions on the jurisdictional objection, which have been annexed to the

petition marked 'pg' - 'P14'. As observed earlier, the said written submissions

have dealt solely with the jurisdictional objection. The said submissions do not

contain a discussion on the merits of the aforementioned complaint of the 8th

Respondent.

13 The letter sent by the 1st Respondent is anneYPtl

Petitioner has been annexed to the petition marked 'PS'.

ti tion marked 'P4' while the response of the

17

Having filed the last written submission 'P14' in December 2001, the Petitioner

states it did not hear from the 1st Respondent until it received the letter dated

3'd April 2006 marked 'P1S', which reads as follows:

"The Human Rights Commission rejected the preliminary objections

forwarded by the Respondent and inquired into the above matter.

According to the report prepared by the retired Judge in relation to the

above application, there is a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

(A copy of the report is attached).14 Therefore it is recommended:

I. To grant the salary scale of A6 from 22nd June 1999 and place at

appointment with all allowances and other payment which are not

less than that of his colleagues V. Niles, Neteunam and P.M. W.

Kumar;

ii. To pay a reasonable compensation for the f ull loss of career."

This Court finds annexed to 'P1S', the observations of the retired Judge,

marked 'P16', which consists of the following parts:

Part I - containing the findings on the preliminary objection; and

Part II - containing the findings of fact, which led to the aforementioned

recommendation .

14 The report has been annexed to the petition, marked 'P16' ,

18

. .. .-.

.. .. .

The Petitioner states (a) that the person who eventually made the

recommendation in 'PIG' was not the Inquiry Officer before whom the parties

had appeared; (b) that it was never informed that a retired Judge had been

appointed to inquire into the complaint 'P3'; and (c) that it was not afforded an

opportunity of making representations before the said retired Judge. More

important however is the allegation of the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent

did not afford the Petitioner a hearing on the substantive complaint, either

orally or by way of written submissions and did not conduct an inquiry into the

primary complaint of t he 8

th Respondent. The Petitioner states that as a result,

it was deprived of an opportunity of placing before the 1st Respondent, its case

on the merits of the complaint of the 8th Respondent.

It is in these circumstances that the Petitioner filed CA (Writ) Application No.

1373/2006 challenging 'PIS' and 'PIG'. As referred to earlier in this judgment,

the said application had been withdrawn by the Petitioner on 23rd February

2007 upon being informed that the 8th Respondent is agreeable to a fresh

inquiry being conducted. The 1st Respondent had accordingly informed the

parties by its letter marked '~' to be present before it for an inquiry on 20th

March 2007 before a new Inquiry Officer, thus demonstrating the agreement

of the 1st Respondent to conduct a fresh inquiry.

The Petitioner had raised the aforementioned two preliminary objections at

the fresh inquiry.ls This Court has examined the written submissions tendered

by the parties annexed to the petition marked '0', T and l' and observes that

IS The objections being that the acts complaine" ,I ,. 1"t an 'executive or administrative act' and the fact that the issue before the 1" Respondent has alr02" ;--',. ~~ c ided by the Labour Tribunal and therefore cannot bo gone into by the 1" Respondent.

19

.'>. .

the said written submissions have been tendered only in respect of the said

preliminary objections, and that a discussion of the merits has not taken place.

The decision of the 1st Respondent has been communicated to the parties by

letter dated 3rd March 2008, annexing the recommendation of the 1st

Respondent, marked 'G'. This Court has examined 'G' and observes that,

having overruled both preliminary objections and having determined that it

has jurisdiction to determine the said application, the 1st Respondent had held

as follows:

"Since the application is nearly nine years old, and in the recommendation

the question of jurisdiction too was adverted to, there is no need now to

hold a fresh inquiry. Therefore the previous recommendation has to

stand."

The above recommendation gives rise to two issues. The first is, having agreed

to conduct a fresh inquiry, and having informed the parties that a fresh inquiry

will be conducted, the Inquiry Officer has erred by arriving at a conclusion that

a fresh inquiry need not be held. The second issue is, having rejected the

preliminary objections, the Inquiry Officer ought to have fixed the matter for a

hearing on the merits. Instead of doing that, the Inquiry Officer has erred by

adopting the previous recommendation, which had not considered the merits

at all, and thereby deprived the Petitioner of presenting its side of the story. In

other words, the 1st Respondent has not afforded the Petitioner a hearing on

the merits either at the first inquiry or at the second inquiry. The 1st

Respondent has therefore acted not only in violation of Section 15(5) of the

20

Act but contrary to the legitimate expectation of the Petitioner that it would

be afforded a hearing on the merits.

This Court is of the view that it is fundamental that an Inquiry Officer follow

the principles of natural justice and affords both parties a proper hearing,

thereby enabling each party to present their side of the story.

In Gamlathge Ranjith Gamlath vs Commissioner General of Excise and two

others/6 Sripavan J (as he then was) held as follows:

"It is one of the fundamental principles in the administration of justice that

an administrative body which is to decide must hear both sides and give

both an opportunity of hearing before a decision is taken. No man can

incur a loss of property by judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings unless and

until he has had a fair opportunity of answering the complaint made

against him. Thus, objectors at public inquiries must be given a fair

opportunity to meet adverse evidence, even though the statutory

provisions do not cover the case expressly. (Vide Errington v. Minister of

Health17) . The court would certainly regard any decision as having grave

consequences if it affects proprietary rights. In Schmidt and another v.

Secretary of State for Home Af(airs18 Lord Denning M. R. suggested that

the ambit of natural justice extended not merely to protect rights but any

legitimate expectation of which it would not be fair to deprive a person

without hearing what he has to say."

21

This Court is of the view that the 6th Respondent who conducted the inquiry

the second time round, should have gone into the evidence and made a factual

determination as to whether there was infact a violation of the fundamental

rights of the 8th Respondent arising from 'P3'. This Court is further of the view

that in the light of the agreement reached in CA (Writ) Application No.

1373/2006 to conduct a fresh inquiry, the 6th Respondent could not have

resorted to the earlier recommendation contained in 'PIG'. The fact that nine

years had lapsed since the complaint should not be held against the Petitioner.

It is significant to note that the 1st Respondent had made no reference to, nor

made any factual determination as to the liability of t he Petitioner with regard

to the alleged fundamental rights violation arising as a result of the transfer,

even though it has recommended the payment of compensation to the 8th

Respondent.

This Court is therefore in agreement with the second ground placed before this

Court by the learned President's Counsel for t he Petitioner that the 1st

Respondent did not afford the Petitioner a hearing on the substantive dispute

and is of the view that t he recommendation 'G' is liable to be quashed by a

Writ of Certiorari.

As t he 1st Respondent had adopted the recommendations made in 200G

contained in 'PIG', and as 'PIG' contained findings of fact which had been

arrived at without hearing the parties, this Court is of the view that it is

appropriate for this Court to consider the recommendation made by the

Inquiry Officer in 2006 in order to ascertain the basis for such finding of fact in

'PIG'.

Having filed the initial complaint in 2000, the 8th Respondent, by a letter dated

I 18th April 2001, annexed to the petition marked 'P7', had reiterated the

circumstances that led to his transfer in 1999. It appears from paragraph 11 of

'P7' that while the inquiry was proceeding, a proposal had been made that the

8th Respondent return to employment on the last paid salary and face a

disciplinary inquiry. The 8th Respondent had agreed to the said proposal on the

condition that he be permitted to resume work in the post of Assistant

Manager. However, the Petitioner had not been agreeable to the said

condition, as by then, the Marketing Division of the Petitioner had been

reorganised and the position of 'Assistant Manager, Sales' had been re-

designated as 'Senior Marketing Representative', and the 8th Respondent was

of the view that the new designation was a post inferior to what he held and

that the restructuring had frustrated his legitimate expectations. The 8th

Respondent had stated further that three others who had been selected as

Assistant Manager, Sales together with him, had been placed on salary scale

'A6' with effect from 22nd June 1999 and that he too should be placed on the

same salary scale.

The complaint that the 1st Respondent had to adjudicate upon was the

complaint that was made by the 8th Respondent in March 2000, marked 'P3',

that he had been unfairly transferred and in the process of which he had been

demoted. The fact that the Marketing division of the Petitioner had undergone

re-structuring and the fact that the position held by the 8th Respondent had

been abolished, becomes relevant, if at all, only once a determination is made

by the 1st Respondent on the complaint 'P3', since 'P3' was the complaint that

the Petitioner had been called upon to answer. In this background, this Court

examined Part II of.''::~F ,.,d finds that the Inquiry Officer has nnt ,,,,r -'-I~ red

23

at all the matters set out in 'P3'. Instead, the Inquiry Officer had focussed his

attention to what was set out by the 8th Respondent in 'P7' and made the

following observations:

"The complainant states that according to the re-organised structure he

would be assigned the new salary group of M3. He further states that

although his earlier designation was "Assistant Manager Sales", his new

designation would be "Senior Marketing Representative". It is his view

that the object of this re-structuring is not for the attainment of

permissible corporate objectivity but for the sale purpose of effectively

invalidating some of the appointments made in the Marketing group.

He states V. Niles, Nateunam and P.M. W. Kumara had already been

assigned a new salary scale of A6 as of 30th September 1999. He states

these two officers were selected along with the rest in the list including the

complainant consequent on the internal advertisement and therefore he

says he belonged to the same case. The complainant states that assigning

him to an inferior post i.e "Senior Marketing Representative" in the

reorganised structure constitutes and frustrates his legitimate expectation

of holding the post of Assistant Manager Sales as per the internal

advertisement to which post he was appointed unconditionally. He says

the respondent has violated his fundamental right to equality guaranteed

in Article 12(1) of the Constitution. According to the complainant, the

respondent had indicated to the Commission that some of the persons

who had been appOinted as "Assistant Sales Manager" were in the

process of being assigned to salary group A6 but the eligibility criteria for

such assignn'::;rr 'A'ere not disclosed.

24

The complainant states such action on the part of the respondent

constitutes an imminent infringement of his fundamental rights. He states

the selection of persons to salary group A6 from among holders of the

post of Assistant Manager on undisclosed criteria Violates his right to

equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The complainant feels that he can no longer work under his employer with

the confidence that he would be treated fairly and justly.

Having considered the submissions made by both parties I am of the view

that the complainant's fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1)

have been violated by the respondent. I suggest that the complainant be

granted the salary scale of A6 from 22.06.1999 and placed at a point with

all allowances and other payments which are not less than that of his

colleagues V. Niles, Neteunam and P.M. W. Kumara.

Since he does not wish to work under the respondent anymore I suggest

that he be paid compensation for full loss of career which the Commission

thinks is appropriate."

The Inquiry Officer has sought to make a determination on the permissibility of

the restructuring process of the Petitioner without addressing the complaint of

the 8 th Respondent that his transfer and what followed thereafter was bad in

law. It is therefore clear that the Inquiry Officer who prepared 'P16', and on

which the recommendation that is now sought to be quashed is based, has

gone on a v oy~:~ ~f his own and considered irrelevant ma tt::c::~'~:"lIe failing to

25

consider relevant matters contained in 'P3'. In these circumstances, is it safe

for this Court to uphold 'G'? This Court thinks not, and takes the view that the

decision of the 1st Respondent is liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari in

view of the fact that the first Inquiry Officer has taken into consideration,

irrelevant material when arriving at the conclusion contained in 'P16' which

has been blindly followed by the second Inquiry Officer.

The third ground urged by the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner is

that in any event, the relief recommended by the 1st Respondent is vague and

cannot be given effect to. As observed earlier, the Petitioner has been directed

to pay a 'reasonable compensation' for the full loss of career. What is

'reasonable' is subjective and any payment made by the Petitioner can give

rise to further complaints and litigation. Furthermore, the payment of

compensation for the fu ll loss of career is inconsistent with the first

recommendation to place the 8

th Respondent on the same salary scale as that

of his colleagues, which In effect contemplates reinstatement. A

recommendation must be specific and must be capable of being given effect

to, which unfortunately is not the case in this application. This Court is in

agreement with the submission of the learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner that the two recommendations made by the 1st Respondent are

incompatible and irreconcilable and that they are in fact mutually exclusive

and collectively exhaustive.

Even though this application is liable to be dismissed in view of the above

findings of this Court, for the sake of completeness, this Court would now

proceed to consider the final argument of the learned President's Counsel for

the Petitio,..",. . .

26

As observed earlier, by an order dated 3rd March 2005, annexed to the petition

marked 'P29', the Labour Tribunal had held that the services of the gth

Respondent had not been constructively terminated by the Petitioner and that

the g th Respondent had vacated his post. The Order of the Labour Tribunal was

pronounced prior to both recommendations of the 1st Respondent, namely,

the initial Recommendation 'PiS' dated 3rd April 2006, and the subsequent

Recommendation 'G' dated 3rd March 200g. This Court observes that there has

been no appeal from the Order of the Labour Tribunal, marked 'P29'. The

Petitioner states that as no appeal was lodged against 'P29', the Labour

Tribuna l Order is final and conclusive vis-a-vis the rights of the gth Respondent

arising from the transfer. It is the contention of the learned President's

Counsel for t he Petitioner that as the judicial process on the grievance of the

gth Respondent has therefore been completed, the 1st Respondent is estopped

from considering the issue of the transfer of the gth Respondent.

A consideration of this issue requires this Court to examine the complaint of

the g th Respondent to the Labour Tribunal as well as the 1st Respondent, in

order to ascertain if t he complaints are identical. In order to understand the

nature of the complaint to the Labour Tribunal, this Court examined the Order

of t he Labour Tribunal marked 'P29'. The following sections of 'P29' reflect, in

the view of this Court, t he nature of the complaint:

As borne out by the above, the complaint of the 8th Respondent to the Labour

Tribunal was one of demotion, transfer and the consequences thereof, which is

identical to the complaint of the 8th Respondent to the 1st Respondent, as

contained in 'P3'. It is therefore clear to this Court t hat the complaint made to

the 1st Respondent and the application made to the Labour Tribunal arises

from the same issue; that the complaints are identical; and that the relief

sought from the Labour Tribunal and the 1st Respondent - i.e. 'reinstatement'

in the same post held prior to the transfer - is identical.

With regard to the said objection, the 1st Respondent, in its recommendation

marked 'G' states as follows:

16

"With regard to the complainant filing the case before the Labour Tribunal

and the L T dismissing the same. It can be stated that the same set of facts

and the circumstances can give rise to a breach of contract and a breach

of fundamental rights. Assertion of one right does not extinguish the

other."

Page 10 of 'P29'.

30

This Court does not disagree with the above observation of the 1st Respondent.

However, the preliminary objection that was raised by the Petitioner was not

that the 8th Respondent cannot seek relief from different fora. That is a right

available to the 8th Respondent and this Court will not interfere with that right.

However, a litigant who chooses to seek the identical relief from different fora

arising from the same incident, whether it is framed in the form of a violation

of fundamental rights or a violation of the contract of employment, must

understand that once one of his preferred forums grants or refuses relief, he

cannot pursue his cause in the rest of the fora to which he has complained.

That is a risk that a litigant must take .

In any event, the Petitioner's argument was that the 1st Respondent is

estopped from ruling on the identical issue since the Labour Tribunal has

already determined that the transfer and what followed thereafter did not

tantamount to construct ive termination and that the 8th Respondent had

vacated his post. Even though the 1st Respondent misdirected itself and did not

determine the issue complained of in 'P3', the issue that arises from the said

objection of the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent ought to have terminated

proceedings before it, once it was informed that the Labour Tribunal has

determined the said issue.

This Court is of the view that once the Labour Tribu nal pronounced its Order,

the 8th Respondent is estopped from continuing to agitate the same issue

before the 1st Respondent, and the 1st Respondent is estopped from

consideri ng the same issue. "Issue estoppel" is a principle of law which

prevents re-litigation of disputes before Courts. It applies to facts directly

.. ~,,"Ac ided by Courts, and those matters wh;, '1 /"~ :n part of the decision which

31

were necessary to making the finding of fact or law. When a judgment of a

Court is final and conclusive, it decides the issues in dispute before it once and

for all, and cannot be disputed by the same parties again. These principles of

law exist as a matter of public policy so that disputing parties are prevented

from re-agitating the same disputes and to ensure that finality is brought to

disputes between the parties.

In New Brunswick Railway Company v British and French Trust Corporation

Ltd27 the House of Lords set out the rationale for the above in the following

manner:

"The doctrine of estoppel is one founded on considerations of justice and

good sense. If an issue has been distinctly raised and decided in an action,

in which both parties are represented, it is unjust and unreasonable to

permit the same issue to be litigated afresh between the same parties or

persons claiming under them."

The learned President's Counsel for t he Petitioner has drawn the attention of

this Court to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Wijenaike v Air Lanka

Limited and Other.28 In that case, the petitioner had been informed by his

employer that he had vacated his post. The petitioner had challenged the

term ination of his services by way of an application to the Labour Tribunal

under Section 31B of the Industrial Disputes Act. The petitioner had also filed

an application under Article 126(1) of the Constitution. On the question of

whether the petitioner could have invoked the fundamental rights jurisdiction

' f.-I 27 9 ~ , 1 39 AC 1 at pages 19-20. "(1990) 1 Sri LR 293.

32

and whether the petitioner should have pursued the application before the

Labour Tribunal, Kulatunga, J held as follows :

"This is a question which must be decided in each case having regard to

the conditions of employment and the intention of the relevant statute. If

the remedy sought arises purely from the contract based on the consent of

parties Articles 12 (1) and 126 have no applicotion, in which event the

dispute must be resolved by an ordinary suit provided by private law, even

if the dispute involves an allegation of discrimination.

Even though it may be a government agency, Air Lanka is a company duly

incorporated under the Companies Ordinance. Our attention has not been

drawn to any provision of that Ordinance or of any other statutory

provision which govern the petitioner's contract of employment with Air

Lanka; nor have I been able to discover any such provision. I am,

therefore, of the view that the petitioner's grievance has to be resolved

by a private law remedy such as the application he has already made to

the Labour Tribunal. An inquiry by the Labour Tribunal is also beneficial

to both parties who are entitled to the rights of an ordinary suit, of

calling witnesses and of confrontation and cross-examination of

testimony at such inquiry on all the points in dispute. I am also of the

view that this would promote the due and orderly administration of

justice by Courts and Tribunals established by law. Any other view would

encourage the proliferation of applications before the Supreme Court

which are not within its jurisdiction merely because the aggrieved parties

or Counsel advising them may feel that the remedy under Article 126 is

convenient or expeditious." (e' . :~ :' ~. ~ ' <; added)

l ..

Although the complaint of the 8th Respondent to the 1st Respondent was one

of transfer, this Court is of the view that the above passage would be

applicable in order to demonstrate why the 1st Respondent should not have

proceeded once the order of the Labour Tribunal had been delivered.

This Court therefore takes the view that the 1st Respondent could not have

proceeded with the inquiry arising from the complaint 'P3' after it was brought

to its attention that t he Labour Tribunal has determined the identical issue.

This Court therefore upholds the final argument of the learned President's

Counsel for the Petitioner and takes the view that t he recommendation of the

1st Respondent marked 'G' is liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari, on

this ground too.

In t he above circu mstances, this Court proceeds to issue the Writ of Certiorari

prayed for in paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition. This Court does not

make any order with regard to costs.
