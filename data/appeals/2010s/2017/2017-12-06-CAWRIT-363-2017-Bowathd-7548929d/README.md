This is an application for a mandate in the nature of writs of

mandamus and prohibition. The petitioner states that her father was the

original permit holder of the residential premises under the Land

Development Ordinance (LDO). On his demise, the Petitioner had made a

request to the Block Office of System H of the Mahaweli Authority to be

qualified as the successor to the said premises. She further states that she

learnt that the 1 st to 4th Respondents are taking steps to issue the permit to

one Dharmadasage Dharmasiri Rajapakse, who is not named as a party to

this application. The Petitioner is moving this Court to issue a writ of

mandamus compelling the Respondents to issue a "Deed of Ownership" in

respect of the land in question to the Petitioner.

Under the section 48A of the LDO, the spouse of the permit holder,

whether helshe is nominated as the successor or not, is entitle to obtain the

3

permit in hislher name at the demise of the original permit holder. If the

spouse is the nominated successor, he/she become entitle to make a

nomination too. In the present case the Petitioner pleads in the paragraph 6

of the petition that that her siblings settled in different areas and she

continued to occupy the premises with her mother and brother which means

that the spouse of the permit holder is among living. As per section 72 of the

LDO the children of the deceased permit holder become entitle to be issued

with the permit only after the death of the spouse.

As per the scheme of succession under Rule 1 of the Third Schedule

of the LDO, the holding devolves only on one person and the elder is

preferred to the younger and the sons preferred over the daughters. The

Petitioner admits that she is living in this premises with her brother. Further

she admits that her father had more children other that the Petitioner and her

brother by stating in the paragraph 6 of the petition that her siblings are

settled in different areas. She has failed or neglected to disclose the details

of her siblings for the Court to come to a conclusion on her entitlement for

successIOn.

Under these circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner has failed to

establish her entitlement to be qualified as the successor to her late father,

the original permit holder. Accordingly, I dismiss the application without

issuing notice.

Shiran Gooneratne J.

I agree.
