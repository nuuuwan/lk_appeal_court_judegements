the said Act. The Petitioner Company is seeking an interim order restraining

the Respondent from taking steps as per the said order published.

The Petitioner is the lessee of the land called Millawa Estate which

was originally belonged to the Land Reform Commission and later vested in

the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation. The Petitioner's grievance is

that the portion of land that had been acquired was a high yielding rubber

plantation therefore the Petitioner will lose enormous amount of which

could have earned for the next 25 years.

The Petitioner in the petition explains the amount of money that that

they expect to earn in the next 25 years. In my view, this is a matter for

calculating the compensation, not a matter to prevent the acquisition. In

paragraph 36 of the petition the Petitioner aver that the acquisition is

illegal, unreasonable, and ultra vires and gives the reasons. Most of these

reasons are in relation to the monetary and property loss that the Petitioner

will suffer. Further the suitability of the land for the proposed public

purpose. The purpose of acquiring the land is to establish a industrial zone.

The petitioner's argument is that the land consists of sloping land and it is

not suitable for the purpose. It is a matter for the designers of the project to

decide and the Court has no expertise to decide on this matter. Further the

Petitioner had not submitted any technical evaluation about the proposed

project and the unsuitability of the land. Another reason submitted by the

Petitioner is that there are lands belonging to other persons that can be

acquired without acquiring the Petitioner's land. This is not a tenable

argument.

The Petitioner states that certain land were acquired by the state prior

to this acquisition but the lands were not utilized. Further it is pleaded that

there is no urgency to acquire the land. But in the same breath, the Petitioner

admit in paragraph 41 that the 1 st Respondent is making all preparations to

commence the work for an Industrial Zone upon the land that was acquired

explaining the urgency and that the land is going to be utilized for the

purpose that it was acquired.

The Petitioner further states that, in the indenture of lease, the lessor

had agreed to give the peaceful possession to the Petitioner for the period of

lease. Any contractual obligation in between the lessor and the lessee will

not prevent the State from acquiring a land for a public purpose. It is a

matter to be considered in paying compensation.

The Petitioner submit that he was not given a hearing prior to making

the acquisition order and it is a breach of natural justice. Under the proviso

to the section 38(a) of the Land Acquisition Act the Minister is empowered

to make an acquisition order on the urgency of acquiring the land. The

Petitioner alleges that the decision to acquire is mala fidei. Other than that

the land acquired is a high yielding plantation the Petitioner had not

submitted any evidence to establish the malice. Acquiring certain other

portions of the same estate prior to this acquisition does not establish

malice.

The learned SC submitted that the possession of the acquired land had

already obtained by the State.

Under these circumstances I do not see any reason to issue notice.

I refuse notice and dismiss the application.
