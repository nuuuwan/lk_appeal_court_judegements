ARGUED ON : 05th September, 2016

DECIDED ON : 19th July, 2017

Oeepali Wijesundera J.

The petitioner has filed this application seeking a mandate in the

nature of a writ of certiorari to quash the decisions against the petitioner

contained in Pi and P2.

The petitioner was a Captain in the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer

Force who was on active service attached to the Gajaba Regiment. The

petitioner was absent without leave and was subjected to a summary trial

and punished after surrendering to the Army during a general amnesty.

The petitioner's learned counsel stated that since he surrendered during

a period of general amnesty his absence was converted to compulsory

leave without pay and the punishment was revoked by P4, P5 and P6.

2

By letter dated 14/08/2010 marked P1 it has been recommended that the

petitioner be prematurely retired and by P2 dated 01/09/2010 petitioners'

commission has been withdrawn.

The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the decision to

prematurely retire the petitioner was on the ground of being absent

without leave for more than 21 days, which pursuant to P4 is no longer

considered as being AWOL, as it has been converted to compulsory

leave without pay. The petitioner's learned counsel further submitted that

P1 and P2 are issued based on 1 R3 and 1 R4 which decisions have been

made pursuant to section 33 (2) (a) and (b) of the Sri Lanka Anny

Voluntary Force Regulations which only applies to officers seeking to

resign or retire. He stated that the petitioner never sought to resign or

retire. Citing the judgment in Re Mark Antony Lyster Bracegirdle (1937)

39 NLR 193 and Bandaranaike vs Weeraratne (1978-79) 2 SLR 412

the petitioner stated that when a wrong provision of the regulations have

been utilized to make a decision such decision is a nullity.

The learned counsel for the petitioner further argued that

what is being challenged is not His Excellency the President's approval

to demobilize but the recommendations to prematurely retire the

petitioner and to withdraw his commission by P1 and P2. Citing the

3

judgment in Flying Officer R.H.M.A.K.B. Ratnayake vs Air Marshal

Donald Perera CA (Writ) 104/2005 CA Minutes 28/02/2007 the

petitioner stated that it was held in this case that the decision of the

commander was ultra vires and a writ of certiorari was granted quashing

the recommendations.

The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that it was the

punishment that has been revoked during the amnesty period as stated

in P4 and that the fact, the petitioner has been absent for over 21 days

still remained valid. The respondents stated that the revocation of

punishment does not prevent them from taking any policy decisions

regarding those who have been AWOL for over 21 days, and that the

policy decision has been taken in accordance with the Regulation 4 and

5 (2) (b) of the Sri Lanka Army (Volunteer Force and Volunteer Reserve)

Regulations of 1985. They further referred to section 79 (1) of the Army

Act.

The respondents referring to section 10 of the Army Act and stated

that the officers such as the petitioner held office at the pleasure of the

President and that it was open to the President to terminate the services

of the petitioner.

4

The learned counsel for the respondents referring to regulations 33

(2) (a) and (b) as mentioned by the petitioner stated that these were

mentioned only to state that they have been carried out to fulfill

requirements and formalities since they refer to payments.

Regulation 4 of the Sri Lanka Army (Volunteer Force and Volunteer

Reserve) Regulations 1985 states; "the Commander of the Army shall be

responsible to the minister on all matters pertaining to training,

discipline and administration of the Volunteer Force':

Regulation 5 (2) (b) thereof states that the "Commandant of the Sri

Lanka Army Volunteer Force shall be responsible to the Commander of

the Army for the maintenance of discipline and the administration of the

Volunteer Force in accordance with the Army Headquarters policy set

out in the Army orders and instructions issued from time to time by the

Commander of the Army".

Section 79 (1) of the Army Act states that "such of the provisions of

Article 140 of the Constitution as relate to the grant and issue of writs of

mandamus, certiorari and prohibition shall be deemed to apply in respect

5

of any court martial or of any military authority exercising judicial

functions".

It is clear that if any military authority is not exercising judicial

functions but only exercising administrative and policy decision, writ

jurisdiction will not apply.

Since the petitioner has been sent on retirement by the President

it will be futile to issue a writ of certiorari to quash P1 and P2.

Section 10 of the Army Act no. 17 of 1948 states thus;

"Every officer shall hold his appointment during the

President's pleasure".

In the case of Air Vice Marshall Elmo Perera vs Liyanage 2003

SLR 331 it was held;

" .... .it was open to the President to terminate the services of

the petitioner on the basis that the petitioner holds office at

the pleasure of the President. "

6

For the afore stated reasons I decide that there is no merit in the

petitioner's application. I dismiss the petitioner's application without

costs.

Application dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

L.U. Jayasuriya J.

I agree.
