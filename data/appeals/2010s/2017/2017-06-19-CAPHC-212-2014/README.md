This is an appeal from the High Court of Kurunegala.

The facts are briefly as follows. The Party of the First Part

Respondents (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the

Respondents) filed information in the Magistrate Court of KUliyapitiya

under section 66( 1) (b) of the Primary Court Procedure Act, informing that

there is a land dispute threatening the breach of the peace. The Respondents

stated that the land in dispute was originally belonged to the third person of

the Party of the Second Part Petitioner Appellants, Jayathilake, who was a

deaf and dumb person. While he was living with the 1 st person of the Party

of the First Part Petitioner Appellant Kusumawathi, she has got two

fraudulent deeds executed to transfer the land to her. Thereafter he was ill

treated by the said Kusumawathi and Jayathilake had to come and live with

the Respondents. Thereafter, partition action No. 106071P was instituted in

the District Court of Kuliyapitiya and the Court has declared the said two

transfer deeds are null and void. After the said judgment of the District

Court in the said partition action, the land was transferred to Respondents by

the deed No. 10317. The Respondents state that they have possessed the

land until they were disposed by the Party of the Second Part Petitioner

Appellants (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the Appellants)

in the early hours of 02.06.2012.

The Appellants stated that the land was in the possession of the said

Jayathilake. He was living with the Respondents but he had to come to the

Appellants due to the ill treatment of the Respondents and they have

repaired the boutique room in the land and allowed the said Jayathilake to

live there.

Both parties have tendered documents in support of their cases. After

inquiry the learned Magistrate determined that the land was in the

possession of the Respondents and they were disposed within two months

prior to the filing of the information and ordered to place them in

posseSSIOn.

Being aggrieved by the order of the learned Magistrate, the

Appellants moved in revision in the Provincial High Court of Kurunegala

without success. This appeal is from the said order.

The learned High Court Judge in the revision application has

correctly held that it being a revision application, the Court has to consider

whether the learned Judge of the Primary Court (the Magistrate) has

followed the correct legal procedure, allowed all parties to present their

cases, considered all the evidence and followed the rules of natural justice in

coming to determination. He considered the order of the learned Magistrate

and has come to the conclusion that the determination was made after

considering the material available.

The revision is a discretionary remedy. It can be invoked where there

is a miscarriage of justice; it cannot be invoked to correct the errors of the

judgment.

(1) Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of

justice has occurred due to a fundamental rule of procedure being

violated, but only when a strong case is made out amounting to a

positive miscarriage of justice.

Attorney-General, V Podisingho 51 NLR 385

In my view such exceptional circumstances would be (a) where there

has been a miscarriage of justice, (b) where a strong case for the

interference of this Court has been made out by the petitioner, or (c)

where the applicant was unaware of the order made by the Court of

trial. These grounds are, of course, not intended to be exhaustive.

The learned High Court Judge has correctly considered the order of

the learned Magistrate. The Magistrate has believed the Respondent's

version of the dispute on good reasons. The trial judge has the authority to

believe or disbelieve a witness on good reasons. He has considered the

statements made to the police at the very first instance and the other

available materials and has come to the finding that the Respondents were in

possession and were dispossessed two months immediately preceding to the

filing of the information. Findings based on evidence should not be

disturbed in a revision application unless a miscarriage of justice has taken

place due to the judge's wrongful appreciation the facts. In the instant case I

do not see any wrongful appreciation of facts.

I do not see any reason to interfere with the findings of the learned

High Court Judge.

Accordingly the appeal IS dismissed subject to costs fixed at Rs.

10,000.00

(This judgment should apply to the case no. CAlPHC/APNIl47/2015 with necessary alterations in the caption.)
