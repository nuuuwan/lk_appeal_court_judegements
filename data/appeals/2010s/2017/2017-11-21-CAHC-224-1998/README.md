land after ejecting the Defendants and all those who hold under them,

4

e) For a declaration that in the event of the Court holding that the said land had

vested in the State that the Plaintiff is entitled to compensation for the said

land.

The Defendant - Respondents ((hereinafter referred to as the Defendants) filed

amended Answer dated 21.02.1990 and prayed for inter alia a dismissal of the

action since the procedure stipulated in the Land Acquisition Act were followed in

acquiring the property and therefore that the corpus vests with the State.

Trial commenced on 12.1 0.1993 and 3 admissions were recorded by the parties;

a) That the land to be acquired is 'Minuwankumbura' in extent A9 R3 P35 as

depicted in Plan bearing No. 5442 dated 13.08.1981,

b) The Jurisdiction, and

c) Compliance with Section 461 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Issue Nos. 1 - 9, 19 & 20 were raised by the Plaintiff and issue Nos. 10- 18 were

raised on behalf of the Defendants.

R. A. Saliya Wikramasinghe licenced surveyor and one V. Sahabandu Almeida

gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff and documents marked PI - P 15 were

tendered as evidence. On behalf of the Defendants an officer of the

Pradeshiyasabawa one H. W. Ariyaratha gave evidence and tendered documents

marked as VI - V 14 as evidence and closed the case.

The learned District Judge pronounced the impugned judgment dated 27.02.1998

in favour of the Defendants and dismissed the Plaintiffs action. Being aggrieved

5

by the said judgment the Plaintiff preferred the instant Appeal by Petition dated

23.04.1998.

The case for the Plaintiff in brief is that by virtue of extraordinary gazette bearing

No. 193/17 dated 21.05.1982 marked as Pll and V3 notice was given under

Section 7 of the Land Acquisition Act to acquire 20 Lots of Land as depicted in

Plan bearing No. 5442 dated 13.08.1981. Lot 16 referred to in the both

extraordinary gazette bearing No. 193/17 dated 21.05.1982 and Plan bearing No.

5442 dated 13.08.1981 IS In extent A9 R3 P35 and was named

'Minuwankumbura'. The case for the Plaintiff is the land more fully described in

the 2nd schedule to the Plaint was wrongfully included as a part of the said Lot 16.

The Plaintiff relies on Plan bearing No. 164 prepared by Saliya Wikramasinghe

licenced surveyor which depicts the corpus as Lot 2. The said Plan No. 164 has

been prepared by superimposing Plan No. 1158 prepared by licensed surveyor C.

C. Wickramasinghe which depicts the corpus as Lot 1.

The Defendants do not accept the said Plan No. 164 as the said surveyor Saliya

Wikramasinghe testified on behalf of the Plaintiff that the Plan was prepared only

through a superimposition and that the he did not physically survey the land. The

learned Counsel for the Defendants further contend that the said Plan No. 164

contains a reference to the corpus as 'Dangaha Kumbura' solely based on the

information contained in Plan No. 1158 and on what was told to the Surveyor by

the Appellant. The surveyor had further admitted that he had not make any other

inquires as to the name of the land in question.

Further the Defendant contends that as per the schedule to Plan bearing No. 5442

dated 13.08.1981 marked as V2, 'Dangaha Kumbura' is not a part of Lot 16 as

claimed by the Plaintiff but is a part of Lot Nos. 01, 03 and 06 in Plan No. 5442.

Lot 16 is described as 'Minuwankumbura' in the said schedule. The learned

Counsel for the Defendants submits that as per Section 4 of the Survey Act No. 17

of 2002 "The decision of the Surveyor-General as to any question relating to land

surveying or mapping shall be final and conclusive."

It is the position of the Defendants that the procedure contained in the Land

Acquisition Act was followed as evidenced by documents marked as VII, VI2,

V03, V04, V05, V06 and V07, V08, V09 and VIO. On a perusal of the said

documents this Court is satisfied that the correct procedure was followed in the

acquisition process. The Defendants further submit that a declaration made under

Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act cannot be questioned by a Court of Law and

relies on the recent case of D. S. 1. Peiris and another Vs. Kaluthara Bodhi Trust

and others CA/Writ/845/2007.

The Plaintiffs father, V. Sahabandu Almeida, who gave evidence on her behalf,

has stated that he only came to know of the acquisition in 1985 and that he was not

aware of the survey nor was he aware of the publication in the newspapers

regarding the acquisition and further that he was not aware of the Section 7 notice.

The learned Counsel for the Defendant submits that the Plaintiff ought to have

known of the acquisition of the corpus, since the said Gazette notifications marked

as VII, VI2 and V3 also refer to a land called 'Dangaha Kumbura' or at least a

part of it in reference to different Lots and not Lot 16, and therefore the Plaintiff

could have taken steps according to law. The Defendant contends that there were

numerous occasions on which the Plaintiff ought to have come to know of the

acquisition as the land was surveyed on several instances, notices under Section 7,

1 I I I [ t I I i I f ! t I I ! i , I ,

7

proviso 'a' to Section 38 and a declaration under Section 5 were published in the

Gazette Notifications and further that V13 is an order made to official

advertisements in the Newspapers.

This Court agrees with this contention. The documents produced by the

Defendants establish that the procedure as stipulated in the Land Acquisition Act

were followed and due notice was given for all concerned parties to take steps

according to law. The Plaintiff could have participated in an inquiry under Section

09 for compensation. This Court cannot hold with the position taken by the

Plaintiff that he was unaware of the acquisition of lands by the State.

When one exammes Plan bearing No. 5442 dated 13.08.1981 together with

extraordinary gazette bearing No. 193117 dated 21.05.1982 marked as P 11 and V3

by which notice was given under Section 7 of the Land Acquisition Act it is clear

that lands surrounding the corpus were all acquired by the state. This acquisition

was made with due notice and the stipulated engagement with the relevant

stakeholders. The Law Acquisition Act provides for mechanisms to award

compensation after an inquiry is made into claims. If the Plaintiff was not vigilant

and did not take steps when he was required to do so he cannot at this stage claim

that he has been prejudiced by such acquisition. To allow such a claim would be to

open the flood gates as there would be no end to the claims of this nature that are

preferred after the statutory mechanism of acquisition has been exhausted. The said

mechanism is designed to make the acquisition a public one and as such is not one

which is done in secret. The magnitude of the acquisition and the location of

properties further strengths the contention of the Defendants that the Plaintiff ought

to have known of the acquisition. The latin maxim "Vigilantibus Et Non

f I i I ! J i t I

1 ,

8

Dormientibus Jura Subveniunt" which means 'the law assists those that are vigilant

with their rights, and not those that sleep thereupon' deserves mention.

For the reasons more fully described above this Court sees no reason for this

Appeal to be allowed and therefore this Appeal is dismissed without costs.

Appeal Dismissed.
