JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena l

The Petitioner- Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 3rd

Respondent) had filed an application in the Provincial High Court holden at

Rathnapura praying for a writ of certiorari to compel the 1st and 2nd

Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st

Respondent and 2nd Respondent respectively) to revoke the permit and or

Jayabhumi deed No. 44535 issued to the 3rd Petitioner Respondent. This is

so stated in prayer c of the prayers in the application made to the

Provincial High Court.

4

Perusal of the averments in the said application shows clearly that the

expectation of the 3rd Respondent from the said proceedings before the

Provincial High Court had been to get a permit and or Jayabhumi deed

issued to the 3rd Respondent Appellant in terms of the provisions of the

Land Development Ordinance revoked. Thus this application is clearly with

regard to something pertaining to alienation of state lands.

At the commencement of the argument of this case, learned Senior State

Counsel submitted that this case is not maintainable in view of the

judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of The Superiritendant.

Stafford Estate and two others Vs. Solaimuthu Rasu1

The Supreme Court in that judgment had clearly held that the jurisdiction

conferred on the Provincial High Courts under Article 154 P 4(b) does not

extend to matters in respect of powers relating to recovery/dispossession

encroachment or alienation of State lands since they are not found in the

Provincial Council List (List 1) to the 9th Shedule to the 13th amendment to

the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

1 2013 (1) Sri. L. R. 25.

Article 154 (P) 4(b) of the Constitution states that a Provincial High Court

shall have jurisdiction to issue, according to law:

Orders in the nature of writs of Certiorari, Prohibition, Procedendo,

Mandamus and quo Warranto against any persons exercising within the

province, any power under:

I. Any law; or

II. Any statute made by the Provincial Council established for that

province; in respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council

List.

Perusal of the learned Provincial High Court Judge's Judgment shows that

he has failed to consider the preliminary objection to the jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court raised on the above basis on behalf of the 1st and 2nd

Respondents.

It is now settled law that the Provincial High Court does not possess

jurisdiction to issue under Article 154 P 4(b) writs of this nature in respect

of matters relating to alienation of state lands since such a subject is not

found in the Provincial Council List (List 1) to the 9th Shedule to the 13th

amendment to the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

6

Lanka. Hence it is clear that the judgment pronounced by the Provincial

High Court in this case has been done without any jurisdiction in that

regard.

Therefore the judgment dated 2007-05-10 entered into by the learned

Provincial High Court Judge is hereby set aside. The application made to

the Provincial High Court must stand refused and dismissed. No Cost is

ordered.

Appeal is allowed.
