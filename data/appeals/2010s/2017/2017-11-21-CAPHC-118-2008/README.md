JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Learned counsel for all the Parties when this case came up on 2017-07-25

before us, agreed to have this case disposed of, by way of written

submissions they had already filed. They agreed that this Court could

pronounce the judgment after considering the contents of the said written

submissions they had already filed.

The Competent Authority Applicant - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Appellant) had issued a quit notice on the

Respondent - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the Respondent), in terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act).

As the Respondent had failed to quit, the Appellant had made an

application under section 5 of the Act to the Magistrate's Court of Hatton

4

seeking an order to eject the Respondent from the land described in the

schedule mentioned in the said application.

Learned Magistrate, after an inquiry, had pronounced the order dated

2005-03-21 refusing the said application.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, the Appellant

had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court holden in

Nuwara Eliya.

The Provincial High Court after the conclusion of the argument had

pronounced its judgment dated 2008 -09-11, refusing to revise the said

order and proceeding to dismiss the said revision application.

Both the learned Magistrate and the High Court Judge had considered in

their judgments, the submission made on behalf of the Respondent

regarding the existence of an order of Court in the case No. 81729, which

had been previously filed.

It is to be noted that the said Magistrate's Court case No. 81729 had been

filed under the Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act.

Learned Magistrate in that case had issued an order to evict the

Respondent from the quarters relevant to that case.

The corresponding revision application filed in the Provincial High Court

with regard to the casel under Government Quarters (Recovery of

Possession) Act is the case No. HC 73/2000 (Rev). Learned Provincial High

Court Judge in that case had set aside the learned Magistrate's order to

evict the Respondent from the said quarters on the basis that the lessee of

the Estate, Watawala Plantations Company had no authority to issue a quit

notice.

The application to the Magistrate's Court in the instant case has been made

by the Competent Authority of the Ministry of Plantation Industries.

The question whether it is lawful for such competent authority to issue a

quit notice in this kind of a situation2 has been considered by this Court in

the following cases;

i. N Chandrabose V Sunil Chandra Kumara De Alwis and two others,[C

A (Writ) Application No. 920/2000 decided on 2003-05-12]3, .. . ii. Manikkam Muthuvelu V Beynanda Dias and Bogawanthalawa

esc Spl LA No. 171/2004 decided on 2004-11-24) filed against this

judgment.s

The view expressed by this Court in the above cases is that it is lawful for

such a competent authority to initiate recovery proceedings to obtain the

possession of state lands under the provisions of State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act. Therefore, the application filed by the Appellant in the

Magistrate's Court in the instant case is lawful.

Section 9 of the Act which has specified the scope of the inquiry states that

the person on whom summons under section 6 has been served shall not

be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the application under

section 5 except that such person may establish that he is in possession or

occupation of the said premises upon a valid permit or other written

authority of the state granted in accordance with any written law and that

such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered

invalid. The Appellant had failed to prove the reqUirements of the above

section.

This Court in the case of Muhandiram V Chairman, Janatha Estate

Development Board6 had held that in an inquiry under State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act, the onus is on the person summoned to

establish the basis of his possession or occupation.

The only basis such person could be permitted to possess or occupy such

land would be upon a valid permit or other written authority of the state

granted in accordance with any written law and that such permit or

authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid?

This Court had further held in that case8 that if the above burden is not

discharged, the only option available for the Magistrate is to make an order

of eviction.

The Supreme Court in the case of L H M B B Herath, Chief Manager

Welfare and Industrial Relations, Sri Lanka Ports Authority V Morgan

Engineering (Pvt) Ltd.9 also had held that the above is the limited scope of

the inquiry, which should be conducted by the Magistrate under section 9

of the Act.

Next question this Court should consider is whether there is any legal bar

for such an application to be entertained by Court in view of the presence

of a previous order made by Court in a case filed under the provisions of

Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act.

As a precursor to the consideration of the above question, it would be

desirable for this Court to proceed to ascertain first whether indeed there is

a valid order of Court, which has previously adjudicated the very impugned

issue before it.

It is clear that no proceedings under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act had been instituted by the relevant Competent Authority

previously. Therefore, the issue whether the Respondent is in possession

or occupation of the said premises upon a valid permit or other written

authority of the state granted in accordance with any written law and that

such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered

invalid10 remains an issue which has not been adjudicated by any Court up

until now.

Further, this is not an issue that could or should 'be decided by Court in

proceedings instituted under the provisions of Government Quarters

(Recovery of Possession) Act. In any case, section 17 of the Act states that

the provisions of the Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything

contained in any other written law. This was recognized by this Court in the

case of Manikkam Muthuvelu V Beynanda Dias and Bogawanthalawa

Plantations Ltd. l1 also. As has been mentioned before this court has to re-

iterate that the Supreme Court had refused leave to appeal application filed

against this judgment12

On the other hand, a person who occupies a state land may have a valid

permit or other written authority of the state at a given time but he may

cease to have such authority later on. It can therefore be seen that the

question whether a person who occupies a state land has a valid permit or

other written authority of the state, is a question which varies with the

passage of time. The answer to that question would depend on the time of

its verification. This is perhaps why the legislature in its wisdom has

included in section 9 of the Act, the phrase" ... and that such permit or

authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid ... " 13.

This means that in any case, any adjudication whether one possesses or . .'

occupies >'such land upon a valid permit or other written authority of the

state granted in accordance with any written law and that such permit or

11 Supra.

12 Supra.

13 Section 9 of the Act

10

authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid'14

cannot operate as res judicata for an indefinite period. This is because it is

impossible for such a position to remain static.

Thus, the existence of previous orders both by the Magistrate's Court and

the High Court in a case filed under the provisions of Government Quarters

(Recovery of Possession) Act cannot operate as res judicata against the

institution and proceedings of the instant case as the issue to be decided in

the instant case is quite different. Therefore, there is no merit in the

submission made on behalf of the Respondent regarding the application of

the principle of res judicata to these proceedings.

The Respondent has failed to establish that he is in possession or

occupation of the relevant land upon any written authority of the state

granted in accordance with any written law and that such authority is in

force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid as required by section

9 of the Act.

This Court therefore decides to allow this appeal. The order of learned

Magistrate dated 2005-03-21 as well as the judgment of the Provincial High

Court dated 2008-09-11 are hereby set aside. This court directs that the

order applied for by the Appellant to evict the Respondent from the

relevant land be issued forthwith.

Respondent is directed to pay a state cost of Rs. 50,000/=

Learned Ma"gistrate is directed to enforce this order without delay.
