The accused-appellant had filed this appeal against the said

conviction and sentence.

Accused - appellants the brother of the deceased. According

to the wife of the decease, on the day of the incident accused had

come home in the night and had asked whether Amarajeewa had

come there. They had replied Asmarajeewa had not come.

After hearing the voice of his brother, deceased who had gone

for a funeral to the front house had come home. All of them had

been out the house when the accused was talking ill of

Amarajeewa. Witness has seen the accused carrying a knife in his

waist. According to the witness there had been no fight. But the

deceased had verbally defended Amarajeewa.

At the trial no questions has been asked with regard to a fight

by the defense. Defense had not marked any contradictions or

omissions from the wife (Devika prosecution witness No.3) of the

deceased or any other witness who had given evidence in this case.

According to the wife of the deceased after the incident

accused-appellant has not allowed anybody to come to the

deceased's house to take the deceased to the hospital. This shows

the attitude of the accused-appellant.

4

Saman Kumara Ranasinghe who had come to the house

immediately after incident has taken the deceased to the hospital.

Doctor on admission had examined the deceased and pronounced

him dead. After coming back to the scene, Ranasinghe along with

other has arrested the accused-appellant and handed him over to

the police.

Police had recorded statements and visited the scene and had

made their observations.

The doctor who held the post-mortem had noted on stab

injury on the chest of the deceased. The injury had damaged the

right ventricle. Owing to this deceased has succumbed to this

injury. According to the doctor said injury, is sufficient to cause

death in the ordinary course of nature.

The accused-appellant had not denied the incident. In his

dock statement he admits that he went to his brother's house. He

further says when his brother tried to assault him he had held his

hand with the knife and then he ran away home. He doesn't admit

the fact that the injured his brother. He doesn't speak of what

happened after the incident.

The maIn contention advanced by counsel for the accused-

Appellant in this appeal was that the death in issue was caused as

a result of the accused-appellant exercising his right of private

defense. But at the trial the accused-appellant has not taken up

this defence. Therefore, in terms of Section 105 of the Evidence

Ordinance the Appellant has failed to prove the existence of such

circumstances. The learned Counsel for the appellant contended

that the learned Judge has not considered the right of private

defense and the fact that the accused didn't have any intention to

kill his brother.

After analyzing the prosecution and the defense evidence

Court held that the sole eye witness Devika (prosecution witness

No.3) is a trustworthy witness. No material contradictions or

omissions were marked at the trial.

In this regard I would like to cite following authorities.

J !

In Sunil Vs Attorney General 1999 (VoL3) S.L.R.191 "The

Court observed solitary witness can be acted upon, provided that

he is wholly reliable.

Further Madkami Baia Vs. The State (1999) C. V.L. J 433

Law of Crimes P.M. Bakshi - Volume 2 page 57". It was held

that the evidence of a solitary witness in a murder can be acted

upon only if it was clear cogent trustworthy and above reproach.

The testimony of Devika states that the accused had stabbed

deeased on his chest closer to the heart. Also the medical evidence

and the postmortem report revealed that the stabbing took place to

the heart of the deceased, causing a fatal injury to his right

ventricle. Therefore, the testimony of Devika and the medical

observation have proved the fact that the accused-appellant has

stabbed the deceased when he was moving from deceased house.

Even though the accused claimed that his injury might have

occurred while he was wagging the knife as self defence, the Court

holds after observing the pattern of injury that such injury could

not have taken place by mere wagging of a knife. According to the

1II1

i

I I

I I I I I i ! I

medical evidence the injury on the chest is deep. Just wagging a

knife can't cause such a deep injury. Further according to the

medical evidence the injury which was caused by stabbing the

chest has been identified as a deep injury, it is understood that a

mere wagging of a knife cannot be a cause such a deep injury.

Thus it is clearly evident that the stabbing has taken place

when the accused-appellant was moving away. The accused-

appellant had stabbed the decease with a knife which stuck on a

vulnerable part of deceased's body resulting his death. The Court

holds that the accused stabbed the deceased but without any

intention to kill him.

After considering the evidence of Devika, nature of the

injury and the type of the weapon. Court holds that the accused

acted without any intention of killing the deceased. When I

consider all these matters I am of the opinion that the accused-

appellant is not entitled to the benefit of right of self- defense.

Further, the Court holds that there is no sufficient

evidence to prove that the victim or the father of the victim had

caused sudden fight with the Accused-appellant. Therefore, the

f

act of the accused - appellant does not fall under the exception of

sudden fight or self-defence.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the

death of Keerthi Gunaratne had occurred due to a sudden fight.

But at the trial stage the defence has not pointed out this position.

The prosecution evidence revealed that at the time of the incident

the deceased was unarmed and did not cause any injury to the

appellant. The appellant had inflicted a fatal blow on the deceased.

The sole witness Devika ( prosecution witness No.3 ) and the

medical evidence supported this position.

The sole eye witness's evidence and the medical evidence

prove that the appellant had tabbed the unarmed deceased on the

chest.

In the case of Ahmad Sherair A.I.R. 193 ,1936 L.A.H. 513

where the deceased was unarmed and did not cause any injury to

appellant, the appellant following a sudden quarrel had inflicted

fatal blows to the deceased, it was held that exception sudden fight

did not apply .

In the case of Amaranathsingh A.I.R. 1928 0 U D 282 it was

held if two men were fighting and one of them unarmed while the

other use a deadly weapon, the one who use such a weapon must

be held to have taken an undue advantage and not entitled to the

benefit of this exception.

Other available evidence the only irresistible inference

that one can draw is that the accused appellant didn't have any

intention to kill the deceased.

Considering the fact that there was only one stab injury

on the chest of the deceased and other available evidence, further it

is observed, " A criminal trial is meant for doing justice to the

accused, victim and the society so that law and order is

maintained. Court minds that criminal trial is meant for doing

justice to the accused, victim and the society so that law and order

is maintained. In the case of State UP vs. Anil Singh, (AIR 1988 SC

1998) that it is necessary to remember that a Judge does not

preside over a criminal trial merely to see that no innocent man is

punished. A judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not

escape. One is as important as the other. Both are public duties

which the Judge has to perform. A Judge does not preside over a

criminal trial merely to see that no innocent man is punished. A

Judge also presides to see that a guilty man does not escape. One

is an important as the other. Both are public duties". (Ambika

Prasad and Another V. State (DeZhi Administration) 200 SC

(Crl.S22)

In the aforesaid circumstances, this Court hold that the trial

Judge has carefully and correctly evaluated the evidence and

decision of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder. There is no reason to interfere with the trial

judge's findings. We affirm the conviction and sentence imposed by

the learned High Court Judge.

Appeal dismissed.
