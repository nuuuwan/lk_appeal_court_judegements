JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

Learned counsel for all the Parties when this case came up on 2017-06-30

before us, agreed to have this case disposed of by way of written

submissions, dispensing with their necessity of making oral submissions.

They agreed that this Court could pronounce the judgment after

considering the written submissions they had filled. Therefore, this

judgment would be based on the material that have been adduced by

parties in their pleadings and the contents of the written submissions filed

by the parties.

The Conservator General of Forests, who has been named in this petition

as the Applicant Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Respondent) had issued a quit notice on the Respondent

- Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant), in terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act).

As the Appellant had failed to respond to the said quit notice the

Respondent had thereafter made an application under section 5 of the Act

in the Magistrate's Court of Tissamaharama seeking an order to evict the

Appellant from the relevant land.

Learned Magistrate after an inquiry had pronounced the order dated 2005-

09-30 evicting the Appellant from the said land.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Magistrate, the

Appellant had made a revision application to the Provindal High Court of

Southern Province holden at Hambantota.

The Provincial High Court after hearing parties, pronounced its judgment

dated 2008 -03-31 affirming the learned Magistrate's order and dismissed

the said revision application.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed this appeal in this

Court.

Learned counsel for the Appellant has conceded that Yala Forest is a state

land. What he has challenged is the fact whether the Appellant is in

possession of the said specified land. This means that it is the position of

the Appellant that he is not occupying the said land. In these

circumstances, this Court is unable to understand as to why the Appellant

ta,kes so much of trouble to prosecute a revision application in the

Provincial High Court and another appeal to this Court against the

impugned order because this order cannot affect him if he is not occupying

this land.

In these circumstances, it is not at all difficult for this Court to conclude

that the Appellant has failed to establish that he is in possession or

occupation of the said land upon any written authority of the State granted

in accordance with any written law and that such authority is in force and

not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid as required by section 9 of the

Act.

It is therefore the view of this Court that there is absolutely no merit in this

appeal.

Thus, this Court affirms the judgment dated 2008-03-31of the Provincial

High Court and proceed to dismiss this appeal with costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
