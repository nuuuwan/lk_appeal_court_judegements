This is a revision application from the High Court of Panadura.

2

The 2nd Accused Petitioner with two others was charged before the

High Court for committing offence of robbery on several persons

punishable under section 380 of the Penal Code. After being pleaded

guilty to all charges, the 2nd Accused Petitioner was convicted and

sentenced. The learned High Court Judge ordered 4 years RI and Rs.

5,000.00 fine on each charge and ordered the jail term to run

concurrently. In addition to the said punishment, the Accused Petitioner

was ordered to pay compensation to the victims of the crime with a

default jail term. Being aggrieved by the order of sentencing, the 2nd

Accused Petitioner moved in revision.

The 2nd Accused Petitioner's contention is that the order to pay the

compensation is excessive. He further submits that the 1 st and the 3 rd

Accused were also being pleaded guilty on previous occasions and they

were not being ordered to pay any compensation, ordering the 2nd

Accused Petitioner to pay compensation is unreasonable.

The Respondent raised two preliminary objections on the

maintainability of the application on the grounds that there is an

inordinate delay and no exceptional circumstances to exercise the

discretionary remedy of revision. !

At the hearing the 2nd Accused Petitioner restricted the revision

application to the payment of compensation part of the order.

The order of sentencing was made on 25.05.2012 by the learned

High Court Judge. The revision application is dated 22.05.2013 and was

filed in this Court on 23.05.2013. There is a delay of 11 months in filing

this revision application. The only explanation given is that he was in jail

and he could not filed the revision application. This explanation is not

acceptable since the law provides for a convicted prisoner to submit an

appeal while in the prison and if he can file this application after 11

months while serving the jail term, no explanation given why he could

not file it as soon as the order was made.

Our courts have held in several occasions that the inordinate and

unexplained delay in seeking relief itself disentitles the petitioner to it.

Revision being a discretionary remedy, the party seeking relief should act

promptly.

It has been held in the case of Seylan Bank V Thangaveil [2004] 2

Sri L R 101 at 105 that;

In this application in revision the petitioner seeks to set aside the

orders dated 7.3.2002 and 10.01.2002 made by the learned District

Judge. The petitioner has filed this application on 17.7.2003. It

appears that there is a delay of one year and four months in

respect of the order dated 7.3.2002 and a delay of seven months

from the order dated 10.01.2003. The petitioner has not explained

the delay. Unexplained and unreasonable delay in seeking relief by

way of revision, which is a discretionary remedy, is a factor which

will disentitle the petitioner to it. An application for judicial review

should be made promptly unless there are good reasons for the

delay_ The failure on the part of the petitioner to explain the delay

satisfactorily is by itself fatal to the application.

The Attorney-General V. Kunchihambu et al. 46 NLR 401

The sentence was passed in February, 1945, and this application

was made on May 25, 1945, and now it is the end of July. In view

of the delay that has occurred I do not think that I ought to exercise

the discretion vested in me by section 357 (1) of the Criminal

Procedure Code.

Mr. Curtis asks in tones of rhetorical indignation if this Court is

going to be a party to an illegal sentence remaining upon the

record of a case. It is a very disturbing question to have to answer

but the answer I would venture is that however much it may offend

one's aesthetic sense to have an illegal sentence left upon the

record, there are cases in which one must put up with that

grievance lest one inflicts a great hardship on a man who had had

every reason to think that he had been dealt with and punished for

the offence with which he had been charged and of which he had

been convicted and that his troubles were over. In matters of this

kind too interest rei publicae ut finis sit litium.

In the present case the 2nd Accused Petitioner has not pleaded

guilty at the very first opportunity but was taking time while the other

two Accused persons have pleaded guilty much before him. Therefore it

cannot be considered that the 2nd Accused Petitioner is repentant of his

crime. The crime that he has committed is also of very serious in nature.

5

The learned High Court Judge has considered that the victim in charge

no.S has the possession of the property involved in the crime and not

ordered any compensation to be paid to him/her. Compensation ordered

to be paid only to the victims in relation to the charges 1 to 4. The learned

High Court Judge has considered the attended circumstances in ordering

the compensation.

Under these circumstances, there is no reason to disregard the

inordinate delay in filing the revision application. I do not intend to

exercise the revisionary jurisdiction vested upon me under the law, which

is a discretionary jurisdiction of this Court, in 2nd Accused Petitioner's

favour.

Accordingly, I dismiss this application.
