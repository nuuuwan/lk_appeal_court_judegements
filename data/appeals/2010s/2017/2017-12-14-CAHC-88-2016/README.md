COUNSEL Janaka Gamage for the Accused-Appellant.

L. Karunanayaka, sse. for the Respondent.

DECIDED ON 13.11.2017

s. Thurairaja. PC. J.

Accused Appellant present in Court produced by the Prison Authorities.

Assigned Counsel informs Court that he has instruction from the

Accused-Appellant not to contest the conviction but the sentence. The

Accused-Appellant also confirms the stance. The Accused-Appellant was

charged under section 355 (b)(2) of the Penal Code. After the trial, he was given

20 years Rigorous Imprisonment and Rs. 5000 fine and default three month in

addition to the Rs.200,000 / - compensation to be paid to the victim in default

two years Rigorous Imprisonment.

Both counsel assisted the court with the facts of the case. It appears

that the accused and the victim are related as father and daughter. This is a

case of grave sexual abuse committed by the father on his daughter. Learned

trial Judge has considered all factors judicially, and evaluated the evidence

1

before the court and imposed 20 years Rigorous Imprisonment and fine and

compensation as mentioned above.

Counsel for the Accused-Appellant submits that the Accused is 59 years old

and he has a daughter from another marriage has a medical condition to be

supported by him. Further counsel submits that the Accused-Appellant has no

means and he is a day to day wage earner to support his family. That shows

that the Accused-Appellant can give only moral support to his child. Counsel

for the Accused- Appellant submits that the minimum sentence is reduced in

2006 to 07 years Rigorous Imprisonment. This matter was discussed in

Rathnayaka Mudiyanselage Sunil Vs. A.G. in case No 199/2009 decided on

08.03.2012. In that case the court has observed that the subsequent

amendment can be used at the time of sentence.

In this case the question is to decide whether the sentence imposed by the

learned High Court Judge was appropriate. Considering the fact the

relationship between the accused and the victim was father and daughter, the

learned Trial Judge has taken it very seriously. This Court also endorse the

same view, because in our society a girl's most trusted male person is her

father. If the father breach the trust and bond, entire society will collapse.

Specially girls will not have any male person to trust upon. This court also

mindful of the sentiment of safeguarding the relationship of father and

daughter.

The Accused-Appellant is not contesting the conviction and also appealing

to this court to re-consider or give concession to his sentence on following

grounds.

1. His age and understood his mistakes.

2. He has children and wife to look after.

Senior State Counsel informs Court that she leaves the matter to

the Court to decide the quantum of sentence. Considering all factors

specially the gravity of the offence and all mitigatory circumstances

stated by the counsel, we affirm the conviction and decided to impose the

following sentence. The 20 years Rigorous Imprisonment is reduced to 15

years Rigorous Imprisonment. Apart from that all the other conditions in

the sentence will remain as it is. Further, sentence to be operated from

the date of conviction.

The Prison Authority is hereby directed to implement the sentence

from the date of conviction namely 26.07.2016.

The Registrar is hereby directed to transmit the original case

record to the Registrar of the High Court of Hambanthota to implement

the sentence.
