L.T.B. Dehideniya J. (PICA)

This is an applicNion for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

certiorari to quash the decision of the 1 st Respondent made after an

inquiry held under section 07(10)of the Agrarian Development Act No.

46 of 2000 amended by Act No. 46 of2011. The Petitioner states that he

is the tenant cultivator of the paddy land called "Salihamy Kumbura"

where the landlady is the 3rd Respondent. The petitioner's content~on is

3

that he was suffering from chronic diabetes and therefore he cultivated

the paddy land through a hired labourer Lal and paid rent to the 3rd

Respondent where she had accepted it without any objection. Thereafter

she had complained to the 1 st Respondent that the Petitioner had sublet

the paddy land to the said Lal. The 1 st Respondent, after holding an

inquiry, decided that the paddy land was sublet to Lal without written

sanction of the 3rd Respondent and ordered to evict the Petitioner from

the paddy land. Being aggrieved by the said order the Petitioner instituted

this application for a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari to quash

the said decision.

The Petitioner does not complain about any irregularity in the

presses of the inquiry. Neither the vires of the 1st Respondent to hold

such inquiry nor any violation of the rules of natural justice in conducting

the inquiry is challenged. The Petitioner's case is that the 1 st Respondent

had come into a wrong conclusion on the evidence presented, that the

Petitioner has sublet the paddy land to Lal. The Petitioner is challenging

the decision of the 1 st Respondent on findings of facts by way of a

prerogative writ.

Wade in Administrative Law ninth edition at page 260 says that;

"Although the contrast between the questions which do and do not

go to jurisdiction was in principle clear-cut, it was softened by the

Court's unwillingness to enter upon disputed questions of fact in

proceedings for judicial review. "

At page 261 further said that;

"There had to be a 'clear excess of jurisdiction ' without the trial of

disputed facts denovo. Questions of law and questions of fact were

therefore to be distinguished, as was explained by Devlin J: .

4

Where the question of jurisdiction turns solely on a disputed

point of law, it is obviously convenient that the Court should

determine it then and there. But where the dispute turns on a

question of fact, about which there is id a conflict of

evidence, the Court will generally decline to interfere. "

In the present case in hand there is no issue on jurisdiction. The

Petitioner's case is that the 1st Respondent's finding that the paddy land

was sublet to Lal was factually incorrect.

Wade at page 262 said that;

"And Lord Reid also once said:

If a Magistrate or any other tribunal has jurisdiction to

enter on the inquiry and to decide a particular issue, and

there is no i .... regularity in the procedure, he does not destroy

his jurisdiction by reaching a wrong decision. If he has

jurisdiction to go right he has jurisdiction to go wrong.

Neither an error infact nor an error in law will destroy his

jurisdiction.

Sunil Coorey in Principles of Administrative Law In Sri Lanka 3rd

edition vo1.2 page 773 says that;

"But the resemblance ends there, for, whereas appellate

jurisdiction usually includes the power to correct errors committed

in the process of exercising power by substituting a correct order

in place of the erroneous one, by issuing a certiorari the exercise

of power could be only quashed for error of law, and it cannot be

replaced by a correct order free of error.

In the present case, as I pointed out earlier, the Petitioner is not

complaining of any error of law. He is totally resting his case on factual

f , ! III Il Ir

5

matters. It is very clear when the grounds for the application described in

the paragraph 21 of the Petition is considered. His argument is that he is

the tenant cultivator and the finding that the paddy land was sublet is

wrong. This is a factual matter that has to be decided on evidence. This

Court do not inclined to enter in to a disputed fact in an application for a

prerogative writ.

I refuse notice and dismiss the application.

I agree.
