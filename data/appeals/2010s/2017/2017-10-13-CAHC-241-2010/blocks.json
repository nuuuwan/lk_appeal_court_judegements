Eventually, these people have crossed the boundaries and entered the land where the house was situated. At that point the witness, her husband, the sister of the witness and the deceased requested them not to quarrel in their premises. At the same time a pet dog had come barking towards the accused and one of the accused had hit the dog with a club which resulted the death of the dog. There after the intruders left the place. The husband of Suseema Gilbert De Silva has taken the carcass to the Police Station to make a complain regarding this. At the mean time all the accused have returned to the said premises and they have entered the house from the rear side of the house and dragged the deceased out of the house to the well and stabbed him' LO death.(The inj uries corroborate with the med:..:al evidence)",
