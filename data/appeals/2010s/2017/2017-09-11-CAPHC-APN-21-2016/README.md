JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The Complainant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the 1st Respondent) had filed an information in the Primary

Court of Kaduwela under section 66 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act, complaining to the learned Primary Court Judge about an existence of

breach of peace between two parties. The said two parties are 1st party-

Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the

Petitioner) and the 2nd Party- Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes called and referred to as the 2nd Respondent).

5

The said report was filed by the Officer in Charge of Thalangama Police

Station on 2015-08-07.

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into this complaint, had by

his order dated 2016-01-26, and ordered that the 2nd Respondent is

entitled to the possession of the house in dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Primary Court

Judge, the Petitioner had filed an application for revision in the Provincial

High Court of Western Province holden at Colombo seeking a revision of

the order made by the learned Primary Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court after hearing the learned President's Counsel

who appeared for the Petitioner, by its order dated 2016-02-02 had

refused to issue notices on the Respondents and proceeded to dismiss the

said revision application affirming the order of the the learned Primary

Court Judge.

The Petitioner has chosen to canvass the said order of the learned High

Court Judge as well as the order of the learned Primary Court Judge in this

revision application before this Court.

Petitioner who is a daughter of the 2nd Respondent claims that she had

purchased this property from the 2nd Respondent on deed of transfer No.

8648 attested by K Jegadeesan notary Public on 2006-07-25.

The fact that the 2nd Respondent had purchased this property on deed No.

8340 attested by K Jegadeesan Notary Public on 2005-09-14 is not

disputed by the Petitioner. 1

On 2015-08-02, the 2nd Respondent making a statement to Thalangama

Police Station had complained that the Petitioner who had come with

another male person threatened her to vacate the house. On 2015-08-04

the 2nd Respondent making another statement had also complained to

Police that the Petitioner had assaulted her and dragged her out of the

house on that date (i.e. on 2015-08-04).

The 2nd Respondent on 2015-08-08, making yet another statement to

police had requested the assistance of Police to take her personal

belongings and the medicines which she had been regularly using from the

house as by that time she had been suddenly ousted from the house.

1 The Petitioner claims that she has purchased this property from the 2nd Respondent subsequently.

The Grama Niladhari of the area by the document marked P 25 (2 E) 22)

has certified that it is the 2nd Respondent who had lived in this address for

about 11 years. The said report had been issued on 2015-08-06.

The Electoral Register marked 2 E) 25 establishes that there are two

occupants in this house as at the year 2014. The said occupants are named

as Hewa Pathiranage Chandrani Perera (2nd Respondent) and Hewa

Pathiranage Chaminda Perera (nephew of the Respondent). The said

Chaminda Perera had been an intervenient party in these proceedings

before the Primary Court and has been named in this application as the

Intervenient Party of the 2nd Party Respondent Respondent. It transpired

during the submissions of learned counsel for the parties during the

argument that the said Chaminda Perera is now deceased.

The bank Statements such as 2 E) 27, invoices sent by Dialog Television

(Pvt) Ltd such as 2 E) 28 have all been sent to the address of this house in

the name of the 2nd Respondent. These facts establish that the 2nd

Respondent had been occupying this house.

Although the Petitioner too had produced some documents such as P 11,

P 13 A, P 13 B, P 13 C and several affidavits of several persons, fact

remains that the Petitioner has admitted in her affidavit filed before the

Primary Court;

1. that she resides at No. 79/2, Horton Place Colombo 07,

2. that the 2nd Respondent being her mother temporarily lived there as

her licensee,

3. that she had removed some of the 2nd Respondent's clothes and

essential items from this house in April 2015 for preparing this house

for sale to another person,

Further, the Petitioner in the statement made to Police on 2015-08-032,

has admitted that the 2nd Respondent along with her nephew Chaminda

Perera looked after this house.

This Court is of the view that the cumulative effect of all the material

adduced before the Primary Court is that it is none other than the 2nd

Respondent who had been in possession of the impugned property and has

been forcibly dispossessed within a period of two months immediately

2 Produced marked at the Primary Court as 1 C) 24.

before the date on which the information was filed by Police in Court under

section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 as

amended.

Thus learned Primary Court Judge has correctly determined that the 2nd

Respondent is entitled to the possession of this house.

It must also be noted that the 2nd Respondent has denied having sold this

house to the Petitioner. She is reported to have complained to the Fraud

bureau about an alleged forged deed being made for the said transfer.

It was also revealed before this court in the course of the argument that

there is a case filed in the District Court with regard to the same dispute.

Hence the rights of the parties could finally be decided as has been

provided for in section 68 (2) and section 74 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 as amended.

In these circumstances this Court is of the view that the learned High Court

Judge was correct when she decided not to issue notices on the

Respondents as one cannot reasonably find a basis to make a decision to

Iissue notices on the Respondents in this case.

This Court sees no merit in this application.

f 10

Thus, this Court decides to refuse this application and proceed to dismiss

the same. The order dated 2016-01-26 made by the learned Primary Court

Judge as well as the order dated 2016-02-02 made by the learned High

Court Judge are hereby affirmed.

The Petitioner is directed to pay to the 2nd Respondent a sum of Rs.

75,000/= as costs of this application.

Application is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 75,000/=.
