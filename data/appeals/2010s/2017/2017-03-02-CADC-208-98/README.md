L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an appeal from the District Court of Kaluthara.

The Plaintiff Respondent instituted this action to partition the land

called Kongahawatta alias Mattan Thottam. The Plaintiff Respondent

presented the pedigree and the list of shares and moved Court to partition

the land. The preliminary survey was done and the plan and report

(marked as Xl and X2) submitted to Court depicting the land as lots A,

B, C, D. The parties admitted that lot D is a road and agreed to exclude it

from the corpus.

The 3 rd Defendant Respondent and the 5th defendant appellant (4 to

14 defendants as a group) claimed that lot A of plan Xl is a separate land

and moved to exclude it from the corpus. Further they submitted different

pedigrees and claimed deferent shares.

Half of the house marked as No.3 in the plan Xl was claimed by

the 3 rd Defendant Appellant on the basis that it was constructed by the

predecessor, the father of the 3rd Defendant Respondent and the

grandfather of the 4 to 14 Defendant Appellants. The 3rd defendant Suhai

and the father of the 4 to 14 defendants Musheen were brothers and their

father was Mahallam Usubu Suleiman Lebbe. The 3rd defendant's

contention is that the house was constructed by the said Mahallam Usubu

Suleiman Lebbe. The 4 to 14 defendants submit that it was build by their

father Musheen and they claimed the entire house for them.

The learned District Judge after trial decided to partition the land as

per the list of shares pronounced in the judgment and held that the house

No 3 shall be divided in equal shares among 3rd Defendant and 4 to 14

Defendants as a group. Being aggrieved by the said judgment the 5th

Defendant appealed against.

At the argument the appellant restricted the appeal to the issue of

the ownership of the house. Therefore it is not necessary to consider the

points raised on the pedigree and the corpus in the petition of appeal.

The 5th Defendant Appellant's argument is that the 3rd Defendant

Respondent's father has not claimed the house No.3 at the preliminary

survey because he knew that it was constructed by the father of the 4 to

14 Defendants. He argues that it is only the 3rd Defendant Respondent's

word against the 5th Defendant Appellant and therefore the survey report

is crucial evidence relating to the house. The 3rd Defendant Respondent's

argument is that by deed No. 11682 marked 3Dl the land including the

house was transferred by Mahallam Usubu Suleiman Lebbe to his

children, the 3 rd Defendant, Musin the father of the 4th to 14th Defendants

and one J ameel who died issueless. His contention is that this deed proves

that the house was in existences even before transferring the land to the

father of the 3rd and 5th Defendants. Since Jameel died issueless, the other

two children became entitle in equal shares.

The 3A Defendant while giving evidence stated that he is claiming

Yz of the house marked No.3 on the basis that it was constructed by

Mahallam Usubu Suleiman Lebbe. He admitted that his father, the

deceased 3 rd Defendant, was present at the preliminary survey but has not

claimed the house before the surveyor. In cross examination it was put to

him that the house was constructed by the farther of the 4th to 14 th

Respondents and that is the reason for not claiming the house by the 3 rd

Defendant before the surveyor, but has denied. In answering to re-

examination, he said that the deceased 3 rd Defendant in his statement of

claim has claimed the house.

The 5th Defendant gave evidence on behalf of the 4th to 14th

Defendants. His contention is that the house No.3 was constructed by the

5

father of them, but has failed to tender any evidence other than his oral

testimony to establish that fact.

The oral testimony of the 5th Defendant is not reliable. At one stage

he said that there was no house on the land when it was transferred by

Mahallam Usubu Suleiman Lebbe and the house shown in the plan was

constructed by his father, but on questioning further he changed his stand

and said that there was a cadjan house. He has contradicted his own

evidence. Further in his statement of claim he has not pleaded the deed

marked 3Dl. In his evidence he claimed the entirety of Mahallam Usubu

. Suleiman Lebbe. Under these circumstances the Court cannot act solely

on his evidence and come to the conclusion that the house was

constructed by the father of the 5th Defendant. As per the deed marked

3Dl, the land has been transferred with the existing house.

The learned District Judge has considered the evidence and come

to the correct finding that the house marked No.3 should devolve on 3rd

Defendant and 4th to 14th Defendants (as a group) in equal shares. I see no

reason to interfere with the finding of the learned District Judge.

Accordingly I dismiss the appeal subject to costs fixed at Rs.
