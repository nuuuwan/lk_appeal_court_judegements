JUDGMENT

The Appellant in this case is the registered owner of the vehicle bearing No.43-

9890. The accused was the driver of the vehicle at the time of detection. He was

arrested on 19.03.2009 for possession and transporting 506 bottles of liquor. The

driver pleaded guilty. The bottles were confiscated and an inquiry for the

confiscation of the vehicle was held. The learned Magistrate confiscated the

vehicle. Being aggrieved by that order the appellant sought to revise the same in

the High Court. The Learned High Court Judge affirmed the order of the Learned

Magistrate.

I I

At the Production inquiry, the appellant gave evidence. The offence was taken

place on 09.03.2009. At the time of offence, the appellant was not the registered

owner. The \{ehicle was registered on his name only on the 17.04.2009.

The appellant in his evidence at the inquiry stated that he works at a liquor bar in

Mawanella. At the time of offence, the accused driver was transporting liquor to

Mawanella. The appellant bailed out the driver.

The registered owner did not mention that he took any precautions to prevent

the offence being committed, but bailed out the accused driver of the vehicle.

The appellant, not being the registered owner at the time of offence cannot claim

the vehicle.

In the case of Kavalahinge Shantha Kumara Vs Rakwana Range officer

[CA(PHC0162/2010] Their Lordship held that "the certificate of registration of a motor vehicle is regard as the best evidence to establish the ownership of a vehicleN

In the instant case, the best available evidence demonstrates that the vehicle

dee: not belong to the appellant. There for the appcliant is debarred from

claiming the vehicle which he does not own.

Further, the appellant was unable to prove that he took all precautions to prevent

the offence taking place.

In the case of K. Mary Matilda Silva Vs I.P. Habarana, it was held that "the order of confiscation cannot be made if the owner proves to the satisfaction of court:

(1) that he has all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission of the offence or

(2) that the vehicle has been used for the commission of the offence without his know/edgeN

The appellant has the burden to prove on a balance of probability that he has no

knowledge and that he took all necessary precautions to stop an offence being

committed. Therefor it is apparent that the Petitioner has not taken precautions

or necessary steps to prevent an offence being committed by the accused driver

of the vehicle. Further the appellant was unable to prove on balance of

probability that he has no knowledge of the offence being committed by the

accused.

Thus, there is no ground to reverse the order of the Learned High Court Judge, or

the order of the learned Magistrate in confiscating the Vehicle bearing Registered

No. 43- 9890.

Appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
