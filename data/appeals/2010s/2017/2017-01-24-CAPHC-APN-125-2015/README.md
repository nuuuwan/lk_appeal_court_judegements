The 2nd Accused-Petitioner filed this Revision Application dated 15/2/2016 to

revise and mitigate the sentence of the Accused-Petitioner by making an order

substituting an appropriate sentence according to law.

The Petitioner was indicted in the High Court of Kalutara for having committed

the murder of With an age David Singho on the 30th January 1999 along with the

two other Accused the mother and father of the Petitioner. On or about 7th May

2014 at the end of the trial the Petitioner along with the other two Accused

pleaded to the lesser offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder

punishable under section 297 of the Penal Code on the basis of a sudden fight.

They were convicted and sentenced to a tenn of 10 years rigorous imprisonment

and fine of Rs.50,0001= each with a default sentence of six month rigorous

imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said order imposing a tenn of 10 years rigorous

imprisonment the Petitioner moved that this court be pleased to exercise the

revisionary powers and to set aside and mitigate aforesaid sentence on the

following grounds of exceptional circumstances;

a) That the Petitioner was only 17 years old with absolutely no previous

convictions and a student preparing for G.C.E. AIL (Advanced Level)

examinations.

b) That on the day after incident 30th January 1999, the son of the deceased

David Singhno has set fire to the house of his parents- that is pt and 3rd

Accused in which the Petitioner was living.

It was submitted that the Learned High Court Judge has failed to take these facts

in to consideration before imposing the aforesaid sentence. The Petitioner also

submitted that due to lack of financial resources he delayed in filling of this

application.

On the perusal of this record we find that the Petitioner who was a student of 17

years old was preparing for his G.C.E. AIL examination. (A certified copy of the

birth certificate marked P3 has been attached) On the evidence led we find that

on the day of incident 30th of January 1999 the son of the deceased David

Singhno set fire to the house that the Petitioner's parents were living. However

when considering the delay in filing this revision application the explanation that

has been given was that due to lack of financial resources the petitioners delayed

in filling this revision application. 1 st and foremost the Petitioner should have

appealed against the judgment dated 7/4/2014.

According Section 331, of the Criminal Procedure Code Act No 15 of 1979 is

read as follows,

331. (1) "An appeal under this chapter may be lodged by presenting a petition

of appeal or application for leave to appeal to the Registrar of the

High Court within fourteen days from the date when the conviction,

sentence or order sought to be appealed against was pronounced:

Provided that a person in prison may lodge an appeal by stating

within the time aforesaid to the jailer of the prison in which he is for

the time being confined his desire to appeal and the grounds therefor

and it shall thereupon be the duty of such jailer to prepare a petition

of appeal and lodge it with the High Court where the conviction,

sentence or order sought to be appealed against was pronounced. "

Accordingly the 2nd Accused Petitioner had the opportunity to appeal against the

conviction and the sentence of the Learned High Court Judge ifhe has informed

the jailer of the prison in which he is for the time being confined declared his

desire to appeal he would have prepared the petition of appeal as it is duty of

such jailer to prepare a petition of appeal and lodge with the High Court where

the conviction sentence or order sought to be appeal against was pronounced.

Accordingly we find the 2nd Accused Petitioner has failed to comply with section

331 of the Criminal Procedure Code Act No 15 of 1979. As such we find that

when he had a legal remedy available to him he has not acted to obtain such

relief by way of appeal.

When considering the delay of the 2nd Accused-Petitioner has taken to file this

revision application is more than two years the reasoning given is that due to

lack of financial resources he was unable to appeal cannot be accepted by this

court. The 2nd Accused-Petitioner and the other two Accused has pleaded guilty

not in the 1 st instance, but after lengthy trial. Although there are the exceptional

circumstances pleaded by the 2nd Accused-Petitioner which could have been

considered by the court the inordinate delay in filing this revision application is

a bar to such consideration.

In the case of CA(PHC) 28/2009 HC Rev 26/08 Don Chandra Maximus

Illangakoon Vs. Officer-In-Charge of Police Station of Anuradhapura his

Lordship Justice K.T.Chithrasiri, decided to look in to the merits of this case

dispite the delay in filing the revision application. Particularly whether there is

a serious miscarriage of justice had been caused to the 2nd Accused-Petitioner

due to the conviction and sentence imposed on him.

In the present case 1,2, and 3 Defendant-Appellants has pleaded guilty and

accordingly the High Court Judge has convicted and the sentenced the

Defendant Appellants. It is against the sentence that this revision application has

been filed. As such we do not have to consider the merits of this case. The

sentence of the Learned High Court Judge on the Petitioner has been under

section 297 of the Penal Code for sudden fight is as follows,

"Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder

Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall

be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which

may extend to twenty years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act

by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing

death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death; or

with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend

to ten years,

or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it

is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to

cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death."

The 2nd Accused-Petitioner had pleaded the substitution of a lesser sentence.

However in mitigating the sentence he has stated that he was a student who was

preparing for the G.C.E. AIL examination and does not have any previous

convictions. That his parent's residence was burnt by the deceased and has made

a plea of sudden fight before the Learned High Court Judge.

In a case of sudden fight it is immaterial which party committed the offence the

provocation and committed the initial assault. However we find that according

to postmortem report that there had been 17 injuries of which several has been

caused to the neck and head of the deceased.

According to the evidence led in case No HC Kalutara 691106. The Petitioner

has been a party to the act and there has been direct evidence that they injured

the deceased.

The Learned High Court Judge has observed that in accordance with the

postmortem report that there had been 17 injuries on the deceased several of

them on the neck and the head of the deceased. We find that the 2nd Accused-

Petitioner can continue his studies in the prison itself on making suitable

arrangements with the Prison Authorities. As such we are of the view that the

sentence imposed on the 2nd Petitioner-Appellant is not excessive and

accordance with the law. The Petitioner has delayed in submitting this revision

application. We see no reason as to why we should interfere with the said order

of the Learned High Court Judge as there is no miscarriage of justice met to the

2nd Petitioner-Appellant.

Accordingly we dismiss this Revision Application with cost ofRs.SOOO/-.
