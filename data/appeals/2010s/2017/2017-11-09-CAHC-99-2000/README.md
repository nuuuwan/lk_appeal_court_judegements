K. K. WICKRAMASINGHE, J.

The Accused Appellant (herein after referred to as the Appellant) was indicted in the High Court

of Panadura on the following charge:-

On or about 08th April 1993, within the jurisdiction of this court the accused Caused the death

of one Vidanalage Gracian De Mel, which is an offence of murder, punishable under section

296 of the Penal Code.

The indictment was read over to the Accused Appellant and the trial was commenced before a

jury. After trial the jury found the accused guilty on a divided verdict of five to two. Accordingly

the Learned High Court Judge of Panadura found the Appellant guilty of Murder and sentenced

him to death.

-..

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the Accused Appellant, made the instant

appeal to this court for the vacation of the same.

Facts of the case:-

The appellant. and the deceased are relatives and they lived in the same neighbourhood. While

the appellant lived facing the st. Peters Lane, the deceased lived towards the interior having

access through a by lane that ran along the land of the appellant. According to the wife of the

deceased, there have been constant quarrels between the two families over the access road.

During the course of the argument counsel for the Accused Appellant contended that when

witness Nimal Soysa was assaulted with a club by the accused, Gratian was not there and

Gratian's son was also far away. The prosecution version is that there cannot be such a distance

between them not to see each other since the passage was only 12 feet.

The prosecution evidence amply demonstrates that, when the deceased was returning along

the side road at the time witness Nimal was attacked. It was the deceased that dispatched the

witnes~ to make a complaint to the police. When the entirety of evidence is considered it shows

that the deceased was coming home at the time the witness Nimal was attacked, although the

witness may not have noticed.

The kris knife which was recovered on a section 27 statement was identified by the eye witness

as the murderous weapon which is been compatible with the injuries sustained by the

deceased.

According to Investigation, the place of offence (blood stains etc. were present at the scene of

crime) is also established as mentioned by the prosecution witnesses.

The judge has very correctly suggested to the jury to consider the defence of a sudden fight.

After considering the relevant facts merits of the case, the jury very correctly returned the

verdict that the appellant is guilty of committing murder.

In the case of lurdu Nelson Fernando and others Vs AG (1998) 2 SlR 329, His Lordships of the

Supreme Court held that even the points raised by the appellants might be decided in Favour,

yet no miscarriage of justice has actually occurred; hence the appeal should be dismissed.

In this present case it is not:~ that the arguments raised by appellants are not tenable and it

should be rejected.

The jury who had the opportunity of watch the evidence had observed the credibility and the

demeanour of the witnesses and they were satisfied that they were credible witnesses.

It is pertinent to note that very few contradictions which do not go to the root of the case are

present. Those contradictions have been adequately considered by the Jurors on the direction

of the Learned High Court Judge. Further the Learned High Court Judge very correctly directed

the jury as to the law relates to a Sudden Fight and had summed up the evidence elicited in

Court including the doc. Statement of the appellant. There by we have no reason to interfere

with the judgement and the sentence imposed by the Learned Trial Judge. ,

The Appeal is hereby dismissed.
