The petitioner has filed this application praying for a writ of

certiorari and mandamus to quash the decision of the first respondent

confirmed by the third respondent (P4) and also for a writ of mandamus

against the respondent to reinstate the petitioner in the rank of Flight

sergeant.

At the time of the incident petitioner was attached to Sri Lanka Air

Force as a Flight Sergeant. The petitioner amongst others was to receive

a house in the "Ranajayapura Housing Scheme" and was called to attend

a meeting by the Ministry of Defence at the said housing scheme, where

he alleged have made a speech which incited the other officers against

the senior officers.

He was summoned before a Court of Inquiry. Which was only a fact

finding inquiry. He was summarily tried and a charge sheet was served.

After recording evidence of five witnesses and after recording the

statement of the petitioner he was found guilty and P4 had been served

on him dismisSing him from the Air Force with disgrace and imprisoned

for 90 days at the Air Force camp at Ratmalana.

The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that he was not given

an opportunity under section 40 (3) of the Air Force Act and the charge

3

sheet was not read over to him. He also submitted that the petitioner was

not given an opportunity to cross examine the witnesses.

Counsel for the respondent argued that the petitioner was

summoned before a Court of Inquiry and that the inquiry was conducted

in a manner consistent with rules of natural justice. He stated that the

evidence of several witnesses were lead in the presence of the petitioner

who was allowed to cross examine them. At the conclusion of the inquiry

the petitioner was found guilty and sentenced to three months

imprisonment.

The respondents counsel argued that the petitioner accepted the

sentence imposed by the summary trail by choosing to accept the

punishment rather than facing a Court Martial. Subsequently the

Commander of the Air Force has taken a decision to discharge the

petitioner from the Air Force (R1). On a perusal of R3 we find that the

Court of Inquiry has not made a note of the presence of the petitioner.

We find that the decision under attack had been made without

following the rules of Natural Justice.

Writ of mandamus is exercised to resolve a party who has been

denied of his right. This has been stated in Perera vs National Housing

Development Authority 2001 3 SLR 50.

We find that the rights of the petitioner had not been denied by the

respondents. For the afore stated reasons I refuse the petitioner's

application.

Application dismissed.
