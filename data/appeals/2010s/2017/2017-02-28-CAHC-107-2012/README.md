By an indictment dated 30th November 2005 the Attorney General indicted the

following Accused to stand trial in the High Court of Panadura for committing the

murder of one Gallage Don Premaratne alias Kalu Preme on or about 21st February

1992 at Kananwila-an offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code read

with Section 32 of the said Code.

1. Gamage Prabhath Janaka Nayana Priyantha Perera

2. Rajapaksha Pathirage Jayathissa

After a trial before a Judge, both these two accused were found guilty of the lesser

charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and on 25th May 2012, the

learned High Court Judge of Panadura imposed a sentence of 7 years' rigorous

2

imprisonment with a fine of Rs.25,OOO/- on the 1st Accused and a sentence of 12

years' rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs.25,OOO/- was imposed on the 2nd

Accused.

Whilst the 1st Accused (hereinafter referred to as 'the Appellant') has preferred this

appeal against the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the 2nd Accused has not made

an appeal to this court. In the circumstances the determination of this appeal will

focus on the propriety of the conviction and sentence pronounced against the

Appellant.

Before I deal with the questions of law arising in this appeal a compendious narrative

of facts becomes apposite.

The principal evidence for the prosecution to drive home the capital charge against

both accused emerged through a non-summary deposition of an eyewitness to the

incident namely; Munasinghe Wimalaratne Silva who had since passed away at the

time of the trial. The prosecution placed this evidence before the High Court of

Panadura by virtue of Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance.

According to the non-summary deposition of the said Munasinghe Wimalaratne Silva

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as 'the witness' or 'the eyewitness'), whilst he

was proceeding towards Kahatapitiya, he met the Appellant, the 2nd Accused (the

accused who has not preferred an appeal) and one Siripala who were all drinking in a

rubber estate. Ajantha who was the 3rd Accused at the non-summary inquiry but was

later discharged by the Hon. Attorney General after committal, joined the drinking

binge. In the end the bacchanalian party constituted a group of five persons

comprising the Appellant, the 2nd Accused, Siripala, Ajantha and the witness himself.

Giving a detailed account of their nocturnal escapades in search of intoxicants to

which the witness was accosted, the witness describes as to how both the Appellant

and the 2nd Accused armed themselves on this fateful day namely 21st February 1992.

3

Whilst the 2nd Accused picked up a gun from a drain, the Appellant pulled out a

manna knife. Then the witness Munasinghe Wimalaratne Silva speaks of the arrival

of a push bicycle which was stopped by the 2nd Accused and immediately the cyclist

was set upon by Siripala and dealt a blow.

As the cyclist went away after he was manhandled, there arrived on the scene a

motorcycle with three riders thereon, one of whom was the deceased Premaratne

aka Kalu Preme. The eyewitness deposes in his deposition that the deceased got off

the motorcycle calling out Tissa-the2 nd Accused in the case. It has to be recalled at

this stage that the widow of the deceased who was called to testify at the trial as to

the identification of the dead body also stated in her evidence that her deceased

husband had known Tissa-the 2nd Accused in the case as they hailed from the same

village.

According to the non-summary testimony of Munasinghe Wimalaratne Silva, the

deceased told the other two riders on the motorcycle to leave. Thereafter Tissa (the

2nd Accused), Parabath (the Appellant) and the deceased were in conversation on the

road.

The witness next states that he saw the Appellant assaulting the deceased with his

hand whereupon the deceased took to his heels shouting - "don't kill me" and he ran

along the bank of a canal. The Appellant and Tissa (the 2nd Accused) gave chase to

the deceased whilst the witness, Ajantha (the 3rd accused in the non-summary

inquiry who was later discharged by the Attorney General) and Siripala followed the

Appellant and the 2nd Accused. The deceased had shouted back saying "Don't kill me.

Please allow me to go and I will have my wound dressed up" but the Appellant and

the 2nd Accused kept chasing after the deceased. In response to a plea of the

deceased, the 2nd Accused shouted back, "I cannot do anything, you are going to be

killed".

4

The witness next states that he saw Prabath (the Appellant) attacking the deceased

with the manna knife and that blow felled the deceased. The witness states that

when he saw this episode with the aid of moonlight on that fateful night, he was

standing at a distance of 5 feet away from the scene. He saw the Appellant deal a

blow again to the deceased who was now lying fallen. He couldn't remember as to

how many blows the Appellant dealt the deceased Premaratne.

Thereafter the Appellant had come towards the witness and others intimidating to

kill them if they divulged the heinous act to anyone. The same fate were to befall

them if they squealed on him. This witness stated that as a result of these death

threats, he couldn't make a prompt complaint to Police. However the pang of gUilt

was gnawing at his conscience for a while but it was the death threats that kept the

witness away from reporting this incident. It has to be pointed out that all three

Accused at the non-summary inquiry (the Appellant, 2ndAccused and Ajanta) were

represented by Counsel who conducted their own individual cross-examination of

this witness at the inquiry.

Belated Statement of the Eyewitness to Police

The witness did not report the incident to police immediately. At the non-summary

inquiry the witness admitted to a lapse of about eighteen months before he gave

information pertaining to the killing. According to the Assistant Superintendent of

Police who testified at the trial, the witness came to the police station voluntarily

and made a statement. Upon being questioned in cross examination in the

Magistrate's Court as to why he delayed reporting this incident, the witness

Munasinghe Wimalaratne Silva reiterated that his reluctance was due to the fear of

death instilled into him. By the time the witness plucked up courage to make a

statement to police a period of about eighteen months had elapsed since the

incident on 21st February 1992.

5

Merely because a witness maintains silence for more than a year after he has

witnessed violent acts on another, the court is not entitled to reject such testimony

ipso facto. Why the witness did not reveal a dastardly act or otherwise is a fact for

him or her to explain and in fact if the explanation is plausible and credible the Court

must act on the testimony albeit belated.

It cannot be laid down as a rule of universal application that if there is any delay in

examination of a particular witness in the course of investigation the prosecution

version becomes suspect. It would depend upon several factors. If the explanation

offered for the delayed statement is plausible and acceptable and the Court accepts

the same as plausible, there is no reason to interfere with the conclusion made by

the trial court for accepting the belated testimony.

Our Courts have emphasized the underlying rationale in several decisions. No doubt

the well known tools of assessing the credibility of a witness such as tests of

spontaneity, contemporaneity and promptness enhance the testimonial

trustworthiness of the witness but they do not operate as inflexible rules. There

exists an exception to these rules-namely if a belated testimony is proffered by the

prosecution, the Court has to proceed to scrutinize the reasons for the delay-vide the

percipient observations of T.S. Fernando J in Pauline de Croos v. The Queen,l and the

perceptive comments of Frederick Ninian Dimitri {F.N.D} Jayasuriya J. on the tests for

credibility in regard to the belated testimony of an eye witness called Chulasiri in

Ajith Samarakoon v. The Republic {Kobaigane Murder Case}.2

At pages 246, 251 and 252 of the appeal brief there is enough testimony as to the

fear entertained by the particular witness that explains the delay is not reporting this

incident to the Police Officers.

6

The witness avowed that there was no enmity between him and the accused. There

was no friendship or family relationship with the deceased. In the absence of ill will

towards the accused or affection with the deceased and having regard to the

testimony of the police witness who spoke to voluntary nature of the witness's

statement albeit belated, this Court finds the reason given by the witness for

belatedness plausible and acceptable.

It cannot be gainsaid that the non-summary testimony of Munasinghe Wimalaratne

Silva established that the deceased Premaratne came by his death at the hands of

the Appellant and the 2nd Accused in this case.

Impugnation of Section 33 Evidence

The Counsel for the Appellant though sought to impugn this evidence placed before

the High Court on several grounds. It was contended that the narrative of

Munasinghe Wimalaratne Silva needed corroboration as he did not fully testify to all

the events that occurred on the day in question. In fact the learned Counsel for the

Accused-Appellant drew the attention of this Court to the evidence of another

witness namely Gunapala who refers to three different events on the day in

question. According to Gunapala who was a resident close to the scene of murder,

five persons had come into his compound on the night of the day in question and

made noise threateningly. Thereafter these persons raided a nearby den of hooch

(kassippu) and the witness heard them manhandle some of those who were imbibing

liquor. Gunapala who was led as a 2nd witness at the trial spoke of three events on

the night of 21st February 1992. The first event pertained to the above story of five

people arriving at his house and rushing towards the kassippu den. The witness

Gunapala spoke of a second incident where he heard an assault on a cyclist about

quarter an hour later on the same night. He heard the bicycle falling with somebody

shouting "00 not hit me." Then the cyclist went away. Thereafter the witness refers

to a third incident of the arrival of a motorcycle and subsequent assault on a person

7

!

t-It

who had been detained after the arrival of the motorcycle. The following morning he

saw the deceased lying with cut injuries on his neck in the paddy field located

somewhere in front of his house. It has to be noted that Gunapala never identified

the five people who came into his compound on the day in question. He was not able

to connect the accused in the dock to these three events. According to him he was

watching all these events from his house in darkness from and even though the

second and third events namely the arrival of a bicycle followed later by a motorcycle

resonate to some extent with the version given by Munasinghe Wimalaratne Silva, in

my view it is the non-summary deposition (Section 33 evidence) that unfolds the

narrative as to the killing. But the learned Counsel for the Appellant contended

otherwise.

Juxtaposing the testimony of Gunapala vis-a-vis the non-summary deposition of

Munasinghe Wimalaratne Silva, the counsel argued that the eyewitness account of

Munasinghe Wimalaratne Silva which emerges through the testimony of his non-

summary deposition is not corroborated at all by Gunapala and therefore the court

should be slow to act on the uncorroborated evidence of Munasinghe Wimalaratne

Silva.

This Court takes a contrary view to this argument of Counsel and highlights a salient

difference between the two witnesses. Whilst Gunapala never identified any of the

Accused, Munasinghe Wimalaratne Silva witnessed the killing at the scene. He

identified both the accused and the deceased. If a witness speaks of incidents on the

day in question but cannot identify the accused or connect them to the incidents, we

would bear in mind that the elements of the offence would not be borne out by that

particular witness. In those circumstances the non-eyewitness testimony cannot

render the eyewitness testimony unworthy of credit. It is true that there were two

other riders on the motorcycle, who arrived with the deceased on the day in

question. But there is evidence that the deceased told them to leave and the

8

deceased was in the company of the Appellant, the 2nd Accused, Ajantha, Siripala and

the eyewitness whose lower court testimony was admitted at the trial. If the other

riders left the scene at the bidding of the deceased, they would not be able to unfold

the narrative that took place subsequently. They can only speak to their arrival along

with the deceased. This initial arrival of the deceased is spoken to by Munasinghe

Wimlaratne Silva whose lower court testimony was admitted under Section 33 of the

Evidence Ordinance. In those circumstances there was no duty on the part of the

prosecutor to summon the other riders on the motorcycle as witnesses. If other

witnesses (the riders who went away) are not going to state anything new, the

prosecutor cannot be faulted for not calling the other riders because the evidence of

Wimalaratne Silva who speaks to the same fact has already been placed before

Court. In such a situation the invocation of a Section 114(f) presumption under the

Evidence Ordinance would not arise and in fact it is our view that Section 33

evidence unfolded the narrative before Court. There was no warrant in such a

situation to draw adverse inferences as the principle on drawing of adverse

inferences, as adumbrated in Walimunige John v. The State/ would not be

applicable in this case. Merely because the prosecution does not lead a witness

whose name appears on the back of the indictment, it does not necessarily lead to

adverse inferences being drawn against the prosecution in terms of Section 114(f) of

the Evidence Ordinance. Adverse inferences are invoked when a witness is essential

to complete the narrative but the witness is not led at the trial. The prosecution is

not bound to call all the witnesses on the back of indictment. But if a material

witness, essential to the unfolding of the narrative is not called, and no satisfactory

explanation is given, the Court can draw the presumption under Section 114(f) of the

Evidence Ordinance4 In this case the eyewitness Wimalaratne Silva completes the

3 76 N.L.R 488

4See R v. Stephen Seneviratne 38 N.L.R 208 at 221; The King v. Chalo Singho 42 N.L.R 269 at 217; The King v. Wegodapola 42 N.L.R 459 at 464; The Queen v. Abeyratne 64 C.L.W 68; Gunasekara v. AG 79 (1) N.L.R 348 at 351-352 9

narrative in extenso and no other witness could have stated anything new as they

had not witnesses the whole incident which culminated in the termination of life of

the deceased.

One cannot seek corroboration from a witness who does not establish directly or

indirectly either mens rea or actus reus on the part of an accused. Neither would an

eyewitness who gives a credible testimony of what he saw, heard and perceived

require corroboration.

In a murder case, based on direct witness account, it is necessary to examine the

testimony of an eyewitness in order to ascertain whether he did really see the

occurrence and whether the statement given by him appears to be natural and

truthful and whether such statement found in corroboration with the medical

evidence on record and other circumstances advances the guilt of the accused or

diminishes it. It is, therefore, not correct to reject the prosecution version only on

ground that all witnesses led do not speak to the occurrence under scrutiny. It is also

not proper to reject the case for want of corroboration by independent witnesses if

the case made out is otherwise true and acceptable.

Merely because the eyewitness testimony at the trial emerges from a Section 33

conduit, it does not lose its weight if it contains sufficiently probative material. At

this stage the criteria for admissibility under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance

need recapitulation.

Admissibility of Evidence under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance

Section 33 of the Ordinance provides one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule, when

it states that evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding or before any

person authorized by law to take it, is relevant in a subsequent judiCial proceeding,

or in a later stage of the same proceeding provided the conditions and safeguards

10

laid down in Section 33 are present. Such evidence is relevant for the purpose of

proving the truth of the facts which it states.

"A criminal trial or inquiry is deemed to be a proceeding between the

prosecutor and the accused within the meaning of this section."s

Let me briefly touch on the preconditions prescribed in the Evidence Ordinance for

the reception of the non summary deposition of a witness who is not available to

give evidence when the High Court trial comes around.

Condition of Admissibility under Section 336

Condition (A) - The evidence should have been given in a judicial proceeding or

before any person authorized by law to take it. 7

Condition (8) - The witness who gave the evidence - is dead

Condition (C) - The proceeding must be between the same parties or their

representatives in interest. 8

Condition (0) - The adverse party in the first proceeding should have had the right

and opportunity to cross-examine.9

The section draws a distinction between the right to cross-examine and the

opportunity to cross-examine. There is ample evidence on the record that the

aforesaid preconditions were fulfilled for the reception of the non-summary

deposition. As I said before in this judgment, at the non-summary inquiry there was

individual cross-examination conducted of the eyewitness on the part of all the

Accused including the Appellant.

Substantive Evidence through Section 33

It has to be noted that the evidence that is admitted through Section 33 of the

Evidence Ordinance is received as substantive evidence of the testimony given in the

5 Explanation to Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance

6See Stephen, Digest, 4th Ed., Art.32 7Bihari Singh Madho Singh v. State of Bihar A./.R. (1954) SC 692; (1954) Cr.L.J. 1742

8 Proviso (a) to Section 33

9 Proviso (b) to Section 33 11

former judicial proceedings. Substantive evidence, as is understood in the Law of

Evidence, is intended to prove the truth of the facts stated. Though Sir James

Fitzjames Stephen-the progenitor of Indian Evidence Act and our own Evidence

Ordinance limits evidence to oral and documentary evidence in the Evidence

Ordinance,lo evidence in a trial does not necessarily come through these two modes

alone. The Evidence Ordinance is inclusionary in that exceptions to hearsay are

recognized in Sections 17 to 38 of the Evidence Ordinance that enable the reception

of hearsay evidence for truth contained in that evidence to be acted upon and

believed for its veracity.

Evaluation of Section 33 Evidence

The considerations that arise when such a deposition is tendered in evidence under

Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance are different from those attending the use of

statements in the Magistrate's Court or High Court to contradict a witness. In the

former case, the statements come in as substantive evidence, whereas when they

are used to contradict, they cannot be used as substantive evidence.ll It would be

incorrect to apply cases relating to contradictions to depositions admitted under

Section 33 as substantive evidence, except as provided in Section 158 of the

Evidence Ordinance. When the witness is present, his evidence in a former judicial

proceeding may always be used to corroborate or contradict him. If the witness is

dead by the time the High Court trial comes about, the former testimony at the non-

summary inquiry could be acted upon as substantive evidence to establish the truth

of what that evidence contains.

Has the Former Testimony been Impeached?

The question arises as to how this evidence has been dented by the defence. This

question has to be answered by taking the whole statement into consideration vis-a-

10 See Section 3 of The Evidence Ordinance llCf. The King v. Sudu Banda (1946) 47 N.L.R. 183; The King v. Punchi Banda (1946) 47 NLR 203; 5.5. Fernando v. The Queen (1953) 55 NLR 392 12

vis other evidence available in the case. Has, the Section 33 testimony on which a

Court can act for its veracity, been in any event impugned or attacked on its

testimonia I trustworth iness?

The answer lies in an evaluation of how it has been confronted by the Appellant in

the Magistrate's Court and what other evidence enhances or diminishes its probative

value. Let me begin with the cross-examination conducted in the Magistrate's Court.

The cross-examination on behalf of the Appellant had proceeded on the basis that

the witness was uttering a falsehood and it was him who was responsible for the

murder. This bare suggestion is not borne out by evidence. In the absence of any

basis for those suggestions the integrity of the evidence stood uncontradicted and

uncontroverted in the Magistrate's Court. It has to be observed that when counsel

makes suggestions to a witness in court, it has to be well founded-see Section 149 of

the Evidence Ordinance. Therefore acceptance of Section 33 evidence for its truth

was well founded and the learned High Court Judge was quite right in acting on the

Section 33 evidence.

Unsworn Statement and its Evidentiary Value

When one traverses the trajectory of totality of evidence given in the High Court of

Panadura, one comes across the dock statement made by the Appellant which has to

be evaluated because as consistently laid down in our Courts such an unsworn

testimony is looked upon as evidence subject to the infirmity that the Accused has

deliberately refrained from giving sworn testimony, and the jury or the judge in this

instance must be so directed. But it has to be borne in mind that:-

a) If the trier of fact believes the unsworn statement it must be acted upon.

b) If it raises a reasonable doubt in his mind about the case for the

prosecution, the defence must succeed.

c) It should not be used against another accused.

J I f 1 f r

See the cursus curiae in Queen v. Kularatne12 and King v. Val/ayan Sittambaram

wherein Bertram c.J allowed the appeal of the Accused-Appellant because one of the

grounds was that the Trial Judge had refused to the accused the opportunity of

making an unsworn statementl13 Queen v. Buddharakitha,14 Gunapala and Others v.

The Republic of Sri Lanka,15 and Kathubdeen v. Republic of Sri Lanka.16

I must refer to the cogent evidence given by the medical officer who conducted the

post-mortem examination. This evidence is corroborative of the prosecution case.

The expert spoke of four injuries out of which the 1st injury which was 5 inches long

had cut the vertebrae. The cut injuries were deep and inflicted on the neck.

According to the medical doctorl all four injuries could have been caused by a

weapon with a sharp cutting edge and long blade. This corroborates the testimony of

Wimlaratne Silva who stated in no unmistakable terms that he saw the Appellant

inflict these injuries with a manna knife. Emanating as it was from an independent

witness who was disinterested and impartiall the evidence of the doctor was not

challenged.

Dock Statement made by the Appellant

The dock statement made by the Appellant teems with inconsistencies. Apart from a

mere denial of any knowledge about the killing which was proclaimed from the dockl

the Appellant denied any knowledge of the deceased. The Appellant spoke of going

to see a musical show which was not mentioned when his counsel cross-examined

the witness in the non-summary inquiry. The Appellant refers to 2nd July 1992 as the

date of his musical entertainment whereas the offence took place on 21st February

1992. If he was pleading a defense of alibil it is not made out on the evidence as

1271 N.L.R 529 at 551 (a judgment of the full bench of Court of Criminal Appeal)

13See 20 N.L.R 257 at 266

prosecution evidence establishes his presence on the date of the offence at the

scene. It is our view that alibi is an afterthought.

No reference was made or suggested in the dock statement as to any enmity with

the eye witness except for a reference to one Chamila Silva Munasinghe who was

allegedly introduced by police to testify against him. Though it is not clear whether

Chamila Silva Munasinghe referred to in the dock statement and the eyewitness is

one and the same person or different persons this allegation of a frame-up was not

at all suggested to the two police officers who gave evidence at the trial. The

Appellant gives the date of his arrest as 5th June 1993 whereas the Police Officer

testified that the Appellant was arrested on 16th June 1993-a discrepancy that was

never resolved by clarifying it with the police evidence.

The Appellant made allegations in his dock statement that after his arrest the police

intimidated and assaulted him in order to extract the truth about the murder. This

position was never suggested to police officers nor was this the appellant's case in

the Magistrate's Court. Thus the case of the Appellant suffers from inconsistency per

se and inter se. If Chamila Silva Munasinghe and the eyewitness Munasinghe

Wimalaratne Silva were one and the same, why was not, the allegation that he was

planted by police, put to him when he was giving evidence in the Magistrate's Court?

It has to be recalled that police evidence was to the effect that Munasinghe

Wimalaratne Silva came to the police station, though belatedly, to b~re it all. Why

weren't the police officers confronted with a police fabrication when they gave

evidence?

A witness is normally considered to an independent witness unless he springs from

the sources which are likely to be tainted such as enmity or relationship and which

make him inclined to implicate the accused falsely. Nothing has been shown or

established before us as to why this eyewitness should be inimical towards the

Appellant.

t

Was the Eyewitness an Accomplice?

In our view the witness was not a particeps criminis. On a perusal of the totality of

evidence in the case, he does not come within the definition of an accomplice. He

falls far short of the requirements which would confer on him that status.

In Chetumal Rekumal v. Emperor7 the definition of an accomplice was propounded.

((An accomplice is one who is a guilty associate in crime or who sustains such

relation to the criminal act that he could be charged jointly with the accused. It

is, admittedlYI not every participation in a crime which makes a party an

accomplice in it so as to require his testimony to be confirmed." (Emphasis

added)

This meaning was adopted by Basnayake J. (as he then was) in the case of Pieris v.

Dole18 Basnayake J. also refers to the words of Chandravarkar J. in Emperor v. Burn19

((No man ought to be treated as an accomplice on mere suspicion unless he

confesses that he had a conscious hand in the crime or he makes admission of

the facts showing that he had such hand. If the evidence of a witness falls short

of these testsl he is not an accomplicel and his testimony must be judged on

principles applicable to ordinary witnesses."

So as correctly submitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General, Wimalaratne

Silva was not a witness for whom Court should look for corroboration.

Failure to Explain Incriminating Evidence

The Appellant has not explained away several items of incriminating evidence which

the eyewitness spoke of. On the 22nd February 1992 the eyewitness places the

Appellant at the scene. He was in the company of the deceased and three others

including the witness. He was armed with a manna knife. According to the witness he

chased after the deceased and dealt him blows. After doing Premaratne in, the

Appellant intimidated the eyewitness and others present at the scene. The mere

declaration that the Appellant did not know the deceased and that the witness

committed the murder himself would not suffice in the teeth of these items of

incriminating evidence.

Evidential Burden on the Appellant

The dock statement is devoid of material facts explaining away the incriminating

items of evidence stemming from the prosecution evidence. Such a failure to offer an

explanation irresistibly leads this Court to inferences and presumptions founded on

common sense and logic. This court is not certainly placing or imposing a legal

burden or a persuasive burden on the Appellant to prove his innocence or that he did

not commit a criminal offence. The court is merely imposing an evidential burden

either by giving evidence or making a dock statement of explaining away the highly

incriminating circumstances and inferences established by the prosecution against

him. Several decisions of our Courts have emphasized this evidential burden

beginning with seminal precedents such as King v. Geekiyanage John Silvr/ and

Albert Singho v. The Queen/1 This burden could be discharged either by giving

evidence or calling witnesses or even in the course of a dock statement since the

making of an unsworn statement is a long recognized right of an accused in this

country.

A useful illustration of the rationale for the evidential burden in the context of giving

evidence appears in the judgment of the House of Lords in Murray v. DPp/2 a case

concerned with the provisions relating to silence in a Northern Ireland legislation. In

fact Murray appears to me to be one of the cases reflecting a modern version of the

Ellenborough dictum that our Courts have oftentimes alluded to in their decisions.

This Court holds that the Appellant failed to discharge his evidential burden of

explaining away the incriminating circumstances against him.

Thus the dock statement made by the Appellant barely bears scrutiny by this Court

and we proceed to reject it as self serving and devoid of exculpatory evidence that

throws doubt on the prosecution case.

Defence called by the Appellant

The Court now turns to the evidence of a witness called by the Appellant namely one

Ajantha who had been a co-accused with the appellant in the non summary inquiry.

As I have stated before in this judgment, Ajantha was the 3rd Accused who was

discharged by the Hon. Attorney General after committal. This witness does not

advance the case of the Appellant as is quite evident from the unsatisfactory

evidence he gave at the trial. According to the non-summary deposition of the

eyewitness, Ajantha was one of those who was a member of the five member party

on that fateful night. But in the trial he denies his presence. There was a culpable

omission on his part to take up this position at the Magistrate's Court when his

individual cross-examination of his accompanying companion Wimalaratne Silva-the

eyewitness took place. Having omitted to assert his absence from the party of five

men on the date of the offence, he testified at the trial that he was never there with

the group on the day of the offence His contradictory stance does not induce

confidence in his testimony and he could not have been so amnesiac at the trial. We

are in agreement with the learned High Court Judge that the evidence of Ajantha

does not take the case of the Appellant anywhere near exculpation.

So in totality it is our view that the case of the Appellant does not throw any doubt

on the prosecution.

So this Court finds no misdirections of law and fact in the judgment of the learned

High Court Judge of Panadura as she has indulged in a comprehensive analysis of the

evidence and law in convicting the Appellant of the lesser offence of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder and sentencing him to a term of 7 years' rigorous

imprisonment. The learned High Court Judge has not reached a perverse or

unsustainable verdict and it is our view that the Appellant has suffered no

miscarriage of justice.

We have given careful consideration to the evidence placed before the High Court

and the judgment pronounced by the learned High Court Judge. We have given our

anxious attention to the comprehensive arguments advanced before us by both the

learned Counsel for the Appellant and the learned Additional Solicitor General.

We would reiterate that it is the duty of the Court to cull out the nuggets of truth

from the evidence unless there is reason to believe that the inconsistencies of

falsehood are so glaring as utterly to destroy confidence in the witnesses. We do not

find such deliberate embroideries as would throw overboard the case of the

prosecution.

It is necessary, to remember that a Judge does not preside over a criminal trial

merely to see that no innocent man is punished. A Judge also presides to see that a

guilty man does not escape. One is as important as the other. Both are public duties

which the Judge has to perform.

We conclude that there is a ring of truth that resonates with the prosecution version

in the main and we proceed to affirm the conviction and sentence pronounced in the

case. In the circumstances we dismiss the appeal of the Appellant.
