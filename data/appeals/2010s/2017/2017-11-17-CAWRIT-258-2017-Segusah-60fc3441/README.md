L. T .B. DEHIDENIYA J (P / CAl

Heard the counsel for the Petitioner. We see no reason to issue notice in this

matter. The complaint filed in the Magistrate court is that the offer letter marked

PI indicates the interest that will be charged is 15% and the mortgage bond is

marked P2 the interest is 26 %. We considered the offer. The bank has offered

15% interest and it is subject to fluctuation on discretion of the bank. Therefore

when entering into the mortgage bond the interest gone up to 26%. We see no

reason to interfere with the findings of the learned Magistrate who has very

correctly decided. Therefore, we see no reason to issue notice. We refuse to

issue notice.
