In the present 330 case, the Petitioner had signed an agreement to export dried leaves of kothalahimbutu on the 25th May 2006, I presume, that they have done their feasibility study of their profit returns. It was agreed at that time to allow export of dried leaves of kothalahimbutu, and there is no change of stance by the State hence there is no betrayal to investors by the State or State agencies. It appears the Petitioners had 335 change their plans the reason better known to them, for which, the State cannot be held responsible.",
