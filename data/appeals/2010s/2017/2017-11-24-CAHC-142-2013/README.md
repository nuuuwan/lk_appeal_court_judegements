Heard submissions of the counsel for the accused appellant. The case was

adjourned for today to receive the submissions of the Attorney General.

Senior Deputy Solicitor General maintaining the highest tradition of the

department and make submissions to assist the Court. The SDSG

submits that he is not supporting the conviction for murder and he agrees

with the counsel for the accused appellant and supports conviction for

culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of cumulative

provocation and on a sudden incident at the last date. Considering the

fact that the incident has happened on just after the new year day and

within the compound of the accused appellant raises the concern of the

Court. As the SDSG submits that there are many circumstances of which

receives the attention of court to consider for a conviction of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder. After carefully considering the

proceedings and submissions of both counsel, this court agrees with the

counsel that this is not a case for a conviction of murder. Therefore we

vacate the conviction for murder and enter a conviction of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of culminate provocation

and sudden fight and impose the sentence of 12 years rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2500/- in default three months simple

imprisonment. Counsel for the accused appellant submits that the

accused appellant was incarcerated from 30.08.2013 and he pleads with

the court to implement the sentence from the date of conviction. State has

no objection for that application. Accordingly we direct the Prison

Authority to implement the sentence from the date of conviction namely,

30.08.2013. The Registrar is hereby directed to return the case record to

the High Court of Kurunegala to implement the sentence. Appeal partly

allowed.
