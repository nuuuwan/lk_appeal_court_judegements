This is an appeal from the High Court ofKegalla.

2

On a complaint made by the informant Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter

sometimes called and referred to as the Appellant), the Officer in Charge of

the Police Station, Rambukkana has filed an action in the Magistrate Court

of Kegalla against 1 st to 4th Accused Respondents Respondents (hereinafter

sometimes called and referred to as the 1 st to 4 th Respondents) for

committing offences punishable under sections 434 and 317 of the Penal

Code read with section 32. After trial, the learned Magistrate acquitted the

accused. Being aggrieved by the said order the Appellant moved in revision

in the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Kegalle

after 14 Yz months. The learned High Court Judge refused notice and

dismissed the revision application. Being dissatisfied with the order of the

learned High Court Judge, this appeal was presented.

The 1 st to 4th Respondents as well as the AG were of the view that the

revision application was filed after a considerable delay and the revision

being a discretionary remedy, this long delay is fatal. The Appellant's

contention is that he made an application through the legal aid to the Hon.

,Iff

3

Attorney General to appeal against the order but the AG replied only after

10 months indicating that the AG is not appealing against and informing the

Appellant to consider a revision. This was communicated to him by the

legal aid after two months and within 2 Y2 months from the said

communication the revision application was filed. The Appellant's

contention is that there is no delay in his part.

The revision application was filed after 14 Y2 months from the order of the

learned Magistrate is a fact. We have to consider whether the delay is

reasonable.

Under section 320 of the Criminal Procedure Code the Hon, Attorney

General has to file the appeal within 28 days. The section reads thus:

320.

(1) Subject to the provisions of sections 317,318 and 319 any person

who shall be dissatisfied with any judgment or final order

pronounced by any Magistrate's Court in a criminal case or matter to

which he is a party may prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal

against suchjudgmentfor any error in law, or infact-

(a) by lodging within fourteen days from the time of such

judgment or order being passed or made, with such

Magistrate's Court a petition of appeal addressed to the Court

of Appeal, or

(b) by stating within the time aforesaid to the Registrar of such

court or to the jailer of the prison in which he is for the time

being confined his desire to appeal and the grounds therefor,

providing at the same time a stamp of the value of fi,!e rupees,

and it shall thereupon be the duty of such Registrar or jailer as

the case may be, to prepare a petition of appeal and lodge it

4

with the court by which such judgment or order was

pronounced.

(2) Subject to the relevant provision of section 317 the Attorney-

General may prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against any

judgment or final order pronounced by a Magistrate's Court in any

criminal case or matter, and where he so appeals, or where he

sanctions an appeal, the time within which' the petition of appeal

must be preferred shall be twenty-eight days.

After 28 days, even the AG is debarred from filing an appeal. Therefore

there is no reason for the appellant to wait for 10 months to get a reply. He

is ought to know that the appealable time has lapsed. Everybody is

presumed know the law and the ignorance of law is not an excuse. Once the

appealable period is over, the appellant should have considered a revision,

without waiting for the AG to give a direction to consider a revision. The

delay cannot be considered as reasonable. Revision being a discretionary

remedy, the one who is seeking the assistance of Court must act promptly

and one who is sleeping over his grievances cannot seek the assistance of

Court by way of revision to remedy the injustice complained of Inordinate

delay is fatal to a revision application.

The learned Magistrate has considered the alibi of the 1 st Respondent that he

was in Colombo, attending a work shop during the period where the incident

has taken place. The alibi was proved by the 1st respondent by submitting

the relevant documents. It has raised a reasonable doubt as to the culpability

of the 1 st Respondent. I don't see any miscarriage of justice in coming to the

conclusion that the 1 st Respondent has raised a reasonable doubt. There is no

reason to interfere with the finding of the learned Magistrate. It. has been

held in the case of Attorney-General vs. Podisingho 51 NLR 385 that:

5

The powers of revision of the Supreme Court are wide enough to

embrace a case where an appeal lay but was not taken. In such a

case, however, an application in revision should not be entertained

save in exceptional circumstances, such as,

(a) where there has been a miscarriage of justice,

(b) where a strong case for the interference of the Supreme

Court has been made out by the petitioner, or

(c) where the applicant was unaware of the order made by the

Court of trial.

The learned High Court Judge has correctly refused notice.

I do not see any reason to interfere with the findings of the learned High

Court Judge.

Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.

I agree.
