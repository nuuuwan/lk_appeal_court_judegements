JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The Applicant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the Respondent) had issued a quit notice on the Respondent -

4

Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant),

in terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act).

As the Appellant had failed to respond to the said quit notice, the

Respondent had thereafter made an application under section 5 of the Act

to the Magistrate's Court of Baddegama seeking an order to evict the

Appellant from the land described in the schedule to the said application.

Learned Magistrate after an inquiry had pronounced the order dated 2005-

04-25 evicting the Appellant from the said land on the basis that he had

failed to produce a permit or due authority to remain in the said land.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, the Appellant

had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of Southern

Province holden in Galle seeking a revision of the order of the learned

Magistrate.

The Provincial High Court after the conclusion of the argument, had

pronounced its judgment dated 2006 -08-29, upholding the preliminary

objections raised on behalf of the Respondent. The Provincial High Court

on that basis had proceeded to dismiss the said revision application.

5

It is that judgment that the Appellant is canvassing in this appeal before

this Court.

The main conclusion arrived at by the learned Provincial High Court Judge

is that the Appellant had failed to produce certified copies of documents

relevant to the revision application filed before it. In this Court the

Appellant has not put forward any argument to negate the said conclusion

of the learned Provincial High Court Judge.

Learned counsel for the Appellant has failed to file written submission in

this Court despite the undertaking that it would be filed within three weeks

reckoned from the date of argument. Thus, this Court would proceed on

the basis that the Appellant has no valid ground to be placed on his behalf

before this Court, for its consideration.

It must also be noted that section 9 of the Act sets out the scope of the

inquiry to be held before the Magistrate in following terms;

" ... At such inquiry the person on whom summons under section 6 has

been served shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in

the application under section 5 except that such person may establish that

he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other

6

written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law

and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid .... "

Upon consideration of the material adduced in this case this Court is unable

to see any basis to assail the judgment of the Provincial High Court.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal with

costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
