The accused appellant was convicted for rape under sec. 364 (2)

(e) of the penal code in the High Court of Trincomalee on 05/11/2008.

This appeal has been filed against the said judgment.

The argument of the appellant's learned counsel was that the age

of the victim was not established beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant

argued that the date of birth was given as 1 st of January 1985 by the

victim while giving evidence in the High Court and referred to her

evidence in page 44 of the brief where it is said as,

Q: When were you born?

A: On 01.01.1985 or on the 28th

(In the National Identity Card it is mentioned as

1985.08.28)

He also referred to the police officers evidence and stated that they

did not give the date of birth as 28/08/85. The appellant argued that the

Birth Certificate marked as P2 and the National Identity Card of the victim

both state the date of birth as 28/08/85 which is different from what the

victim said.

Therefore the only issue that has to be decided is whether the date

of birth of the victim has been established by the prosecution.

2

The learned Deputy Solicitor General referred to page 78 and 44

of the brief and stated that in the National Identity Card and the Birth

Certification both carry the date of birth as 28/08/85. He also submitted

that the victim is not a literate person. On perusal of the victim's evidence

at page 44 of the brief it appears that she is not a literate person.

The certified copy of the Birth Certification of the victim has been

marked and produced by the Deputy Registrar marriages of Births and

Deaths and it has been accepted by the High Court. The counsel for the

accused has accepted P2 without any cross examination. Therefore the

appellant can not say that the date of birth has not been established.

Sec. 10 (1) of the Registration of Birth and Deaths Act no. 17 of

1951 (as amended) deals with the duty of the Registrar to Registrar births

deaths and still births. The learned High Court Judge in his judgment at

p. 111 has dealt with the age of the victim correctly. Therefore it has been

established when the sexual intercourse took place the victim has been

under 16 years of age.

I n Silva vs Silva 43 NLR 572 it is held that

lithe statements in a birth certificate offered prima lacie proolol

the lact 01 birth 01 the date 01 birth, 01 the place 01 birth ... "

Since it has been established that the victim had been under 16

years of age at the time of offence the consent is immaterial.

3

It is established law that a Birth Certificate marked and produced

by an official witness is prima facie evidence. Therefore we decide the

argument of the appellant can not be accepted.

For the afore stated reasons we decide to dismiss the appeal.

Judgment and conviction of the learned High Court Judge of Batticaloa

date 05/11/2008 is affirmed.
