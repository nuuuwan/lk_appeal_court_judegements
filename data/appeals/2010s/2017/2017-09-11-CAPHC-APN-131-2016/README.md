P Padman Surasena J

The Accused Petitioner in this case was indicted by the Hon. Attorney

General in the High Court of Balapitiya alleging that he, on or about 2007-

04-12, at Karandeniya, had committed rape of a girl below the age of 16

years, an offence punishable under section 364 (2) (e ) of the Penal Code

as amended by Act No 22 of 1995.

The Accused Petitioner, upon the charge in the indictment being read over

and explained to him, had pleaded not guilty to the charge. The trial had

then begun on 2014-02-20. Thereafter at the tail end of the said trial i.e.

on the date fixed for the learned defence counsel to make his final address

before court, the Accused Petitioner had opted to plead guilty to the

charge moving to withdraw the plea of not guilty he had earlier tendered.

Learned High Court Judge had then recorded his plea of guilt, permitting

him to withdraw his previous plea of not guilty and had proceeded to hear

learned counsel for both parties on the question of the quantum of the

sentence. Having heard the submissions learned High Court Judge had

sentenced the Accused Petitioner to a term of 08 years RI and to a fine of

Rs. 500/= along with a default sentence of 01 week imprisonment.

It is this sentence which the Accused Petitioner seeks to revise in this

application. It is his prayer in this application that the remainder of the

sentence to be served by him be converted to a suspended sentence.

Thus, the task before this court in this case is to ascertain whether there

are any grounds to allow such an application.

It is the followings which have been urged as grounds by the Accused

Petitioner in this regard;

I. that the learned High Court Judge had used evidence led against

him at the trial to decide the quantum of sentence;

II. that the learned High Court Judge had evaluated the said evidence

in his order regarding the sentence;

III. that the learned High Court Judge did not order compensation to the

victim;

IV. that the Accused Petitioner received legal advice that his sentence

would be suspended if he pays a reasonable compensation;

V. that the Accused Petitioner has two children;

It is the view of this Court that the learned High Court Judge is entitled to

take the evidence led in the case into consideration in the run up to his

decision with regard to the quantum of the sentence. He is also entitled to

evaluate such evidence as the quality of evidence would have a direct

5

bearing on his decision. Thus nothing turns out from the 1st and the 2nd

grounds above.

With regard to the 3rd and 4th grounds above all what this Court has to say

is that it is neither the accused nor his counsel who decides the sentence.

Indeed this Court time and again has frowned upon the practice of

sentence bargaining1.

The fact that the Accused Petitioner has two children is a ground common

to all the accused who have children. This Court at many occasions had

held that mere having children cannot be considered as a reason to escape

from punishment by a person who had pleaded guilty to a serious charge.

Hence the 5th ground too cannot be considered as a ground upon which

the Accused Petitioner is entitled to a suspended sentence.

When learned Deputy Solicitor General raised the issue that there are no

exceptional circumstances in this case, learned counsel for the Accused

Petitioner relied upon paragraph 29 of the petition which he stated

containing the exceptional circumstances he relied on. However learned

counsel for the Accused Petitioner conceded that those matters were not

placed before the learned High Court Judge on behalf of the Accused

Petitioner. In any case these are not grounds that could be considered for

the assessment of sentence.

In these circumstances none of the above grounds could be considered as

grounds upon which the learned High Court Judge could have acted under

section 303 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. This is so because none

of these situations constitute grounds set out in section 303 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act as amended by Act No. 47 of 1999.

Further this Court has to stress the necessity for the learned trial judges to

address the issues of public interest in deciding the appropriate sentence to

be imposed on an accused who has been convicted. It is necessary that

trial judges, when deciding the quantum of sentences must bear in mind

that the public interest in sentenCing must prevail over the welfare of the

convicted accused2

Perusal of the order made by the learned High Court Judge shows to the

satisfaction of this Court that he had carefully considered all aspects he

ought to have considered before passing the sentence. This Court cannot

find any basis to deviate from the course of action that was adopted by

him in this case.

In these circumstances this Court has no basis to interfere with the order

of the learned High Court Judge. Thus, this Court decides to refuse this

application. It should stand dismissed.

We make no order for costs.

Application is dismissed.
