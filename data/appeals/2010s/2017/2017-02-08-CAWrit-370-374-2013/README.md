JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

When these cases were taken up for argument on 2016-08-29, all the

parties agreed that the issues to be decided by this Court in respect of the

cases namely,

C A (Writ) Application No. 370/2013,

C A (Writ) Application No. 371 / 2013,

..... ----

C A (Writ) Application No. 372 / 2013,

C A (Writ) Application No. 373 / 2013,

C A (Writ) Application No. 374 / 2013,

are the same, and hence agreed that it would suffice for this Court to

pronounce one judgment in respect of all the above cases. Hence this

judgment must apply to all the cases above referred to.

Petitioners in these applications had been employees of Ceylon Transport

Board (CTB).

Ceylon Transport Board (CTB) was established under the Motor Transport

Act No. 48 of 1957 with effect from 1958-01-01.

The Transport Board Law No. 19 of 1978 repealed the said Motor

Transport Act No. 48 of 1957 and in turn established Sri Lanka Central

Transport Board (SLCTB) with effect from 1978-06-15.

Subsequently 10 regional Transport Boards were established under SLCTB.

With effect from 1990-12-28, 93 depots under the above 10 regional

Transport Boards belonging to the SLCTB were converted to peoplised

I I I I I

7

companies under the Conversion of Public Corporations or Government

Owned Business Undertakings in to Public Companies Act No. 23 of 1987.

By Act No. 37 of 1991, National Transport Commission (NTC) was

established and entrusted the task of regulating the transport services

which were being provided by the SLCTB and the peoplised companies.

The peoplised companies were converted into companies in terms of

section 2 of the Conversion of Public Corporations or Government Owned

Business Undertakings in to Public Companies Act No. 23 of 1987.

The Petitioners have retired from the respective Bus Companies upon

reaching 60 years which is the compulsory age of retirement.

The 3rd Respondent (Assistant Commissioner of Labour) had calculated the

gratuity payable to each of the Petitioners in terms of the Payment of

Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983, as amended by Act No. 41 of 1990 and Act

No. 62 of 1992 and directed the 4th Respondent (SLTB) to deposit the

respective sums of money on or before a particular date in favour of the

Petitioners.

In terms of Section 33 of the Act No: 27 of 2005 which established the Sri

Lanka Transport Board (the 4th Respondent), all assets and liabilities of the

said bus Companies were vested in the 4th Respondent and accordingly the

4th Respondent has become the body which is now liable to settle the

gratuity due to the Petitioners.

It is the complaint made by the Petitioners to this Court that the 4th

Respondent had failed and neglected to comply with the aforesaid direction

of the 3rd Respondent dated 01.05.2010 and no action was taken by the 3rd

Respondent to file the required certificate in the relevant Magistrate's

Courts against the 4th Respondent to implement the payment of gratuity

referred to above.

The Court of Appeal in an application filed by the 4th Respondent seeking a

Writ of Certiorari, has held as follows. (The Court of Appeal judgment in C

A. Writ application No. 143/2003 is produced marked P 4.

" ..... In the instant case even though the employees were given new

letters of appOintments they continued in their employment without a

break in service in the same capacity with the Petitioners after the

Petitioner's Companies were formed. Therefore at the end of the period of

I 1 I I f 1

1 I { I I

9

service of the employees the Petitioners are liable to pay gratuity for the

entire period of service of the employees after deducting the gratuity if any

was already paid. The order of the commissioner in this regard is therefore

legal and the Petitioner has not shown any ground to set aside the said

order of the Commissioner and hence the application of the Petitioner is

dismissed without cost. .... "

As the 1st Respondent has failed to take action against the 4th Respondent

to recover the gratuity due to them, the Petitioners, pray from this Court a

Mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus be issued directing the 1st

Respondent to initiate proceedings in the Magistrate's Court against the 4th

Respondent and directing the 4th Respondent to pay gratuity due to the

Petitioners.

It is the position of the Respondents that when bus depots were peoplised

in 1990, the employees of those Peoplised Deports that were converted in

to Companies were given the following benefits;

t

I I i I I I I

t I

~ 1

~ t , t I I 'l 1 I

10

(a) Two week's salary for each year of service as compensation called

peoplisation compensation although they continued in service;

(b) Two week's salary for each year of service as gratuity although

they continued in service;

(c) Shares based on the service and last salary drawn;

(d) Continuous employment with the Peoplised Companies with all

benefits and facilities they enjoyed at the SLCTB.

However it is the Respondents position that only about 50,000 employees

opted to get the above benefit, and about 4,000 employees opted out of

the Peoplisation Programme and those employees were not given any of

the above benefits. The employees who have opted out from receiving the

above benefits mainly belonged to SLCTB Head Office and the Regional

Offices.

In these Circumstances, it is the 4th Respondent's position

I. that the gratuity that is legally due to the Petitioners have already

been paid.

II. that there is no further gratuity that is due / payable to the

Petitioners by the 4th Respondent.

"-. I

11

tIII. that therefore, subsequent calculation made by the 3rd Respondent

(P2) is contrary to the provisions contained in the said Act

IV. that there is no agreement by the 4th Respondent as envisaged by

Section 10 of the Payment of Gratuity Act to pay one month's salary

for each year of service.

V. that the gratuity to retired employees should be paid from the date

of their first appOintment to the date of retirement from the

Peoplised/Cluster Bus Companies, after deducting the gratuity

already paid.

VI. that the mere fact that the Cluster Bus Companies have passed

resolutions by their respective Board of Directors to enhance the rate

of payment of gratuity from two weeks to one month per year of

completed service only in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2005, does not

legally bind the 4th Respondent to pay such amounts.

VII. If they had passed a resolution for payment of one month with

retrospective effect it would appear mala fide.

VIII. that the former Cluster Bus Company employees should be paid'

gratuity at the rate of one month per each year of completed service

on retirement from the date of peoplisation up to the date of

12

retirement and 02 weeks salary from the date of first appointment to

peoplisation on their last drawn salary, after deducting the gratuity

already paid at the time of peoplisation.

IX. in the circumstances, any gratuity which the Petitioner can claim

must be calculated on the basis that the starting point for calculation

of gratuity was 28.12.1990 and the enhanced rate could be applied

only from the effective date stated in the resolution marked 4 R 9.

X. the Petitioner when he joined the Poeoplised Company in 28.12.1990

was paid gratuity amounting to 2 weeks' salary calculated on the

basis of the salary he drew on that day per month. Therefore, the

legal Gratuity payable up to that date had been paid and accepted by

the Petitioner.

XI. when the peoplisation occurred, 2 weeks' gratuity was paid although

the employee did not retire and continued as an employee of the

Peoplised Company.

XII. The Petitioner was employed in the Ruhunu Bus Company Limited

and the Resolution of this Cluster Company was passed on 2002 10-

16 marked 4 R 9 according to which the operative date is 2002-10-

16. I tf

~I

~ fI

13

It must be observed that the Court of Appeal has not specified clearly

about the rate of payment of gratuity i.e. Whether it was 02 weeks or one

month per year of completed service.

It appears that there was no unambiguous determination made either by

the award of the 1st Respondent or in the judgment of the Court of Appeal

with regard to the rate of payment of gratuity whether it should be 02

weeks or one month salary per year of completed service. The only

IIj

ri

emphasis in the Court of Appeal judgment was that the gratuity should be

paid for the continued period from the date of first appointment to the date

of retirement.

It is necessary at this stage to see the nature of the reliefs that the

Petitioners have prayed from this Court in the instant case. They have

prayed for the following two principle reliefs.

I. a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to initiate legal

fiproceedings against the 4th Respondent.

II. a writ of Mandamus directing the 4th Respondent to pay gratuity due

to the Petitioner.

f

"

14

Petitioners have admitted the receiving a part of gratuity. They also have

admitted that the 1st and 3rd Respondents have instituted cases in the

Magistrate's Courts for the recovery of part of gratuity due to the

Petitioners.

In the light of the above admissions the Petitioners have failed to satisfy

this Court that a definite sum of money is still due to them as gratuity

according to law, payable by the 4th Respondent.

Ii (I

In these circumstances this Court is of the view that this is not a fit case in f

which this Court should exercise its discretionary writ jurisdiction against

the Respondents.

Hence all the following applications namely:

C A (Writ) Application No. 370/2013,

C A (Writ) Application No. 371 / 2013,

[

C A (Writ) Application No. 372 / 2013,

C A (Writ) Application No. 373 / 2013,

C A (Writ) Application No. 374 / 2013,

are hereby dismissed. This court makes no order for costs.

Applications dismissed without costs.
