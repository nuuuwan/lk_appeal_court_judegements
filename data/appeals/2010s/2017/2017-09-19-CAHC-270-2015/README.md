The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Chilaw under

section 364 (1) of the Penal Code for committing the offence of rape on

Velu Raja Lechchami and he was convicted for the said offence after trial

by the learned High Court Judge and was sentenced to 10 years RI with

a fine of Rs. 7,5001=. He was also ordered to pay Rs. 25,0001= as

compensation to the victim.

On the day of the incident the prosecutrix along with two others

namely Mary Matilda and Saroja has gone in search of her missing

daughter, around ten in the night while they were waiting at a bus halt

near Thoppuwa junction the appellant, who was manning a check point

has questioned the prosecutrix and the other ladies, and they were taken

2

to the check point and asked to sit on a bench. Sometime later they were

released and when they reached the bus halt the prosecutrix was asked

to come back to the check point. The prosecutrix alleged thereafter she

was raped by the appellant inside the bunker at gun point. The appellant

in his evidence had denied the allegation of rape, but had admitted the

fact that three women came near the bunker on the day in question. He

further stated that they wanted the police to stop a vehicle for them to go

to Colombo.

The learned counsel for the appellant argued that the

contradictions in the prosecutrix's evidence were not considered by the

High Court Judge which I find is not correct vide page 277 of the brief. I

observe that those contradictions have no relevance to the main incident.

The appellant's counsel further stated that the prosecution failed to

hold an identification parade. On perusal of the evidence of the

prosecutrix I find that she had ample time and opportunity to see the

appellant before the alleged incident and afterwards. Therefore there was

no necessity to hold an identification parade. It was held in Attorney

General vs Joseph Aloysius 1992 (2) SlR 264 that "An identification

parade is a means by which evidence of identify is obtained. But it is

certainly not the only means by which it could be established that a

3

witness identified accused as the person who committed the offence.

Identification can take place, depending on the circumstances even

where in the course of an investigation the witness points out the person

who committed the offence to the police. That evidence too would be

relevant and admissible subject however to any statutory provision that

may specifically exclude it at the trial."

The appellant's counsel argued that the test of probability was not

applied by the High Court Judge when evaluating the evidence. In page

286 of the brief in his judgment the learned High Court Judge has

mentioned that the said bunker had a roof and fairly high walls and if a

person lies on the floor that person could not be seen from outside.

Therefore this argument of the appellant also fails.

His Lordship Chief Justice 8asnayake expressed his opinion in

Regina vs Dharmasena 58 NLR 15 that "in a charge of rape, it is not in

law necessary that the evidence of the prosecutrix should be

corroborated." Chief Justice 8asnayake whilst considering the merits of

this case refers to two American judgments namely Ellison vs State 19

N M 428,144 pac 10 and Boddie vs State 52 Ala 395, 398. Although

corroboration is not necessary in a case of this nature as stated in the

above judgment, I find that there is corroboration in the instant case.

J , . !

On the issue of corroboration although the medical evidence does

not support her evidence prosecution witness number five namely Sumith

Abeysinghe who was on duty at the said bunker on the day in question

as stated in evidence that one out of the three women who came was

taken inside (vide page 190 of the brief) and was kept inside the bunker

for nearly two hours. This item of evidence strongly corroborates the

position of the prosecutrix.

At this stage it is pertinent to refer to section 30 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act no. 15 of 1979.

Section 30 states thus;

Ilwhenever it is necessary to cause a woman to be

searched the search shall be made by another woman

with strict regard to decency. II

Therefore the appellant can not be heard to say that he was

unaware of the said provision.

5

For the afore stated reasons I am not inclined to set aside a well

considered judgment. The judgment dated 29/10/2015 by the learned

High Court Judge of Chilaw is affirmed.

Appeal dismissed.
