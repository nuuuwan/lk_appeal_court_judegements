The Accused Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) was

indicted in the High Court of Chillaw for the offence of the murder of one W.

Michael Maximus alias Ravindra under Section 296 of the Penal Code and for

the offence of attempted murder of one Chaminda Fernando (PW2) in the

course of the same transaction, under Section 320 of the Penal Code.

The Appellant pleaded not guilty to the said charges and the prosecution led the

evidence of one M. G. Dinidu Samal Fernando (PWl), PW2 mentioned above,

W. Francis Joseph Fernando (PW4), the Judicial Medical Officer G. L.

Danapala Weerasekara (PW8),PoliceConstable M.Karunasena(PWll),

Inspector of Police U. Siripala (PW10) and Dr. Mary Margaret Fernando

(lMO) (PW9) and closed the case.

The case in brief for the prosecution is that on 21.11.2000 PW 1, PW2 and the

deceased and some others had being at PW 4' s residence when subsequently

Christy (the brother of the Appellant) and one Pradeep had come to the house of

PW4. Prima facia it may be inferred that PW4 sold alcohol and 'bites' at his

residence and as such was operating an illegal tavern patronized by the locals of

the vicinity. Allegedly, under the influence of liquor the said Christy and

Pradeep had had a verbal altercation with the deceased which resulted in PW 4

expelling these individuals from his residence.

Thereafter the deceased, PW1 and PW2 had gone to a hopper boutique in the

locality, on two bicycles. When these persons were having hoppers the said

Christy and Pradeed had come to the shop and assaulted the deceased and PW2.

PW2 retaliated with a 'Sprite' bottle which missed the said Christy who

thereafter had run away from the shop. It is important to note that the said

Christy's residence was in close proximity to this hopper boutique. At this stage

Christy's wife (sister-in-law of the Appellant) who was altered to the squabble,

had telephoned 'Oli' (a reference to the Appellant - 'Oliver') and had informed

him that his brother Christy was involved in a fight.

The Appellant who also resided in close proximity had arrived at the said

hopper boutique moments later in a white van bearing registration number 252 -

3417 and attempted to assault the said persons and thereafter, allegedly, threated I,

the deceased, PWI and PW2 saying that he will "run them over" and had

thereafter left.

The deceased had then requested to borrow the bicycle from PWI who had

agreed to lend it to him and therefore these three individuals had proceeded to

PWI 's house on the two bicycles. PWI was riding on one and PW2 on the other

with the deceased seated on the top tube of the bicycle. Whilst en route they had

noticed a van driving towards them at an excessive speed. Soon thereafter they

had recognized that it was the Appellant behind the wheel and had therefore

attempted to avoid a collision by steering to the far left of the road however the

side mirror of the van had hit PWI 's bicycle throwing him off instantly and then

had proceeded to knockdown the bicycle ridden by PW2 and the deceased.

PW2 states in evidence that the impact threw the deceased on to the windshield

of the van shattering it immediately at which point the deceased fell back on to

the road after which the Appellant had driven the van over the body of the

deceased and had driven away from the scene.

PWll, Police constable M. Karunasena who was on mobile patrol duty at the

material to the incident had stopped van driven by the Appellant which was

driven towards PWll fleeing the said collision. It was observed by PWll that

Appellant seemed tense and that the said van, with a shattered windscreen,

appeared to have met with an accident. Therefore, PW 11 had instructed the

Appellant to go to the Police Station after which the said Police Constable had

proceeded towards the scene of the incident to find the deceased and PW2

seriously injured and lying on the left side of the street where the collision had

taken place.

After the injured were attended to and finding that the Appellant had not gone to

the Police station as instructed by PWll, the Police had gone in search of the

Appellant who was found at his residence with the damaged van parked outside

of his house. PWl1 had thereafter arrested the witness around 12.45 am, a short

while after the said incident.

The Appellant responded to the narration of the prosecution by way of a

statement from the dock denying any culpability stating that he had tried to

avoid an accident which unfortunately, he was unsuccessful in doing resulting

in a collision with the bicycle(s). The Appellant stated that when he noticed

people gathering around the point of collision he had fled the scene in fear and

had rushed home and informed his family of the incident after which he had

taken the van to the Police Station and surrendered to the Police.

The learned High Court Judge thereafter by judgment dated 02.04.2015 found

the Appellant guilty of the aforementioned chargers and thereafter sentenced

him to death for the 15t charge and inter alia 10 years rigorous imprisonment for

the second charge.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment the learned Counsel for the Appellant

preferred the instant appeal by Petition of Appeal dated 08.04.2015 in which the

grounds of Appeal are stated numbered (a) to (i).

6

The crux of the instant Appeal, as submitted by the learned Counsel for the

Appellant, is whether the learned Trial Judge had erred in fact and in law by

concluding that the required mense rea / murderous intention had been

established under Section 296 of the Penal Code beyond reasonable doubt in

light of the several grounds of Appeal as submitted by him.

The required mense rea / murderous intention is found in Section 294 of the

Penal code which reads;

"Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder-

Firstly- if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention

of causing death; or

Secondly- If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as

the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom

the harm is caused ; or

Thirdly- If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any

person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the

ordinary course of nature to cause death; or

Fourthly- If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently

dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury

as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any excuse for

incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.

7

I shall now consider whether as provided for and illustrated in the penal code

the Appellant had the required mens rea when committing the actus reus which

resulted in the death of the deceased and caused serious injury to PW2. For sake

of prudence it must be noted that the actus reus in the instant Appeal is not in

dispute. If one were to shoot another with a gun after proclaiming that 'I will

shoot you' it is clear that such an act coupled with such intention after the

utterance of such words amounts to murder, as it satisfied the elements

contained in Section 294 of the Penal Code.

In the instant case the weapon used to execute the actus reus is the van bearing

registration No. 252 - 3417 belonging to the Appellant. It is alleged that the

Appellant had entered the hopper boutique mentioned above and prior to

leaving the said boutique had said, in the words of PWI "I will run down all

four of you" and in the words of PW2 that "I will run you down". The learned

Counsel for the Appellant submits that the testimony of these witnesses do not

precisely collaborate each other and that they were an afterthought which was

not mentioned in their statements to the Police. The learned DSG refers to the

case of the Indian Supreme Court Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai vs State Of

Gujarat 1983 AIR 753 1983 SCR (3) 280 in which it was held inter alia in

relation to a case of rape that;

"Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and shake the

basic version of the witnesses therefore cannot be annexed with undue

importance. More so when the all-important "probabilities- factor" echoes

in favour of the version narrated by the witnesses. The reasons are: (1)

I

1 1 I I I

8

By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video

tape is replayed on the mental screen; (2) ordinarily it so happens that a

witness is overtaken by events. The witness could not have anticipated

the occurrence which so often has an element of surprise. The mental

faculties therefore cannot be expected to be attuned to absorb the details;

(3) The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one

may notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its

image on one person's mind whereas it might go unnoticed on the part

of another; (4) By and large people cannot accurately recall a

conversation and reproduce the very words used by them or heard by

them. They can only recall the main purport of the conversation. It is

unrealistic to expect a witness to be a human tape recorder;"

As observed by the learned High Court Judge both these witnesses have not

contradicted each other when giving evidence in chief and in essence have

corroborated each other's testimony. Further the learned Trial Judge's reasons

in judgment; that the mere fact that a statement was not made to the police is

only an omission in law which cannot discredit the witness or make his

testimony untrustworthy.

As submitted by the learned DSG the learned Trial Judge has correctly held that

the circumstances in which the statement to the Police was made and the

evidence in chief was led are different.

I

This Court finds that when considering whether such an omission is fatal to the

case of the prosecution one must consider such omission in toto; with due

relevance to material elements of the evidence placed before the trial judge. In

such totality I see no merit in the Appellants contention that failing to mention

the threat by the Appellant jeopardizes the testimonial trustworthiness of the

said witnesses, this is more so in light of the fact that both the said witnesses

admitted that they failed to inform the police about the threat made by the

Appellant that he will "run them down".

Notwithstanding the threat alleged to have been proclaimed by the Appellant

what this Court must discover is the required mens rea / murderous intention on

the part of the Appellant to have murdered the Deceased and to have attempted

the murder of PW2. Did the Appellant use the weapon (the van) with the

intention of killing the deceased? If affirmative, then in the same transaction he

may be deemed to have had the required mens rea to have attempted the murder

ofPW2.

It is material to note the location in which the actus reus occurred. As

corroborated by the PWI, PW2, PWII and PWI0 the Deceased, PWI and PW2

were traveling on the left side of the road .when the collision happened and not

as contended by the Appellant i.e. that the Deceased, PW 1 and PW2 had come

on to the middle of the road. PW 10 the Police Inspector, who investigated the

scene of the collision, has given evidence that the Appellant had come on the

wrong side of the road from the opposite direction and that there were tire

marks 140ft long to the place of the collision. This Court finds this trace to be

imperative in deciding the mens rea / murderous intention of the Appellant.

." 10

A skid mark is the visible mark left by any solid which moves against another,

and is an important aspect of trace evidence analysis in forensic science and

forensic engineering. Skid marks caused by tires on roads occur when a vehicle

wheel stops rolling and slides or spins on the surface of the road. Skid marks

may be divided into "acceleration marks" created on acceleration, if the engine

provides more power than the tire can transmit; "braking marks," if the brakes

"lock up" and cause the tire to slide; or "yaw marks", if the tire slides sideways.

It is evident that the tire marks found at the scene were neither "brake marks",

since the vehicle would eventually have come to a stop and not continued for

140ft nor were they "yaw marks" considering the nature of the said marks. It

has to be "acceleration marks" left behind from a vehicle rapidly accelerating

towards a target, and in the instant collision, towards the Deceased, PW1 and

PW2.

This Court therefore finds that the Appellant possessed the required mens rea /

murderous intention to have committed the actus reus of murder and attempted

murder as charged in the indictment, as evidenced by the tire marks found at the

scene by targeting and attacking the Deceased and PW2 with the van with the

intention of causing death and / or with the intention of causing such bodily

injury as contained in Section 294 of the Penal Code.

As submitted by the learned DSG the learned Trial Judge had correctly noted

the fact that as per the evidence ofPW10, who was on the scene of the collision

moments after its occurrence, there were no signs that the Appellant had taken

I I ! I

I I

. .

11

any steps to prevent the collision and there was no evidence to suggest that the

bicycle had moved towards the van.

Further, it is submitted by the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the learned

Trial Judge had erred in Law by attaching a critical/diluted probative value to

the contents of the Dock Statement made by the Accused and consequently

rejecting it - with no consideration that it has to be regarded as "Evidence" in

the Case.

However, the evidence of PWI 0 who intercepted the Appellant after the said

collision contradicts the dock statement of the Appellant. The Appellant was

first intercepted by PWIO after fleeing the scene of the crime and then advised

to proceed to the Police Station but however, he was only later arrested at his

residence although the Appellant states that he voluntarily surrendered himself

to the Police. As such the credibility of the Appellant is greatly questioned and

therefore I concur with the findings of the learned Trial Judge who rightly

rejected the dock statement of the Appellant.

In this context and for the reasons as more fully described above this court is of

the view that the learned High Court Judge, who had the privilege to witness,

asses and understand the demeanour and level of credibility of the witnesses

giving evidence under oath, had correctly evaluated and analysed the evidence

elucidated at trial and has arrived at the finding that the Appellant is guilty

beyond reasonable doubt of the chargers contained in the indictment.
