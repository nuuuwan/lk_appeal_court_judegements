The Applicant Respondent Respondent (hereinafter sometimes called and

referred to as the Respondent) instituted action in the Magistrate Court of

Hambanthota under section 5 of the State Land (Recovery of Possession)

Act to recover possession of a block land where the Respondent

Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the

Appellant) was in occupation. The Appellant, though has raised several

grounds of appeal in the petition of appeal, his main argument presented

to this Court is that the Respondent is not a Competent Authority under

the Act and therefore the application is bad in law.

The competent authority who filed this action is the Resident Project

Manager of the Walawa Special Area. He pleads that he is the competent

authority for the Walawa Special Area under the Mahaweli Authority

Act.

Section 18 (1) of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act allows a

corporate body to authorize any officer generally or specially to be a

competent authority. The section reads thus;

18. In this Act, unless the Context otherwise requires-

"competent authority" used in relation to any land means the

Government Agent, an Additional Government Agent or an

Assistant Government Agent of the district in which the land is

situated and, includes

(I) an officer generally or specially authorized by a corporate

body, where such land is vested in or owned by or under the

control of, such corporate body.

Section 2(2) of the Mahaweli Authority Act declares that the Mahaweli

Authority is a "body corporate". The section reads thus;

1 I 1 ! 1 I I I I ! i ! t

/

2. (1) With effect from such date as may be determined by the

Minister by Notification published in the Gazette, there shall be

established an Authority called the Mahaweli Authority of Sri

Lanka (hereinafter referred to as the "Authority '').

(2) The Authority shall, by the name assigned to it by subsection (1),

be a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common

seal and may sue and be sued in its corporate name, and may

perform such acts as bodies corporate may by law perform.

Section 5(2) of the Act has made the Director General of the Mahaweli

Authority is the chief executive officer. The section reads;

5. (1) The Minister may, with the approval of the President, appoint

one of the Directors to be the Director-General of the Authority.

(2) The Director-General shall be the chief executive officer of the

Authority.

The Director General of the Mahaweli Authority has specially authorized

the present Resident Business Manager of the Walawa Special Area as

the Competent Authority for the said area to perform the duties under the

State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act by the letter dated 08.04.2015.

It is obvious that even prior to the present officer, the former officers who

held the post of Resident Business Manager of the Walawa Special Area

would have been authorized to perform the duties under the Act.

On the other hand the Appellant cannot question the contents of the

application filed under section 5 of the Act. Section 9(2) of the Act

precludes the Magistrate from calling any evidence to prove the contents

of the application. The section reads;

5

9. (2) It shall not be competent to the Magistrate's Court to callfor

any evidence from the competent authority in support of the

application under section 5.

Under these circumstances, the argument of the Appellant that the

Respondent was not a competent authority fails.

The Respondent has not presented any argument before us to establish

that he is in occupation under a valid permit or on a written authority

issued by the State under law.

Accordingly I dismiss the appeal.

I agree.
