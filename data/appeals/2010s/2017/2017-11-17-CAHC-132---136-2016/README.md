Accused-Appellants are present III Court produced by the Prison

Authorities.

Mr. Gayan Perera who is appeanng for the 4th and 5th Accused-

Appellants moves Court that he may be permitted to withdraw the appeal

of his clients namely the 4th and 5th Accused-Appellants and makes an

application under Section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code to back date

the sentence from the date of conviction.

Senior State Counsel who is appearing for the Attorney - General

informs Court that the brief is in Tamil, therefore he is waiting for the

officially translation of the brief and he submits that he cannot assist the

Court regarding the backdating the sentence. On the request of the Counsel

this Court inquired from the 4th and 5th Accused-Appellants whether they

want to withdraw the appeal. The Accused - Appellants on questioning in

Sinhala, confirms and submits to Court that they wants to withdrawal the

appeal. Considering the application of the Accused-Appellants we Act under

Section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code and allow the withdrawal of

the appeal.

Regarding the observation and the objections raised by the Senior

State Counsel, we observed that these Accused-Appellants were convicted

on 03/8/2016 and sentenced to 03 years Rigorous Imprisonment and this

brief was waiting for translations. Court is mindful of the waiting period for

the translations. Therefore, we act under Section 328 and the fact that the

Accused-Appellants were in custody from the date of conviction, we decided

to implement the sentence from the date of conviction.

We direct the Prison Authorities to implement the sentence from the

date of conviction namely 03/08/2016. Subject to the implementation of the

sentence the appeal against the 4 th and 5th Accused- Appellants are

dismissed.

Registrar is hereby directed to attend to the translations.

Mention this matter on 23/02/2018 to check the translations

regarding 1 st, 2nd and the 3rd Accused-Appellants.
