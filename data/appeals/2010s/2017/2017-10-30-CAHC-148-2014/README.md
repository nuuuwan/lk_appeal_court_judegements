Judgment s. Thurairaja PC, J

Accused appellants were originally indicted before the High Court of Kalmunai under section 354 and 364(2)(g) of the penal code. For abduction and gang rape

committed on a child who is less than 16 years of age. After the trial the accused appellants were convicted and sentenced as follows:

I. For the first count all three accused persons were sentenced to 5 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of RS. 2000, in default 3 months rigorous

imprisonment,

II. For the second count, the first accused appellant sentenced to 15 years

rigorous imprisonment, fine of RS. 5,000/- in default 6-month rigorous

imprisonment, RS 200,000/- compensation payable to the victim in default 2 years rigorous imprisonment,

III. For the third and fourth count, second and third accused appellants were

sentenced to 7 years rigorous imprisonment, fine of RS. 5,000/- in default 6

months and RS. 25,000/- compensations payable to the victim in default 1-year rigorous imprisonment.

The accused appellants preferred an appeal against the said conviction and the

sentence imposed on them by the High Court of Kalmunai.

When the appeal was taken up, the accused appellants submitted to courts through

their counsel, that they will not be contesting the conviction but the sentence.

Counsel for the appellants and the respondent made submissions.

As per the available material, it appears that the child victim was born on the 25th

May 1993 and the incident had happened on the 11 th of December 2005. At the time of the offence she was 12 V2 years old. All three accused appellants had dragged, virtually carried the victim to a house which is under construction and the 1st accused

appellant had raped her, 2nd and 3rd appellant were there. There is no evidence that these two accused persons had sexual intercourse on the victim child.

The accused appellants are not contesting the conviction therefore the finding of

guilty and conviction on the accused appellants by the learned high court judge will stand as it is. Perusing the proceedings and the judgment we find that the finding of the learned trial judge was justified and warranted by the evidence which was revealed in the trial. Therefore, we do not intend to interfere with the findings of the High Court judge.

CA 148/2014 JUDGMENT Page 2 of 4

In Sanjeewa and others V. The Attorney General 2004 BLR 65, Shirani A. Bandaranayake, J who headed a five-bench decision stated that:

A first offender should receive some kind of mitigation of sentence in

most offences but where the first offence is grave; there might be little reason to make a concession to human frailty.

Regarding the sentence imposed on the 1 st accused appellant is very reasonable and warranted by the available facts before the courts. Therefore, we do not intend to

interfere with the sentence imposed on the 1st accused appellant by the learned trial

judge.

Regarding the 2nd and the 3rd accused appellant sentence appears to be illegal as per Section 364(2)(g) the minimum sentence to be imposed is 10 years. Both the 2nd and

3rd appellant had not challenged the conviction therefore it is mandatory for the court to impose a sentence stipulated by the law.

Acting under section 328 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and considering

facts of this case we decided to impose a minimum sentence stipulated in Section

364(2)(g) of the Penal Code. Accordingly, the 2nd and 3rd accused appellant is

imposed of 10 years rigorous imprisonment, fine of Rs. 5,000/- in default 6 months

simple imprisonment and Rs. 25,000/- compensations payable to PW1 victim child in default 1-year simple imprisonment

For the purpose of clarity, the sentence is reproduced,

1st accused appellant

1st count: 5 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2,000/- in default 3 months

simple imprisonment.

2nd count: 15 years rigorous imprisonment, fine of Rs. 5,000/- in default 6 months

simple imprisonment and Rs. 200,000/- compensations payable to PW1 victim child

in default 2 years simple imprisonment.

The sentence for the 1st and 2nd count will be implemented concurrently from the date of conviction namely 4th November 2014.

2nd and 3rd Accused appellant

1st count: 5 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 2,000/- in default 3 months simple imprisonment.

3rd and 4th count: 10 years rigorous imprisonment, fine of Rs. 5,000/- in default 6 months simple imprisonment and Rs. 25,000/- compensations payable to PW1 victim child in default 1-year simple imprisonment respectively.

CA 148/2014 JUDGMENT Page 3 of 4

The sentence for the 1st, 3rd and 4th count will be implemented concurrently from the date of conviction namely 4th November 2014.

If the 1st, 2nd and 3rd accused appellants fail to pay the fine and the compensation the default sentence will be implemented consecutively.

Subject to alteration of the sentence the appeal is dismissed.
