During the course of the argument counsel for the accused appellant raised following grounds of Appeal:-

(1) Whether Learned Trial Judge considered the credibility of the particular witnesses. (2) Whether Learned Trial Judge's Judgement is contrary to the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses. (3) Whether Learned Trial Judge has failed to give reasons to reject the defence version. (4) Whether Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the custody of the documents especially P1 and P2. (5) Whether the Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that P55(marked by the prosecution) as a confessionary statement. Also submitted that piece of that evidence cannot be admitted.

The trial has commenced by calling prosecution witness No.1-Singhara Dhananjaya Silva, Audit officer, Audit officer (during the period of the time of offence). Thereafter witness No.2 Don Chandrasiri Ariyapperuma the Manager of Bank of Ceylon (during the period of the time of offence). He was one of the key witnesses who testified before the Learned High Court Judge. Thereafter few other witnesses namely Victor Wijewickrema (PW50, K.M. Dayarathna-Grama Sevaka Bowala,Gampola (PW6), Mahinda Aththanayake - Bank Officer (PW4), J.A. Ranbanda - Bank Officer (PW16), M. Senevirathne- Legal Officer, The Finance Pvt. Ltd., E.Q.D and Investigating Officer were called to give evidence on b~half of the prosecution. After the prosecution case, the accused appellant has given evidence.

The counsel for the accused appellant submitted that in order to prove charge No.3 and 5 the prosecution has to prove that the said alterations were done by the Accused Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore in the absence of that evidence, the prosecution was unable to prove charge number 3 and 5 beyond reasonable doubt.

He further submitted that the EQD Rathnavelu specifically testified that the signature in the cheque was different and that one Thilakeratne has signed the particular cheque and it was Thilakerathne's signature (who was earlier listed as a suspect in Magistrates court and discharged).

Synopsis of the Prosecution case:-

PW1 Singhara Dhananjaya Silva, audit officer had conducted an audit in response to a complaint received regarding irregularities in the Gampola Branch of Bank of Ceylon. Accordingly, he along with his team has initiated a general audit of the said branch.

3

During the course of investigation he has discovered certain irregularities mainly on the cheque collection register (Pl) and on several collections slips (Pla).

This register contains the records of the cheques pending collection of credit for 07/03/1991 from Bank of Ceylon branches ~ Gelioya, Kandy, Katugastota, Nawalapitiya, Peradeniya, Pilimathalawa and Kandy _2nd branch. It is being indicated that a total of Rs. 722,799.70 was pending collection. Out of the total sum the register indicated that Rs.569, 758.52 was to be collected from the Kandy branch.The investigation revealed that the actual amount which should have been collected from the Kandy branch was in fact Rs.519, 758.52 and therefor a sum of Rs. 50,000 less. But the corresponding collection slip (Pla) has accurately shown that the amount to be collected from the Kandy branch as RS.513, 758.52.

Witness further stated that he had familiarized himself with the handwriting of the accused having worked with him for over 3 years, during which the accused functioned as a clerk. He states that the alterations made to documents mark.ed Pl and Pla are ones made by the accused as the handwriting on the said documents belongs to him.

(Page 2510f the brief))

Similarly, during his testimony the witness had identified in court that the documents that carry signs of alterations which are submitted as evidence, all contain the handwritings and signatures of the accused.

The testimony of Don Chandrasiri Ariyapperuma ~ Branch Manager (PW2)

During the period of time in question, the witness had been employed as the Branch Manager of Bank of Ceylon, Gampola Branch. He states that during the said period of time, accused was employed as a clerk in the Cheque Clearance Division. The accused was responsible for sorting cheques received to the bank, preparing necessary documentation and then submitting them to respective banks for transfer of credit accordingly. This includes all authority regarding the handling of collection slips.

Durino- thp oeriod of time in question, an emplovee of the bank named Javac:;ino-hp has brought to his attention the existencL ~uspicious account under no. 2209. The said officer was suspicious since the handwriting on the deposit vouchers corresponding to transactions of the said accounts was familiar to him. Upon receiving the complaint, he had passed it on to the Regional Manager and the Internal Audit Department. This had led to the aforementioned investigation spear headed by PW1.

He stated that the account in question bearing no. 2209 belongs to one Manathungalage Thilakarathna. Once the investigation commenced, they had taken steps to freeze the account. Thereupon they had sent notices informing about the account being frozen to the addresses that was listed in corresponding details of the account. No responses had been made regarding the said freezing, nor had any person come forward claiming to be the owner of the account and inquiring about the issue despite the account in questing having a balance of Rs.182, 503.34.

The testimony of Victor Wijewickrama - (PW5)

When the witness went to the BOC Gampola branch on 15/04/1987, the accused had approached him requesting his aid in opening up a bank account. The accused had told PW5 that the account is being opened for his brother-in-law. The accused had further instructed the PW 5 to fill out the necessary forms (P3) in his own handwriting using his own details but with the exception of name of the intended account holder; which was to be M. Thilakarathna.

(Page 367)

He stated that a person called M. Thilakarathna (personally not known to him) came with the document marked P3, the accused had also given another document for him to sign (marked P4). This document in question usually contains the signature of person intending to open a bank account. But in this instance, both the name and signature of intended account holder was not to be seen. According to the testimony K. M. Dayarathna - Gramasevaka Bowala, Gampola (PW6) M. Thilakarathna was not a resident of his division and he has never met such a person in his official or re::-s0lLCl1 Lc1pacity.

'<!# M1nnda Aththanayake - Bank Officer (PW4Lhad been employed in Bank of Ceylon, Gampola Branch from 1991 to 1992 under the supervision of PW2. He had worked closely with the accused during the said period of time. He stated that the accused had been given the responsibility of collecting cheques deposited to the bank and other

documents that were needed for the process of obtaining funds as per the amounts mentioned in the aforementioned cheques.

When he was shown the documents lead as evidence, he had accurately identified those at ones as handled by the accused. When questioned as the probability of the said documents being altered unknown to him, he stated that the accused had sufficient opportunity to make such alterations in a manner 'that was not subjected to his supervision.

(Page 392) He further corroborated the amounts mentioned by PW1 as funds that have been received in excess through altered documents in his testimony.

The testimony of J. A. Ranbanda - Bank Officer (PW16)

Who had been employed in BOC, Gampola Branch as a cashier. He has received a cheque bearing account number 2209, dated 25/02/1991 for Rs.1000 (marked P7). The identity of the bearer of the cheque had been certified by the accused. He has identified the sign to be belonging to the accused having been familiar with the handwritings and the signature of him. He further identifies similar cheques signed by the accused on multiple times. Documents marked PI to P4, P4.1 to P5, P5.l to P5.19, P6, P6.1 to P7, P7.1, X, X-I, Y, Z, Z1, P and Q had been submitted to the N. Thangarathnaveil - Examiner of Questionable Documents by Gampola Magistrate to be examined. He has compiled a report bearing -. -- "" . , ....... / .I. / /"'.

Along with the aforementioned documents, he had been sent two samples of handwriting and signatures belonging to two suspects namely, Noel Gamini (accused) and one D. G. Thilakarathna. He had been able to conclude that some of the documents submitted as evidence contained the handwriting that are compatible with the

handwriting sample belonging to the accused. Suspect D.G.Thilakeratne was acquitted in the Magistrate Court.

Hewa Godage Chandradasa - Inspector of Police, Criminal Investigations Department, has conducted the investigation regarding the misappropriation of funds worth of 1.4 million rupees in the Gampola Branch of Bank of Ceylon. Accordingly, he has taken statements from relevant parties and initiated an investigation. He, has compiled an initial report containing specimens of hand writing of the accused and submitted to the Gampola Magistrate. The Magistrate has taken steps to submit the said specimens to be inspected further.

The testimony of M. Senevirathna, AAL - Legal Officer, The Finance (Pvt) Ltd. The witness also being a licensed Notary Public has executed a Deed of Sale bearing number 2087 in 22/0811991 (marked P20). The Vendee of the Deed is the accused. The accused had bought a land for an amount of Rs.125, 000 in Sudhuhumpola, Kandy. The transaction had been carried out once the accused makes due payments to the The Finance Ltd, whereupon the company instructs the witness to execute the Deed. A similar Deed bearing no. 2089 dated 22/08/1991 (marked P21) has been executed by the witness under similar conditions with the same parties.

Therefor it is evident that the above mentioned property was bought after the date of offence and therefore prosecution had built up a prima facie case against the accused. When the Defence was called by the Learned High Court Judge, the Accused Appellant had testified upon the documents that were marked and submitted as evidence. He admitted that they contained his handwritings.

(Page 641) He further recognized his signature that has been placed on the said document. But he denied making any alterations and stated that he had no knowledge of the person who made such alterations. He further denied having any exclusive knowledge regarding the details of bank account no. 2209.

Counsel for the Accused Appellant submitted that if the Accused Appellant failed to explain that all these documents were not under his custody, in the absence of the explanation court can presume that offence has been committed by the accused. In support of argument 1 Counsel sited the decided case Christian V s the King 46 NLR at

, <. - -page 4 where court held that court was entitled to hold in the absence of the explanation by the accused the only reasonable inference was that the accused that had made the alterations. He further stated that with regard to the judgement in this case is very ambiguous because Learned Trial Judge started in his judgement that the procedures adopted by the superior officers were merely questionable: .

It is pertinent to note that the document Pl and Pla are once made by the accused appellant, as the hand writing of the said documents .belongs to him. Other than the EQD, the accused appellant himself had admitted that fact but denied the fact that he made alterations.

When considering available evidence stated above, it is abundantly clear that the Defence was unable to shake the creditworthiness of any of the prosecution witnesses. Thus, their testimonies stand absolutely unchallenged. Further, the Defence had not been able to cast any doubt to the accuracy of the documents submitted as evidence, CiS well as the report compiled by the Examiner of Questionable Documents. Having regard to the above, it is evident that the prosecution had proven the case beyond reasonable doubt.

In the case of Dhananjothy ChatterjeeVs- State of W.B. (1994) 2 SCC 220, it was held that, "The imposition of appropriate punishment is the manner in which the Court responds to the society's cry for justice against the criminal. Justice demands that Court should impose punishment befitting the crime so that the Courts reflect public abhorrence of the crime. The court must not only keep in view the rights of the criminal but also the rights of the victim of the crime and the society at large while considering the imposition of appropriate punishment".

Sevake Peru:rr:.:! '?t~ .. _. State :: Tan:u ...... ..;. ... AIR (1991) SC 1463, held that, II Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats. It is therefore the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed etc."

Mahesh Vs State of MP (1987) 2 SCR 710, In refusing to reduce the death sentence observed that "It will be a mockery of justice to permit the accused to escape the extreme penalty of law when faced with such evidence and such cruel acts. To give the lesser punishment for the appellants would be to render the justice system of the country I suspect I. The common man will lose faith in courts. In such cases, he understands and appreciates the language of deterrence more than the reformative jargon".

The Bank of Ceylon belongs to the State and therefor the funds misappropriated by the accused belong to the State. Therefore, there is no reason to reverse the conviction or reduce the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge Even though the learned Senior ASG submitted that the suspended sentence imposed does not commensurate with the offence committed, at this juncture I do not wish to enhance the sentence since this is an appeal by the appellant. Thus we affirm the conviction and the sentence.

Hereby the Appeal is dismissed.
