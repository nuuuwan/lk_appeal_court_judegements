This is an application for mandates in the nature of writ of certiorari

and mandamus. The Petitioner seeks to quash the declaration of the 2st

and 3rd Respondents that the 8th Respondent is eligible to be registered

with a first class title of Absolute Ownership to the parcel of land and to

quash the decision of the 6th and 7th Respondents to register such title.

Further a writ of mandamus to compel the 6th and 7th Respondents delete

or to effect necessary alteration to the registration of the Title Register.

Petitioner's contention is that the finding of the Commissioner

made under the Registration of Title Act No. 21 of 1998 is factually

incorrect and the procedure adopted is bad in law. The learned DSG raised

several preliminary objections in maintainability of this application. The

learned DSG submits that the Petitioner has failed to explain delay, has

misrepresented material facts, a writ Court cannot decide factual disputes

and the Petitioner has alternative remedy of appealing against the decision

of the Commissioner to the District Court.

4

The learned DSG submitted the Gazette published by the

Commissioner declaring the title of the 8th Respondent and argue that the

Petitioner has failed to submit the said Gazette and it amounts to

misrepresentation. The Petitioner in his reply refer to certain factual

matters that he is contesting, but no proper explanation offered for not

disclosing the Gazette.

Jayaweera v. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura

and another [1996J 2 Sri L R 70

Per Jayasuriya, J.

''A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of

a Writ of Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as

a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to

relief still the Court has a discretion to deny him relief having

regard to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to

jurisdiction &#8209; are all valid impediments which stand against

the grant of relief"

Dahanayake and others v Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd and

others [2005 J 1 Sri L R 67

(i) The grievance of the petitioners arose in November 1994, when

the arrears of the enhanced cost of living allowance was paid to the

employees in service at that time. The petitioners should have

sought a writ of mandamus in 1994 and not in 2003. It is settled law

that inordinate delay in invoking the jurisdiction of the Court does

not entitle the petitioners to any relief under writ jurisdiction.

(iiJ The petitioners have not produced a copy of the arbitral award

which was made in respect of the identical claim as that which is

presently before court, more so, as that 2nd respondent

5

Commissioner General of Labour has cited and relied upon the

said award in his order. It is established that the petitioners have

previously unsuccessfully canvassed the identical issue arising in

this case in another forum.

(iii) If there is no full and truthful disclosure of all material facts,

the Court would not go into the merits of the application but will

dismiss it without further examination.

Ratnayake v. Jayasinghe 78 NLR 35

Held, The delay of one year and three months which bad mot been

satisfactorily explained by the petitioner barred the remedy. The

Court has a discretion which it could exercise to refuse the

application on the ground that there had been undue delay in

bringing the proceedings.

The said Gazette was issued in 2014 and this application was filed

in 2017. The DSG submits that the delay is not explained. Unexplained

delay is fatal to an application for a prerogative writ. It had been held by

the superior courts in several occasions as such. The Petitioner's

contention is that he was unaware of the Gazette and the wrong procedure

adopted by the Respondent led to this situation. In paragraph 45 of his

Petition he stated that the 8th Respondent entered in to the land on 1 i h

January 2016 and after inquiring, he became aware that the certificate of

title has been issued to the 8th Respondent. petitioner cannot say that he

was unaware of the Gazette because the presses in title registration in the

said area was in progress and the Petitioner has to be vigilant. In any case,

the Petitioner became aware in January 2016 that the Gazette has been

published. The petition of this application was drafted according to the

date bearing in it, was 30th December 2016 and submitted to Court on 1 i h

January 2017. One year's period has lapsed in between acquiring

6

knowledge on the publication of the Gazette and institution of this

application. There is explanation for this delay.

According to the petition, the ownership of the block of land is in

dispute. The identification is also challenged by the Petitioner. These

factual matters cannot be decided in a writ application. It has to be

decided in a proper forum where the evidence can be led because the

factual matters have to be decided on evidence.

Thajudeen V Sri Lanka Tea Board and another [1981J 2 Sri L R

471

Where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the facts

is subject to contro-versy and it is necessary that the questions

should be canvassed in a suit where parties would have ample

opportunity of examining the witnesses so that the Court would be

better able to judge which version is correct, a writ will not issue.

The Title Registration Act provides an opportunity for an aggrieved

party to appeal to the District Court. the Petitioner states that he was

unaware of the Gazette and he could not have appealed. As I pointed

above, the Petitioner should have been vigilant.

Under these circumstances, I uphold the preliminary objections and

dismiss the application without costs.

President of the Court of Appeal

Shiran Gooneratne J.

I agree.
