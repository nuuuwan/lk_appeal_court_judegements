DECIDED ON : 30/10/2017

The Accused Petitioner (here in after referred to as the Petitioner) has been

Indicted in the High Court of Chilaw for committing murder of Anthonilage

Pradeep Gamini Fernando on 21st November 2004 at Dummaladeniya, an offence

punishable under section296 of the Penal Code. The Accused Petitioner pleaded

guilty to a lesser offence. Thereafter he was convicted for Culpable Homicide not

amounting to murder under section 297 of the Penal Code. Accordingly he was

sentenced to 15 years Rigorous Imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of Rs.7500

with a default sentence of 6 months imprisonment. Learned Counsel for both

parties were heard in support of their respective positions.

At the trial the evidence of the following witnesses were led on behalf of the

prosecution :-

1. Warnakulasuriya Chaminda Roshan Ferllando

2. Jayasuriya Kuranage Danushka Shehan Perera

3. Dr. Handun Pathiranalage Wijewardena

After their evidence the accused appellant pleaded guilty to a lesser offence of

Culpable Homicide not amounting to murder under the ground of Grave and

Sudden Provocation.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment pronounced by the Learned High Court

Judge, the Petitioner has filed this application for revision in this court.

Facts of the case:-

The prosecution case was based on the evidence of two eye witnesses mentioned

above who were present at the scene of the incident.

2

According to evidence, the deceased Pradeep, Roshan, Chuti Mahattaya and

another person named Oeepal went to the sea shore at about 12.30 pm. The

accused Wasantha, Batti, Suresh and others were consuming liquor at the wadiya

and the deceased and others joined them. Thereafter the wife of the accused

came to the wadiya at about 1.30 pm and asked the accused "5akkiliya mokada

karanne r to which the deceased is alleged to have said "ehema kiyana eka

harinahanemanussaya neda?"at which point the accused had hit the deceased

with an empty bottle but it had not struck the deceased.

Thereafter, there had been an altercation after which the accused and Suresh had

left the area. After a while the accused had returned and shouted at the deceased

and stabbed the deceased. When he fell down the accused ran after Oeepal and

while running knocked on a person named Annie and fallen on the ground.

The wife of the deceased taken the deceased to the hospital but the deceased had

succumbed to his injuries. The contention of the learned counsel is that there is a

strong possibility that something would have happened which provoked the

accused to act in the manner he did. He further submitted that there was no

animosity between the accused and the deceased. Also it was mentioned that the

accused is repenting for his action and he was convicted after a long delay.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitting Ananda Vs AG (1995) 2SLR 315, AG

Vs Oevapriya and another (1990) 2 SLR 212, Liyana Mendis Gunadasa and two

others Vs AG (CA 141/2006) decided on 20/06/2014 contended that it is settled

law that even a deserving sentence made after a considerable period of time

should not be imposed at a later stage.

The Learned Counsel for the Respondent has taken up following preliminary

objections:-

1. The Petitioner although had a right of appeal which is a statutory right

without exercising same has sought to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction.

2. The order of the Learned High Court Judge is not irregular illegal or

capricious.

In this present case the accused had pleaded guilty to Culpable Homicide not

amounting to murder under Grave and Sudden Provocation, which proves from

3

evidence. The evidence of two eye witnesses demonstrates how the altercation commenced at the time they were consuming liquor together. The deceased had interfered with the dialogue between husband (the Accused appellant) and wife because of their friend ship. Unfortunately that had resulted for the killing.

The evidence of the JMO reveals that there were three superficial injuries other than the fatal injury.

Considering above, we bring down the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge from 15 years to 10 years RI.

Revision Application is hereby allowed.
