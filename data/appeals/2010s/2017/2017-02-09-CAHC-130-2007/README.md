The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) was

indicted in the High-Court of Batticaloa under section 296 of the Penal

Code for the murder of a person named Kanapathipillai Sandanampillai

and after trial was convicted and sentenced to death.

The story of the prosecution is that on 27.05.2003, there had been an

argument between the fourth witness's sister and her husband. The

Appellant who was living close by (having consumed alcohol) had

attacked the deceased with an iron bar when the deceased was inside the

toilet. The deceased succumbed to her injuries subsequently.

The grounds of Appeal urged by the Appellant is that the Learned High

Court Judge erred in Law by failing to consider the available evidence

favourable to the Appellant and has failed to consider that the Appellant

is entitled for lesser culpability on the basis of voluntary intoxication.

The Appellant's Counsel submitted that the evidence placed before the

court suggests that the Appellant was intoxicated at the time of the

incident- and further submitted that prosecution witness noA has stated

in his evidence that the Appellant was drunk and behaved in an angry

manner. Prosecution Witness Sathasivam says that the Appellant had

consumed alcohol and he was quiet.

Sathasivam goes on to say that the Appellant kept the iron bar and asked

the witness to call the sister. After this, the witness had walked some

distance; his sister raised cries to the effect that the Appellant was

assaulting the mother.

Kanapathi Pillai Y ogeswari whose evidence was adopted under section

33 of the Evidence Ordinance has stated in her evidence that the

Appellant drank everyday and assaulted people. When the Appellant

assaulted people, she used to settle disputes; but on the day in question

she has not gone near the Appellant as he had been behaving senselessly.

What this witness says is that on previous occasions the Appellant did

not pick up quarrels with her but on the day in question when she asked

the Appellant to not to assault the deceased, the Appellant assaulted the

witness after uttering the words "What are you speaking?"

On a careful perusal of the evidence of the above witnesses, this court

cannot conclude that the Appellant was intoxicated at the time of the

attack.

The fact that the Appellant asked Sathasivam to call his sister indicates

that the Appellant had the ability to identify a specific person before the

assault took place.

Moreover, three persons namely Sathasivam, Yogeswari and the

deceased were present at the scene of the crime and according to the

evidence, the Appellant has selected the feeblest person who was eighty

years of age to deal with the blows.

The medical evidence proves that the deceased had sustained head

injuries and Sathasivam had seen the Appellant directing the blows at

the head of the deceased.

This clearly establishes the murderous intention of the Appellant.

It was held in Rathnayake Vs The Queen 73 NLR 481 that "For the

purpose of Section 79 of the Penal Code the state of intoxication in

which a person should be is one in which he is incapable of forming a

murderous intention; and whether he has reached that stage of

intoxication or not, is a question of fact for the jury to determine

depending on the evidence in each case; and it is for the person who

raises the plea of drunkenness to establish on a balance of probability

that he had reached the state of intoxication in which he could not have

formed a murderous intention."

In King V s Velauden 48 NLR 409 it was held "When in a case of

murder the defense of drunkenness is put forward, the burden is on the

accused to prove that by reason of intoxication there was an incapacity

to form the intention necessary to commit the crime."

Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance provides thus" When a person is

accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of

circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in

the Penal Code or within any special exception or proviso contained in

any other part of the same code, or in any law defining the office, is

upon him, and the Court should presume the absence of such

circumstances. "

After considering the evidence placed before the High Court and the

above decisions, this court is of the view that the Appellant had not

reached the stage of intoxication at the time of the attack. Therefore, this

court is not inclined to agree with the argument advanced by the Counsel

for the Appellant.

For the foregoing reasons, this court moves to dismiss the Appeal.
