The Accused Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) was

indicted in the High Court of Colombo for the offence of the possessing a 3

grams of heroin and for trafficking of same. Upon the conclusion of the trial the

Appellant was convicted on both counts and sentenced to life imprisonment.

The prosecution led the evidence of IP G. Ariruwan (PWl), IP N. Rangajeewa

(PW2), Government Analyst K.P. Sivaraj (PW13), IP A. Jayamana (PW3)

The case for the Prosecution in brief was that on 24.06.2003 PW2 had received

information that a person by the name of Suclesh was selling heroine in front of

the house of one Irene at 'Garagewatte' in the Thotalanga area. Thereafter, PW2

together with PWI and 6 other police constables had conducted a raid to arrest

this person and left the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) at 2225 hours and

3

reached the area and halted at a Race-by-Race centre on top of the road in

question. Then both PW 1 & PW2 had proceeded on foot towards the house of

the said Irene and they both testified that they saw the Appellant standing close

to a dog cage in front of the said house. PW 1 had introduced himself and

inquired from the Appellant who he was and the Appellant had answered that he

as 'Sanjaya'. Thereafter the Appellant's shirt and trouser pocket was searched

but since nothing illegal was found. PWI and PW2 had taken the Appellant near

a wall of the said house and searched further. They had then detected a bag

hidden in the underwear of the Appellant with about 200 pieces of metal foils

all of which contained heroine. Thereafter the Appellant was arrested and taken

to his home in Singharamulla in Kelaniya. This search however did not reveal

anything. The Appellant was then taken to the PNB where the testing, weighing

and sealing was done. It was stated in evidence that the sealed articles were

handed over to the production officer PW3 only on the following day since it

the raid was conducted late in the night.

The Appellant proceeded to make a statement from the dock denying the

charges levelled against him and stated that on the day in question he had gone

to the area to collect certain leaves from one Kusumawathie whose home was

near the said Irene's house. These leaves were allegedly required for the

treatment of his father who had been suffering from paralysis. The Appellant

states that around 6.30 - 7.00 pm as he was climbing the steps leading to the

said Kusumawathie's house and officer had taken him into the house and

assaulted him inquiring about drugs. The said officers had not believed the

reason given by the Appellant as to why he was present at that location and had

told the Appellant that he had come to buy drugs. They had then put him into

the Jeep and asked him whether the drugs belonged to one Bandu. They had

4

taken him around and taken him finally to head office and introduced heroine to

his person.

The Counsel for the Accused Appellant raised 3 grounds of Appeal. Namely;

1. Whether the learned Trial Judge had adequately considered the

discrepancies of the evidence of the main prosecution witness.

2. Whether the learned Trial Judge had adequately considered the

probability of the raid.

3. Whether the learned Trial Judge misdirected himself in evaluating the

dock statement.

On the first ground of Appeal the learned Counsel for the Appellant has pointed

out 4 discrepancies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. That;

a) PWI and PW2 are at variance with regard to the crowd in the vicinity of

the raid,

b) PWI and PW2 are at variance as to the moment they first witnessed the

Appellant,

c) PWI and P\V2 are at variance as to where the Appellant was searched,

d) PWI and PW2 have given different accounts about the time at which they

reached PNB.

This Court finds that the first three discrepancies highlighted by the learned

Counsel for the Appellant are minor in nature as a witness cannot be expected to

recall every detail of an incident with photographic precision and the said

discrepancies may be assumed to be minor variations in the interpretations of

5

events and / or the way in which one narrates the version of events as they

unfold. The forth discrepancy however, warrants careful scrutiny of this Court.

As per PWl once the arrest was made the Appellant was broughtto the PNB

around lAO a.m. the following day i.e. 25.06.2006 (vide page 49 of the appeal

brief) He specifically states that it was lAO in the morning. As per PW2 they

had returned at about 4.00am. (vide page III of the appeal brief) This was

stated by the said witnesses in evidence in chief. The learned Counsel submits

on behalf of the State that the said discrepancy was due to a typographical error

which is evident since a similar error had been made when PW2 was asked in

cross examination about the time at which they returned to PNB it had been

recorded as llAO ( vide page 143) and not as lAO.

The learned Counsel further submits on behalf of the State that the time of

arrival is not a serious contradiction since the defence had not questioned the

prosecution witness at length on same. However, when considering this

discrepancy with the other discrepancy highlighted by the learned Counsel for

the Appellant it seems to be of more concern.

According to the evidence of the prosecution they had gone to the area from

which they arrested the Appellant and then proceeded to the residence of the

Appellant in the Sinharamulla Kelaniya area and returned to the PNB. As per

PWl the running meter of the vehicle used in the raid indicates that they had

travelled for about 60 k.m in the night in question. However, when questioned,

PvV2 denies having travelled such a distance and it is apparent that PW 1 has

given vague answers about the distance travelled.

6

The learned Trial Judge has addressed his mind to this variation in the nanative

but had concluded that there is room for a driver of a vehicle to indicate a higher

millage to save fuel for personal use and as such the distance of 60 km allegedly

travelled to conduct the raid does not challenge whether the raid was actually

conducted. This assumption however, is not based on evidence led during the

trial and as such is an enoneous assumption made by the learned Trial Judge to

the detriment of the Appellant.

This Court therefore, cannot hold with the leaned Trial Judge as both these

discrepancies when taken together i.e. the time of aniving at PNB and the

distance that the Officers have travelled on the raid raise a doubt in the version

of the prosecutions of the events that unfolded on the night in question. The

benefit of which must accrue in favour of the accused.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant raises another point which reqUIres

serious consideration. After the Appellant was taken to the PNB and after the

weighing of the seized substance was concluded the said productions were

sealed using the seal of IP Paul who was not a member of the party which

conducted the raid. When questioned, PW1 states in evidence that he did so

since his personal seal was sent for repairs and since IP Paul was at the PNB

office at the time. When questioned why IP Paul's seal was used PW2 has

stated in evidence that the question should be put to PW 1. PW2 states further

that he was never requested to place his seal on the production although he

possessed his personal seal.

In the case of Perera vs. AG 1998 (I) SLR 378 it was held inter alia in realtion

to productions that "the most important journey is the inwards journey because

the final Analyst Report will depend on that." III a case in vvhich charges have

7

been preferred under the prOVISIOns of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Act, No. 13 of 1984 and especially where the Appellant argues that the

substance in question had been subsequently introduced to the Appellant it is

fundamental that the chain of production be established beyond reasonable

doubt. The purpose of sealing a production and the procedure insisted upon by

Court to re-seal a production after it has been produced in evidence stresses on

the importance of preserving the item of evidence through the trial process in a

manner in which it cannot be tampered with. It is only after the trial process that

an item of evidence maybe dispensed with. In this case it seems that from the

inception an officer who was not part of the team which conducted the raid had

been used to seal the said production raising a serious doubt. This seems to be a

highly irregular practice which cannot be acknowledged as good procedure as it

may lead to an abuse of the process. The fact that the said IP Paul was not called

to give evidence is seen as a lapse on the part of the prosecution in proving the

chain of production also in proving the case beyond reasonable doubt.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant submits the case of Sinnaiya Kalidasa

Vs. The Hon . Attorney General CA 128/2005 BASL Criminal Law 2010 Vol.

III page 31 in which Ranjith Silva J quotes E.S.R. Coomaraswamy in the Law

of Evidence Volume 2 Book 1 at page 395 dealing with how police evidence in

bribery cases should be considered;

" In the great many cases, the police are, as a rule unreliable witnesses. It

is all ways in their interests to secure a conviction in the hope of getting a

reward. Such evidence ought, therefore, to be received with great caution

and should be closely scrutinized."

Ranjith Silva J states;

8

"By the same token the same principles should apply and guide the

judges in the assessment of the evidence of excise officers in narcotic

cases. Judges must not rely on a non -existent presumption of

truthfulness and regularity as regards the evidence of such trained Police

or excise officers."

Further, as contended by the learned Counsel f(Jr the Appellant it seems that the

learned Trial Judge has misdirected himself in evaluating the dock statement. In

his dock statement the Appellant has referred to an incident which has taken

place on the 24th of July 2003 when in fact the raid had taken place on the 24th

of June 2003. The learned Trial Judge has arrived at the conclusion that the

incident referred to by the Appellant is not related to the raid in question and

therefore has rejected the said statement. The learned Counsel for the Appellant

submits that this is most probably due to a typographical error since in

Sinhalese the pronunciation for 'June' and 'July' are similar. He fUliher

contends th3t the Appellant was in remand in J LIly after been arrested in June

and as such the Appellant was no doubt referring to the raid in question.

The learned Counsel on behalf of the State submits that 'one cannot come to a

conclusion that the date had been recorded by mistake' since the Defence

Counsel had not rectified the said typographical error when the proceedings

were cQlTected. However, the learned Counsel on behalf of the State heavily

relies on a purported admission made by the Appellant in his dock statement in

which the Appellant states that the "police asked me if the drugs were Bandu's".

The learned Counsel on behalf of the State submits that this tantamount to an

admission as the said question could only be asked after recovering the

contraband from the Appellant.

9

However, it seems that the learned Trial Judge has rejected the Dock Statement

on the basis that it relates to a separate incident. This Court finds that such a

conclusion is unsubstantiated and a wrong finding of fact especially since the

Appellant was giving his version of the incident he has been charged with and

also since the Appellant could not have referred to any other incident other than

the raid in question.

In light of the circumstances discussed above this Court finds that the

prosecution has failed to prove the charges against the Appellant beyond

reasonable doubt and as such the impugned Judgment of the learned Trial Judge

dated 17.09.2009 is hereby set aside and the Appellant is acquitted from the

chargers levelled against him.
