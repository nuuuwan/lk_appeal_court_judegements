2Sth June, 2016

Sth March, 2017

The Petitioners to this Application have sought an order for Writ of Certiorari to quash two orders made by the 1sdt Respondent dated OS.01.2011 and IS.02.2010 produced and marked Pl1 and P12 respectively.

The 1st Respondent has ordered the Petitioners to pay compensation to the 6th to 193rd Respondents under section 6 of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No 4S pf 1971 (hereinafter referred to as the said Act) as amended.

Admittedly the 3rd and the 4th Respondents were appointed as liquidators by the Commercial High Court in the case bearing No. CHC 6/200S/Co to wind-up the Sth Respondent Company, where the 1st and the 2nd

Petitioners had been Directors.

During the pendency of the winding-up process. The 6th to 193rd

Respondent had complained to the 1st Respondent under and in terms of

Page 2 of 5 IJ I

the said Act, alleging that their services have been terminated contrary to the provisions of the said Act.

Accordingly, two cases bearing Nos TEU/N57/2007 and TEU/C/31/2008 have been filed against the Petitioner by the 1st

Respondent. The representative of the Petitioners has informed the 2nd

Respondent who conducted the inquiry, that a provisional liquidator has been appointed by the Commercial High Court of Colombo.

On receipt of such representation, the 2nd Respondent had proceeded with the inquiry under and in terms of Section 12(2) of the said Act and made orders produced and marked as P11 and P12.

Section 12(2) of the said Act provides that,

"The Commissioner shall, for the purpose of any inquiry under this Act have all the powers of the District Court-

a) To summon and compel the attendance of witnesses; b) To compel the production of witnesses; and c) To administer any oath or affirmation to the witnesses.

At this stage, it is pertinent to refer to section 279 of the Companies Act which provides that,

"When a winding-up order has been made or a provisional liquidator has been appointed, subject to the provision of subsection (2), no action or proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company except by the leave of the Court and subject to such terms as court may impose."

It was held in East West Research & Design (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Weerakoon Commissioner of Labour 1993 1 SLR 191 that the bar

imposed by section 264 can only be removed by the Court before which the winding-up is pending.

This court is of the view that the "inquiry" held by the 2nd Respondent will not fall within the ambit of "proceeding or action" contemplated by section 279(1) of the Companies Act as the institution headed by the 1st

Respondent is not established by Law for the administration of justice.

Moreover, the 2nd Respondent has not filed proceedings in the Magistrate's Court to implement the orders contained in P 11 and P 12 under section 6A(2) of the said Act.

This court holds that the orders contained in Pll and P12 are not illegal orders as they were made after holding an inquiry as evidenced by the documents produced and marked lRl to lR7.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court refuses to issue the mandate sought by the Petitioners.

Accordingly, the Application of the Petitioners stands dismissed with cost fixed at Rs. 50,000/-.
