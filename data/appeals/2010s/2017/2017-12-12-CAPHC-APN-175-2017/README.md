The Petitioners seek to challenge in this proceeding, the said order of the

Provincial High Court delivered in the year 2014

The Petitioners have also filed an appeal against the impugned order. This

court has assigned a number to the said appeal. That number is CA (PHC)

148/2014.1 The Petitioners have paid brief fees also. Thus, that appeal is

only to be listed shortly for argument. This position is reflected from the

documents produced ,Marked PI Nand PI M 2. Admittedly the Petitioner

has filed this application only to obtain a stay order to halt the proceedings

in the Magistrate's Court.

It is the order dated 2017-10-17, made by the learned Magistrate of Mount

Lavinia produced Marked P2 which had prompted the Petitioners to file this

application despite the fact that the appeal regarding the same issue is to

be listed for argument shortly.

When there is a right of appeal provided for by law, an applicant in a

revision application must show the existence of exceptional circumstances

for any intervention by a revisionary Court. Perusal of the Petition shows

that the grounds urged therein cannot be accepted as exceptional

circumstances.

Further, this court is of the opinion that the mere facing the trial in the

Magistrate's Court cannot cause any prejudice to the Petitioners.

In these circumstances, this Court has no basis to issue notices on the

Respondents.

Therefore, this Court decides to dismiss this application without costs.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
