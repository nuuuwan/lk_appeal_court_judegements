S. DEVIKA DE LlVERA TENNEKOON, J .

The Plaintiff - Appellant abovenamed (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Plaintiff) instituted action in the District Court of Kegalle seeking to partition

the land as morefully described in the schedule to the Plaint dated 09.11.1979.

The Plaintiff took up the position that the original owner of the corpus was one

Hindha and after his demise the land devolved on to one named Kirihamy.

Thereafter by virtue of deed bearing No. 15324 dated 02.05.1903 marked as PI

the said land was allegedly transferred to one Balindha. After Balindha's demise

the Plaintiff contends that his next of kin i.e. son Jothiya and daughter Rankiri

became co -owners of the said land. Thereafter the said Rankiri alias

Ukkuamma had transferred 1I4th share of the corpus to one Sirisoma by deed of

transfer bearing No. 22563 marked as P2. Upon the demise of the said

Ukkuamma, the said Sirisoma being her son became entitled to Y2 share of the

corpus. Consequently the said Sirisoma had transferred 1I3rd of his share i.e.

1I6th of the corpus to the aforementioned Jothiya by virtue of deed bearing No.

287 marked as P3. Thereafter the said Jothiya had allegedly transferred the said

land to the Plaintiff by deed No. 860 marked as P4.

The 6th and 7th Defendant-Respondents (hereinafter collectively referred to as

the 6th and 7th Defendants) filed their statement of claim dated 28.10.1982 and

admitted the chain of tittle to the corpus only up to the devolution to the said

Balindha but contended that the sole heir of the said Balindha was one named

Wadagammana Pallehagedara Sirimala alia Kira who became entitled to the

corpus upon the demise of the said Balindha after which the said Kira

transferred the corpus to the 7th Defendant by deed bearing No. 4249 dated

18.11.1959 and thereafter transferred the remaining Yz share to the Plaintiff by

deed No. 8416 dated 26.06.1976.

It was the position of the 6th and 7th Defendants that the 6th Defendant planted

all the trees on the corpus and it was the 6th Defendant who constructed the

buildings found therein and possessed the land for over 50 years.

The trial commenced on 17.08.1988 and two admissions were recorded by the

parties and 6 issues were recorded by the Plaintiff and 5 issues were raised by

the 6th and 7th Defendants. In support of the contention of the Plaintiff the

Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant gave evidence and marked documents PI - P4.

The 7th Defendant gave evidence in Court on his behalf and marked documents

7Vl - 7V4. The 6th Defendant passed away during pendency of the Defendants

case.

Upon the conclusion of the trial the learned District Court Judge delivered

judgment on 03.02.1999 in favour of the 6th and 7th Defendants and ruled that

they were entitled to the corpus on the ground of prescription.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment the Plaintiff preferred the instant appeal

inter alia on the following grounds;

a) As per deeds marked P2 & P4 the said Balindha had two children named

Jothiya and Ukkuamma,

b) According to the evidence of one William in case bearing No. 214281P

marked as P5 the said Balinda had two children.

c) According to the evidence of one Allisa in case bearing No. 3588/P

marked as P6 the said Balinda had two children,

d) The birth certificate of the said Wadagammana Pallehagedara Sirimala

marked as 7V3 is a forged document,

e) No evidence of prescription in favour of the 6th and i h Defendants.

5

This Court must first consider whether the evidence presented during trial

establishes that the aforementioned Jothiya and Ukkuamma were children of the

said Balindha or ifBaindha's sole heir was the said Kira.

The Plaintiff relies on cases bearing No. 214281P and No. 3588/P in which

allegedly Balindha's rights and entitlements over the corpus in the said cases

were devolved on to Jothiya and Ukkuamma as next of kin. Having perused

documents marked P5, P8, P6 and P7 relating to the above cases this Court

agrees with the findings of the learned District Court Judge that the said

evidence is not sufficient to establish that the said Jothiya and Ukkuamma as the

next of kin of Balindha. It is prudent to point out that the Plaintiff has even

failed to produce the caption in case bearing No. 21428/P to correctly evaluate

its evidential value. The burden of proving the paternity is on the Plaintiff and

where the Plaintiff has failed to produce sufficient evidence in support of his

contention, this Court is unable to decide in his favour. It is clear that the

Gannoruwe Kadegedara Nonis, the son of the original Plaintiff, is not aware of

his lineage, which matter is in dispute in the instant case. When questioned on

his ancestry the said Nonis had answered that he came to know that Jothiya and

Ukkuamma were the children of Balindha after having discovered the

aforementioned case records P5, P8, P6 and P7. It is clear that even the 2nd

Defendant who gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff is not aware of the

descent and as such the contention of the Plaintiff is uncorroborated with cogent

evidence.

The position that the birth certificate marked as 7V3 is a forged document is

first been suggested at this stage in appeal. Attention is drawn to page 162 of the

Appeal brief which notes that the documents marked as 7V1 - 7V 4 were duly

proved and marked as evidence at trial.

In the case of Sri Lanka Ports Authority and another V. Jugolinija-Boal East

1981 (1) SLR 18 in which it was decreed that;

"if no objection is taken, when at the close of a case documents are read

in evidence, they are evidence for all purposes of the law. This is the

curses curiae of the original civil courts."

Similarly in the recent case of S amarako on V. Gunasekera and another 2011 (1)

SLR 149 in which Amaratunga , 1. held inter alia that;

"When a document is admitted subject to proof, the party tendering it in

evidence is obliged to formally prove it by calling the evidence necessary

to prove the document according to law. If such evidence is not called

and if no objection is taken to the document it is read in evidence at the

time of closing the case of the party who tendered the document it

becomes evidence in the case.

On the other hand if the document is objected to at the time when it is

read in evidence before closing the case of the party who tendered the

document in evidence, the document cannot be used as evidence for the

party tendering it."

Considering the above findings this Court finds that the document marked as

"7V3" has been duly proved at the trail since no objection was raised as to its

admissibility at the closing of the Defendant's case.

This Court is therefore of the view that the Plaintiff has failed to establish with

certainty the parentage of the said Jothiya and Ukkuamma and as such this

Court holds with the Defendant that the said Kira was the sole heir of the one

named Balindha aforementioned, especially in light of deeds marked as 7Vl

and 7V2 dated 1959.11.18 and 1976.06.26. As far back as 1959 the 7th

7

Defendant, and her predecessor in title, the said Kira, was seized and possessed

of the corpus.

I shall now consider if the Defendants are entitled to the corpus on the basis of

prescription. The Plaintiff admits that the 6th Defendant and the 6a Defendant

were resident on the corpus for 28 years from around 1969/1970. The Plaintiff

however, alleges that this was under the leave and licence of the aforementioned

Jothiya.

The Plaintiff further admits that the 6th Defendant and the 6a Defendants were

present on the land when the same was being surveyed in 1981. The surveyors

report marked as X has noted that the buildings marked as a, b, c, & d on the

corpus belonged to the 6th Defendant. It is evident that the Plaintiff has not

produced any evidence of an adverse claim against the rights of the 6th and 7th

Defendants. As correctly evaluated by the learned District Court Judge the

witnesses who gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff seem to not have much

knowledge relating to the corpus.

Therefore this Court is of the view that the learned District Court Judge has

arrived at the correct findings by judgment dated 03.02.1999.

F or the reasons morefully described above the Appeal is dismissed without

costs.

Appeal dismissed.
