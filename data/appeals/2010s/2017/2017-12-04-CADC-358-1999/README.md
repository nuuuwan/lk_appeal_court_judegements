The Plaintiff - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted

action in the District Court of Puttalam by Plaint dated 06.02.1985 against the

Defendant - Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Defendants) for inter.

alia a declaration that the premises described in the Schedule A to the Plaint

belongs absolutely to the 15t Plaintiff and a declaration that the premises

described in the Schedule B to the Plaint belongs absolutely to the 2nd Plaintiff.

The Defendants filed Answer dated 03.05.1985 and sought for a dismissal of the

.-Plaint and further that the Defendants be entitled to right of way as it exists

now.

When the instant Appeal came up for argument the Defendants raised

preliminary objections as follows;

a) No Plaint has been filed by the Plaintiffs - Appellants in the official

language of the Court.

b) The Plaintiffs have failed to close their case reading III evidence the

documents they marked and relied on for their case.

Upon a perusal of the Appeal brief it is clear that there is no Plaint filed in

Sinhala. As per Article 24( 1) of the Constitution;

"Sinhala and Tamil shall be the languages of the courts throughout Sri

Lanka and Sinhala shall be used as the language of the court situated in

all the areas of Sri Lanka except those in any area where Tamil is the

language of administration. The record and proceedings shall be in the

language of the court. In the event of an appeal from any court records

shall also be prepared in the language of the court hearing the appeal, if

the language of such court is other than the language used by the court

from which the appeal is preferred."

The Counsel for the Defendants submits that therefore there is no valid Plaint

before Court upon which the 'Court can act and proceedings commence.'

However, it is evident that the English Plaint dated 06'.02.1985 (vide page 440f

the appeal brief) has been answered by the Defendants by Answer dated

03.05.1985 (vide page 358 of the appeal brief) which is also in English.

On a perusal of the Journal Entries it is further evident that the English Plaint

dated 06.02.1985 has been accepted not only by the defendants but also by

Court and Court has proceeded with the case. On 10.03. 1987 the case has been

taken up for trial and the issues and admissions of the parties have been

recorded in Sinhalese, and the language of the Court and record has been

maintained in conformity to Article 24(1) of the Constitution mentioned above.

Therefore the question this Court has to now consider is whether the filing of an

English Plaint invalidates the entire Court process. The English plaiI1t has been

filed in ] 985 which is 32 years prior to this objection been raised on behalf of

the Defendants.

Up until then, the Defendants have accepted and answered the averments

contained in English in the Plaint and the learned District Judge has commenced

and continued with trial and thereafter delivered judgement dismissing the

application of the Plaintiffs. It is also clear that no prejudice has been caused to

the Defendants by reason of the Plaint been in English, this is so because the

Answer of the Defendants was filed in English.

To reject the Plaint at this stage would be to invalidate the whole Court process

owing to a technicality by which no prejudice has been caused. As such the

Defendants objection regarding the maintainability of this action is overruled.

The second objection raised by the Defendants relates to matters that ought to

be considered when the main matter is taken up for argument.

Therefore, the preliminary objections of the Defendants are overruled and this

matter may be fixed for argument on its merits.

Objection overruled.
