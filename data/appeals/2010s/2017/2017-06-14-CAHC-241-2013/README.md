DECIDED ON 9th June 2017

K. K. WICKRAMASINGHE, J.

The Accused Respondent (herein after referred to as the Accused) was indicted in the High

Court of Ratnapura on the following charge:-

On or between 1st of January 2004 to 24th May 2004 in Palawela, Udaniriella, within the

jurisdiction of this court the accused committed rape on one Yamanthalage Chaturika

Madushani who was under the age of 16 years an offence punishable under section 364 (2)(e)

of the Penal Code as amended by Act No.22 of 1995.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, complainant appellant preferred the

instant appeal to this court on inadequacy and the illegality of the sentence.

The indictment was read over to the Accused Respondent and the trial was commenced before

the high court judge. The evidence of the victim Cahturika Madushani commenced on

23/10/2013. The indictment was amended to read under section 365 B of the Penal Code as

amended by the learned state counsel with permission of court before the examination in chief

2

was concluded. The accused pleaded guilty to the amended indictment. There after the learned

high court Judge of Ratnapura found the appellant guilty of the amended charge levelled

against him. Accordingly, on 26th October 2013, accused accused was convicted and sentenced

to a term of 10 months rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 500.00 with a default sentence

of 1week period of imprisonment. Furthermore compensation amounting to Rs. 50,000 was

ordered to be paid to the prosecutrix (victim) and as default ordered it to be recovered as a

fine. If that is -also defaulted then another period of 1 year period of imprisonment was

imposed.

Counsel for the accused respondent contended that the petition of appeal is filed out of time.

Section 321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure act No.1S of 1979 stipulates that the appeal

must prefer within 14 days of the Judgement. Further states that the day on which the

judgement was pronounced shall be included, but all public holidays shall be excluded. When

perusing the official calendar it is evident that 24th of October happened to be a public holiday.

As per section 2 of the Holidays Act No. 29 of 1971, every Sunday is considered to be a public

holiday. According to section 3(a) of the said act, the days specified in the first schedule are also

considered as Public Holidays. Accordingly Deepawali Festival day has been declared to be a

public holiday. Since 2nd November 2013 had been declared as the day of Deepawali Festival,

that date and Sundays should be excluded. The 14th day of the period was fallen on the 9th of

November which was a Stlturday.

According to section 321{2} of the Code of Criminal Procedure act No.1S of 1979 states that "If the time for preferring petition of oppeal expires on a day on which the office of the count is closed the appeal shall be deemed in time if such petition be preferred on the first day next thereafter on which such office is open"

Therefore, 9th November being a Saturday the appeal had been lodged on the first working day

11th November 2013. Page 161 of the high court brief reveals that in fact the state counsel had

filed this appeal and the registrar also had date stamped the same. Thus it is abundantly clear

that the instant appeal has filed well within the time period of 14 days.

Facts of the case:-

The prosecutrix(victim) was living with her grandmother, which was at the close vicinity of the .. house of the accused. The accused was 62 years of age with 5 children who were elder to the

victim. He was the younger brother of the victim's maternal grandfather. During the period of

the incident, the victim used to visit the house of the accused at any time of the day even alone.

The accused also used to visit her. The accused and his wife used to send the (prosecutrix)

victim to the boutique when needed. On the day of the incident, the accused appellant had

3

l

called the victim to his house informing that he wanted to send her to the boutique. When she

went, she was taken to the kitchen and the accused had asked her to lean against "Mirisgala"

and molested her.

The parents of the victim were not living with her and the accused was living close vicinity.

Since the accused was her grandfather's brother whom she used to trust she use to visit his

house frequently. At the time the accused got down the victim to his house, the other inmates

of the house were not available and therefore there was no body to rescue her.

Before giving evidence the victim had cried before the trial judge and the trial judge had ample

opportunity to observe the witness and thereby to understand the mental trauma she had

undergone. It was revealed that she had to change her residence after the incident.

As grounds of appeal the learned Senior DSG contended that the sentence imposed by the

learned high court judge is highly inadequate and does not commensurate with the gravity of

the offence as the learned trial judge had failed to consider the following;

(l)The tender age of the prosecutrix(victim)

(2)The age of the accused

(3)The accused enjoyed a position of trust

(4) The preparation of modus operandi of the accused

(5) The mental trauma under gone by the victim

(6) Influence exerted by the accused and his party attempting to hush up the crime

(7)The child had been adequately descriptive in proving a charge under section 365 B

(8) The illegality of the sentence

In this instant case, the incident had taken place at the time the victim was studying in grade 3

and she was only 8 years old. According to submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant

at the time of the trial the accused was 71 years of age. All these facts were brought to the

notice of court by both parties. Therefore the learned trial judge ought to have considered the

tender age of the victim.

In the case of AG Vs Hewa Walimunige Gunasena CA(PHC) APN 110/2012 decided on

12/2/2014, it was held that, "A person indicted of an offence of child abuse does not deserve any sympathy ............ Therefore I hold there were sufficient grounds for imposing a custodial

4

t[ft

sentence to the accused to prevent the commission of further offences".in the above stated

case, Court of Appeal considered the age gap of the parties among other things and enhanced

the punishment imposed on the accused respondent.

AG Vs Ranasinghe (1993) 2SLR 81 CA it was held that;

"An offence of Rape calls for an immediate custodial sentence. Reasons are:

To mark the gravity of the offence

To emphasize public disapproval

To serve as a warning to others

To punish the offender

To protect women

Aggravating factors would be;

Use of violence over and above force necessary to commit rape

Use of weapon to frighten or wound the victim.

Repeating acts of rape.

Careful planning of rape.

Previous convictions for rape or other offences of a sexual kind.

Extreme youth or old age of victim.

Effect upon victim, physical or mental.

Subjection of victim to further sexual indignities or perversion liS.

In the case of AG Vs H.N.de Silva 1 (1956) 57 NLR 121 AT page 124, it was held "In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, a judge should consider the matter of

sentence both from the point of view of the public and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the question only from the angle of the offender. A judge should in determining the

proper sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from the nature of the offence as it appears from the nature of act itself and should have regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is charged. He should also have regard the effect of the punishments as a deterrent and consider what extent it will be effective".

In this instant case, it is pertinent to note that the trial judge has not considered the mental

trauma undergone by the victim. Further it was revealed that the accused had warned the

victim not to divulge the incident to anybody. The son of th~ accused had told the victim's uncle

not to complain to the police. The victim in her evidence had clearly explained that the penis of

the accused had touched her private parts which lasted for few minutes.

The learned DSG brought all these facts to the attention of this court and we are mindful of the

same. In Judgements such as Pepper Vs Hart (1993) lAIl E R 42, Manawadu Vs AG (1987) 2

SLR 30, De Silva Vs Jeyaraj Fernandopulle & Others etc. it has been held that the hansard is the

official publication of parliament and that is published to keep the public informed of what

takes place in parliament thus, the parliament debates reported in Hansard could be referred to

in order to facilitates the interpretation of a statute.

Realizing the rising crime rate involved in violence against women and children the Amendment

to the Penal Code was brought in by Act no 22 of 1995. By introducing this section legislature

intent to prevent and protect the vulnerable sector of the society namely women and children'

State of Karnataka Vs Krishnappa air (2000) 1470 SC held that the courts are obliged to respect

the legislative mandate in the matter of awarding of sentence in all such cases ..

Therefore considering all rthove and also giving our minds to the present age (IT the accused

respondent we impose him the minimum punishment of 7 years RI and order him to pay a

compensation of Rs.50, 000 to the victim with a default sentence of 1 year RI and a fine of

Rs.1000 with a default sentence of 6 months.

The Appeal is allowed.
