Case No.: CA 651/2011 Writ

Before A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

P. Padman Surasena, J.

Counsel Chathura Galhena for the Petitioner.

Arjuna Obeysekara, SDSG for the AG.

Date 16.11.2016

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

Counsel for the Petitioner Mr. Chathura Galhena and Mr.Arjuna Obeysekara,

SDSG have made their submissions in respect of this matter. By the petition

dated 22.11.2011, the Petitioner - Sri Lanka Medical Council seeks several

orders from this Court among which are a writ of certiorari and a writ of

prohibition in respect of two circulars that have been marked respectively as

P10 and P10B. Whilst the circular marked P10 categorizes the Petitioner as a

public enterprise, P10B nominates certain ages for retirement in respect of

employees in the public enterprise so nominated. However, this Court

observes that the person who has sworn an affidavit to prosecute this

application for the aforesaid writs has stated in his affidavit dated

22.11.2011 that he has been duly authorized by the Petitioner to affirm to

the several matters he has sworn in his affidavit. It is to be noted that the

Petitioner -Sri Lanka Medical Council is a body corporate which has

perpetual succession and common seal and several powers and duties have

been imposed on the said Council by the Medical Ordinance of 26.10.2007

which has been amended from time to time. The deponent on behalf of the

said corporate body, though he claims authorization from the Council, has

not provided any evidence of authority on behalf of the Petitioner. In the

case of a corporate entity seeking mandatory orders and quashing orders in

the nature of certiorari and prohibition, it has to act through agents and

such agents have to provide before this Court a proper authorization for

purposes of adjudication into the merits of the application. In other words

the Attorney-General has raised this question in the argument before us and

it has to be noted that though this Court has taken an expansionist attitude

in regard to locus standi, there has to be proper delegation of authority for

the chairman of a legal entity to act on behalf of such entity. It has been

submitted before us that the Council (Petitioner) comprises 24 members

and there is no motion or a joint affidavit on their behalf authorizing the

chairman to plead for prerogative orders. This Court doesn't need to

emphasize that an ultra vires act can always be challenged in its proper

,

jurisdiction of this Court but there has to be a proper authorization of a

deponent.

Be that as it may, this Court is of the view that this application as presently

constituted has to be dismissed on the basis of this preliminary objection.

We proceed to dismiss the petition in view of the infirmity as pointed out

above.
