DECIDED ON: 29.11.2016

A.H.M.D. NAWAZ. J.

The petitioner prayed for a writ of mandamus compelling the 1 st and/or

2nd and/ or 3rd and/ or 4th respondents to implement the directions given

by the 5th respondent shown in documents marked P Band P BA. This

application arises out of an issue where the petitioner sought the

assistance of the 1 st - 4th respondents to have a particular post standing

on his land relocated. There had been a site inspection and thereafter the

Divisional Secretary by P 6 wrote to the Public Utilities Commission

referring to an agreement reached among all the parties as to the

relocation of this particular post. Thereafter the Public Utilities

1

..

Commission has approved by P7 the proposed relocation and notified that

decision to the Ceylon Electricity Board. Counsel who appears for the 1 st

- 4th respondents submits to Court that despite the best endeavours to

enforce the approval of the Public Utilities Commission which came about

as a result of the direction of the Divisional Secretariat, they have failed to

implement and enforce the relocation as a result of the obstruction to the

efforts made by the 7th respondent. Senior state counsel who appears for

the Public Utilities Commission, 5th, 6th, & 8th respondents states that the

order has been made under Section 39(1) of the Electricity Act. This

establishes the fact that there is a remedy available to the 1 st to 4th

respondents to move the relevant Magistrate's Court to carry into effect

the order which they wish to enforce namely the relocation of the post. It

becomes apparent from the argument that the 1 st to 4th respondents are

yet to take steps. Mr. Sanjaya Kannangara undertakes to take steps to

move the Magistrate's Court in order to carry out the decision of relocation

which has already been made. The Legal officer of the Ceylon Electricity

Board takes cognizance of the order that we make today in regard to this

matter.

The 1 st - 4th respondents will pay due regard to Section 09 of schedule 2

of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009.

The counsel for the 1 st - 4th respondents undertakes to proceed to take

steps in the Magistrate's Court. In the circumstances, Mr. Wijesekara for
