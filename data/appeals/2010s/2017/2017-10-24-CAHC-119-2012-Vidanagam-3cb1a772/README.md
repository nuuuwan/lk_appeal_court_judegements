The Accuse Appellant was indicted before the High Court of

Embilipitiya on a charge of murder. The Charge is that on or about the 2nd of

March 2002 together with another unknown person committed the murder

of one Wickramawithana Punchi Appuhamy, an offence punishable under

Section 296 of the Penal Code read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

After trial without jury, the learned High Court Judge convicted the

Appellant and sentenced him to death. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment the Appellant tendered this appeal.

The Appellant does not contest any procedural step taken place in the

trial. The appeal is solely based on the facts of the case.

P.W. 1 Seetha Nandani is the only eye witness to the incident. In her

testimony she said that the deceased was her uncle and as a habit she visits

their family, who were living next door, every evening. On the date of the

incident she was seated on a bench with the decease and a person called

Raja in the evening and two persons came in a motor cycle. They stopped

the motor cycle about 10 feet away and came close to them and shown a

piece of paper and asked for person. At that moment the witness got up and

started going towards the house. Then she heard a gunshot and looked at

them and saw that her uncle was falling down. She has started shouting and

the person came with the piece of paper chased behind her and she ran in to

3

the house. She had seen that the other person was carrying a weapon like a

gun. Thereafter they went towards Embilipitiya in the motor cycle. Her

uncle was admitted to the Embilipitiya hospital but succumbed to the

InJunes.

This witness indentified the Appellant as the person who came with

the piece of paper at the identification parade.

The Appellant challenge the identification parade on two grounds, i.e.

that the Appellant was shown to the witness at the Embilipitiya police

station and his photographs were taken from his house and shown them to

the witness. Further the learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the

identification parade was held after one and half years after the incident and

the Court cannot rely on such an identification parade.

The appellant was arrested at Dehiattakandiya.by the Dehiattakandiya

police on suspicion of some other incident and was remanded. He was

produced before the Magistrate Court of Embilipitiya from the remand

custody for the paradl!. The Embilipitiya police did not have any

opportunity to show the Appellant to any witness at the police station after

taking him into custody because he was not taken into custody by the

Embilipitiya police and he was not kept in that police station.

One allegation made by the Appellant is that he was asked to come to

the police station in 2002 and shown to the witness Seetha Malini and asked

whether he is the person but she has not identified him at that stage. This

position was not suggested to the witness while she was giving evidence.

The learned Counsel alleged that the inquiring officer was not called

to give evidence and the Appellant did not have the opportunity to suggest it

to the inquiring officer. This argument cannot be accepted because this

could have been suggested to the witness Seetha Malini. Without

4

suggesting it to the prosecution witness, leading that evidence though the

defence witness reduces the evidentiary value.

Taking the photographs in to the custody by the police officers and

showing it to the witness was suggested and it was denied. The Appellant in

his evidence stated that while he was in remand custody the police officers

have taken the photographs in to their custody and he has come to know

about it from his mother. The Accused is personally unaware of the fact that

the photographs were taken in to custody. When this was suggested to the

prosecution witness it was denied. Therefore the defense should have called

the mother to establish the fact that the photographs were taken in to

custody. Unless the fact that the photographs were taken in to custody is

established, the allegation that they were shown to the witness cannot

sustain.

The witness was very specific on the identification. While answering

the cross examination, the witness said that she can identify the Appellant

even now because she was so frightened and she can remember the face of

the Appellant. The two persons have come close to them and the time was

about 5.40 in the evening where the light is more than enough to identify a

person. There is no suggestion that the light was not enough to identify a

person.

The Counsel argued that the witness had identified the Appellant only

as a person like the one who came. The learned High Court Judge has

correctly analyzed this answer and had come to the conclusion that the

witness gave that answer because of the question put forward by the Court.

The witness categorically stated that the Appellant is the person came with

the piece of paper.

The Counsel's argument is that it is unsafe to convict the Appellant

where the prosecution case is depending on the identification when the

5

correctness is challenged. He submitted several authorities in this regard. In

the instant case the identification established beyond reasonable doubt. The

learned High Court Judge expressed the view that memory powers of the

different persons are not equal and some persons may be able to remember

things for longer periods than others. I do not see any reason to differ from

this opinion.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant has marked 4 contradictions in

the witness Seetha Malani' s evidence. V3 and V 4 are in relation to

extraneous matters. That is whether the deceased had any other cases and

whether he was detained in the Boossa Camp. The contradiction marked V2

is on the issue of wearing helmets. The witness said in Court that the two

persons were not wearing helmets but only wearing caps. When the witness

questioned in detail, she said that one was having his helmet in his hand. At

the non summary inquiry the witness has stated that both of them were

wearing helmets. The learned High Court Judge has analyzed this evidence.

He is of the opinion that the witness had not stated in the non summary

inquiry that the two persons were wearing helmets when they approached

the deceased. There is no contradiction in this evidence. They (the

perpetrators) may have worn helmets when they reached the crime scene but

when they approached the deceased they were not wearing helmets, but only

caps.

The contradiction marked VI is about the place where the witness

was seated. Her evidence is that she along with the deceased and Raja were

seated on a bench at that time. But she has stated to the police that she was

under the arch and the deceased with his wife and Raja were seated on the

bench. The learned Counsel for the Appellant argue that this contradiction

diminish the credibility of the witness. What matters in this case is not

where the witness was seated but how the incident occurred and whether she

saw the incident. The witness was very precise in giving evidence as to what

6

had happened. She has seen that the Appellant approaching the deceased.

Suddenly a gunshot was fired and when she looked she had seen that her

uncle felling.

The witness's stand is that the appellant with the other person came to

the deceased and the gunshot was fired. This was corroborated by the JMO.

His opinion is that the gunshot was fired in close range and from higher

position aiming downwards. The deceased was seated and the perpetrator

was standing when the gunshot was fired. The doctor's evidence

corroborates the PW l' s evidence as to how the gunshot was fired.

Unless the contradictions are very material to the case and goes into

the root of the case a mere contradiction will not attack the credibility of the

witness. It has been held by F.N.D.Jayasuriya, J in the case of Best

Footwear (Pvt) Ltd, And Two Others V. Aboosally, Former Minister Of

Labour & Vocational Training And Others [1997J 1 Sri L R 137 that;

In evaluating the evidence of a witness a court or tribunal is not

entitled to reject testimony and arrive at an adverse finding in regard

to testimonial trustworthiness and credibility on the mere proof of

contradiction or the existence of a discrepancy. The deciding

authority must weigh and evaluate the discrepancy and ascertain

whether the discrepancy does go to the root of the matter and shake

the basic version of the witness. If it does not, such discrepancies

cannot be given too much importance ... Before arriving at an

adverse finding in regard to testimonial trustworthiness the Judge

must carefully give his mind to the contradictions marked and

consider whether they are material or not and the witness should be

given an opportunity of explaining those contradictions that matter ...

Witnesses should not, be disbelieved on account of trivial

discrepancies and omissions and the Court should look at the" entirety

7

and totality of the material placed before it in ascertaining whether

the contradiction is weighty or is trivial.

In the instant case the contradiction marked VI does not shake the

credibility of the witness.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant further submits that the

prosecution has failed to call the inquiring officer to give evidence. His

contention is that the officer who was called is not the chief inquiring

officer. The retired police officer Fernando was called as witness and he did

the preliminary investigations, the officers who recorded the statements

were also called as witness. The Appellant was arrested on suspicion of

another case by another police station and was produced for this case

through the prison. Under these circumstances the chief investigation officer

is the retired officer Fernando. Therefore the argument that the chief

inquiring officer was not called, fails.

I see no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned High

Court Judge.

I affirm the conviction and the sentence.

Appeal dismissed.
