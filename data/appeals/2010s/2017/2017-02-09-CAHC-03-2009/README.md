M.M.A.GafToor,J.

The appellate jurisdiction of this Court had been

invoked by the I Accused- Appellant to set aside the conviction and

sentence on several grounds. Namely contradictions as to the

statements made by the prosecution Witness 1 and 2 in relation to

the number of officers involved in the raid the time the relevant

officers left the Police Narcotics Bureau, the manner the suspects

were gathered at the time of raid and the manner the suspects

attempted to escape.

The relevant facts of the case are as follows:-

The prosecution witness -1 (PW 1) in lieu of receipt of

information regarding the suspect trafficking heroin, formed a raid

party and proceed to the location where the suspect was said to be

at by the informant. Upon the arrival of point the officers of the

Police Narcotics Bureau raided the house and arrested the suspect

along with the two others, one of whom was found to be in

possession of heroin addition to the suspect himself.

On the 7th July. 1995 the suspect pleaded not guilty

and was served with the indictment by the Attorney General for the

possession of 2. 5g of heroin, and offence Punishable under Section

54A ( c) of Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance Act

No 13 of 1884.

During the course of the trial, the suspect gave evidence

under oath. Upon the conclusion of the trial it was found by the

High Court Judge that the accused was guilty for the possession of

heroin and was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment on 8th

July, 2009.

The matter proceeded on appeal to this Court for

consideration of conviction and sentence based on several grounds

for which submissions has been made at length.

When considering the said grounds of appeal, it is of

importance to analyze if such grounds are in fact capable of

reversing the conviction and sentence awarded at the conclusion of

the trial at High Court - We1ikada.

The accused-appellant states that contradictory

evidence submitted by the prosecution witnesses 1 and 2 which

formed the above grounds of appeal.

Therefore, this Court will consider the matters separately in

order to reach an overall verdict.

The discrepancy as to the time the officers left police

Narcotics Bureau is not of significant difference which affect the

core of this case and thus, is not material. This due to the fact that,

if the time recorded was in fact the very opposite in relation to one

another (a.m. p.m. etc.) then it would suffice as aground or appeal

and thus, would qualify as material to reconsider the case itself,

however, mere discrepancy as to 30 minutes or so, of the time does

not affect the root of the case established by the prosecution, for if

it was instance where one stated 8.00 a.m. while another stated

8.30 p.m., then such discrepancy would entail doubt as to the

accuracy and truthfulness of the evidence. As such doubt has not

arisen, the ground of appeal cannot withstand the justification.

The ground of appeal as to the number of officers who

were part of the particular raid according to prosecution witness 1,

7 officers were part of the raid where as prosecution witness 2-

stated five officers were involved. However, by the analysis of the

I I

I

J l r III

statements provided it is vital to note that even though there is a

discrepancy. The discrepancy itself is not capable of shocking the

conscience of this court. This is due to the fact that PW 2 had

been required to "roughly estimate" the number of officers who

took part in the raid in 1995. The statement of PW2 was not made

affirmatively but rather on an assumption. Thus an assumption

does not superseded the documentary evidence present at hand

found information books. This is because there exists sufficient

evidence to prove that in fact 7 officers were part of the raid with

reference to the officer number. Thus, an assumption is not

capable of altering the obvious evidence present.

Lastly, the ground of appeal based up-on the

contradictory manner the suspect and two others were gathered

and attempted to escape cannot be found to be of material essence

to affect the conviction reach by the trial judge. During the course

of committing an offence by a person with knowledge of such being

an offence, would function cautiously in order to avoid any form of

inconvenience. Therefore, the sight of Police officers raiding the

premises would naturally course a suspect to flee as part of human

f f [ II [ It

6

instinct, for an innocent man would not necessarily flee unless

there is a reason behind such behavior.

Furthermore, the manner of escape can be perceived by

different persons in a different manner given the view point of such

person. Moreover, the exact specification as to the manner the

suspect and others attempted escape can be phrased differently by

the persons involved in the raid. Thus, while one would perceive

the attempted escape from one view point another is capable of

witnessing the event from different angle itself. As a result, the

statement of evidence as to the direction would vary based on the

viewpoint of each prosecution witness.

However, such variation as to the viewpoint is not a sufficient

ground of appeal unless it concerned a serious issue as to a

witness who was not part of the raid gave evidence at the trial,

which would entail an offence on its own.

In addition to the above grounds of appeal, the accused-

appellant states that the learned High Court Judge had made

reference to the information books of the officers who were part of

I , t I r I, i f l

the raid. It must be borne in mind that, if the Judge has reached

the conviction based on the material found in information books, it

will be deemed prejudicial to the accused-appellant. However, by

analyzing the judgment of the said High Court Judge it is evident

that, the learned High Court Judge had made a remark as to the

observations made by the officers and not otherwise. Hence, the

conviction had not been driven by consideration of such material

found in information books.

Further, Accused-Appellant states in his appeal that" un

contradictory evidence" was submitted at time of trial and such

evidence was not taken into consideration by the trial Judge. It

must be heavily stressed that, for evidence to amount as " un

contradictory" it must be such that there exists no contradictions

as to the evidence whatsoever. However, the accused-appellant did

not produce a witness supporting the stance held by the Accused-

appellant himself. In such circumstances, the accused-appellant

cannot state that the evidence provided at the trial was un

contradictory, When it was not compelling evidence as a whole for

consideration.

The Accused-Appellant further states that, the High Court

Judge has shifted the burden of proof unto the Accused-Appellant

to provide a reasonable explanation as to the reason for the officers

of the raid to implicate the Accused-Appellant in relation to

possession of heroin. It is vital to note that the Accused-Appellant

had been given the opportunity to provide evidence to prove his

innocence and non- involvement in possession of heroin. Such

award of fair opportunities cannot be seen as a shortcoming in the

law, for one will be deemed innocent until proven guilty and such

opportunity was given to the Accused-Appellant.

At the argument of this appeal learned Counsel for the

appellant strenuously contended that the learned trial judge

has erred in law by perusing the notes of the information book

while delivering the judgment. Learned Counsel relied strongly

on the following judicial decisions :-

Sheela Sinharage Vs. The Attorney General 1885 (1) SLR

i II

Banda and Others Vs .Attorney General 1998 (3) SLR 168

Keerthibanda Vs. Attorney General 2002 (4) SLR 245.

I

I have given my mind to the rule of law enunciated in the

above judicial decisions. I hold that the decision in the above

case has no application whatsoever to the issue which arises

in the instant case.

The rule of law enunciated in the above judicial

decisions is that a trial Judge cannot use the matters recorded

at the non -summary inquiry or matters recorded in a police

statement as substantive evidence. In the instant case, the

learned trial Judge has not used the notes of the information

book as substantive evidence.

Therefore, it is with responsibility this Court can state

that the grounds of appeal of the Accused-appellant is

baseless and lack sufficient reasons. Further, the Learned

10

High Court Judge has given the benefit of the doubt to the

accused-appellant to prove his innocence and failure to do so

does not amount to prejudice caused by the trial Judge in

reaching the verdict. Moreover, the trial had been fair form the

inception. Thus, this court will dismiss the appeal and impose

the conviction and sentence awarded by the High Court Judge

accordingly.
