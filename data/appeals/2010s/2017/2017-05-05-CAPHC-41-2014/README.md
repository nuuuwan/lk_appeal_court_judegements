Wattala under section 40 of the Forest Ordinance as amended by Acts

Numbers 13 of 1982,84 of 1988 and 23 of 1995.

The Claimant-Petitioner Koshiba Credit (Pvt) Ltd (hearin after

referred to as the Appellant) is a Finance Company which under a lease

agreement let the vehicle bearing No. WPJC-6572 to Weliwita Angoda

Liyanage Palitha Perera who became the registered owner of the

vehicle. The said Gihini Arachige Chanaka Senadira was charged in

the Magistrate Court of Wattala bearing case No 63301111 for

transporting timber without a permit an offence punishable under

section 25(1) read with section 40 of the Forest Ordinance. He pleaded

guilty to the chargers. Thereafter an inquiry was held regarding the

confiscation of the vehicle under section 40 of the Forest Ordinance.

The Appellant who is the absolute owner claimed the vehicle on the

basis that it has taken necessary precaution to prevent the commission

of an offence and the offence was committed without his knowledge

and at the learned Magistrates inquiry S. Gunawardana an agent of the

absolute owner gave evidence and testified that when the vehicle was

given to the registered owner the company has given written

. r ...

5

instructions to the effect that the vehicle should not be used for any

illegal activities. To corroborate this evidence he produced a document

to the Magistrate Court which was a certified as true copy and the court

accepted it and allowed to be marked as a document marked "X3". This

was marked without any objections from the Respondents or from

court. The said document was not accepted on any condition that it was

subjected to proof. In the said document there is clear averment giving

specific instructions to the registered owner prohibiting him from using

the vehicle for illegal activities. The said witness's evidence was that

the company had warned the registered owner not to use the vehicle for

illegal activities. This evidence has not been challenged at all.

The Learned Magistrate had not given any reasons as to why he

rejected the evidence of the agent of the absolute owner which was

given in the Magistrate Court. It was contended that it is highly

unreasonable for the Learned Magistrate to refuse to Act on the

document marked "X3" at the stage of judgment after accepting, the

said document even without subject to proof. It was submitted that the

above procedure amounts to an admission of the document marked

"X3". In the said document the registered owner had signed and there

, I ' f , '

6

is no dispute that the registered owner had not signed the document and

he was not aware of the document.

Accordingly it was submitted that the decision in S.C. Appeal No

l05A12008 where the requirement is to show that the absolute owner

had taken all possible precautions to prevent the use of vehicle for the

commission of the offence. It was submitted a clause to the effect that

the vehicle should not be used for illegal activities in an agreement

between the parties can be considered as a valid precaution. The

registered owner too had given evidence and he had stated that the

vehicle had been used without his knowledge and he had taken all the

possible precautions to prevent the vehicle being used for any illegal

activities.

Accordingly it was submitted that court be pleased to set aside the

judgment of the Learned Magistrate and Learned High Court Judge and

be pleased to release the vehicle to the absolute owner or send this case

back for a fresh inquiry.

" ,

7 ff f\The Learned DSG making submissions stated that the appeal made

by absolute owner which had been dismissed by the High Court of

Negombo for the reason that the Forest Ordinance did not give a right

of appeal. However subsequently the absolute owner had made a

revision application to the High Court ofNegombo. The Learned High

Court Judge after going through all material evidence and law

dismissed the revision application of the Appellant. Thereafter the

Appellant had appealed to this court to set aside the order of the

Learned High Court Judge.

It was submitted by the DSG that the main submissions on behalf of

the absolute owner was that the absolute owner had a marked a page,

of the purported agreement which contained a clause to the effect that

the vehicle should not be used for any illegal purpose. The Appellant

contended that the said page should be construed as the Appellant

owner having taken all precautions to prevent an offence taking place.

It transpired at the argument that the absolute owner at the Magistrates

Court inquiry in fact marked only just one page of the document and

that the Learned Magistrate directed the absolute owner to file the

entire document.

8

, 1

It was submitted that the said document was not filed at all in the

Magistrates Court. It was filed in the High Court with the revision

application. It was contended that the said filling is illegal. As revision

is supervisory in nature, and the Learned High Court Judge in

exercising the revisionary jurisdiction can only supervise what has

already been submitted in the lower court.

The said document had not been tendered in the Lower Court, hence

the Learned High Court Judge in exercising revisionary jurisdiction is

debarred from supervising the said document. The Learned Magistrate

had called for the said document and has given the Appellant

opportunity to tender it to the Magistrates Court. The Appellant failed

to produce same and the Learned Magistrate made order to confiscate

the vehicle on 28/7/2011. The only conclusion that one could arrive at

is that there was no such agreement at the time of the commission of

the offence and therefore the Appellant did not tender it. Giving

evidence the Appellant stated that the registered owner was told

verbally not to sell the vehicle. Hence this clearly demonstrates that the

Appellant took no precaution to prevent an offence from taking place.

It was submitted that in a revision being a discretionary remedy should

, .

9

only be exercised in limited cases, where the order that is challenged is

manifestly illegal or the procedural error appears that would shock the

conscious of the court.

The Respondent submitted that the Appellant has not alleged that the

order of the Learned Magistrate to be illegal, irregular, capricious or

arbitrary. Hence the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge is valid

in law and therefore should be allowed to stand. It was submitted that

as the Appellant tender a purported agreement only at the revisionary

stage, which is prohibited by law and by such tendering of documents

illegally, the Appellant not only prevented the prosecution from asking

questions about the agreement at the inquiry stage but also misled court

in SUbmitting same at the revision stage. The said document was not

marked subject to proof and therefore should be accepted as evidence.

The Appellant filed a revision application in the High Court of

Negombo and the Learned High Court Judge by his order dated

13/2/2014 affirm the order of the Learned Magistrate. The Appellant's

appealed against the judgment of the High Court to the Court of Appeal

being aggrieved.

10

It was contended by the Respondent that this is not the legal basis for

the accepting evidence section 64 of the Evidence Ordinance stated that

documents must be proved by primary evidence except if it cannot be

obtained. The Rule regarding primary evidence being generally

necessary applied only to the proof of contents of the document and not

to cases involving its existence or position created by it, as to which

secondary evidence would be admissible. But the contents of

documents cannot be proved, as a general rule, both in English law and

our law, by any evidence other that the document itself, which is

primary evidence. The Learned Magistrate in fact was not satisfied with

just a page of a purported agreement and directed the filing of the whole

agreement, which the Appellant failed to do, for reasons best known to

himself.

The law as it stands today in Sri Lanka the Claimant of a vehicle

should demonstrate that he took,

1) all precautions to prevent the vehicle being used for the

unlawful purpose, and

2) that the owner had no knowledge of the vehicle being used

for the commission of the offence.

. ,

11

The legal authorities have clearly stated that there should not be made

a distinction between the registered owner and the absolute owner.

According to the case Mary Matilda de Silva V. IP Police Station

Habarana CA(PHC) APN 86/97 the Claimant has to prove the above

ingredients on a balance of probability. The Respondent states that the

Appellant made no attempt to discharge the duty cast on him.

In the case ofSC Appeal No. 120/2011 it was held,

" ..... .if an offence was committed without it's (absolute

owners) knowledge the absolute owner has to satisfy court that

necessary precautions were taken and the offence was committed

without its knowledge."

It has been clearly held that the Appellant has to demonstrate by

evidence that he took all precautions to prevent an offence taking place.

Further it has been held that simply informing the registered owner not

to do any illegal activity with the vehicle does not suffice. The

Appellant has done exactly what the law has prohibited him from

doing. The Appellant has led no evidence to demonstrate that he took

concrete steps to prevent the offence taking place.

12

, ,

In fact it is the registered owner who can give evidence and convince

the Learned Magistrate that he took all precautions to prevent the

offence taking place, for the simple reason that he has the vehicle in his

physical custody. In this case the Appellant took it upon himself to

discharge the above mentioned twofold burden. The Respondents state

that the Appellant is not in a position to discharge the burden as the

vehicle is not in his custody. Further all the Appellant has done is to

tell the registered owner not to sell the vehicle. The humble contention

of the Respondents is that the Appellant has failed to place any

evidence to discharge his burden.

In the case of Range Forest Officer Vs. Duwa Pedige Aruna

Kumara and between Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd

Vs. The Attorney General, Priyasath Dep, PC, J it was held;

" At this stage it is relevant to refer to section 40(1) of the

Forest Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1982 which deals

with forfeiture of timber, tools, boats, carts, cattle and vehicles

used in the commission of offences under the Ordinance. The

relevant section reads as follows;

13

40(1) Upon the conviction of any person for a forest offence-

(a)AII timber or forest produced which is not the property of

the State in respect of which such offence has been

committed; and

(b)AII tools, boats, carts, cattle and motor vehicles used in

committing such offence( whether such tools, boats, carts,

cattle and motor vehicles are owned by such person or

not)

Shall by reason of such conviction, be forfeited to the State.

The amendment to section 40 of the Forest Ordinance by Act No

13 of 1982 substituted the words" shall by reason of such conviction

be forfeited to the State" for the words shall be liable by order of the

convicting Magistrate to confiscation" According to the plain reading

of this section it appears that upon conviction the confiscation is

automatic. The strict interpretation of this section will no doubt cause

prejudice to the third parties who are the owners of such vehicles.

, .

14

The implications of the amended section 40 of the Forest Ordinance

was considered by Sharvananda, J in Manawadu V. Attorney General

(19872 SLR 30) It was held that:

"By section 7 of Act No. 13 of 1982 it was not

intended to deprive an owner of his vehicle used by the

offender in committing a 'forest offence' without his

(owner's) knowledge and without his participation. The

word 'forfeited' must be given the meaning 'liable to be

forfeited' so as to avoid the injustice that would flow on

the construction that forfeiture of the vehicle is automatic

on the conviction of the accused. The amended sub

section 40 does not exclude by necessary implication the

rule of laud; alteram partern'. The owner of the lorry not

a party to the case is entitled to be heard on the question

of forfeiture of the lorry, if he satisfies the court that the

accused committed the offence without his knowledge or

participation, his lorry will not be liable to forfeiture.

The Magistrate must hear the owner of the lorry on the

question of showing cause why the lorry is not liable to be

forfeited. If the Magistrate is satisfied with the cause

shown, he must restore the lorry to the owner. The

Magistrate may consider the question of releasing the

lorry to the owner pending inquiry, on his entering into a

15

bond with sufficient security to abide by the order that

may ultimately be binding on him"

The Supreme Court has consistently followed the case of Manawadu

v. The Attorney General. Therefore it is settled law that before an

order for forfeiture is made the owner should be given an opportunity

to show cause. If the owner on balance of probability satisfies the

court that he had taken precautions to prevent the commission of the

offence or the offence was committed without his knowledge nor he

was privy to the commission of the offence then the vehicle has to be

released to the owner.

The next question that arises is who is the owner as contemplated

under section 40 of the Forest Ordinance. In the case of vehicles let

under hire-purchase or lease agreements there are two owners,

namely the registered and the absolute owner.

The counsel for the Appellant relied on section 433 A which was

introduced by Code of Criminal Procedure (amendment) Act No 12 of

1990 section 433 A reads as follows;

, \ .

16

433A (1) in the case of a vehicle let under a hire purchase or leasing

agreement, the person registered as the absolute owner of such

vehicle under the Motor Traffic Act (chapter 203) shall be deemed to

be the person entitled to possession of such vehicle for the purpose

of this chapter.

(2) In the event of more than one person being registered as

the absolute owner of any vehicle referred to in subsection(l), the

person who has been so registered first in point of time in respect of

such vehicle shall be deemed to be the person entitled to possession

of such vehicle for the purpose of this chapter".

The chapter referred to in this section is the chapter XXXVIII of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act dealing with disposal of property

pending trial and after the conclusion of the case. (Section 425-433)

(The Forest Ordinance (Amendment) Act No 65 of 2009 deemed

section 433A inapplicable to persons who pleads guilty to or is found

guilty of a forest offence. The implications of this amendment will not

be considered in this appeal as the amendment came into force after

the order of confiscation was made by the learned Magistrate)

17

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant relied on the judgment in

Mercantile Investment Ltd. V. Mohamed Mauloom and others ((1998)

3 SLR 32) where it was held that lIin view of section 433 A(1) of Act No

12 of 1990, the Petitioner being the absolute owner is entitled to

possession of the vehicle, even though the Claimant- Respondent had

been given its possession on a lease agreement. It was incumbent on

the part of the Magistrate to have given the petitioner an opportunity

to show cause before he made the order to confiscate the vehicle."

The registered owner who has a possession and full control of the

vehicle is responsible to use of the vehicle. He is the person who is in

a possession to take necessary precautions to prevent the commission

of an offence. Therefore the registered owner to whom the absolute

owner had granted the possession of the vehicle and who has the

control of the vehicle is required to satisfy the court that he had taken

all precautions to prevent the commission of the offences and that the

offence was committed without his knowledge.

In this case I am of the view that the absolute owner has failed to

submit the lease agreement marked "X3" which has been tendered to

.. .,"

18

High Court for perusal as such we are of the view that as absolute owner

has failed to Act with due diligence in forwarding the said document to

the Magistrate Court when an opportunity has been afforded to him

should accept the consequences that arises out of his own actions.

However in the present case we find that although the absolute owner

had taken all the possible precautions to prevent the vehicle being used

for illegal activities which the registered owner giving evidence had

accepted. He has failed to produce the said agreement to the Magistrate.

However as the said document has been tendered to the High Court in

interest of justice been done we set aside the order of the High Court

Judge and the Learned Magistrate and we send the case back for fresh

inquiry to the Learned Magistrates Court of Watt ala.
