Oeepali Wijesundera J.

The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Tangalle for the

murder of K.L. Pradeep Priyantha under section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial he was convicted and sentenced to death.

The appellant had been visiting the deceased's house and was

known to the members of the family. On 05th of September, 1998 he had

visited the deceased at home and left with him. The appellant had

returned at 7.30 p.m. on the same day and had informed the members of

the family that the deceased had gone with a friend and will be returning

later. Prosecution witness number one, sister of the deceased had

attended a wedding and has met the appellant and he has inquired about

the deceased. On the 07th the body of the deceased had been found in a

lake in a decomposed state. The appellant had attended the 7 days

almsgiving and later he has left with the other brother Pradeep and he

too has gone missing.

The medical evidence reveals that the deceased had died due to

the injuries caused to the head by a cutting weapon. Prosecution witness

number two Sumithra has testified that on the 06th appellant came in the

night and told her that her older brother was found drunk and at the same

breath he has said that the deceased had met with an accident and is

staying at 8andula's house and has asked her to come with him. She

then had seen an iron rod in the van of the appellant near the front seat.

Counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant was charged

in the High Court of Matara bearing case No. HC 224/2008 for the murder

of the other brother Pradeep and was acquitted without calling the

defence. He argued although it was the same witness similar facts and

same accused still the prosecution witnesses have been disbelieved.

Evidence relied upon by the Learned High Court Judge to convict

the appellant are evidence regarding a close friend of the family, usage

of a false name on the identification papers, the van used by the appellant

was a stolen van, appellant left the house with the deceased on the osth

(last seen theory), posing off as a Navy officer, after leaving with the

appellant deceased did not return home and the body was found in a

lake, the appellant informing the family by coming home that deceased

was visiting a friend, subsequently he left with the other brother and his

body was also found in the lake, subsequent conduct of the appellant. At

the time of arrest, an offensive weapon and a firearm was found in the

appellant's possession, personal belongings of the deceased was found

in the appellant's possession, having various photographs of himself

under various names and finally section 27 (1) recovery in which the

weapon used to kill the deceased was found (P1).

Out of the above arguments deceased was last seen with the

appellant and the personal items of the deceased was recovered by the

investigating officers established a strong prima facia case against the

appellant. The appellant has not explained as to how the personal

belongings of the deceased came into his posseSSion which is in his

personal knowledge. When one considers these two items of evidence

we can't say that the conviction is bad in law.

The judgment in King vs Appuhamy 46 NLR 128 and Queen vs

Samanasena cited by the learned counsel are not relevant to the facts

of this case. In Nissanka vs The State 2001 3 SLR 75 the Court of

Appeal has considered the Ellenborough theory and has discussed it at

length, and has referred to a series of judgments which dealt with the said

principle.

A certificate issued in the name of the deceased was recovered

from the possession of the appellant with the photograph of the appellant

on it, this proves that the appellant wanted to pose as deceased which

proves the motive for the killing.

F or the afore stated reason we decide to affirm the conviction and

the judgment dated 29/05/2012 and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
