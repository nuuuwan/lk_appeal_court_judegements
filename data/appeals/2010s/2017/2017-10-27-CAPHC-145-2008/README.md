JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

Learned counsel for both Parties, when this case came up on 2017-06-28

before us, having made brief oral submissions, agreed to file written

submissions.

The Petitioner- Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant) had filed an application in the Provincial High Court holden in

Kurunegala praying for a writ of Mandamus to compel the Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 2nd Respondent) to

implement the recommendations contained in the letter dated 2005-08-15.

This letter was produced in the High Court marked @e5 3.

According to the designation mentioned at the bottom of the said letter,

the author thereof is stated to be the Deputy Chairman of the Western

Provincial Council and also the Chairman of the Public Petitions Committee

of the Western Provincial Council. The author by this letter had

recommended to the Respondent that it would be appropriate to settle the

4

dispute referred therein, in the way suggested in the said letter. It is this

recommendation that the Appellant had sought to implement in the High

Court through a writ of Mandamus.

At the commencement of the argument of this case, learned Senior State

Counsel submitted that this case is not maintainable in view of the

judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of The Superintendant,

Stafford Estate and two others V Solaimuthu Rasu1.

The Supreme Court in that judgment had clearly held that the jurisdiction

conferred on the Provincial High Courts under Article 154 P 4(b) does not

extend to matters in respect of powers relating to recovery/dispossession

encroachment or alienation of state lands since they are not found in the

Provincial Council List (List 1) to the 9th Schedule to the 13th amendment to

the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

Article 154 (P) 4(b)'of the Constitution states that a Provincial High Court

shall have jurisdiction to issue, according to law:

1 2013 (1) Sri. L. R. 25.

<

5

Orders in the nature of writs of Certiorari, Prohibition, Procedendo,

Mandamus and quo Warranto against any persons exercising within the

province, any power under:

I. Any law; or

II. Any statute made by the Provincial Council established for that

province; in respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council

List.

Perusal of the learned Provincial High Court Judge shows that he has

refused the application for a writ of Mandamus on the basis that there is no

enforceable public duty on the part of the Respondent to carry out the

recommendation made in the letter marked @e5 3.

Although the above view of the learned Provincial High Court Judge is

correct, this Court has to stress the fact that the writ jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Courts do not extend to matters in respect of powers

relating to recovery/dispossession encroachment or alienation of state

6

lands since they are not found in the Provincial Council List. Therefore, in

any case the Provincial High Court could not have issued the writ sought by

the Petitioner Appellant in this case.

For the foregoing reasons we decide to dismiss this appeal with costs.

Application is dismissed with costs.
