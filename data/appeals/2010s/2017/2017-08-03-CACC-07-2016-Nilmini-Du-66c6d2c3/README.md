Recorded by Wijaya Kanthi de Silva and Thalatha Wijesinghe

After following the procedures on 24.06.2016 this matter was

taken up before the President of the Court of Appeal and the charges

were read over to the respondent and the respondent pleaded not guilty.

Subsequently, the matter was fIxed for inquiry and the inquiry was taken

up before H/L Justice V.K. Malalgoda PC (PICA) and H/L Justice

Thurairaja. The case for the petitioner was concluded and the case was

reserved for the defence. After the elevation of H/L Justice Vijith

Malalgoda PC (PICA) to the Supreme Court this case could not be

1

t II

~ rIi i i IrI

reached. Therefore, the matter came up before this Bench afresh. The

Counsel for the petitioner moves Court to adopt the proceedings and

proceed in this matter. Counsel for the respondent submitted that he

came knew to it. Therefore, due to the time considering Court decides to

take the case afresh.

We direct the Registrar in Court to read over the Charge Sheet.

Charge sheet is read over.

The petitioner and the respondent both are present in Court.

When the charge sheet is read over, the President's Counsel Mr.

Faisz Musthapha is taking following objections.

My submission IS twofold. Respectfully firstly I am basing my

submissions on the footing that there is a parallel jurisdiction in Your

Lordship's Court and the District Court. My submission is that having

regard to the facts involved and judgments of Your Lordship's Court, the

appropriate forum is the District Court, the original Court to hear and

determine this matter. In support of that I shall be citing two very

pertinent judgments of Your Lordship's Court. Secondly, my submission

is prima facie, on the face of it or rather ex facie the charge sheet does

not disclose any offence of contempt. It is a twofold submission, one

assuming that, even if that there is a charge known to the law that the

2

1 II Ii I

J !

'forum conveniens' is the District Court. Then the other is that at any

event one cannot be proceed for the reason that its ex facie the charge

sheet does not disclose a charge known to the law.

My Lord regarding the 1st submission may I advert to a very recent

judgment. I referred to the unreported judgment of Your Lordship's

Court, in the case of Mary Jean Varma vs. Dr. Chrisantha Nicholas

Anthony Nonis and others C.A. Application bearing No.ll of 2016, dated

24th of January 2017. This arose consequent to restraining orders issued

by the Civil High Court. The petitioner sought to deal with the

Respondent for contempt for alleged disobedience. There is a considered

judgment of Your lordships, delivered by the then President, Justice

Malalgoda and Justice Surasena. His Lordship Justice Surasena held

that "the petitioner had not adduced any acceptable reason as to why it

is the Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal alone which should deal

with the case. There is absolutely no bar for the petitioner to file this case

in the very High Court before which the main case is pending. Indeed it

would be the learned High Court Judge who is already possessed of the

facts and circumstances of this case and who has access to all the

material adduced in this case, who would unboundedly be the best

Judge to deal with this case. This court has taken a similar view in the

case of Metthananda Vs. Kushan Fernando in which a similar objection

was upheld of Your Lordships Court. This Court dismissed that

3

application and directed the Petitioner to institute the application for

contempt in the District Court where the alleged subject matter of the

complaint was said to have been occurred."

My Lord, the concluding portion is in the same tenor. Counsel refers to

the judgment in the case of Varma Vs. Dr. Nonis C.A. Application 11/16

the Minutes of the Court of Appeal of 24th January, 2017. I also refer

respectfully to the Dicta appearing at Page 10 where the view was taken

for reasons set out in the judgment that it was more appropriate to go to

District Court and their Lordship's made order referring the Petitioner, if

he so desires to institute the proceedings in this regard, in the High

Court before which the matter was already pending, and whose order is

alleged to have been violated by the Respondents. I would submit that

these dicta apply with full force to the present matter also and for the

sake of completeness, may I refer to the case adverted to in the judgment

in Metthananda Vs. Kushan Fernando 2006 1 SLR Page 290. I am duty

bound to state to Your Lordship's that there are cases which say that

where parallel jurisdiction exist one is entitled as of right to invoke either

and a Court cannot decline to exercise jurisdiction in respect of the

particular court matter on the footing that there is a like application

pending in the other court. My submission is that there is a distinction.

Whereas of right you can invoke the jurisdiction since if, you are a

plaintiff or you are a complainant you are entitled as a right to access to

4

both Courts but contempt is different. Actually the real complainant is

the Court. The Complainant is only bringing the facts to the notice of the

Court. So my submission is, in those circumstances, those cases are

distinguishable because there was a right to invoke both jurisdictions. I

am duty bound to say to your Lordships that there are cases which say

that, but those are distinguishable. Your lordships are also aware that

there are cases where without going to Provincial High Court parties have

come before your Lordship's Court. These are cases in which Your

Lordships did not decline to hear the case on the ground that the

complainant should have gone to the High Court. But Your Lordships

would appreciate that these are cases as of right, they were entitled to

invoke both jurisdictions and both fora. But here it is different. Because

here it is the Court that takes cognizance of a complaint pertaining to the

Court itself, not as of right on the part of the petitioner. He is only

bringing to the notice of Court and that the Court then sets in motion,

the proceedings for contempt. This is distinguishable from the ordinary

complaint in a civil case or in a criminal case. So my submission is

respectfully that in this matter Your Lordships would appropriately refer

the petitioner to the original Court, the District Court.

My Lord, the other submission is that if Your Lordships would peruse the

charge sheet it is clear that it does not disclose an offence. I don't know

My Lord it is a storm in a tea cup apparently this arises out of a

5

III 1 I ! ! I t II

i

f

I

custodial dispute with regard to a minor child. Apparently there was an

arrangement by which the Court gave joint custody, legal custody and

physical custody to both. Further, the arrangement by the court said,

"you take the child on Thursday and return by Sunday morning".

Apparently My Lord, this is fall out of the bitterness among parties, as

there was a little delay of two hours. So it's really a storm in a tea cup.

There is bitterness of course where sometimes, the time is a healer.

But, be that as it may, only just two hours, the point is this. Respectfully

the charge sheet does not allege willful or intentional delay, does not say

it was calculated to bring the Court into any form of disrepute. It merely

says failure to comply. Significantly Your Lordship would see there is an

omission also to mention any penal section which is a part of a charge

sheet. There is no reference at all to any penal provisions. But the

substantive submission that I am making is, it doesn't constitute

contempt ex facie. There is no office unknown to the law because if I may

refer Your Lordship to a fairly old case, 22 NLR the famous case Ismail

Vs. Ismail, where it was specifically held at Page 190, judgment of HjL

Bertram CJ agreing with HjL Justice De Sampayo, it was held that,

"disobedience order of Court is not contempt. There must be either, it

should be calculated to bring the Court into disrepute. There must be

defiance. Defiance of the order or some extra element of turpitude which

elevates it from mere disobedience to contempt and Your Lordships be

6

II Ii !!

pleased not to permit contempt proceedings to be used as a thumbscrew

for enforcement. There is a modality for enforcement respectfully because

there is specific provision for enforcement of these orders. In fact this

was followed in a more recent case by HjL Justice Amarasinghe the case

of Dayawathi & Pieris vs. Dr. Fernando where contempt proceedings were

initiated, 1988 Vol.2 of Sri Lanka Law Reports commencing at page 314-

it sought to deal with the Respondents for alleged defiance or

disobedience of the order of the Supreme Court. It was disallowed by HjL

Amarasinghe, J. The dicta commences at 368. "I am unable to accept

without qualification the submission of the learned President's Counsel

appearing for the Petitioner. No lesser person than Queen's Counsel Mr.

Jayawawardana. In order to establish contempt of Court the words of

Lord Radcliffe in Reginald Perera vs. the King, where a member of

parliament had occasion to pass some strictures in regard to the mode in

which prisoners had been kept in jail pending trial. This was put up to

Justice Basnayake who ordered that contempt proceedings be taken and

the M.P. was hold up for contempt. The matter went up before the Privy

Council. The Privy Council was acquitted the accused. This is a citation

from that case at page 369. "There must be involved some act done or

writing published calculated to bring a court or a judge of the court into

contempt or to lower his authority or something calculated to obstruct or

interfere with the due course of justice or the lawful process of the Court.

This does not necessarily happen where a person has failed to or refused

to obey an ordinary, non-coercive order of Court. Bertram CJ in the case

of Ismail vs. Ismail said that "non-compliance with the judgment of a

Court is not, in ordinary circumstances, a contempt of Court." Where the

order of court is declaratory i.e. where it is a decision merely expressing

publicly, informal and explicit terms, the rights and obligations of the

parties concerned a failure to abide by such an order would not, in my

opinion, without more, amount to a contempt of Court. (See Law of

Contempt such and such). Indeed even if the order of the court is more

than merely declaratory, the failure, or even refusal to comply with it

does not necessarily, by itself, constitute a contempt of court. Their

Lordships said in Amarasekera Vs. Goonewardene, it's a very elaborate

judgment, a police Magistrate had directed the Respondent to abate a

nuisance by removing a kiln to the furthest distance possible from the

house or break it down. The appellant refused or failed to do that in that

case. Now if the respondent said this in open Court in an offensive or

contemptuous tone, he certainly deserved punishment and he rendered

himself liable to punishment. But if the Magistrate called upon him to

show cause why the court of law with regard to cases where the law

expressly provides for the execution of decrees several proceedings such

as contempt proceeding should not be resorted to the effect order of

court." This is very clear as set out in the judgment of Bertram CJ in the

8

case of Ismail Vs. Ismail You Lordships' be pleased to look at the dicta

which commences as 369 and goes on to 372. "Even if there is no

process in law to execute a particular order and there is, in my opinion

no such process prescribed by law to give effect to the order of the

Supreme Court made in the exercise of its jurisdiction conferred upon it

by the Article 126 of the Constitution the execution of administrative

action does not by itself constitute contempt. I think it would be

improper to use contempt proceedings as a lever obtaining such

execution vide such and such and such a number of judgments. Perhaps

it may advisable in cases where the law does not provide for the

execution in order to ensure that the party affected gives an undertaking

to comply with a order for then the failure to honour such an

undertaking would I think entitled or other party to legitimately use

contempt proceedings to enforce the order of court." My lord this was

followed again by the Supreme Court in the case of Cabbir Hasson Vs.

Fairline Garments 1990 1 SLR page 394. Hon. HjL Justice Mark

Fernando expressly said, "that failure to comply in order of Court does

not much due to contempt per se. Here there is no allegation in the

charge sheet that is willful, virtual defiance or calculated to lower the

estimation of the Court. The ex facie the charge sheet does not say so.

Your willful disobedience not calculated to dishonor and does not say

brings the Court into disrepute as evidenced by the charge sheet." The

9

I!

J I!i i ,!

t I I i

dicta appear at page 400. "Except there lS willful compliance,

noncompliance or defines on the part of the respondents failed to would

not ordinary per se the contempt of Court and cited the case of Ismail vs.

Ismail. The assertion the charge sheet is mere none compliance." Now My

Lords there is provision in Civil Procedure Code, Section 216 sets out the

nature of the decrees that can be passed, orders that can be passed.

Clause 'c' says it commands a person to do or refrain from doing an act.

The modality in which decrees could be passed i.e. 216 (e) is material for

the present purposes.

Section 217 (e) - A decree or order of court may command the person

against whom it operates - do the following:

to pay money etc ...

From Court: That is the procedure of contempt if it comes before

the DC?

Yes My Lord. My submission where there is authority say, where there is

provision for execution you must have recourse to the particular

provision because as Your Lordships' aware where the act creates a

specific remedy you must follow that. Section 334 of the Civil Procedure

Code is material. How enforce, you can't command the person to do the

physical act you can get recompense. It says mandatory and restraining

orders clause (e) & (t). There is in line with the submission of rather dicta

10

m the judgment which say that there is a provIsIon for execution you

can't use this as a thumbscrew. The man doesn't comply you can get

damages, which sought of contempt of Court. Unless there is an

additional opposing he throws the summons himself I won't get it or

make some commence about the Court. Everyday Your Lordships pass

orders for instance in a land action. It doesn't comply. He asked to

vacate the land, it doesn't go. You take out. That's not contempt. My

submission is, the authorities say noncompliance of an order of Court

unless they add an element which shows either defiance that was in

manifesting In the charge sheet. Charge sheet merely says

noncompliance. My submission is ex facie it does not disclose a charge of

contempt. May I know with this context referred to the charge sheet. It

says 1) On the 18t of May failing to return the physical custody of the 2nd

Respondent in case number such and such to the 18t Respondent is case

number such and such, District Court of Colombo by 8.00 a.m. 2) On the

8th of May 2016 failing to return the physical custody of the 2nd

Respondent in case number such and such to the 18t Respondent,

District Court of Colombo by 8.00 a.m. No ascertain either willful or

contumacious conduct which committed they are affirmed to the Court,

not deny rights of parties. That is so you must request 334. So my

respectful submission is that therefore ex facie the offence of contempt is

11

not made out and therefore that these proceedings cannot be continued

on two reasons:-

1) The more appropriate forum in the District Court.

2) Fundamentally the charge is flawed and consequently no

proceedings of contempt can be continued.

Counsel for the petitioner Mr. Eraj de Silva submits as foUows:-

With respect My Lord we were unaware of these sort of objections

because my learned very senior President's Counsel said that he will

consider whether this evidence can be adopted. We didn't expect this

type of objection. But having being in the state of unawareness on my

learned friend's own judgments we can show Your Lordships' Court that

with greatest respect there is no substance to what the learned

President's Counsel said. Because my learned President's Counsel in his

eloquence is very very selective in what he chose to read to Your

Lordships' Court. On the submission first of the question of whether

noncompliance of order of Court will be contempt of court and whether

one is to be willful or not on my learned friend's own judgments I say

with respect noncompliance is contempt. My learned friend did not read

this part. It was the distinction between directive orders and declaratory

orders and in fact my learned friend did not read that part. With respect

in the case of disobedience to injunctions and undertakings given to

12

court of curSIve orders that means directory orders there is strict

liability, but in the case of other orders noncompliance with the

judgment of a court would not ordinarily be contempt of Court. So it

draws the distinction between directive orders and non-directory

declaratory orders. In the case cited Dayawathi vs. Fernando is a case of

a declaration. In the case of a declaration of a status then there might

have to be some will. But in directive orders such as this a case before

Your Lordships' Court where there is a very clear direction that the

physical custody of the child must be handed over to the mother at 8.00

a.m. and bitterly fought case. In those circumstances, the learned

Court gave a direction to the parties. It's a custody order. What more

directory than this. If I may handover the portion of that judgment that

to Your Lordships it has been also highlighted in red. I am taking the

judgment of my learned friend that part was not read to Court. I say

with respect there has to be strict compliance of this sort of orders.

Otherwise the whole judicial process of whole courts of Sri Lanka will be

severely undermined and people will take the law in to their own hands

as it is alleged that this particular respondent has done in this case and

in several other instances. We have pleaded that he willfully disobey but

we don't need to go that far. The submission that my learned friend

made has no basis whatsoever. And that is why perhaps it was taken in

the first instance when this case proceeded. But after this case came to

13

!

f ! I I !

I I !

1

~ i II

~ ! t ,

~ f

a certain point and it looks like the accused would be sent there would

be some sanction against the accused. Now all these technical

objections start coming. So I said it is not fair to the petitioner and to

the judicial system of Your Lordships' Court.

My second objection which came first on the question of jurisdiction of

Your Lordships' Court. On the judgments cited by my learned friend

itself again there is no substance. My learned friend failed to cite the

Galle Face Hotel case which is cited in this judgment in the case of Cyril

Gardiner which very explicitly says that the original courts had a power

to punish of contempt only if it is merely in the face of the court or if

there is a specific provision of law that makes it so punishable. That is

cited in this judgment. Now in the judgment cited by my learned

President's Counsel, the application for contempt before the Court, the

particular provision of law was 183 (b) of the Civil Procedure Code. In

terms of 183 (b) there is an express punishment for contempt of Court

(Counsel reads the 183 (b) of the Civil Procedure Code). Besides that

there is an offence for contempt of Court disclosed in the relevant section

itself. So therefore, it accords with the Cyril Gardiner case and the

relevant statute gives the power of punishment of contempt and therefore

the original court has power to punish. So completely distinguishable

from this case. Because in this case there is no provision and both

learned President's Counsel never cited before this Court any particular

14 I I I

j ,

provision of law that makes this punishable for contempt unlike section

183 (b). So this judgment is right in accordance with Cyril Gardiner's

case which I cited before Your Lordships' Court. Then the other

judgment that learned President's Counsel cited is a restraining order

under the Companies Act. It is completely different and in that case that

was the High Court. In that case, Their Lordships' also held that Section

18 of the Judicature Act specially empowers the High Court to punish

for contempt. But this is in the District Court. These are all Court of

Appeal Judgments and the case of Cyril Gardiner was not cited before

this Court. This offence of contempt with respect noncompliance with

the custody order is not something done in the face of the Court, the

word used in the judgment is ex facie curia. Not in the face of the Court

neither is it made explicitly punishable for contempt. I say with respect

that these matters under Judicature Act are punishable for contempt

and in terms of Constitution. It is only Your Lordships' Court that has

the power to punish for contempt. So I say that these objections are

without basis.

Thirdly, I say at this stage these objections cannot be taken. This is not

the stage to take. Because at this stage the charge sheet has been read

out. This is the stage for pleading. If these objections were to be taken

they should have been taken first by way of filing objections to the

summons and then taken at that stage. Now that stage has passed and

15

!, II ! l I Ii ! I I I! IIf

~ I I

t (

j I ,

in any event already evidence has been led. This is the stage that the

accused pleads and after the charge sheet is read out taken at that stage.

I say with respect the respondent is estopped from taking these sort of

objections without prejudice to my submission that on the basis of the

judgment cited by my learned friend alone there is no substance in his

objections and therefore, I respectfully ask from Your Lordships' take the

plea from the accused and to start this inquiry.

Reply to the submissions of Counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Eraj de

Silva, by Counsel for the respondent Mr. Faisz Musthapha, PC.

My Lord, My first submission, may I take Your Lordship the Case of

Ismail vs. Ismail, this is a case where there is a cursive order, this was a

direct order made by the Court as here, directing the respondent to

install a boiler within a certain period at a certain location. The direct

cursive order directing the respondent to do that. There was

disobedience, noncompliance, Ismail vs. Ismail and proceedings were

contempt to resorted to as well as the damages, and Their Lordships

said that the mere noncompliance would not be punishable for contempt

in fact specifically Your Lordship note 2nd page My Lord, there is a

reference at page 191 Section 334 of the Civil Procedure Code. This is a

curSIve order, not a declaratory order commanding the respondent to

comply and Bertram CJ specifically said (Counsel reads page 191)

16

r f

r !

"Noncompliance of the judgment of the Court is not in ordinary

circumstances contempt of Court. They are passing overlook the fact that

the proceedings are inappropriate and that the law has expressive

provided for or the case in question by Section 334 of the Civil Procedure

Code. Oblivious of this fact the Court made order against the respondent

punishing for contempt and subsequently the plaintiff brought this

action against the defendant claiming damages." So my submission is

that authoritatively that is the case that I cited to Your Lordship, in fact

I cited that portion apparently my learned friend's attention His Lordship

says cursive order certainly, even non-cursive orders he says where it

made a declaratory, you must give the undertaking. This IS not a

declaratory order. This is a cursive order directing me to produce the

child. But the judgment says, (H/L Justice Amarasinge's judgment, page

395). This is a cursive order, but even in respect of non-cursive order I

mean merely declaratory unless there is an undertaking on the parties

you cannot proceed by way of contempt and Section 183(b)referred to my

learned friend supports you because ordinarily it is not punishable.

Section 183(b) says it is a punishable as contempt. Ordinarily it is not.

So my submission is that unless there is willful contumacious conduct,

it is does not punishable for contempt and the charge sheet aver that.

From Court

President's Counsel Mr. Faisz Musthapha appearing for the

respondent takes up a preliminary objection as stated above and Mr.

Eraj de Silva responded to it. We heard submissions of both Counsel

and it appears some of these materials are dealing with the substantive

matter and it will be appropriate for the Court to decide after hearing the

evidence of the parties. Therefore, the Court allows the case to proceed

and make a decision at the end of it.

The respondent was asked whether he is comfortable and

understanding the language in English, Sinhala or Tamil. The accused

answered that he is comfortable in English. The Court asks whether he

has any objections the proceedings to be conducted in English. The

accused says that he is comfortable and he has no objection of

conducting these proceedings in English. Now we ask the Counsel for the

complainant whether he is comfortable to have these proceedings in

English. On instructions, Counsel for the Complainant says that he has

no objections. Both are comfortable in English. Hence the proceedings

will be conducted in English. If necessary, if any party needs any

translation in English, Tamil or Sinhala it can be provided by the Court.

or even smaller. He was very small, very tender age. (Witness is

crying) When I try to remember all the incidents Sir, it gets very

was so hard.

Court. Now this was a bitterly fought custody case as you said.

Now there was an order given by the District Court. Is that correct?

A: Yes.

their Lordships Court and you seek permission to mark that order

meet the charge of contempt.

Q: Now it's like this way, if you goes back to the same Court, you will

turn back and say you are appearing your own case. So then what

happened?

A: My Lord even in the High Court case that was sent back the same

issue surfaces.

Q: There is a different there, Now in this case, he gave the order and

it's violated and You are sending back and the other Court has a

supervisory jurisdiction Under Section 105(3) and you can overall

supervise the Court as well as the subject matter.?

A: But likewise in the case that was sent back, where the order was

made by the Original Court by the High Court and the other Me

Lords Commercial High Court. It was sent back to the same

Court.

Q: Commercial High Court that we won't get the jurisdiction?

A: It has Me Lords, Section 105(3) has.

Q: Section 105 (3) has.

A: Section 18 conferred that jurisdiction. The contempt is ordinarily

dealt with by the sitting Judge. For instance if there is something

in the course of proceedings it has to go before the same Judge.

Q: No. proceedings different. This is violation of an order.

Unfortunately, I have some material, because I heard this case. I

heard the evidence. I may be going to hear it again or I may not. So

it says it's more than beyond what we see.

A: Your Lordships see we are not commencing de novo. The point is

this. Two aspects. One is troubling Your Lordship is whether it

could be sent back to the same Court, because is that District

Judge sitting there. But the answer to that is in contempt

proceedings it ordinarily goes before the same judge you can't

avoid it. In fact the law contemplates that. In the two judgments

that I gave Your Lordships, it was sent back to the same Court.

Then as to whether the question is in order to commence upon

proceedings there should be an offence known to the law. When

you merely say the charge sheet, you have not complied, the

answer to that is that is through the ex-crucial proceedings. It

doesn't disclose any offence for contempt. May it be you may lead

evidence but my submission is you have to lead the evidence

enlighten to the charge sheet.

Q: Has the President preferred a Charge Sheet here?

A: Yes My Lord there is.

My Lord my submission is the ingredients do not disclose the

offence of contempt.

Q: That comes at the end of it?

A: No My Lord even at the commencement. That is why I am declined

to plead because the charge sheet does not disclose the offence of

contempt. That is why I asked disclose an offence known to the

law. The mere fact that you don't comply the order of Court does

not by itself constitute contempt. Your Lordship sees the

authorities say specially a cursive order there is a provision for

execution Section 334. Ismail vs. Ismail said that is not an

offence. The point I am making is ex-facie on the face of the charge

sheet there is no offence disclosed. It is different from saying Your

Lordship sees a finding at the end the ex-facie does not disclose

an offence known to the law because the alternative is there is

proVISIOn for execution and mere noncompliance in terms of

Ismail vs. Ismail does not constitute the offence of contempt. It

does not disclose an offence of contempt. Those are my

submissions.
