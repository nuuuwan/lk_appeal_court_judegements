Judgment

S. Thurairaja PC J

Accused Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as appellants) above mentioned

were originally indicted at the High Court of Colombo as follows;

I) Possession of 4.5 grams of Heroin punishable under section 54 A (d) of the

poison, Opium dangerous drugs Act.

II) On the same date, time and the place and in the same course of transaction

trafficking of 4.5 grams of Heroin punishable under section 54 A (b) of the Act

above mentioned.

After the trial, accused appellants were found guilty by the trial Judge and was sentenced

them to Life Imprisonment.

Being aggrieved with the said conviction and sentence the appellants preferred an appeal

to the Court of Appeal. The Counsel for the appellants submitted following grounds of

appeal for the consideration of the Court:

a) The Learned Trial Judge has failed to give sufficient time for the Appellants to

prepare for their case, thereby violated their Right to have fair trial.

b) The learned trial Judge failed to consider Improbability of the detection.

c) Only one witness gave. evidence and the Judge relied on the uncorroborated

evidence of the single Police investigating officer.

d) The learned Trial Judge perused and relied on the notes of the investigating

officers, which were not marked or produced at the High Court Trial.

The Counsel for the appellants submits, that the appellants had retained a Counsel and

the trial had commenced on the 25-10-2006 and continued till 7-11-2006. On the 2nd of

July 2007, this case was taken up before a new Judge. The Counsel who appeared for all

the appellants did not represent them. The Court assigned a new Counsel for all

appellants, adopted previous proceedings and continued with the trial.

Counsel for the appellants submit that the Attorney at Law who was assigned for the

appellants was not given sufficient time to prepare for his case of which resulted in no fair

trial to the accused appellants.

The above ground of appeal is a preliminary issue to be dealt with the basic rights of the

appellant. If it is held in favour of the appellants, it will result that there was no trial held

and it will be referred for are-trial.

Duty of a High Court Judge upon receiving an indictment is provided in Section 195 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (CCPA). More specifically section 195 (g) provides as

follows;

where the accused on being asked by court so requests, assign an attorney-at-law

for his defence.

In this case, on the date of the trial before a new judge the accused appellants were

unrepresented on a charge where, if they are found guilty they could face death penalty

or Life imprisonment.

It will be appropriate to refer the relevant provision in our Constitution. Article 13 (3)

provides for fair trial and it reads as follows;

(3) Any person charged with an offence shall be entitled to be heard in person or

by an attorney-at-law, at a fair trial by a competent court.

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which was adopted by the

General Assembly of the United Nations on 16th December, 1966 and entered into force

on 23rd March, 1976. Sri Lanka has acceded to the aforesaid Covenant on 11th June, 1980.

it has become necessary for the Government of Sri Lanka to enact appropriate legislation

to give effect to those civil and political rights referred to in the aforesaid Covenant, for

which no adequate legislative recognition has yet been granted. Therefore, the said ICCPR

CA 286/2009 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 8

was brought in as a legislation by 56 of 2007. (the above is quoted from the preamble of

the said Act)

Article 4 (1) provides as follows;

(1) A person charged of a criminal offence under any written law, shall be

entitled-

(a) to be afforded an opportunity of being tried in his presence/

(b) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing

and where he does not have any such assistance, to be informed of that right,'

(c) to have legal assistance assigned to him in appropriate cases where the interest

of justice so requires and without any payment by him, where he does not have

sufficient means to pay for such assistance:

(d) to examine or to have examined the witnesses against him and to obtain the

attendance of witnesses on his behalf, under the same conditions as witnesses

called against him/

(e) to have the assistance of an interpreter where such person cannot understand

or speak the language in which the trial is being conducted,' and

(f) not to be compelled to 'testify against himself or to confess guilt,

The learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) submits that the accused appellants were

represented at the beginning of the trial before the High Court and the trial Judge had

directed all parties that this trial will be taken on day to day basis. When the case was

taken up on the 2nd July 2007 accused appellants were unrepresented and the Counsel on

record had informed court that she will not be appearing for the appellants anymore, Trial

Judge then had assigned a counsel and continued with the trial. (This fulfil the

requirements under Section 195 (g) of the CCPA, hence the appellants had a fair trial.)

Learned DSG also submits that the assigned counsel did not complain or make a request

for a postponement hence there is no violation of a fair trial. Counsel quotes an

observation of UN Human Rights Committee on Wright v. Jamaica, Communication

No. 349/1989, U.N. Doc. CCPRlC/45/D/349/1989 (1992).

8.4 The right of an accused person to have adequate time and facilities for the

preparation of his or her defence is an important element of the guarantee of a

fair trial and a corollary of the principle of equality of arms. In cases in which a

capital sentence may be pronounced, it is axiomatic that sufficient time must be

granted to the accused and his or her counsel to prepare the defence for the tria{

this requirement applies to all the stages of the judicial proceedings. The

determination of what constitutes ''adequate time" requires an assessment of the

individual circumstances of each case. There was considerable pressure to start

the trial as scheduled on 17 March 1983, particularly because of the return of the

deceased's wife from the United States to give evidence; moreover, it is

uncontested that Mr. Wright's counsel was instructed only on the very morning

the trial was scheduled to start and, accordingly, had less than one day to prepare

Mr. Wright's defence and the cross-examination of witnesses. However, it is

equally uncontested that no adjournment of the trial was requested by either of

Mr. Wright's counsel. The Committee therefore does not consIder that the

inadequate preparation of the defence may be attributed to the judicial authorities

of the State party; if counsel had felt that they were not properly prepared, it was

incumbent upon them to request the adjournment of the trial. Accordingly, the

Committee finds no violation of article 14, paragraph 3(b).8.5 With respect to the

alleged violation of article 14, paragraph 3(e), it is uncontested that the trialjudge

refused a request from counsel to call a witness on Mr. Wright's behalf It is not

apparent, however, that the testimony sought from this witness would have

buttressed the defence in respect of the charge of murder, as it merely concerned

CA 286/2009 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 8

the nature of the injuries allegedly inflicted on the author by a mob outside the

Waterford police station. In the circumstances, the Committee finds no violation

of this provision.

Considering the facts and the procedure followed in the said case this in a way support

the stance taken up by the appellants. In the above-mentioned case the Prosecution and

defence had taken 'sufficient' time to prepare for the case and the procedure followed

was much favourable to the accused person. The committee found that after having

sufficient time, requesting further time to call a witness can be rejected. We should be

mindful that they had several pre-trial conferences before that case was taken up for trial.

The DSG attempted to fortify his argument by referring the Rules of Supreme Court. It will

be appropriate to consider the procedure followed in this case.

The alleged incident (raid) had happened on the 15th August 1998, indictment was

preferred on 15th November 2001 and the trial commenced on the 25th October 2005. In

the meantime, the Second accused had died in the prison due to natural causes. Trial

continued till 7th November 2006, then the trial Judge had been elevated to the Court of

Appeal. The succeeding Judge took over the case on the 2nd July 2007 and the appellants

on that day were unrepresented. On that day the appellants were provided with an

assigned counsel and the trial continued. (Vide pages 93 and 94 of the appeal brief)

Further examination in chief of the only prosecution witness continued and halted due

non-availability of productions of the prosecution. It is noted that the assigned Counsel

had made a request to have a copy of the indictment. (vide page 105 of the brief) This

shows that the Counsel for the appellants had appeared even without a copy of the basic

document namely the indictment. It is needless to say that the assigned counsel was not

possessed with any of the information in relation to this case because there is no

endorsement to say the counsel was provided with the brief including the indictment and

other relevant documents.

Our Constitution has enshrined any person who faces a criminal charge is entitled to a fair

trial this is further strengthened by CCPA, ICCPR act and other related laws. Our legal

system also time and again confirmed that Justice should not only appears to be done it

should in fact be done.

In this present case an Attorney at Law was assigned and he was not given any details

about the case. It is mandatory for the court to provide necessary information to the

assigned counsel free of charge. Without any or basic information being given to the

assigned counsel one cannot say a fair trial offered.

Considering the Laws, decided authorities especially the case cited by the DSG, Wright v.

Jamaica, Communication No. 349/1989, U.N. Doc. CCPRlC/45/D/349/1989 (1992) it is

important that the accused person to have a fair trial, it is the duty of the State (Legal

system). If the duty is not fulfilled this court will not hesitate to conclude there is no trial.

Considering the above factors, we find that the accused appellants are entitled to a fresh

trial after granting all their rights provided by law.

Since the first ground of appeal is considered favourably to the accused appellants, we

do not incline to discuss the other grounds.

We quash the conviction and the sentence dated 20th October 2009 and order are-trial.

Re-trial ordered.
