ORDER RELATING TO THE APPLICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION

the 1st and 2nd Respondents. The party who subsequently seeks to

intervene after this application was filed in this Court will be referred to as

the Intervenient Party.

Learned counsel for all the Parties when this case came up on 2017-06-27

before us, agreed to abide by the written submissions, they had filed with

regard to the question of intervention, and requested this Court to

pronounce the order pertaining to the application for intervention after

considering the written submissions, They dispensed with their necessity of

making oral submissions. Therefore this judgment would be based on the

material adduced by the parties in their pleadings and written submissions.

The Petitioners are the directors of the company named Fashion Tex

International (Pvt) Ltd which had employed the Intervenient Petitioner. On

a complaint being made by the Intervenient Petitioner regarding

nonpayment of his salary the 1st Respondent had issued a certificate in

terms of section 3 D of the Wages Boards Ordinance. As the Petitioners did

not comply with the order of the 1st Respondent to pay the specified sum

of money to the Intervenient Petitioner, the 1st Respondent had instituted

proceedings in the Magistrate's Court to recover it as a fine.

Learned Magistrate had accordingly ordered the said amount be recovered

as a fine. The Petitioners thereafter filed an application for revision in the

7

High Court of Colombo. Learned High Court Judge having heard parties

had dismissed the said revision application. The Petitioners have now

appealed to this Court and the said appeal is said to have not yet been

listed!.

The Petitioners have admitted that the interest of the Intervenient Party

was looked after by an Attorney at law appearing for the aggrieved party

both in the Magistrate's Court as well as in High Court2 The Petitioners

however has failed to put forward any acceptable basis as to why this

Court should refuse the application made by the Intervenient Party to

intervene in this case. Further, in the light of the facts and circumstances

of this case which is an application for revision under Article 138 of the

Constitution, it is the view of this Court that no prejudice would be caused

to any party by allowing the Intervenient Party to intervene in this case.

After all, it is the money due to him that the learned Magistrate had

recovered in the impugned order. Thus, he could be considered as a party

who has sufficient interest in this matter.

1 Paragraph 2 (XIV) of the written submission filed by the Intervenient Party.

2 Paragraph 11 of the written submission filed by the Petitioners.

For the foregoing reasons we decide to allow the Intervenient Party to

intervene in this case as an Intervenient Respondent to this revision

application.
