JUDGEMENT

K.K. Wickremasinghe J.

This is an appeal against the order of the of the learned High Court Judge of

Matara.The Appellant in this case was alleged to have committed an offence of

cheating. He was charged in the Magistrate Court of Matara under case No.

3

69825 and 72780 for cheating of Rs. 900,000 and Rs.650, 000 which is punishable

under section 403 of the Penal Code.

Evidence was amalgamated and one order was delivered by the learned

Magistrate acquitting the appellant.

Upon acquittal, the aggrieved party filed a revision application in the High Court

of Matara(as the sanction to appeal was not given).At the hearing of the revision

application, it was held by the Learned High Court Judge that a retrial be held.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the accused appellant has preferred this appeal

to this court.

The ir.tervcnient complainant petitioner respondent ~md the appellant were

business persons. The appellant was given RS. 900,000 by the 1st Respondent and

a cheque for such amount was given where the cheque was not postdated. The

cheque was returned due to lack of funds. Subsequently the account was closed

by the appellant.

The basis for the order of the Learned Magistrate amalgamating the two cases

was that the charge sheet was irregular and upon that the case was dismissed.

The Learned Magistrate was of the view that the charge should h~ve been framed

under section 398 to be read with section 403 of the Penal Code. The Learned

Magistrate has gone into evidence and considered same and yet one reason for

acquitting the Appellant is the fault in the charge sheet.

\

The Learned High Court Judge in revising the order of the Learned Magistrate held

that the duty to frame charge is upon the Learned Magistrate in terms of section

182 and by section 167 such charge sheet could be amended. As it was not done

so the case was sent for retrial. Before arriving the decision, the Learned HCJ has

gone into all aspects of the case. He has held that, since the charge sheet is illegal,

the pronouncement upon it is void.

In the case of AG Vs Piyasena 63 NLR 489, it was held that the Learned Magistrate

holds that a charge was illegally framed, and then the accused could be retried.

Considering above, it is apparent that the order of the LHCJ is not irregular, illegal,

arbitrary or malicious and it is sound in Law.

Thus, there is no ground to reverse the order of the Learned High Court Judge.

Appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
