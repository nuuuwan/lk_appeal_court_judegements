This is an appeal from the High Court of Hambanthota.

The Petitioner Appellant (the Appellant) was the tenant cultivator

of the paddy land called "Galaboda Kumbura Lot 3" under the landlord,

the 15t Respondent Respondent. (the 15t Respondent) By letter dated

09.08.2000, (P2) the 15t Respondent under the Agrarian Services

(Amendment) Act informed the Appellant with copies to the 2nd

Respondent Respondent Agrarian Officer of the area and the 3 rd

Respondent Respondent Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services

(hereinafter sometime called and referred as the 2nd or 3rd Respondent

respectively) that he has decided to sell the paddy land at the rate of Rs.

60,0001- per acre. The Appellant by letter dated 20.08.2000 (P3) informed

the 15t Respondent that he is willing to purchase at the rate ofRs. 25,0001-

per acre. Thereafter, the 2nd Respondent informed the Appellant by the

letter dated 15.11.2000 (P4) that the Agrarian service committee acting

under section 12 A (3) of the Agrarian Services Act has determined that

the price of the paddy land shall be Rs. 40,0001- per acre. The Appellant,

on receipt of the said determination, informed the 3rd Respondent by the

letter marked P5 that he is willing to purchase the paddy land at the price

determined and requested four seasons i.e. two years time to pay the

money. The 2nd Respondent by letter dated 19.01.2001 (P6) informed the

Appellant to purchase the paddy land before 05.02.2001 and in default a

certificate will be issued permitting the 15t Respondent to sell the land to III

i

3

outsider. Since the Appellant failed to purchase the paddy land before the

specified date a certificate dated 09.04.2001 CPll) was issued permitting

the 1 st Respondent to sell the land to an outsider. Accordingly the 1 st

Respondent has sold the land to the 4th Respondent by deed no 2237

dated 09.09.2002 attested by Y.M.Faruk N.P.

The Appellant being dissatisfied with the decision of the 3 rd

Respondent filed an application for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

certiorari to quash the certificate dated 09.04.2001 marked Pll and a writ

of mandamus to compel the 2nd & 3rd Respondent to decide that the land

shall be sold to the Appellant.

The learned High Court Judge after inquiry dismissed the

application. This appeal is from the said dismissal.

The 2nd and 3rd Respondents raised a preliminary objection that

there is an un due delay in making the application and therefore the

application shall be rejected in limine. On merits the Respondents

argument is that the decision of the 3 rd Respondent is not ultra vires and

therefore no writ of certiorari lies. The Appellant in response argue that

the order was made under a repealed law and therefore the decision is bad

in law. There contention is notwithstanding the delay a decision ab initio

void cannot stand.

Before going in to the aspect of delay, I will first consider whether

the decision of the 3 rd Respondent is ab initio void.

The 1 st Respondent acting under section 12 of the Agrarian

Services Act informed the Appellant about his wiliness to sell the paddy

land. The law prevailed at that time was the Agrarian services Act No 56

of 1979 as amended. This Act was repealed by the Agrarian Development

Act No. 46 of 2000. The new Act came into operation on 18th August

t II

t I i I

2000. From that date onwards the old Act stand repealed. The inquiry

concluded after the new Act.

Section 12 A of the old law as amended by Act No. 4 of 1991 has

provided for the landlord to offer the land first to the tenant cultivator

when transferring the paddy land. The section reads thus;

12A. (1) Where the landlord of an extent of paddy land in respect of

which there is a tenant cultivator intends to sell such extent, he

shall, in the first instance, communicate in writing his intention

and the price at which he intends to sell such extent, to the

tenant cultivator. A copy of such communication shall be sent

by the landlord by registered post to the Agrarian Services

Committee within whose area of authority such extent of paddy

land is situate.

(2) If the tenant cultivator is willing to purchase such extent of

paddy land at the price nominated by the landlord, he shall

indicate his willingness to the Agrarian Services Committee

which shall fix a period within which the transfer is to be

completed.

(3) If the tenant cultivator is willing to purchase such extent of

paddy land but states that the price nominated by the landlord

is excessive, the Agrarian Services Committee may, in

consultation with the landlord, determine a price which in its

opinion is reasonable and fix a period within which the transfer

is to be completed.

(4) Where the tenant cultivator is not willing to purchase such

extent of paddy land or is not willing to purchase it at the price

determined by the Agrarian Services Committee, or where such

5

tenant cultivator having agreed to purchase such extent at the

price nominated by the landlord or determined by the Agrarian

Services Committee as the case may be does not complete the

transfer within the period fixed therefor, the Agrarian Services

Committee shall issue a certificate to that effect and thereupon

the landlord may proceed to sell such extent to any other

person,

(5) Any transfer by the owner of an extent of paddy land in

contravention of the provisions of this section shall be null and

void and shall render the person in occupation of such extent

liable to be evicted in accordance with the provisions of section

6 section (3) of section 4 shall apply.

The new law I.e. the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000,

provide for the same but with a different outcome. Section 2 of the Act

reads thus;

2. (1) The owner of an extent of paddy land in respect of which

there is a tenant cultivator, who intends to sell such extent, shall

in the first instance make an offer to sell such extent to the

tenant cultivator. Such offer shall be made to the tenant

Cultivator by communication in writing, and sent by registered

post, stating the price at which he offers to sell such extent. The

owner shall cause a copy of such communication to be sent by

registered post to the Agrarian Development Council within

whose area of authority such paddy land is situated.

(2) If upon receipt of the communication under subsection (1). the

tenant cultivator is willing to purchase such extent of paddy

land at the price offered by the owner, he shall indicate his

willingness to the owner and the Agrarian Development

I

II

I I

Council by communication in writing sent by registered post

and the Council shall fix a period within which the transfer

s hall be completed.

(3) (a) Where the tenant cultivator is willing to purchase such

extent of paddy land but states that the price offered by the

owner is excessive, the Agrarian Development Council may

in consultation with the owner determine a price which in its

opinion is reasonable, having regard to the market value of

paddy lands in the area and proceed to fix a period within

which the transfer shall be completed.

(b) On the price being fixed, the tenant cultivator shall

thereupon purchase such extent of paddy land either at the

price offered by the owner or as determined by the Agrarian

Development Council, as the case may be and shall complete

the transfer within the period flXed.

(4) Where the Commissioner-General is satisfied, after inquiry,

that a tenant cultivator has failed and neglected to act in

accordance with the provisions of subsection (2) or (3), the

Commissioner-General shall take action to evict such tenant

cultivator in accordance with the provisions of section 8.

(5) Any transfer by the owner of any extent of paddy land in

contravention of the provisions of this section shall after inquiry

be declared null and void by the Commissioner- General and

shall render the person in occupation of such extent under such

transfer, liable to be evicted in accordance with the provisions

of section 8.

I I I I

(6) Where a transfer of any extent of paddy land is declared null

and void by the Commissioner-General a copy of such

declaration shall be transmitted under section 5 to the Registrar

of Lands of the District in which such extent of paddy land is

situated.

Subsections 1,2 and 3 of the section 12A of the previous Act is same as

the sub sections 1,2 and 3 of the new Act except for the Agrarian Service

Committee in the old law, the Agrarian Development Council was

inserted in the new law. Under section 99 (2) (c) of the new Act there is a

transitional provision that the Agrarian Service Committee to funcition

until the Agrarian Development Council is established the section reads;

(c) (i) the Agrarian Services Committees established under the

Agrarian Services Act, No. 58 of 1979. shall continue to

function till the Agrarian Development Councils are

established under this Act;

Therefore, the Agrarian Service Committee can make a

determination on the price of the paddy land.

The repealed Act provided for a certificate to be issued to the

landlord permitting him selling the land to outsider in case of the tenant

cultivator not buying the land within the prescribed time period. In the

new legislation instead of the certificate, the tenancy right of the tenant

cultivator has been terminated. The law made that the tenant cultivator

liable to be evicted. A tenant cultivator can be evicted only on the

termination of his tenancy rights. Therefore it is obvious that the

Legislature has intended that the tenancy should come to an end with the

refusal/failure to buy the land after indicating his wiliness to buy the land

under section 2 (2) or (3) of the Act. Once the tenancy rights have been

terminated, a certificate is issued or not is not material, the owner can

III I,I Ir t

8

exercise his ownership rights without any encumbrance. Disposing his

land to a person of his choice is a right of an owner of a property.

The document marked P 11 is only to inform the 1 st Respondent to

sell the land to someone else on the basis that the tenant cultivator

Appellant is not buying the same. Under these circumstances, issuing of

the document marked P 11 is not ultra vires and is not ab initio void.

The Appellant filed this application to quash the order of the 2nd

Respondent dated 09.04.2001 marked Pll. The application was filed in

the High Court of Hambanthota on 07.01.2003; that is one year and nine

months after the order. The Appellant has not explained the delay. The

Counsel for the Respondents argues that it is an inordinate delay and the

application shall be dismissed in limine. He has cited several authorities

in support.

In the case of K. A. Gunasekera v. T. B. Weerakoon (Assistant

Government Agent, Kurunegala), 73 NLR 262 at 263 it was held that 7

months is a too long period without any explanation.

In the case of Hopman and others v. Minister of Lands and Land

Development and others [1994] 2 Sri L R 240 it has been held that "the

appellants have failed to give a satisfactory explanation for their conduct

and the delay in making their application to the Court of Appeal and

hence that Court cannot be faulted for exercising its discretion against the

issue of the writ."

Sarath Hulangamuwa v. Siriwardena, Principal, Visakha

Vidyalaya, Colombo 5 and others [1986] 1 Sri L R 275 is a case filed in

challenging the refusal to admit a child to the school. The Court held in

that case that the application has been made more than 10 months later. II

Writs are extraordinary remedies granted to obtain speedy relief under

exceptional circumstances and time is of the essence of the application.

In the case of Jayaweera v. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian

Services Ratnapura and another [1996] 2 Sri L R 70 Per Jayasuriya, J.

held that " A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the

issue of a Writ of Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course,

as a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to

relief, still the Court has a discretion to deny him relief having regard to

his conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all

valid impediments which stand against the grant of relief."

In the case of P. B. Dissanayake v. 1. O. K. G. Fernando and

another 71 NLR 356 it has been held that where the extraordinary process

of this Court is sought alter such a long lapse of time, it is essential that

the reasons for the delay in seeking relief should be set out in the papers

filed in this Court.

In the present case the application has been made after a long delay

of one year and nine months. There is no explanation given in the

Application for the delay. Appellant is not entitled to relief as a matter of

course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled

to relief, still the Court has a discretion to deny him relief having regard

to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all

valid impediments which stand against the grant of relief. The delay has

to be explained as the time is of the essence of the application.

In the case of B iso Menika vs. Cyril de Al wis and Others [1982] 1

Sri L R 368 Sharvananda, J. (as he was then) held that a Writ of

Certiorari lies at the discretion of Court and will not be denied if the

proceedings were a nullity; even if there is delay, especially where denial

I I

10

of the Writ is likely to cause great injustice, it will be issued. In the

present case there is on nullity of the proceedings. On the other hand

there is no injustice done to the Appellant because the lSI Respondent,

even he had the opportunity to evict the Appellant, has not done so.

Instead the Appellant was offered to be the tenant cultivator of the new

owner, the 4th Respondent. Therefore denial of the writ will not cause

injustice to the Appellant.

Under these circumstances I see no reason to interfere with the

finding of the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly the appeal is dismissed. No costs.
