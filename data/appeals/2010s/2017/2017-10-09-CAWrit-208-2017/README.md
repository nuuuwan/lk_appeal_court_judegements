Counsel for the Petitioner in support of this application moves for notices

and stay orders as prayed for in terms of prayer (c) and (d) to the Petition. The

Learned D.S.G. and Counsel appearing for the 4th Respondent have objected to the

said relief been granted.

The Petitioner was informed by letter dated 19th August 2015, regarding an

inquiry bearing reference No. em:5)h:5):)e3 3/Z/2/DIl76/20 15, by the 3rd Respondent

in respect of a complaint made by the 4th Respondent. At the said inquiry the

Petitioner and the 4th Respondent stated their respective positions in writing and

with supporting documents.

The Petitioner states that the 4th Respondent in his dual capacity as an

employer, functioned as the Head of the Board of Directors and in the role of an

employee, as the Managing Director/ General Manager and further states that the

4th Respondent has agreed with the management to be paid a "Directors fee" for

his functions qua Director. Therefore the Petitioner contends that the 4th

Respondent was not entitled to EPF, ETF or other statutory payments related to

salaries.

The 4th Respondent as an employee of the Petitioner had received a

payment which the Petitioner submits was a "Directors fee" and not a 'salary". As

such the issue before the 3 rd Respondent for determination was whether payments

received by the 4th Respondent was a Directors fee or a salary. In this context I

have perused documents marked P4 and the several attachments therein. The

determination of the said inquiry is attached marked P8, where the 2nd Respondent

held that the 4th Respondent is an Employee of the Petitioner and therefore the

Petitioner is liable for payment ofEPF to the 4th Respondent.

Respondents contend that when the Petitioner accepts the fact that the 4th

Respondent is an Employee of the Petitioner the obvious conclusion that could be

arrived at is that the 4th Respondent is an Employee of the Petitioner and therefore

is entitled to all statutory related payments on salary.

In the aforesaid background the question to be answered is has the 2nd

Respondent given adequate reasons in arriving at the said determination where he

has held that the 4th Respondent was an employee of the Petitioner and therefore is

entitled for payment of EPF.

I refer to the Judgement of Ranjith Silva J in CAll 234/06, cited by the

Counsel for the Petitioner. The Court in this case referred to the decision in

Bandara vs Premachandra 1994-1 SLR 301where Fernando J. held,

"The state must, in the public interest, expect high standards

of efficiency and services from public officers in their

dealings with the administration and the public. In the

exercise of constitutional and statutory powers and

jurisdictions, the judiciary must endeavour to ensure that this

expectation is realized. "

At the said inquiry before the 3rd Respondent, the stand taken by the

Petitioner was "whether the amounts paid to the 4th Respondent were paid in

respect of his employment or whether it was paid as a director fee in respect of his

role as a Director of the Petitioner." The said determination in document marked

P8 does not address the issue as to whether the 4th Respondent was paid a

"Directors fee" or whether he was paid a salary by the Petitioner in his capacity as

"General Manager/ Director," but merely state that the 4th Respondent is an

employee and therefore is entitled for payment of EPF.

In the circumstances I find that the Petitioner has been deprived of a

determination on the disputed questions of fact and the reasons for it.

The Learned D.S.G. has also objected to this Petition on the grounds of

undue delay in filing the Petition. However taking into consideration the

documents marked P9, P 11 and P 12 (a) to P 12 (b), I do not see a delay which can

be attributed to the Petitioner.

Accordingly interim orders as prayed for in paragraphs (c) and (d) are

granted.

I issue notice on the Respondents.
