The counsel for the accused appellant made detailed submission and submitted that there is no evidence to connect the accused appellant to the crime. There is no eye witness to the incident. The first witness namely Gamini Karunasena was the brother of the deceased. He gave evidence and said that there was a fight earlier regarding sale of a cattle. The prosecution submits that the dispute of payment of Rs.200 was the motive. As per the evidence of the witness, he says the so-called fight had happened two to three months earlier and it is only an exchange of heated words and he had not heard or seen any fight thereafter. It is important to note that he had not told this to the police or in the non-summary inquiry. That had been observed as a serious omission at the trial. Beyond all, the witness had told in the non-summary inquiry was that there was no fight between the accused and deceased, which is marked as a contradiction (V1). Considering the background, I do not find that PW1 was a credible witness. He contradicted the core issue of his evidence. The trial judge had not considered the evidence of this witness fairly.",

On the day of the incident i.e. on the 2nd August 2004 she confirms that the brothers of the deceased had come home late in the evening and left to the plantain cultivation after few minutes the deceased also went to his cultivation. Since he did not return, she walked up to the bund at around 11.30pm in the night and she couldn't find her husband. She said she had clear visibility, due to moon light. On the following day, in the morning she got to know that her husband is lying dead on the . bund. It was about 60feet (Bamba 10) from the house of the deceased. It is also observed, that she says there was a fight between the deceased and his brother Sunil on a previous occasion on which the deceased was hospitalised.",
