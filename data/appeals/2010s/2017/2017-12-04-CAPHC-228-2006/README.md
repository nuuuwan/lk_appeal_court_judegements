JUDGEMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Learned counsel for both the Parties, when this case came up on 2017-07-

25 before this Court, agreed to have this case disposed of, by way of

written submissions, dispensing with their necessity of making oral

. . submissions. They agreed that this Court could pronounce the judgment

after considering the written submissions they would file. Therefore, this

judgment would be based on the material adduced by parties in their

pleadings and their written submissions.

The Petitioner - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the 1st Respondent) has filed an information in the Primary Court of

Elpitiya, complaining to the Primary Court about a dispute to a possession

of a land.

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into this complaint, by his

order dated 2005-01-28, had ordered that the 1st Respondent is entitled to

the possession of the land in dispute.

Learned Primary Court Judge has come to this conclusion after considering

the documents adduced before him.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Primary Court

Judge of Elpitiya, the Appellant had made a revision application to the

Provincial High Court of Southern Province holden at Balapitiya urging the

High Court to revise the order made by the learned Primary Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court of Balapitiya after hearing parties, by its . .

judgment dated 2006-11-23 had affirmed the order of the Primary Court

and proceeded to dismiss the said revision application.

It is against that judgment of the Provincial High Court that the 1st

Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Appellant) has filed this appeal in this Court.

The Appellant had agreed to be content with filing written submissions to

place his case before this Court. Therefore, it is his responsibility to explain

in his written submissions as to why this Court should interfere with the

judgment of the Provincial High Court.

However, perusal of his written submissions show that he has merely

reproduced the factual positions that had already been agitated at the

lower Courts.

This Court has perused the order of the learned Primary Court judge as

well as the order of the Provincial High Court. This Court is of the view that

there is no illegality or impropriety in the order of the Primary Court. This

Court also cannot observe any irregularity of the proceedings before the

Primary Court.

Further, this Court is unable to gather any exceptional circumstance or

even any basis as to why the Provincial High Court should have exercised

its discretionary revisionary jurisdiction to interfere with the order of the

Primary Court.

This Court in several previous judgements has highlighted the provisional

nature of the orders made by the Primary Court under part VII of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979.

This Court has to be mindful that the order under appeal in this case is an

order, which the Provincial High Court has pronounced when exercising its

revisionary jurisdiction. This Court in the case of Jayasekarage Bandulasena

and four others Vs Galla Kankanamge Chaminda and two othersl had held

that an appeal against Provincial High Court judgements in revision

applications filed challenging orders made by Primary Courts under Part VII

of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 cannot be converted to

an appeal against the order of the Primary Court.

As has been stressed by this Court in the case of Punchi Nona V

Padumasena and others2 the Primary Court is only required to take action

of a preventive and provisional nature pending final adjudication of rights

in a civil Court.

This fact taken together with the other material adduced before court

proves to the satisfaction of this Court that there is no merit in this appeal.

Thus, this Court decides to dismiss this application with costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
