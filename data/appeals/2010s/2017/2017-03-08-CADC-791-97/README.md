This is an appeal from the District Court of Gampaha.

The plaintiff -respondent instituted an action in the District

Court of Gampaha to partitioned the land called Kappuwawatta

alias Mahawatta as per the pedigree in the plaint. After filing the

statements of claim by the parties, the case was taken up for trial

on 21.01.1988 without a contest and the judgment pronounced

on 25.02.1988 declaring the shares of the parties. Thereafter the

interlocutory decree was entered and the commission for

partition was also issued to the Court Commissioner to partition

the land as per the interlocutory decree.

In the mean time an application has been made by

K.A.Sumanawathie to intervene into the action. After an inquiry,

the learned District Judge on 25.01.1991 allowed the application

and added her as the 10th defendant. Thereafter she was allowed

to file a statement of claim but before filing the state of claim, she

moved for a fresh commission to survey the land.

After filing the statements of claim the case was fixed

for trial again. On the trial date, the plaintiff- respondent raised

an objection that since the judgment has been entered on 25th

February 1988 by the learned District Judge after taking

evidence and the interlocutory decree has been entered, the

order of the Court dated 25.01.1991 allowing the 10th defendant

to intervene and file a state of claim is not legal. The Court

inquired into the matter and decided that the order dated

25.01.1991 is per incuriam and was made without jurisdiction.

The learned District Judge decided to proceed with the

interlocutory decree already entered. Being aggrieved by the said

order, the 18t defendant appealed to this Court.

Section 48 of the Partition Law brings a finality to the

interlocutory decree, Subsection 1 of Section 48 reads:

(1) Save as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the

interlocutory decree entered under section 26 and the final

i ! , i I I

I,

I

~ I ! f , i , ,

decree of partition entered under Section 36 shall, subject to

the decision on any appeal which may be preferred there

from, and in the case of an interlocutory decree, subject also

to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, be good an

sufficient evidence of the title of any person as to any right,

share or interest awarded therein to him and be final and

conclusive for all purposes against all persons whomsoever,

whatever right, title or interest they have, or claim to have, to

or in the land to which such decree relates and

notwithstanding any omission or defect of procedure or in

the proof of title adduced before the court or the fact that all

persons concerned are not parties to the partition action, and

the right, where or interest awarded by any such decree

shall be free from all encumbrances whatsoever other than

those specified in that decree.

The only instance that a party can intervene after the

interlocutory decree is defined in subsection 4 which reads;

(4)

(a) Whenever a party to a partition action;

(i) has not been serve with summons or

(ii) being a minor or a person of unsound mind, has not

been duly represented by a guardian ad item, or

Paragraph (iii) repeated by ( Section 21,17 and 1997)

(iv) being a party who has duly filed his statement of

claim and registered his address, fails to appear at the

trial.

And in consequence thereof the right title or interest of

such party to or in the land which forms the subject

matter of the interlocutory decree entered in such party

has been extinguished or such party has been

otherwise prejudiced by the interlocutory decree, such

party or where such party is a minor or a person of

unsound mind, a person appointed as guardian and

litem of such party may nor or before the date fixed for

the consideration of the scheme of partition under

section 35 or at any time not later than thirty days after

the return of the person responsibility for the sale under

section 42 is received by court, apply to the court for

special leave to establish the right, title or interest of

such party to or in the said land notwithstanding the

interlocutory decree already entered.

The learned District Judge without considering the finality

of the interlocutory decree, allowed the application of the 10th

defendant to intervene on the basis that the plaintiff was

unaware of the co owners of the land and by that there was an

injustice done to the 10th defendant. This is not a recognized

7

reason under section 48 (4) to intervene after entering the

interlocutory decree.

The learned District Judge considered the objection raised

by the plaintiff and came to the conclusion that the order dated

25.01.1991 where the 10th defendant was allowed to intervene,

was made per incuiram,

Samarakoon C.J. explaining the per incuriam rule held in

the case of Billimoria Vs. Minister of Lands and Land Development

& Mahaweli Development and others (1979) 1 Sri L.R.1 0 at 13 and

14 that;

The Attorney- General contended that the stay order was

one made per incuriam. He cited the case of Alosupillai Vs.

Yavetipillai and another (2) in which Basnayake, J. following the

case of Huddersfield Police Authority Vs. Watson (3) stated A

decision per incuriam is one given when a case or a statute has

not been brought to the attention for the Court and it has given

the decision in ignorance or forgetfulness of the existence of that

case or statute". This statement is by no means exhaustive. In

Morrelle Ltd. Vs Wakeling (4) at 686 the Court observed as

follows:

As a general rule the only cases in which decision should

be held to have been given per incuriam are those of decisions

! ; , Il i

8

gIven In Ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent

statutory provisions or of some authority binding on the court

concerned : so that in such cases some part of the decision or

some step in the reasoning on which it is based is found, on that

account, to be demonstrably wrong. This definition is not

necessarily exhaustive, but cases not strictly within it which can

properly be held to have been decided per incuriam must, in our

judgment, consistently with the stare decisis rule which is and

essential feature of our law, be in the language of Lord Greene

M. R. of the rarest occurrence".

In Young Vs. Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd. (5) at 300, Greene,

Mr. pointed particularly to two classes of decision per incuriam :-

(ii) a decision in ignorance of a previous decision of its

own Court or of a Court of co-ordinate jurisdiction

covering the case, and

(ii) a decision in ignorance of a decision of a higher

Court covering the case which binds the Lower Court.

Lord Denning M. R. was inclined to add another

category of decisions - one where a long standing rule

of the common law has been disregarded because the

, t

\

9

Court did not have the benefit of a full argument

before it rejected the common law.

In the instant case the order dated 25.01.1991 where the

learned District Judge allowed the application to intervene after

the interlocutory decree has been made without considering

statutory provisions i.e. section 48 of the Partition Law.

Therefore it can be considered as a " A decision given when the

statue has not been brought to the attention for the Court and it

has given the decision in ignorance or forgetfulness of the

existence of that statute. " Such a decision is a decision made in

per Incunam.

In the case of Gunasena Vs. Bandaratilleke (2000) 1 Sri L.R.

292 , Wijetunga, J. held that:

The authorities clearly indicate that a court has inherent

power to repair an injury caused to a party by its own mistake.

One it is recognized that a court would not allow a party to suffer

by reason of its own mistake, it must follow that corrective action

should be taken as expeditiously as possible, within the

framework of the law, to remedy the inquiry caused thereby. The

~ I I

modalities are best left to such Court, and would depend on the

nature of the error"

Under these circumstances, the finding of the learned

District Judge date 1997.09.02 is correct in law. We see no

reason to interfere with he learned District Judge's findings.

The appeal is dismissed without costs.
