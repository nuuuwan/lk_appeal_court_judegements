The issue in this case revolves around an interpretation of Sections 25(2) and (3) of

Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977 as amended. Here is an appeal of two Defendant~

Appellants namely the SA and 7 A Defendant~Appellants (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as "the Appellants") who neither filed a statement of claim nor raised any

point of contest but they have sought to impugn the judgment of the learned

Additional District Judge of Avissawella dated 08.10.1999. Be that as it may, the 8A

Defendant~Respondent has raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of

the appeal on the premise that the Appellants lack locus standi as they have failed to

agitate their claims before the District Court by way of a statement of claim and

points of contest.

This partition suit has had a long and chequered history. It began in 1962 when five

Plaintiffs (Plaintiff~Respondents) by their plaint dated 26.03.1962 instituted this

action to partition a land called "Hikgahawatte Kebelle" as more fully described in the

schedule to the plaint. The original 5th and th Defendants who are represented before

this Court by SA and 7 A Defendant~ Appellants had been allotted entitlements in the

plaint (l/2th each of the corpus sought to be partitioned) but as I stated, they did not

file any statement of claim in the District Court. The trial itself began on 20.07.1973

and the interlocutory decree entered in the case was set aside by the Court of Appeal

on 25.05.1982 and the Court that comprised Atukorale J. and G.P.S. De Silva J. (as he

then was) directed a fresh trial to be held~vide pp386~ 389 of the original record.

A commission had been issued to a licensed surveyor Sinnatamby Singanayagam to

carry out a preliminary survey and accordingly Plan No. 721 and report of the

Commissioner dated 15.Ol.1963 were filed of record.

Filing an amended statement of claim dated 29.05.1989, the original 8th Defendant

(who is now represented by the 8A Defendant~Respondent before this Court)

claimed that Lot 1 which is known as Kankanigewatte and depicted as such in the

preliminary plan bearing No. 721 (marked as X) is a different land and therefore it

should be excluded from the subject~matter sought to be partitioned in the case. In

fact when one peruses the report filed by the commissioner along with his

preliminary plan, one finds a reference to Lot 1 which the commissioner states to be in

the possession of the original 8th and 9th Defendants. The original 8th Defendant also

claimed that his predecessor in title had prescribed to Lot 1 and he had also succeeded

to this lot by way of a deed of gift made in his favour as far back as 16.05.1937. So the

case of the 8th and 9th Defendant~ Respondents was that Lot 1 in preliminary plan

bearing No. 721 must be excluded from the corpus sought to be partitioned in the

case. It has to be stated at this stage that the preliminary plan bearing No. 721

depicted 5 lots and the contest of the 8th and 9th Defendant~Respondents was that the

subject~matter for partition must be confined to a corpus comprising only Lots 2 to 5.

No Statement of Claim from the Appellants

As opposed to the position taken up by the 8th and 9th Defendant~ Respondents to

exclude Lot 1 and confine the partition to lots 2, 3, 4 and 5, the record pertaining to

this case would demonstrate that the original 5th and th Defendants~the Appellants in

the case before this Court, never filed a statement of claim nor did they raise any point

of contest. It is the contention of the substituted 5A and 7 A Defendant~Appellants

that they could yet prosecute the appeal and have this matter decided on the merits

despite the failure of their predecessors 5th and th Defendants to file their statements

of claim in the District Court. Let me refer to the trial de novo in which the principal

features relevant to the preliminary objections surface.

3

Trial de novo

Upon a perusal of the proceedings dated 20.08.1998 on which date the trial de novo

began in the District Court of A vissawella. It is apparent that the Plaintiffs

themselves raised a point of contest to the effect that the subject~matter for partition

must be confined to Lots 2 to 5 as depicted in the preliminary plan bearing No. 724.

By raising this issue, it is crystal clear that the Plaintiffs themselves appear to have

agreed that the corpus should not incorporate Lot 1 ~ a position taken up by the 8A

Defendant~ Respondent.

According to the plaint filed in the case, the share allotment of the two Appellants

was 1/2th each of the subject~matter sought to be partitioned and what in the mind of

the Plaintiffs was the subject~matter that should be partitioned was made clear by the

Plaintiffs when they raised issue No.1 on 20.08.1998 namely whether, as depicted in

the preliminary plan, it is only Lots 2 to 5 that should be partitioned in the case. In

other words it is quite clear that by raising this point of contest, the Plaintiffs should

be taken to have agreed that Lot 1 to which the 8th and 9th Defendants had staked

their claim and whose exclusion they had sought, would not form part of the subject~

matter sought to be partitioned in the case (see issue No. 1 at page 238 of the Appeal

Brief). Therefore it is quite clear that the share entitlements as given by the Plaintiffs

in the plaint to the respective Defendants were to flow from Lots 2 to 5.

If the Appellants before this Court~ the 5th and 7th Defendants had a claim that their

1/2th entitlement each were to come from a larger land which included Lot 1, it was

incumbent upon them to have their case presented before the learned District Judge

and adjudicated upon on these lines. If the 5th and th Defendants had a claim to Lot 1,

which they say should be included in the subject~matter for partition, it would go

without saying that Lot 1 must be incorporated within the subject~matter to be

partitioned and it was open to the Appellants to have this case presented before the

learned District Judge. If it was the contention that their share entitlement was no

doubt l/2th but the l/2th share should originate from a larger corpus namely Lots 1 to

5 and not from Lots 2 to 5, the 5thand th Defendants (the Appellants) could not rest

content with the extent of corpus given by the Plaintiffs in their issue. The issues

raised by the Plaintiffs at the trial particularly issue No.1 were indicative of the fact

that they would confine the partition suit to Lots 2 to 5. The Sth and 9th Defendants

who were named by the licensed surveyor as the possessors of Lot 1 raised no issues,

possibly because the Plaintiffs by implication did not include Lot 1 as part of the

corpus to be partitioned. Though the Appellants had not filed their statement of claim

by this stage, there was clear enough indication as to the case the Plaintiffs were

proposing to present before Court and it was as plain as a pikestaff that the Sth and 9th

Defendants were putting forward the identical case as regards Lot 1 namely it should

be excluded. In the face of these claims unfolding at the trial, I must observe that the

Appellants chose not to put forward their case either in the form of a statement of

claim or a consequent point of contest. It must be stated though that the 22A and 23rd

Defendants did include Lot 1 as part of the corpus~vide issue No.5 at the trial.

The trial de novo began with the testimony of lAI substituted Plaintiff~Respondent on

behalf of the Plaintiffs and their case was closed with the marking of documents from

PI to P4. The SA Defendant~Respondent namely Karunadasa Rodrigo gave evidence

on the behalf of the Sth and 9th Defendants and closed their case with the marking of

documents from 8VI to 8V5. The 22A and 23rd Defendants summoned one

Balasooriya Arachchige Leelawathi to give evidence and upon the conclusion of the

trial, the learned District Judge of A vissawella pronounced judgment dated on

09.10.1999 ordering the partition of a corpus which did not include Lot 1.

It is against this judgment that the 5th and th Defendant~ Appellants (who are now

represented by the SA and 7A Defendant~Appellants) have preferred this appeal

specifically pleading that Lot 1 should form a constituent part of the corpus. It was in

these circumstances that the SA and 9A Defendant~ Respondents contend that this

Court cannot proceed to hear this appeal when the case of the Appellants had not

been properly placed before the learned District Judge of Avissawella.

Inclusion of Lot 1 neither pleaded nor put in issue by the Appellants

The surveyor had already reported that it was the 8th and 9th Defendant~Respondents

who were in possession of Lot 1 when he carries out the preliminary survey. The 8th

and 9th Defendant, Respondents prayed for an exclusion of Lot 1 in their statement of

claim. The Plaintiffs confined the corpus to be partitioned to Lots 2 to 5.The 22A and

23rd Defendants included Lot 1 as part of the corpus~vide issue No. 5 at the trial. So

what was in issue before the learned District Judge was whether Lot 1 should be

excluded or not. However, the stark fact remains that the inclusion of Lot 1 was never

prayed for by the Appellants. A statement of claim which operates as a springboard in

partition law must clearly set out a prayer for what a Defendant wishes to obtain as a

share, right or interest at the end of the trial. In Cinemas Ltd, v. Ceylon Theatres

Ltd/ H.W. Tambiah J. (with T.S. Fernando J. and Manicavasagar J. agreeing) in

setting out the effect of the corresponding provision of Section 19 in the repealed

Partition Act No. 16 of 1951, said:

"On the summons returnable date, or a later date fixed by the court for the purpose, every

defendant or other party to the action may file or cause to be filed in court a statement of the

claims setting out the nature and extent of his right, share or interest to, of, or in the land. Any

party to the action whose rightful share or interest to, of, or in the land is mortgaged or leased

by an instrument registered under the Registration of Documents Ordinance should disclose

or cause to be disclosed to the court the existence of mortgage or lease and the name of the

mortgagee or lessee."

In fact Section 19(1) of the prevailing Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, mirrors the above

provision:

(a) any defendant in the action may file or cause to be filed in Court a statement of claim setting

out the nature and extent of his right, share or interest to, of or in the land to which the action

rdates and shall, ifhe disputes any averment in the plaint rdating to the devolution of title file

1 (1965) 67 N.L.R 97

\I I

or caused to be filed in Court, together with his statement of claim a pedigree showing the

devolution of title.

(b) Any party to the action whose right, share or interest to, of or in the land is mortgaged, or

leased by an instrument registered under the Registration of Documents Ordinance shall

disclose or cause to be disclosed to the court the existence of the mortgage or lease and the

name and address of the mortgagee or lessee;

The court is empowered to decide disputes regarding the corpus of the land in case of

any claim that the corpus should be enlarged or restricted. There was no such claim

on the part of the Appellants that invited Court to a consideration whether the

corpus should be enlarged.

What then is the consequence of the inaction of the appellants?

Consequences of Failure to File a Statement of Claim

Section 25(2) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977 as amended sets out the following:

"If a defendant shall fail to file a statement of claim on the due date the trial may proceed ex

parte as against such party in default, who shall not be entitled, without the leave of

court to raise any contest or dispute the claim of any other party to the action at the trial."

Section 25(3) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977 as amended is curative in the

following tenor:

"A court may permit a party in default to participate in the trial after notice to the other

parties to the action affected by the claim or dispute set up or raised by such party in default,

on being satisfied of the bona fides of such claim or dispute, and upon such terms as to costs

and filing of the statement of claim or otherwise as the court shall deem fit."

A Defendant who has not filed a statement of claim is not without a remedy. Unless

and until the court has granted leave, he cannot raise any contest or dispute the claim

of any other party. The Counsel for the Appellants contended before this Court that

the original court permitted the Counsel for the Appellants to cross-examine the

Plaintiff and that course of action adopted by the learned District Judge was

tantamount to leave being granted. I am not inclined to agree. If this view is adopted,

any Defendant in default of a statement of claim may contrive to cross/examine a

party through his attorney/at/law and claim that he has participated at the trial. If

cross/examination is allowed to a party who has not followed the express provisions

of Section 25 of Partition Law, it may be an event where a District Judge may not have

foreseen fully, as the hurly burly of a trial so heavily fought before him may not have

alerted him to the fact of a default unless it was brought to his notice. Section 25(2) of

the Partition Law entails participation upon leave being granted to a Defendant in

default and such leave cannot be implied merely because a District Judge who is quite

oblivious to the default permits the Defendant to cross/examine a party. If a

Defendant fails to file a statement of claim, he becomes a party in default and such

default is cured only with leave being granted by court. The burden is on the

defaulting Defendant to move the District Court for leave as leave is a condition

precedent to participation.

Section 25(3) of the Partition Law expands on the consequences of leave being

granted. Section 25(3) as set out before enumerates the steps that could be taken

upon leave being granted.

A party in default must move for leave and in this case such leave was not expressly

sought of the learned District Judge of A vissawella before the Counsel for the

Appellants proceeded to cross/examine the Plaintiff. None of the requirements set out

in Section 25 have been followed. The answers elicited in cross/examination of the

Plaintiff entered the record owing to a violation of the express provisions of Section

25(2) and (3) of the Partition Law and the trial should be construed to have

proceeded against the Appellants ex parte because evidence obtained in violation of

Section 25(2) and (3) of the Partition Law was improperly and illegally received. One

has to shut one's mind to this illegally obtained evidence. In any event I must observe

that even the answers elicited through the Plaintiff in cross/examination do not

establish a case for inclusion of Lot 1 to the satisfaction of court. So much for the

cross~examination of the Plaintiff by the Appellants.

Attempts to Cross~Examine 8th Defendant~Respondent

The Counsel who appeared for the Appellants in the original court made an attempt

to cross~examine the 8th Defendant~ Respondent but this application has been

rejected by the learned District Judge in the interim order made on 20.05.1999 (vide

p.277 of the Appeal brief).

It has to be stated that the interim order of the learned District Judge to disentitle the

Appellants to cross~examine the 8th Defendant~ Respondent was not appealed against.

It is for the 1st time in this appeal that the Appellants call in question the propriety of

the order of the learned District Judge dated 20.05.1999. Given that a party can

canvass the propriety of an interim order in a final appeal, I have to bear in mind that

the preliminary objection is to the effect that the Appellants have no right of appeal as

they had been in default and they never followed the procedure as set out in Section

25(3) of the Partition Law to cure that default. Except for the application of the

Counsel for the Appellants to cross~examine the 8th Defendant~ Respondent, there is

no specificity as to what contest the Appellants would be raising or which claim of

any other party the Appellants would seek to dispute. A mere application to pose

questions in cross~examination does not satisfy the requirement of leave that is

contemplated within Section 25(2) of the Partition Law. Leave sought must be on a

specific contest that a party in default wishes to raise or a claim that such party

wishes to dispute. Once such a claim or contest is brought to the notice of court, leave

would be granted to participate at the trial provided the other parties to the action

are noticed and the bona fides of the claim or contest are satisfied. The Court can even

order the filing of a statement of claim upon terms but in the court a quo, there was no

attempt made to cure the default and enter into the case other than the application to

cross~examine the 8th Defendant~ Respondent. One cannot lose sight of the fact that a

default is triggered upon a non filing of a statement of claim and the trial proceeds ex

9

parte. A defaulting party cannot proceed to cross~examine a party until the default is

cured under Section 25 of the Partition Law. An application to cross~examine a party

cannot be equated to an application for leave to cure default and enter into the case to

raise a contest or dispute a claim. The application for leave must precede the

application to cross~examine a party.

I would adopt the pertinent observations of Dheeraratne J. in the case of Mendis v.

Dublin de Silva and two other; where the learned judge stated:

"I find it difficult to subscribe to the proposition advanced on behalf of the appellant, that a

defaulting party, who is disentitled to raise a contest or a dispute as a matter of right at the

trial, acquires such a privilege once the trial is concluded."

So the status of the Appellants as if in default has continued all the way up to the

conclusion of the trial. A petition of appeal cannot cure such a default in these

circumstances.

There is another reason that inclines me to uphold the preliminary objection. It is the

contention of the Appellants before this Court that the corpus must be enlarged in

that it should include Lot 1. This Court poses the question as to how the Appellant

can seek to have Lot 1 excluded in the appellate court if he has not led any evidence at

all on the exclusion of Lot 1 at the trial. Both the Civil Procedure Code and the

Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977 contain salutary provisions which promote and protect

the rights of parties by affording them process rights such as audi alteram partem. But

the Appellants missed those opportunities every step of the way. I would sum up

those missed opportunities. The opportunity to file a statement of claim was not

availed of. Even the opportunity to cure the default was also missed. So the

Appellants must be taken to be parties who just remained on record without having

participated at the trial.

Section 754(1) of the Civil Procedure Code bestows a right of appeal only on a party

who is dissatisfied with any judgment pronounced in a civil case to which he is a party.

The Counsel for the Appellants argued that any aggrieved party can appeal to the

Court of Appeal and in support of this proposition counsel cited the well known case

of Bandaranaike v. Jagathsena and other~/a decision of the Supreme Court which

turned on the provisions of Section 260 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15

of 1979 which reads:

'Subject to the provisions of this Code and any written law every person accused before any

criminal Court may of right be defended by an attorney/at/law, and every aggrieved party

shall have the right to be represented in court by an attorney/at/law .

This provision to extend the right of representation to an aggrieved party was

introduced for the first time in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 so

that a victim who was subjected to an offence can be represented in any criminal

court by an attorney/at/law. Such a right to an aggrieved party was not available in

Section 287 of the repealed Criminal Procedure Code which stated:

"Every person accused before any criminal court may of right be defended by a pleader."

This extension of a right made available to an aggrieved party such as a victim of an

offence or a complainant in criminal case is by no stretch of imagination comparable

to a party who is already guaranteed with such protections as in Section 25(2) and

(3) of the Partition Law. A party qua Appellants who missed the opportunity of

availing himself of putting forward his case in the original court cannot be treated on

par with a victim of an offence who is so desirous of taking advantage of Section 260

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979. If a party chooses not to make

use of the curative provisions such as Section 25 of the Partition Law, he would be

just a party who remained on the record without having participated at the trial. He

cannot be an aggrieved or a dissatisfied the party. In those circumstances, I do not see

an aggrieved party in the Appellants as the Supreme Court found one such aggrieved

party in Bandaranaike v. Jagathsena and others.4 Therefore a recourse to

Bandaranaike v. Jagathsena and others would amount to an attempt to compare the

incomparable duo.

Who is an Aggrieved Party?

The question of whether the Appellants who remained on the record as mere parties

to the case could become "aggrieved parties" can also be disposed of by recourse to

the English precedent of In re Sidebotham5 which was also cited by Dheeraratne J. in

Mendis v. Dublin de Silva and two others6 In the case of In re Sidebotham

Bramwell, LJ stated the general rule namely an appeal must be by the party who has

endeavored to maintain the contrary of that which has taken place.? Further James,

LJ described the attributes of a ''person aggrieved" as follows:

"But the words ''person aggrieved" do not really mean a man who is disappointed of a benefit

which he might have received if some other order had been made. A "person aggrieved" must be

a man who has suffered a legal grievance, a man against whom a decision has been pronounced

which wrongly deprived him of something, or wrongly affected his title to something. ,,8

These dicta of James LJ in Sidebotham, ex parte have been followed in Sevenoaks

Urban DC v Twynam9 and Ealing Corp v. Jones.lO On the strength of the above

precedents it is clear that in the context of a trial a legal grievance emanates from a

cause that was placed by a party before a trier of facts who, through a

misappreciation of facts or law, pronounced a decision wrongfully refusing a rellef or

title to which the party is entitled. If these elements are not present in a party, he has

suffered no legal grievance, he has hardly suffered a damnum; if he alleges he has it is

damnum absque injuria. A petition of appeal cannot operate as a statement of claim at

this stage.

In the circumstances I hold that the Appellants have no locus standi to maintain this

appeal and accordingly I proceed to uphold the preliminary objection and dismiss the

appeal.
