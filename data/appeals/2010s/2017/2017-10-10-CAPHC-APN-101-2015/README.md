Before S. Devika de L. Tennekoon, J

S. Thurairaja, P.C. J

Counsel Dushantha Kularatne for the

1st Accused-Petitioner.

Decided on 12.09.2017

S. Thurairaja, P.C. J

The 1st Accused - Petitioner, Rankoth Pedige Suresh Chandana Kumara,

preferred a revision application dated 15.08.2015, and submitted to the

Court of Appeal on the 28.09.2015. The counsel supported the petition

and moved for notice. We find the conviction was on the 03.07.2014, and

the petition was received to the Court of Appeal after one year and two

months. The delay is not properly explained in the petition. We find that

the petitioner has not exercised his legal rights enshrined to him by the

law, namely the appeal. Revision is an exceptional jurisdiction granted to

the court of appeal and it is jealously guarded for deserving situations and

it cannot be used lavishly as such. We heard counsel submitting the

grounds for issuance of notice, we could not find a single ground which

falls within the ambit of exceptional circumstances. The exceptional

circumstances are crystalized by decisions of our Court and confirmed by

the Supreme Court. The main contention of the petitioner is that the

f

confession is not properly qualified and the learned judge has not

considered the mandatory things in his judgement. I had the privilege of

going through the brief from cover, to cover further assisted by the

counsel in his submissions. I find that the learned High Court Judge has

covered all possible legal theories in favour of the accused person.

Considering all submissions, I do not find that there is an exceptional

circumstances submitted in the petition or by the counsel. Therefore, this

application does not qualify for issuance of notice. Notice refused.

Notice refused.
