L.T.B. Dehideniya J. (PICA)

The Chairman of the Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee on

behalf of the Ministry of Health called global tenders for the supply of

80000 bottles of Human Albumin Solution BPIPh Eur, 20% in 50 ml bottle.

The 1 st Petitioner through the 2nd Petitioner tendered a bid for the supply of

the medicine. The Petitioners state that they were the second lowest bidder.

After evaluating the bids, the petitioners state that the Committee decided to

award the tender to the Petitioners. Thereafter the unsuccessful bidders

made an appeal to the Procurement Appeal board and the Petitioners were

invited by the board to participate at the inquiry. Thereafter the board

directed the Technical O)mmittee to re-evaluate the bids. On re-evaluation,

the tender was awarded to the 3rd Respondent who was not the lowest

bidder. The Petitioners' contention is that the tender should have been

awarded to them.

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the

Technical Committee did not inform the Petitioners of their decision to

award the tender to the 3 rd Respondent. Further he submitted that the

Petitioners were the suppliers of this medicine for the last four years to the

Sri Lanka government without any complaint. As per the tender notice, the

drug should certify to the BP/Ph Eur standard but the Petitioners' drug is IP

standard certified drug. The learned President's Counsel admits that those

are two different standards but the Counsel's argument is that the IP

standard is equal or higher than the BP standard.

The learned President's Counsel, ASG, for the Respondents raised a

preliminary issue that the Petitioners have given notice only to the 2nd

Respondent, the other respondents; especially the 1 st Respondent should

have been noticed before supporting this application for interim relief.

On the merits, the learned ASG submits that the Petitioners' bid is not

within the specifications of the tender notice. The tender notice was to

supply the drug in BP/Ph Eur standard but the petitioners do not have that

standard, their standard is the IP standard.

The learned ASG further submitted that the Procurement Appeal

Board, after considering the appeal, directed the Technical Committee to

evaluate the bids that are in conformity of the tender notice only and

accordingly the tender was awarded to the 3 rd Respondent. She further

brought to our notice that the Letters of Credit to import the drugs have been

opened before institution of this action.

The learned ASG submits that the Petitioners have given notice only

to the 2nd Respondent and no notice of this application is given to the other

Respondents. Her argument is that under the Rule 2 (1) of the Court of

Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990, the Petitioners should have given

notice to the other Respondents too. The learned ASG relies on the

I l

l I 1 J I I I

judgment of the of H/L Surasena 1. in the case of C.A. (Writ) Application

No. 98/2016 CA Minutes dated 22.06.2016 where the requirement of

issuing notice prior to supporting for interim reliefhas been emphasized.

I will first consider the merits of this application.

The tender notice calling for global tenders IS marked as P3.

According to this notice it is very clear that the standard of the drug that is

intended to import has to bear the BP/Ph Eur certification. The Petitioners'

argument is that the IP certification is equal or higher than the BP standard.

It mayor may not be, but what is necessary is the BP standard. Unless the

bidder has the BP standard, he is not qualified to bid. His bid should have

rejected at the first instant.

The Procurement Appeal Board is for a displeased bidder to challenge

the decision of the Committee. In the present case the unsuccessful bidder

exercising his right to appeal, has appealed to the Procurement Appeal

Board. The board has invited the Petitioners also to make their

representations to the Beard. According to the learned ASG, the Board has

directed the Technical Committee to evaluate the bids that were offered by

the bidders who has the relevant standards according to the tender notice.

Since the Petitioners do not have the relevant standards at the time of

presenting the tender, his bid was not necessitated to be considered by the

Technical Committee.

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner's argument is that

the Petitioners were the suppliers for the last four years without the BP

standard will not carry any weight. If the State wanted the BP standard

drugs for the last four and the tender was awarded to the Petitioners who

don't have BP standard during the last four years, is a wrong practice

adopted by the authorities concerned and the Petitioners do not get any right

to ask for the tender ~ven for this year without BP standard. If the

I I I i i

Petitioners are of the opinion that the IP standard is equal or higher than the

BP standard, they should have represented facts to the authorities prior to

calling for tenders because the Petitioners knew that the standard required

by the Sri Lankan government is the BP standard which they did not have.

Once the tender notice is published, an offer which is not in conformity with

the requirements cannot be accepted.

The learned President's Counsel submits that the Petitioners have

obtained the BP certification after closing the tenders. What has to be

considered is the qualification of the bidders as at the time of closing

tenders. If he is not qualified to present the offer at the closing of the tender,

any subsequent qualification obtained by the petitioner will not bring him in

to the category of qualified bidders. His disqualification, as at the time of

closing the tender, remains.

Under these circumstances, it is not necessary for the Court to

consider the applicability of the rules at this stage. The Petitioners have

failed to establish that they were qualified bidders for the subject tender.

Accordingly, I see no reason to issue notice or to issue any interim

relief

Application dismissed. No costs.
