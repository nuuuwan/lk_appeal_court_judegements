Further the court takes very serious notice that the Petitioner had submitted false hood under oaths to this court. Further he had 140 submitted incorrect fact to subvert the course of justice to this court as well as to the trial court. The Petitioner did not come to this court with clean hands. Time and again this court and the Supreme Court held that a person should come to courts with clean hands, if not, the court will not grant any relief. Following the decision made previously I decide that the Petitioner is not entitled for any relief, the application for 145 transfer is refused.",
