Order

S. Thurairaja, P.C., J.

The petitioner above named filed petition to quash an order made

by the 41h Respondent under Section 90(1) of the Agrarian Development

Act No. 46/2000 as amended by 46/2011. The parties filed objections and

counter objections. The learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for

CA Writ No. 37112014 Order Page2of7

the 1st to the 3rd Respondents raised preliminary objection, that the subject

matter comes under the provincial list stipulated by the constitution of the

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Therefore this Court has no

jurisdiction but the High Court of the province namely High Court of

Kegalle. Parties filed written submissions on the said objection and moved

to Court make a decision on the preliminary objection before proceed to

the substantive issue.

The Counsel for the petitioner submits that the application was filed

far back in October 2014 and pleadings are now completed, therefore

referring the matter to the Provincial High Court will cause further delay

and inconvenience to the petitioner, hence he is objecting for the transfer

and submits that this Court also has jurisdiction to hear the matter. He

quoted article 154(P) of the Constitution refers the cases of Kaluarachchi Elen

Nona Vs. Sunil Weerasinghe Commissioner General of Agrarian

Services and others in C.A. Writ 23/2013 decided on 10.06.2016. Supreme

Court decision on Wijesuriya V. Nimalawathie Wanigasinghe S.C. Appeal

No. 33/2007, G.D. Kusumawathi and another Vs Assistant'

Commissioner of Agrarian Services C.A. PHC 65/2018 (sic) decided on

26.05.2016.

The Counsel for the 4th Respondent also makes submissions and

moves Court to dismiss the petition of the petitioner in limine and with

costs.

The Counsel for the 1st to 3rd Respondent Senior D.S.G. submitted

that the impugned order was made under the 90(1) of the Agrarian

Development Ordinance and that matter comes under the provincial council

list hence the High Court of said provincial has jurisdiction. Therefore this

matter must be referred to the provincial High Court.

CA Writ No. 371/2014 Order Page 3 of7

All parties agree that the said decision was made under Section

90(1) of the Agrarian Development Ordinances.

Section 16 of the Agrarian Development (Amendment) Act No. 46 of

2011 which reads as follows:

"THE PRINCIPLE ENACTMENT IS HEREBY AMENDED BY THE

SUBSTITUTION FOR THE WORDS "COURT OF APPEAL"

THOSE WORDS APPEAR IN THE PRINCIPLE WHEREEVER

ENACTMENT,

PROVINCE"

OF THE WORDS "HIGH COURTS OF THE

(Emphasis added)

Section 90(1) of the Agrarian Development Ordinance reads as

follows:

"Where a complaint is made to the Commissioner

General by any owner cultivator or occupier of agricultural land that

any person is interfering with or attempting to interfere with the

cultivation rights, threshing rights, rights of using threshing fields, the

right of removing agricultural produce or the right to the use of an

agricultural road of such owner cultivator or occupier, the

commissioner general after inquiry may if he is satisfied that

such interference or attempted interference will result in

damage or loss of crop or livestock, issue an order on such

person cultivator or occupier requiring him to comply with such

direction as maybe specified in such order necessary for the

protection of such rights."

(Emphasis added)

CA Writ No. 37112014 Order Page 4 of7

If a party is aggrieved by the decision made by the

Commissioner under Section 90( 1) he has to seek the competent

jurisdiction under Section 90(3) of the Agrarian Development

Ordinance which reads as follows:

"An order under subsection (1) shall be binding on the person

in respect of whom it is made until set aside by a court of

competent jurisdiction"

(Emphasis added)

Now I consider Article 154(P) of the constitution states as follows:-.

154P. (1) There shall be a High Court for each Province with effect

from the date on which this Chapter comes into force. Each

such High Court shall be designated as the High Court of

the relevant Province.

(2) The Chief Justice shall nominate, from among Judges of the

High Court of Sri Lanka; such number of Judges as may be

necessary to each such High Court. Every such Judge shall be

transferable by the Chief Justice.

(3) Every such High Court shall-

(a) exercise according to law, the original criminal jurisdiction of

the High Court of Sri Lanka in respect of offences committed within

the Province;

(b) notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any law,

exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by

Magistrate's Court and Primary Courts within the Province;

(c) exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as Parliament may,

by law, provide.

(4) Every such High Court shall have jurisdiction to issue,

according to law -

(a) orders in the nature of habeas corpus, In respect of persons

illegally detained within the Province; and

(b) order in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition, procedendo,

mandamus and quo warranto against any person exercising,

within the Province, any power under-

(i) any law; or

(ii) any statutes made by the Provincial Council established for that

Province,

In respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council List.

(5) The judicial Service Commission may delegate to such High

Court, the power to inspect and report on, the administration of

any Court of First Instance within the Province.

(6) subject to the provisions of the Constitution and any law, any

person aggrieved by a final order, judgment or sentence of any

such Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under paragraphs (3)

(b) or (3) (c) or (4) may appeal there from to the Court of Appeal

in accordance with Article 138.

According to item number 9 of the 9th schedule deals with the subject of

Agriculture and Agrarian Services as follows;

9: 1 Agriculture, including agricultural extension, promotion and

education for provincial purposes and agricultural services (other

than in inter-provincial irrigation and land settlement schemes,

State land and plantation agriculture);

9:2 Rehabilitation and maintenance of minor irrigation works;

9: 3 Agricultural research save and except institution designated as

national agricultural research institutions.

(

My brother, Justice Vijith Malalgoda, P.C. President of the Court

of Appeal had decided in Kaluarachchi Elen Nona Vs Sunil

Weerasinghe and four others (C.A. Writ 23/2013 decided on 10.06.2013)

almost the identical matter that the provincial High Court and the Court

of Appeal also has concurrent jurisdiction. I conquer his view.

The legislators brought the 13th amendment to provide easy

excess of all central authorities and judiciary to the public, till then citizens

of our country had come to Colombo for most of the things. Now it is

available, close to their home, namely within the province. Once again,

without valid reason taking matters which had been given to the provincial

High Court to Court of Appeal, will not serve the purposes of the

amendment to the Constitution. Therefore I am of view that these matters

should be dealt by the provincial High Court, which is closed to their

home. Most of the time, the relevant judges are sensitive on the issues of the

said province. Considering all, this Court decides this matter should be

heard and determine by the Provincial High Court holden at Kegalle.

Therefore we decided to transfer this case to the Provincial High Court of

Kegalle.

Registrar is hereby directed to transfer the case record and all

connected papers to the Registrar of Provincial High Court.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C., J (PICA)

I agree.
