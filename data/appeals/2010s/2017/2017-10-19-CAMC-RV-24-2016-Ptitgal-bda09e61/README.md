This is an application filed by the Petitioner seeking the interfering of

this Court in the order of imprisonment made by the Magistrate Court of

Balangoda in a maintenance application. The facts of this case as per the

petition are that the Petitioner was ordered to pay the maintenance for his

wife but was in arrears of 38 months and the Court has imposed a term of 38

months imprisonment. The contention of the petitioner is that the said term

of imprisonment is illegal. The learned DSG submitted that the section 8 of

the Maintenance Act provides for the Court to impose one month

imprisonment for the failure to pay the maintenance for one month and the

period of imprisonment that a Magistrate Court can order is govern by the

Maintenance Act, not by the Criminal Procedure Code.

The fact that the Petitioner was in arrears of maintenance for 38

months was not in issue. The only issue was whether the Magistrate Court

can impose a term of imprisonment of 38 months. The section 5 of the

Maintenance Act No.37 of 1999 reads thus;

5. (1) Subject to the provisions contained in section 10, where any

person against whom an order is made under section 2 or the proviso

"

to section 11 (/) thereinafter called the "respondent'') neglects to

comply with such order, the Magistrate may, for every breach of the

order, sentence such respondent for the whole or any part of each

months allowance in default, to simple or rigorous imprisonment for

a term which may extend to one month.

(2) The Magistrate may, if an application is made in that behalf by

any person entitled to receive any payment under an order of

maintenance, before passing a sentence of imprisonment on the

respondent, issue a warrant directing the amount in default to be

levied in the manner provided by law for levying fines imposed by

Magistrates in the Magistrate Courts.

In the present case the learned Magistrate has ordered the

imprisonment of one month for nonpayment every one month.

The power of the sentencing by the Magistrate Court is provided in

section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The section 14 reads thus;

A Magistrate's Court may impose any of the following sentences: -

(a) imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding

two years;

(b) fine not exceeding one thousand five hundredrupees;

[2, 21 of2005} Repealed

(d) any lawful sentence combining any of the sentences

aforesaid:

Provided that anything in this section shall not be deemed to repeal

the provisions of any enactment in force whereby special powers of

punishment are given.

Under the proviso to this section the Magistrate Court can impose any

term of sentence if it is governed by any enactment in force whereby special

powers of punishment are given. The Maintenance Act is such an enactment

where special powers given to the Magistrate Court. Therefore the term of

imprisonment that could be imposed by the Magistrate Court in a

maintenance case for not complying the order to pay the allowance IS

governed by the Maintenance Act.

that;

It had been held in the case of Siriwardane V. D.Emalin 59 NLR 263

Where a person who is ordered to pay maintenance is in arrears for

more than six months, the Magistrate has jurisdiction to sentence him

to imprisonment for a term which may exceed six months. In such a

case, the maximum term of imprisonment is determined by section 8

of the Maintenance Ordinance and not by section 312 of the Criminal

Procedure Code.

Therefore the learned Magistrate's order of imprisonment for 38

months is not an illegal order.

The Petition is dismissed without costs.

I agree.
