JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Learned counsel for the Respondent - Respondent - Respondent

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Respondent), when this case

came up on 2017-08-03 before us, agreed to have this case disposed of,

by way of written submissions. Therefore, this judgment would be based

on the material so adduced.

The Applicant - Petitionef - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Appellant) was absent when this Court took up this case for argument

on 2017-08-03. No application was made on his behalf with regard to the

progress of the case. Therefore, this Court decided not to postpone the

argument.

It is in these circumstances, that this Court had proceeded to dispose this

appeal by considering the merits of this appeal.

Applicant-Petitioner-Appellant had filed the information relevant to this

case in the Magistrate's Court of Kalawana under section 66 (1) (b) of the

Primary Court Procedure Act.

Learned Magistrate having inquired into the complaint contained in the said

information, by his order dated 1997-10-10, had held that the Appellant

has not proved that he is entitled to the impugned right of way.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Primary Court Judge, the

Appellant had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of

Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Ratnapura urging the Provincial High

Court to revise the order of the learned Primary Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court after hearing parties, by its judgment dated

2004-02-06 had refused the said application for revision and procee.ded to

,

dismiss it. The Provincial High Court has taken the view that there are no

exceptional circumstances to interfere with the learned Magistrate's order.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed this appeal in this

Court.

5

The judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Ramalingam V

Thangarajah1 would be relevant to this proceedings. It is a judgment

which had interpreted section 69 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act

No. 44 of 1979. It would be relevant and appropriate to quote the

following passage from that judgment here. It is as follows;

" ..... On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land

other than right of possession of such land, the question for decision,

according to section 69 (1), is who is entitled to the right which is subject

of dispute. The word "entitle" here connotes the ownership of the right.

The Court has to determine which of the parties has acquired that right, or

is entitled for the time being to exercise that right. In contradistinction to

section 68, section 69 requires the Court to determine the question which

party is entitled to the disputed right preliminary to making an order under

section 69 (2) ...... "

It is the view of this Court that the Respondents have failed to prove to the

satisfaction of Court that they are entitled to the impugned roadway. This

11982 (2) Sri. L R 693.

is exactly what the learned Primary Court Judge also had decided in his

order.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons this Court decides to

dismiss this appeal as this Court sees no merit in it. The Respondent is

entitled to the costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
