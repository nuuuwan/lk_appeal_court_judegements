L. T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an appeal from the High Court ofBalapitiya.

The OlC of police, Elpitiya filed information under section 66 of the

Primary Court Procedure Act in the Magistrate Court of Elpitiya on a land

dispute threatening the breach of the peace naming 1 to 4 Respondents as

parties. The 1 st and 2nd Respondents were of one party and the 3rd and the 4th

Respondents were of the other Party. The 1st Respondent Petitioner (now

deceased) (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the 1 st

Respondent) made a complaint to the police stating that the 3rd and 4th

Respondent Respondent Respondents (hereinafter sometimes called and

referred to as the 3rd and 4th Respondents) entered in to the land which was

in his possession and erected a fence separating a portion and destroyed the

plantain bushes. Thereafter the police inquired in to the complaint and

inspected the disputed land. The police was of the view that there is a

likelihood of the breach of the peace due to this dispute and referred the

matter to Court.

After filing the relevant affidavits, the learned Magistrate determined

that the 3rd and 4th Respondents were in possession at the time of filing the

information and the 1 st and 2nd Respondents failed to establish the date of

dispossession. Being aggrieved by the said order the 1 st and 2nd Respondents

moved in revision in the High Court of Balapitiya without success. This

appeal is from the said order of the learned High Court Judge.

4

The main issue in this case is the date of dispossession. There is no

dispute that on the day of filing the information under section 66 of the

Primary Court Procedure Act in Court the land in dispute was in possession

of 3rd and 4th Respondents. The complaint made by the deceased 1 st

Respondent to the police is that the 3rd and 4th Respondents erected a fence

and he was dispossessed from the block of land separated by the fence.

Therefore it is admitted fact that the 3rd and 4th Respondents were In

possession at the time of filing information. Section 68 of the Act reads

68. (1) Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part

thereof it shall be the duty of the Judge of the Primary Court

holding the inquiry to determine as to who was in possession of

the land or the part on the date of the filing of the-information

under section 66 and make order as to who is entitled to

possession of such land or part thereof

(2) ....... .

(3) Where at an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right to the

possession of any land or any part of a land the Judge of the

Primary Court is satisfied that any person who had been in

possession of the land or part has been forcibly dispossessed

within a period of two months immediately before the date on

which the information was filed under section 66, he may make a

determination to that effect and make an order directing that the

party dispossessed be restored to possession and prohibiting all

disturbance of such possession otherwise than under the authority

of an order or decree of a competent court.

(4) ........ (subsections 2 and 4 omitted)

Under subsection (1) it is the duty of the Court to determine as to who

was in possession on the date of filing the information. As I pointed out

I

1 l i

earlier, it is an admitted fact that the 3rd and 41h Respondents were In

possession on the date of filing the information. If the 151 and 2nd

Respondents contend that they were in possession of the land in dispute and

were dispossessed within a period of two months immediately before the

date on which the information was filed under section 66, that fact has to be

established by the 151 and the 2nd Respondents. Under section 101 of the

Evidence Ordinance the person who asserts the existence of a fact has to

prove the existence of that fact. The section reads

101. Whoever desires any court to give judgment as to any legal right

or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must

prove that those facts exist.

When a person is bound to prove the existence of any fact, it is said

that the burden of proof lies on that person.

Illustrations

(a) A desires a court to give judgment that B shall be

punished for a crime which A says B has committed. A

must prove that B has committed the crime.,

(b)A desires a court to give judgment that he is entitled

to certain land in the possession of B by reason of facts

which he asserts, and which B denies to be true. A must

prove the existence of those facts.

In the present case the 151 and 2nd Respondents asserts that they were

dispossessed within two months immediately prior to the filing of the

information. Therefore they have to prove that fact. If that fact is not proved

his assertion fails.

The first complaint made to the police by the 151 Respondent is silent

on the date of dispossession. The first few sentences in the said statement

are in past tense. He says that the 41h Respondent has erected a fence.

6

Thereafter he says that the fence was erected when he was at home and then

he asked her not to do so but she did not listen. The argument of the

Counsel for the 2nd Respondent Appellant is that this indicates that the

complaint was made on the day that the fence was erected. I do not agree

with the contention of the learned Counsel. The fact that the land was in

possession of the 3rd and 4th Respondents has been established and therefore

there must be clear and cogent evidence to establish that the they came in to

possession by forcibly dispossessing the 1 st and 2nd Respondents within two

months immediately prior to filing the information in Court. The 1 st and 2nd

Respondents have failed to establish the date of dispossession.

Since the 1 st and 2nd Respondents failed to establish that they were

disposed within two months immediately prior to filing of the information,

the 3rd and 4th Respondents who were in possession at the time of filing the

information become entitle to posses.

I see no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned Magistrate

and the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 10,000.00
