Both counsel concluded their submissio::1s. Counsel for the Accused-

Appellant submits that she is not challenging the conviction but the

3. The learned High Court Judge failed to consider items of evidence

favorable to the Appellant and makes submissions on the above

grounds.

Learned DSG, Ms. Harippriya Jayasundara submits that she is supporting

the conviction and the sentence and she says that the learned High Court

Judge's finding a conviction under sudden fight is justifiable considering the

evidence available. (grave and sudden provocation is justifiable) She further

submits that the deceased died because of the blow on the head caused by

the Accused-Appellant. Therefore, she supports conviction and the sentence.

We carefully considered the submi~sions and the evidence placed

before the High Court in this case. We find that the Accused and the

deceased did not have any previous animosity and this had happened on a

sudden fracas between the parties. The Accused-Appellant and the deceased

are from same family and inter-related. As per the evidence available, we

find that the Accused-Appellant had dealt one blow on the deceased with a

wooden plank available on the scene. The deceased died after 10 days from

the incident. It is evidence before the High Court that the deceased had gone

to the government hospital at Bingiriya and took medicine for his headache.

Thereafter, there is a witness to say that he was involved in his normal work

and the other witness says that he didn't work. Nothing before the court

that he was on bed rest. There is evidence to say that the deceased had been

donated blood at the government hospital for a friend of him. On the third

2

occasion he complained of a headache, after ten days from the incident and

he was taken to the Chilaw general hospital. There he was admitted, treated

and transmitted to the National Hospital, Sri Lanka, situated in Colombo,

where he died. The counsel for the Accused-Appellant submits that there is

causation. Counsel for the Respondent submits that as per the J.M.O's.

evidence the death was a result of an assault.

Considering the submissions made by both counsel, we summanze the

incident as follows. This incident had happened on a fight, which was not

premeditated. The Accused has dealt one blow with a wooden plank

available on the scene and the deceased died after ten days with medical

interference. The learned High Court Judge could have considered other

mitigating circumstances also before the conviction. The Accused-Appellant

is not challenging the conviction, but we are mindful, the evidence should

have been considered in favour of the Accused-Appellant. This incident had

happened in 1997 and the learned High Court Judge also considered it

seriously before he passed the sentence.

Considering all circumstances, we affirm the conviction and we re-

consider the sentence and vacate the sentence of ten years and impose 8

years Rigorous Imprisonment and we order the same to be implemented

from the date of conviction. The other conditions will remain as it is.

We direct the Prison Authorities to implement the sentence from the date of

conviction namely 30.11.2015.

Subject to the variation of the sentenc:=, the appeal is dismissed.
