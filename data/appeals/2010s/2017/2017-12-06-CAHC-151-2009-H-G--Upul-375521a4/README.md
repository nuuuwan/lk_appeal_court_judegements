L.T.B. DEHIDENIYA, J

This is an appeal from the High Court of Anuradhapura. The appellant

was indicted before the said High Court on a charge of committing murder of

Udahagedara Amarangani on or about 8th September 2001, a charge punishable

under Section 296 of the Penal Court. After trial, the appellant was convicted

and sentenced with death penalty. Being aggrieved, the appellant presented this

appeal to this court. The grounds of appeal, the appellant urged before this

court are:

1. Learned Trial Judge (L TJ) has factually misdirected herself on

critical issues of facts causing serious prejudice to the appellant.

2. Evidence of the Grama Sewaka is wholly contradicted by other

prosecution witnesses which the L TJ has been totally oblivious to.

3. Case being governed by circumstantial evidence, evidence led at the

trial is suggestive of a 3rd party (namely the Grama Sewaka) being the

perpetrator of the crime.

4. Items of circumstantial evidence are wholly inadequate to support the

conviction and the L TJ failed to apply the principles governing the

evaluation of circumstantial evidence cases.

5. Application of the Ellenborough principle is wholly inapplicable and

unwarranted to the instant case.

6. L TJ has misconstrued the defense of alibi raised by the appellant.

7. L TJ has failed to evaluate the defense evidence In its correct

perspective causing prejudice to the appellant.

8. L TJ has erred in law by examining the defense evidence in the light

of the prosecution evidence which tantamount to shifting the burden

of proof to the appellant.

9. Items of evidence favorable to the appellant have not been considered

by the L TJ thereby occasioning in a deprivation of a fair trial.

Seemange Seethadevi (PW2) stated in evidence that the deceased came

to her house and informed that there had been an argument with the appellant

and the appellant has taken the children and left house. On the advice of the

witness the deceased spent the night with them in their house and left in the

morning. She further stated that one Azwer, a witness listed but was not called,

informed her that the deceased had shown him a threatening letter claimed to

have been written by the appellant. The prosecution neither called Azwer as a

witness nor produced the letter in evidence. The statement made by Azwer to

the witness cannot be derived on but the witness's reaction to the statement can

be taken as evidence. On receipt of this information, witness had gone to the

deceased's house. She testified that the Grama Sewaka namely, Nilawasam

Bopage Keerthisoma was at the compound of the deceasd's house all by

himself. This witness's stand was that when she went there only the Grama

Sewaka was there. She had called out the deceased's name but she was not to

be seen. Subsequently the Grama Sewaka has found the deceased's body lying

in a toilet pit.

Witness Mapa Mudiyanselage Yasawathi testified that upon hearing a

commotion from the deceased's house she informed the Grama Sewaka.

Thereafter she with the Grama Sewaka and another villager had gone to the

deceased's house. At that point she had seen the appellant leaving the place

telling them he had forgotten his shoes and had come to collect them. She says

that they were unable to trace the deceased and she returned home. Much later

heard a commotion from the deceased's house and when she went there the

body had been found lying in a toilet pit.

The Grama Sewaka Keerthisoma testified that the witness Yasawathi

had informed him that she had heard a commotion from the direction of the

deceased's house and he along with the witness Yasawathi and other villagers

has gone to the deceased's house. He also stated that they met the appellant

leaving the house. He further testified that he discovered the body lying in an

open toilet pit and thereafter the police was informed and the police proceeded

with.

The other witnesses are official witnesses.

The appellant made a dock statement and stated that he went to Kandy

with his children and came back only on the information of the police that they

were looking for him. The appellant's daughter gave evidence on behalf of the

defense and said that her father took them to Kandy and stayed with them. The

father had not come back to the house they were previously living in.

The Learned High Court Judge did not accept the alibi of the defense

and convicted the accused appellant.

This case is based on circumstantial evidence. There is no direct

evidence to the fact that the appellant has committed this offence. In a case

relying on circumstantial evidence, for the accused to be convicted, the only

5

conclusion that could have been come into has to be that the accused has

committed the crime.

The counsel for the Appellant submits that the learned High Court Judge

has misdirected on factual matters. Her first argument is on the discovery of the

body. The witness Yasawathi has testified that they could not trace the

deceased and she left. Witness Seethadevi testified to the fact that when she

came in, only the Grama Sewaka was there. The body has been found

thereafter. The counsel's contention is that the learned HCJ's finding that the

body was found immediately after the appellant's departure was wrong. The

accused appellant has left the house informing that he came to collect the shoes

that he has left. Both witnesses, i.e. Grama Sewaka and Yasawathi testified to

this fact. Thereafter they have called the name of the deceased and searched for

her. There is evidence to say that the doors were open too. If the deceased was

alive and was inside the house, she would have been answered the call. The

only conclusion that the court can come into is that the deceased was among

living even at the time when the witnesses called her name. witness Seethadevi

seeing the GS alone in the deceased's compound does not create a doubt. The

body found immediately means that the body found within the almost at the

same time.

The witness Yasawathi has stated that she left the place on the failure of

tracing the deceased. Witness Seethadevi had come after Yasawathi left. When

Seethadevi came only the GS was present. The presence of GS is explained by

this two witnesses' conduct.

The GS testified to that he recovered the body lying in the toilet pit. The

learned Counsel submits that there is a contradictory inter se that who were

present at the time of the recovery of the body. There is no direct question put

6

to the GS on this issue. The GS had stated that Yasawathi and other villagers

came with him in search of the deceased. But who was present when the body

was recovered was not elicited from this witness.

The second factual misdirection that the counsel argued is contradiction

on the destruction of house hold furniture. The GS testified that some

photographs were damaged and thrown to the compound. Witness Yasawathi

was questioned whether the house hold furniture were damaged and destroyed

and she had answered negatively. These answers do not create any doubt in the

credibility of the witnesses.

As I stated above, in a case relying on the circumstantial evidence the

prosecution must be able to present evidence which will lead only to the

conclusion that the accused committed the crime. In the case of Don Sunny v.

The Attorney General [1998] 2 Sri L R 1 it was held that the prosecution must

prove that no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of

committing the offence. In the present case the witnesses testified to the fact

that when they came to the house of the deceased the appellant left from there.

The doors were open. The deceased was not to be seen. On further searching,

they found that the deceased lying in a toilet pit. There had been a hostility

between the deceased and the appellant on the previous day and in the morning

again a witness had heard the commotion from the deceased's house. When the

witnesses arrived at the deceased' house, the appellant was leaving the house

and they found that the deceased was murdered and put into a toilet pit. This

evidence directs only to one conclusion that the appellant had committed the

murder of the deceased.

The appellant in a dock statement stated that he left the house on the

previous day and had not come until the police called him. The appellant's

7

daughter who was living with him testified that they were living in Kandy on

the day in issue. Court has to be mindful of the fact that the whole incident

propped up on an information revealed to the appellant by his daughter, i.e.,

that the deceased is having an illicit affair with the GS. On this information she

lost her mother. Only her father was living. Court has to evaluate her evidence

with keeping this in mind.

The two witnesses testified to the fact that they met the appellant on the

day in issue at the deceased's house. They have spoken to the appellant. There

is no doubt on the identity of the appellant. With this evidence, my view is that

the appellant had failed to create a doubt in the mind of the learned High Court

Judge.

Under these circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the findings

of the learned High Court Judge.

I affirm the conviction and the sentence.
