The evidence of IP Jayasinghe and PC Edirisinghe, reveals that they surrendered themselves to the Police station. According to medical evidence, the prosecutrix had sexual intercourse for a period of time and that confirms the version of the prosecutrix. There is neither contradictions nor omissions marked in the evidence of the prosecutrix. She had no opportunity to make a complaint to the police and as soon as she got the opportunity she has made a statement to the police. Though the appellant mentioned in his doc statement that the prosecutrix was raped by her mother's paramour, it was never put to the witness in her cross examination or even the fact that her mother was carrying on with a paramour.",
