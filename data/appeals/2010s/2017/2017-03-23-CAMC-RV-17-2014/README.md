The 1st Respondent is a Police Constable attached to Nittambuwa Police

Station who was produced before the Magistrate as a suspect in this case.

The 2nd Respondent being the Senior Superintendent of Police of Kelaniya

Division had conducted investigations into this incident.

Assistant Superintendent of Police, Gampaha had filed the 1st report dated

I

J

2014-06-12, reporting to the Magistrate's Court that the death of P Prabath

Indika Jayasinghe, had been caused in an incident where the Suspect

Respondent had opened fire whilst being on duty. The report describing

I

1

the background of the said incident had stated that the Suspect

Respondent along with another Police Officer namely PC 85874 Nuwan

; I Thilakarathne had been on duty at Pasyala in Nittambuwa police area on

the Colombo Kandy main road. These two police officers were at that time,

engaged in duties pertaining to checking negligent driving, driving under

the influence of liquor, breaking traffic laws etc. According to that report,

the shooting incident had occurred around 1.30 PM on 2014-06-11. The

report further states that the Suspect Respondent was compelled to open

fire with his official revolver at the deceased, who, being the rider of a

motor bicycle, not only failed to obey the orders of Police Officers to stop

i 1 but also attempted to knock them down. The said report contains a

t

,

5

summary of statements given by the Police officer PC 85874 Thilakarathne

and Heripitiyalage Sachin Chaturanga who was the pillion rider of the

motor bicycle ridden by the deceased.

A second report had also been filed subsequently by the 2nd Respondent,

but the date on which it was filed is not clear. However, it would appear

from the contents of that report that the Suspect Respondent was

produced before the learned Magistrate along with that report. The journal

entry dated 2014-06-16 of the case record shows that the Suspect

Respondent was produced before the learned Magistrate on 2014-06-16.

Thus it can be concluded on these facts that it is on 2014-06-16 that the

2nd Respondent had filed the 2nd report. It is on that day that the learned

Magistrate had commenced recording evidence of the witnesses.

The 2nd Respondent (His report indicates that he is a Senior Superintendent

of Police in-charge of Kelaniya Police Division although he has been named

in the caption of the petition filed in this Court as an Assistant

Superintendent of Police. He has also informed this position to this Court

when he had appeared in this court on 2014-09-012) had also filed a 3rd

report on 2014-06-17 on which date the learned Magistrate had resumed

2 Vide journal entry dated 2014-09-01 of the docket.

6

the inquest proceedings and had proceeded to record the evidence of few

more witnesses.

The Journal entry dated 2014-06-17 of the case record shows that the

further inquest proceedings on that day had resumed at 1430 hrs.

Therefore, it can reasonably be concluded that the impugned order had

been made by the learned Magistrate towards the end of the day's

proceedings on the same dal as evidence of six witnesses had been

recorded on that day.

A closer look at the 2nd report filed by the 2nd Respondent on 2014-06-16

shows that, that report had also stated that it is for an offence punishable

under section 298 of the Penal Code that the Suspect Respondent is liable.

It is to be noted that the second report contains summaries of three more

witnesses not mentioned in the 1st report while the 3rd report contains

. names of 4 more witnesses4 to be called as witnesses at the inquest

proceedings.

2. COMPLAINT BY THE PETITIONER

At the end of the said inquest proceedings learned Magistrate had

delivered the impugned order dated 2014-06-17 in which she had held that

the death of the deceased was due to hemorrhage from internal injuries

caused to the body of the deceased due to gunshot injuries.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner had no complaint with regard to the

above finding by the learned Magistrate as it is perfectly within the purview

of the powers and duties entrusted to an inquirerS by virtue of section 370

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the 'Act').

However the learned Magistrate in the course of her order, has also held

i. that the evidence given by the pillion rider (Heripitiyalage Sachin

Chaturanga) cannot be accepted as a truthful testimony,

ii. that the said pillion rider by giving false evidence before Court, had

. . deliberately attempted to show that this incident is a murder,

iii. that this incident is not a murder,

5 As per section 370(4), nothing in section 370 shall preclude a Magistrate from holding an inquest.

8

iv. that this incident may have occurred due to shooting by Police

Officers as the deceased had failed to obey the orders to stop,

v. that this incident had occurred due to the negligence of the Suspect

Respondent in handling his fire arm.

It is this part of the learned Magistrate's order that the Petitioner is seeking

to revise in this application.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that the

learned Magistrate had failed to keep herself within the scope of Chapter

xxx of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. Thus, it is the

complaint of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that the learned

Magistrate had acted in excess of jurisdiction.

3. RESPECTIVE POSITIONS TAKEN UP BY THE

RESPONDENTS

It is appropriate at this stage to briefly identify the positions taken up on

behalf of the 1st Suspect-Respondent and the 2nd and 3rd Respondents

respectively.

9

A. ON BEHALF OF THE 1ST SUSPECT-RESPONDENT

Learned counsel for the Suspect-Respondent has taken up the position:

i. that the inquest proceedings cannot be challenged by way of a

revision application;

ii. that the findings arrived at, by the learned Magistrate is well within

the law as section 370(3) empowers a Magistrate to take steps if the

report or other material before him discloses a reasonable suspicion

that a crime has been committed and it is exactly that step that the

learned Magistrate in this case had taken;

iii. that it was necessary for the learned Magistrate to decide on the

offence in order to decide whether the suspect should be enlarged on

bailor not;

iv. that as neither the report nor the evidence in this case discloses an

offence punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code learned

Magistrate had taken a judicial decision after evaluating all the

1

material before her;

v. that all the material before the learned Magistrate favoured a finding i

under section 298 rather than a finding under section 296 of the

Penal Code.

B. ON BEHALF OF THE 2ND AND 3RD RESPONDENTS

Learned Senior State Counsel appearing for the 2nd and 3rd Respondents,

has advanced before this Court several arguments. When turning to those

arguments, it can be seen that he has launched three-pronged attack on

the case of the Petitioner. They are briefly as follows.

1. Revisionary jurisdiction of this Court does not lie to revise a verdict

of an inquirer at an inquest,

II. There are no exceptional circumstances pleaded in the petition,

III. Any pronouncement by this court on the legality of the impugned

order would only be academic since the Petitioner does not pursue

prayers (c), (d) and (e) of the Petition.

4. APPLICABLE LAW

Bearing in mind above mentioned respective positions advanced by the j parties, it is convenient to commence evaluating the submissions of the

j I , 1 \ l

I I I i

1 1

,

11

learned counsel for all the parties, by reproducing section 370 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. They are as follows;

Section 370

"Duty of inquirer

(1) Every inquirer on receiving information that a person -

(a) has committed suicide; or

(b) has been killed by an animal or by machinery or by an accident; or

(c) has died suddenly or from a cause which is not known,

shall immediately proceed to the place where the body of such deceased

person is and there shall make an inquiry and draw up a report of the

apparent cause of death, describing such wounds, fractures, bruises,

and other marks of injury, as may be found on the body and such

marks, objects and circumstances as in his opinion may relate to the

cause of death and stating in what manner such marks appear to have

been inflicted.

(2) The report shall be signed by such inquirer and shall be forthwith

12

forwarded to the nearest Magistrate.

(3) If the report or other material before him discloses a reasonable

suspicion that a crime has been committed the Magistrate shall take

proceedings under Chapter XIV and XV and in such event the record of

the inquiry and the inquirer's report shall be annexed to the record of the

proceedings before the Magistrate.

(4) Anything herein contained shall not preclude a Magistrate from

forthwith holding an inquiry under the powers vested in him by section 9,

whenever any of the events mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of

subsection (1) of this section have been brought to his notice.

(5) Any inquirer may, for the purpose of any inquiry under this Chapter, if

he considers it expedient, issue process to compel the attendance of any

witness to give evidence before him, or to produce any document or

other thing.

(6) If any person so summoned fails or neglects to attend at the time and

place specified in such summons, the inquirer may issue his warrant for

the apprehension and production before him of such person.

! ." I 4 I . }

I i J I ft 1

~

~

~ I

I I

13

(7) Every person who so fails to attend, or who refuses to take the oath

of a witnes~ or refuses to answer any question which shall be legally

asked of him/ or fails or refuses to produce any document or other thinrt

shall be guilty of an offence/ and shall be liable on conviction thereof to a

fine not exceeding one hundred rupee~ or to imprisonment of either

description for any period not exceeding three month~ or to both. "

5. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 'INQUIRER' AND 'MAGISTRATE'

It would be prudent at the outset to observe that the duties section 370

entrusts to an inquirer are different at some occasions, to the duties it

entrusts to a Magistrate. Further, such different sets of duties could easily

be separated from each other as they are required to be performed at

two different stages of the inquest proceedings.

It is section 370(1) which basically refers to the duty of an inquirer. Thus

one needs to distinguish and clearly identify the nature of the office of

'inquirer'. Section 2 of the Act has defined who an 'inquirer' is. According

to section 108 of the Act it is the Minister who appoints any person by

14

1 name or office to be an inquirer for any area the limits of which shall be

j i specified in such appointment. It must be stressed here that the inquirer's 1 I I duty as set out in section 370(1) is to draw up a report of the apparent ,

1 ,

J ! I

.1 1

1

cause of death.

In addition to the distinction between an inquirer and a Magistrate

referred to above, another occasion at which such distinction could be

observed is section 371 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. For

convenience that section is reproduced below:

5.371.

''(1) When any person dies while in the custody of the police or in a

mental or leprosy hospital or prison the officer who had the custody of

such person or was in charge of such hospital or prison, as the case

may be, shall forthwith give information of such death to a Magistrate ot

the Magistrate's Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the

body is found, and such Magistrate shall view the body and hold an

inquiry into the cause of death.

(2) For the purposes of an inquiry under this section a Magistrate shall

15

have all the powers which he would have in holding an inquiry into an

offence. "

Accordingly, in any of the situations set out in the above section,6 it is

only a Magistrate and not an inquirer who is not a Magistrate who can

conduct an inquiry into a death of such person.

Of course it must be stressed here for the avoidance of doubts that

nothing contained in section 370 shall preclude a Magistrate from

forthwith holding an inquiry under the powers vested in him by section 9

of the Act, whenever any of the events mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b)

and (c) of subsection (1) of section 370 have been brought to his notice.7

Indeed it is noteworthy that by virtue of section 9 of the Act a

Magistrate's Court anyway has jurisdiction to inquire into sudden or

accidental deaths8 of persons.

Towards the facilitation of the due performance of the duty, section

373(1) has empowered an inquirer, if he considers it expedient, to call

upon the Government Medical Officer of the district, or any other medical

16

practitioner, to hold a post mortem examination of the dead body, and to

report to such Magistrate or inquirer regarding the cause of death.

6. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 'CAUSE OF DEATH' AND 'APPARENT

CAUSE OF DEATH' I I I a I ,

It is to be noted that the meaning of the term "cause of death" in section

373(1) is different to the term "apparent cause of death" in section

370(1) of the Act.

What is contemplated in section 373(1) is the cause of death determined

by a Medical Officer upon performing a post mortem examination. In

other words, it is the cause for that person's death which is generally

described in medical terms by a Doctor. It must also be borne in mind

that a Medical Officer is not engaged in hearing evidence etc., in the run

up to his conclusion regarding the cause of death referred to in section

373(1) of the Act. It would only be the conduct of the post mortem

examination and the analysis reports if any, prepared pursuant to

17

laboratory tests of any sample that he may have obtained and forwarded

for analysis during the conduct of the post mortem examination which

would form the basis for his finding of the cause of death.

On the other hand, what section 370(1) contemplates is the apparent

cause of death as revealed by all the material available. This material

would include the evidence of witnesses who may have testified before

the inquirer. The apparent cause of death set out in the report drawn up

by an inquirer referred to in section 370(1) of the Act goes a step beyond

the threshold of cause of death referred to in section 373(1) reported by

a Medical Officer. 'The former is declared after consideration of the latter',

is how this Court could express this phenomenon in the briefest possible

way. In other words, the cause of death referred to in section 373(1)

reported by a Medical Officer upon performing a post mortem

examination is made use of by the inquirer in the process of his arriving

at a finding regarding the apparent course of death as per section 370(1).

18

7. IMPUGNED PART OF THE ORDER

As has been mentioned earlier in this judgment learned counsel for the

Petitioner did not seek to challenge the verdict returned by the learned

Magistrate at the inquest proceedings. This verdict is clearly mentioned at

page 22 of the proceedings. (1st and 2nd paragraphs of the impugned

order).

What the inquirer must do once he has completed the inquiry and drawing

up of the report setting out the apparent cause of death of the deceased,

is described in section 370(2).

According to section 370(2) the inquirer, once the report under section

370( 1) has been drawn up shall sign the said report and shall forthwith

forward it to the nearest Magistrate.

It is at this moment that the role of the Magistrate (as opposed to an

inquirer) begins. According to section 370 (3), the Magistrate shall take

proceedings under Chapter XIV and XV, if the report or other material

before him discloses a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been

It[

I

I

~

t

19

committed. It has to be re-iterated that this function is a function that has

exclusively been entrusted to the Magistrate and not to the inquirer.

Thus provisions in section 370(2) and 370(3) could be described as

another occasion which distinguishes duties of an inquirer from that of a

Magistrate.

It would be in order to consider at this juncture, the effect of the

impugned order made by the learned Magistrate in the instant case.

What the learned Magistrate had done after returning the verdict, has

amounted to;

i. an evaluation of evidence given by the witnesses and deciding on

the credibility of their evidence,

ii. deciding firmly, the offence that the suspect had committed,

iii. deciding firmly, that this incident is not a murder,

iv. making a firm conclusion regarding the way this incident has

occurred (i.e. due to shooting by Police officers as the deceased had

failed to obey the orders to stop),

IJ~ l JIIIl

I

t

20

v. deciding firmly, the intention the Suspect Respondent has had (i.e.

the decision that this incident had occurred due to the negligence of

the Suspect Respondent in handling his fire arm).

In this backdrop, the task before this Court at this moment would be to

decide whether the learned Magistrate is permitted by law to arrive at the

above findings.

8. ROLE OF THE MAGISTRATE UNDER SECTION 370 (3)

As has been mentioned above, what section 370 (3) requires a Magistrate

to do, if the report or other material before him discloses a reasonable

suspicion that a crime has been committed is to take proceedings under

Chapter XIV and XV. Therefore, it is necessary to ascertain the nature of

proceedings under Chapter XIV and XV.

Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act deals with the ways of

institution of proceedings and it is section 136 which is relevant at this

instance.

Accordingly, proceedings in a Magistrate's Court shall be instituted as

per section 136, in one of the following ways: -

,

21

(a) on a complaint being made orally or in writing to a Magistrate of

such court that an offence has been committed which such court has

jurisdiction either to inquire into or try :

(b) on a written report to the like effect being made to a Magistrate of

such court by an inquirer appointed under Chapter XI or by a peace

officer or a public servant or a servant of a Municipal Council or of an

Urban Council or of a Town Council; or

(c) upon the knowledge or suspicion of a Magistrate of such court to

the like effect:

(d) on any person being brought before a Magistrate of such court in

custody without process, accused of having committed an offence

which such court has jurisdiction either to inquire into or try; or

(e) upon a warrant under the hand of the Attorney-General requiring a

Magistrate of such court to hold an inquiry in respect of an offence

which such court has jurisdiction to inquire into; or

(f) on a written complaint made by a court under section 135.

,

22

Section 136(3) insists that no written complaint shall be entertained by

a Magistrate except as provided in section 136(1)

Chapter XV of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act deals with the institution

of Non-Summary proceedings. The relevant section therein is section 145

which is to the following effect:

" When the accused appears or is brought before the Magistrate's Court,

the Magistrate shall in a case -

(a) where the offence or anyone of them where there is more than

one/ falls within the list of offences set out in the Second Schedule to

the Judicature Act; or

(b) where the Attorney-General being of opinion that evidence recorded

at a preliminary inquiry will be necessary for preparing an indictment

within three months of the date of the commission of the offence so

direct~

hold a preliminary inquiry according to the provisions hereinafter

mentioned.

,

23

9. WHETHER A FINDING REGARDING 'APPARENT CAUSE OF

DEATH' BY AN INQUIRER BE REVISED.

Learned Senior State Counsel who appeared for the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents relying on the case of GAD Seneviratne Vs The Attorney

General9 sought to argue that the revisionary powers of this court cannot

be invoked to quash a finding made by a Magistrate or an inquirer at the

end of an inquest proceeding.

The basis for the above decision that the revisionary powers do not extend

to findings at inquest proceedings even when such inquest proceedings

had been conducted by a Magistrate is the fact that a Magistrate holding

an inquest proceeding is considered no more than an inquirer performing

the same function. Hence such Magistrate at such occasion cannot be said

to be acting judicially. The inquirer's role is confined to a restricted duty.

That is only to conduct an inquiry in order to draw up a report regarding

the apparent cause of death of the deceased.

971 NLR 439

1 ! I !

24

It is to be noted that the judgment in the case of GAD Seneviratne Vs

The Attorney GenerallO was pronounced by Court in respect of two

applications filed before it. One is an application for revision and the other

is an application for a writ of Certiorari. The relief claimed in both of those

applications was the same and that relief was to have the findings made

by the joint Magistrate- Colombo on 1966-09-15, at the conclusion of an

inquest held under chapter 32 of the then Criminal Procedure Code

quashed.

It must be noted that in that case, there had been two different verdicts

pronounced. The first was pronounced subsequent to the inquiry held in

April 1966 and the second made on 15th September 1966. The first verdict

was to the effect that it is a case of suicide while the second verdict was

to the effect that it is a case of culpable homicide. As has been mentioned

above th~ purpose of those two applications was to have the subsequent

verdict (i.e. the verdict that it is a case of culpable homicide) quashed.

Such a move if successful would leave the first verdict (i.e. the verdict that

it is a case of suicide) in force.

It is therefore clear that the purpose of those applications was to have the

10 Supra

IIIII! f

fJfIfI

t

, .. .

25

verdict of the inquirer changed into a verdict the petitioners in those cases

would have preferred to. Thus, in the light of those facts, the judgment in

that case is quite justifiable, understandable and perfectly in accordance

with law. Further this Court in similar circumstances would also have done

the same.

Therefore, this court is in full agreement with the judgment of that case

and hence by no means is attempting to deviate from the principle that a

verdict returned at the inquest of proceedings cannot be challenged in a

revision application. Further it must be borne in mind that the inquirer

conducting an inquest performs more an administrative function thus his

decision in an inquest proceedings is a decision made in the course of

such function and not a judicial decision made by a Magistrate.

10. WHETHER AN ORDER MADE UNDER SECTION 370(2) A

JUDICIAL ORDER.

It is to be observed that both the learned counsel for the Suspect -

Respondent and the learned Senior State Counsel in their respective

written submissions filed before this court, have submitted that any order

26

made by a Magistrate after the inquiry report is submitted to him under

section 370(2) would be a judicial order which would be made in terms of

the powers vested in the Magistrate by virtue of section 373(1) of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act.ll

As has been pOinted out before, the power given under section 370 (3) of

the Act, has to be exclusively exercised by a Magistrate after consideration

of the inquiry report or other material before him.

This means that the impugned part of the order of the learned Magistrate

is a judicial order. Therefore, such an order could be revised by a Court

exercising revisionary powers. Further, it is clear that the impugned part of

the order does not form part of the verdict or finding with regard to the

apparent cause of death pronounced in terms of section 370(1) of the Act.

This in turn establishes that the nature of the order that is being

impugned in this case is different from the nature of the order that was

impugned in the case12 relied upon by the Respondent.

11 Paragraph 17 of the written submission filed by the Suspect Respondent and Paragraph 3(ii) of the written submission filed by the Complainant Respondent.

12 GAD Seneviratne Vs The Attorney General (supra)

27

11. EFFECT OF PETITIONER NOT PURSUING PRAYERS (e),

(D) AND (E).

Although the prayers in this application have focused to have the order

granting bail to the Suspect Respondent set aside, at the time of

argument, learned counsel for the Petitioner stated to Court that he would

not pursue a cancellation of bail already granted to the Suspect

Respondent, but would focus on setting aside the finding by the learned

Magistrate which he submitted fell outside the scope of Chapter XXX of

the Act.

It must be borne in mind that the basis upon which the Petitioners have

prayed for cancellation of bail granted to the Suspect Respondent is the

illegality of the finding arrived at by the Magistrate. Therefore, it cannot

be said that the Petitioners have materially deviated from the grounds

they had based their petition at the inception. Indeed, if this court is to'

hold that the bail granted to the Suspect Respondent should be cancelled,

it probably would have to pronounce on the legality of the finding of the

learned Magistrate that the offence the Suspect Respondent had

"

28

committed is an offence punishable under section 298 of the Penal Code.

It is exactly this course of action that the Petitioner is now pursuing before

this court. Hence, the 3rd ground of attack by the learned Senior State

Counsel is not sufficient for this Court to halt the exercise of its revisionary

powers since the character and nature of this proceeding has not

changed.

12. FAILURE TO PLEAD EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

Although the learned Senior State Counsel has taken up the position that

no exceptional circumstances have been pleaded by the Petitioner. This

court at the first instance13 on 2014 - 08 - 29 had decided to entertain this

application considering the seriousness of it. It is recorded in following

terms:

" ..................... Heard Counsel in support of the application. Even though,

generally in matters like this where parallel jurisdiction is exercised both

by the High Court and this Court, Court opts to refer it back to the High

Court. However, taking into consideration the seriousness of the complaint

13 On the date Petitioner supported this application in this court for notices.

I,

l

29

and the application of the petitioner that the ori'ginal record be called for

inspection. Court is of the opinion that it is appropriate to entertain the

application by this Court and proceed on the matter. Registrar is directed

to issue notice on the parties and the complainant-respondent is directed

to appear in person on the next date which order to be communicated

through the SSP Gampaha over the phone and by way facsimile.

The complainant-respondent is directed to produce the LB. reports for

information of Court and also the statement if any made by the suspect-

respondent to the police .............. "

In addition, it must also be stated here that invoking revisionary

jurisdiction is a power that has been vested in the hands of courts rather

than in the hands of a party. This could be further illustrated by a

reference to a right of appeal that is vested in the hands of a party

aggrieved with an order of Court and not in the hands of a Court. If the

party aggrieved, does not prefer an appeal the Court will not be able to

assume jurisdiction to hear any appeal thereof. It is not the case in the

exercise of revisionary powers and that is why an application for revision

unlike an appeal must be supported in court. That is to satisfy court that it

iI

f

30

should issue notices on the Respondent. The court will decide to issue

notices on the Respondents only if it is satisfied that it is a fit case that the

court must look into in the exercise of its revisionary powers. If the Court

is not satisfied that there is a fit case to be looked into, that would be the

end of the revision application.

In these circumstances the fact that the petitioner has not pleaded any

exceptional circumstances cannot and should not stop this court in

exercising the revisionary powers the law has vested in it, in case this

Court finds the impugned order to be illegal and thus, would be having far

reaching consequences.

13. CONSIDERATION OF BAIL TO THE SUSPECT

At the end of the order the learned Magistrate had directed that the

Suspect Respondent be enlarged on bail as he had been produced before

Court in respect of an offence punishable under section 298 of the Penal

Code.

Question as to whether the Court should grant bail to the suspect

produced before it would be the next immediate issue that the Magistrate

31

will have to decide at this stage. Indeed that is what appears to have

bothered the mind of the learned Magistrate. That appears to be the

underlying reason for the learned Magistrate to have proceeded to arrive

at a definite conclusion as what offence the Suspect Respondent had

committed. That is because the question of bail will be dependent on the

nature of the offence he is alleged to have committed.

It would be necessary at this stage to refer to few provisions in the Bail

Act as in terms of section 27 of the Bail Act, it is the provisions of the Bail

Act which shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 with regard to the question

of bail pertaining to this case.

The section which is on the point is section 13 of the Bail Act which states

that a person suspected or accused of being concerned in committing or

having committed, an offence punishable with death or with life

imprisonment shall not be released on bail except by a judge of the High

Court.

In view of the above section of the Bail Act it becomes necessary for the

learned Magistrate to ascertain whether the Suspect Respondent is a

t

32

person suspected or accused of being concerned in committing or having

committed an offence punishable with death or life imprisonment. This is

because the offence of murder is an offence punishable with death under

section 296 of the Penal Code.

Thus, it would be incumbent upon the learned Magistrate to decide after

considering the report of the inquirer and other material before him,

whether the suspect can be categorized as a person suspected of being

concerned in committing or having committed an offence of murder. It

would be this decision that would determine whether he should enlarge

the Suspect Respondent on bail.

Therefore the role of the Magistrate at this pOint, would be to ascertain

whether the Suspect Respondent could be reasonably suspected or

accused of being concerned in committing or having committed, an

offence punishable with death or with life imprisonment. If the Suspect

Respondent falls under this category he shall not be released on bail

except by a judge of the High Court.

It would be useful at this stage also for learned Magistrate to bear in mind

that his role is only to ascertain whether there is a reasonable suspicion

33

that any offence has been committed. It is thus, important to understand

that there is no necessity for a Magistrate to arrive at a firm conclusion at

this stage as to the nature of the offence that has been actually

committed.

The importance of the restrictions placed on the scope of the duty of the

Magistrate is justifiable by the fact that the investigation has to proceed

beyond this point also until it reaches its completion.

In view of this section what is necessary to be decided by the Magistrate

is exactly what appears in that section. In other words, it would suffice at

this stage if the learned Magistrate only makes a decision as to whether

the Suspect Respondent is a person who is suspected of being concerned

of an offence punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code. This in all

probability could have been done without the impugned conclusions.

It must be noted in this case that the evidence given at the inquest by one

of the witnesses who was the pillion rider of the motor cycle has

suggested that the accused Respondent deliberately shot the deceased

without a justifiable reason. However, another witness who was a three-

wheeler driver has testified to the effect that the shooting by the Accused

34

Respondent was not deliberate but may have been accidental. That is a

special feature in this case. In the light of the two rival positions being

1 taken up by two different witnesses, question arises as to which set of I evidence the learned Magistrate should adopt to base his decision !

regarding bail to the Suspect Respondent. This assumes some importance,

as pOinted out before also, as the law relating to bail will vary with the

nature of the offence the Suspect Respondent is suspected to have

committed.

It must be remembered at this stage also that what the learned Magistrate

is expected to do under section 370(3) of the Act is to ascertain whether

the report or other material before him, discloses a reasonable suspicion

that a crime has been committed. In this case, available material discloses

a suspicion that a crime has been committed. That suspicion is a

reasonable suspicion because it is supported by evidence.

As has been mentioned above, it has become necessary for the learned

Magistrate to ascertain whether the Suspect Respondent could be

categorized as a person who is suspected or accused of being concerned

in committing or having committed the offence of murder. Therefore, the

35

task before the learned Magistrate is to ascertain whether the report or

other material before him discloses a reasonable suspicion that an offence

of murder has been committed.

14. CONCLUSION

It would be relevant at this stage to reproduce the following passage from

the case of GAD Seneviratne Vs The Attorney General14

" ................ However, it must be noted immediately that the function of an

inquirer or a Magistrate acting under Chapter 32 of the Criminal Procedure

Code is not to investigate an alleged crime or offence. Indeed, the whole

inquiry proceeds upon the basis that the cause of death is yet to be

ascertained. The learned Magistrate was mistaken when in his second

'verdict' he stated "The court is required only to ascertain whether the

evidence discloses a "reasonable suspicion" that an offence has been

committed." It is clear from the sections of law quoted above that the

function of an inquirer or Magistrate under Chapter 32 is to hold an

enquiry into the cause of death and to state as a finding what in his

14 supra

J

t

Itt

fI

I

36

opinion was the cause of death. The recording of the finding concludes

the inquest of death. If the finding of an inquirer forwarded to a

Magistrate under section 362(2) or of a Magistrate acting under section 9

or 363 of the Code gives rise in the Magistrate's mind to a reasonable

suspicion that the crime has been committed, the Magistrate may assume

the powers of a Magistrate's Court under section 148(1)(c) and initiate

criminal proceedings himself, but the right to initiate criminal proceedings

that is available to an inquirer under section 148(1)(b) and to a Magistrate

under section 148(1)(c) cannot alter the nature of an inquest of death that

may precede such initiation of criminal proceedings; it only emphasizes

the investigative nature of those proceedings. is ......... "

When considering the totality of the circumstances emerged in this case, it

is the view of this court that it has not become really necessary for the

Magistrate to come to a finding whether some witnesses have deliberately

given false evidence. It has also not become necessary to decide the exact

manner in which the shooting had occurred at this stage. This is so in view

of the fact that the function of the learned Magistrate at this stage is only

to ascertain whether the report or other material before him discloses Q

15 At page ....

37

reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. If the learned

Magistrate is satisfied that such report discloses a reasonable suspicion

that a crime has been committed, the next course of action which is open

to him is to take proceedings under chapter XIV and XV.

The scope of steps contemplated in chapter XIV and XV were discussed

earlier in this judgment.

In this case the step that the learned Magistrate should take is to institute

proceedings in this case in terms of section 136(1) (b) as it empowers a

Magistrate to institute proceedings on a written report indicating that an

offence has been committed made to such court by an inquirer appointed

under chapter XI.

Although the order of the learned Magistrate reveals that the medical

officer has tendered the cause of death of the deceased to Court, there is

no indication that the post-mortem report has been received by the

learned Magistrate by the time she made the impugned order. Perusal of

the post mortem report assumes an importance due to the fact that some

of the witnesses appear to give the impression that the Suspect

Respondent opened fire shooting the deceased at close range. The post

38

mortem report if available could be expected to reveal some forensic

evidence which would be of some assistance to the evaluation of the said

rival positions. Therefore, the impugned conclusion that there is no

offence punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code becomes a

premature conclusion arrived at without consideration of any such possible

revelations of the post-mortem report. It would not be in the best interest

of justice to make such pre mature conclusions at such preliminary stages

of such proceedings in rather desperation. The post mortem report,

pertaining to this case when made available might sometime prove that

the learned Magistrate is right in her conclusion. However the question

which troubles this Court is; What if the post mortem report corroborates

the testimony of the witness which the learned Magistrate disbelieved?

Things would then turn in a different direction in such a situation. The

conclusion by the learned Magistrate may then lead to an injustice. Such

injustices could be averted if the Magistrates take care to ensure that they

do not step outside the scope of the duty that the law has entrusted to

them under section 370 of the Act.

The Magistrates, when called upon to ascertain, as required by section

370(3) of the Act, whether the report of an inquirer discloses a reasonable

Iii II

rl

suspicion that a crime has been committed, must be mindful of the

followings:

I. that their function is to ascertain whether the report or other

material before him discloses a reasonable suspicion that a crime

has been committed;

II. that the investigation in most case will have to continue after this

finding also;

III. the witnesses who have testified before the inquirer have not been

subjected to cross examination;

IV. that the non-summary inquiry and sometimes the trial will have to

be conducted in courts at a subsequent occasion;

V. that there is likelihood of a full drawn criminal trial in the High

Courts.

VI. credibility of the witnesses will be tested in the course of the trial;

VII. that the consideration of charges must best be done after a proper

investigation is completed.

III I. that it is the Attorney General who will decide on the charges to be

included in the indictment filed in the High Court.

f I

I ' I ':

40

Magistrates must in these circumstances, take utmost care to guard

against any prejudice that could be caused to the future steps of the case.

It could be seen that there is no difficulty to conclude that the report and

the other material before the learned Magistrate in the instant case

discloses a reasonable suspicion that an offence under section 298 of the

Penal Code has been committed. However, the question here is whether

the learned Magistrate could totally ignore the assertions by the pillion

rider of the motor cycle that the shooting was deliberate. If the learned

Magistrate entertained doubts with regard to the veracity of this position

of the three-wheeler driver, she could have said so in rather a lighter tone

than saying that she disbelieved that witness altogether. There cannot be

any difficulty in such a move as her role should only be to ascertain

whether there is a reasonable suspicion that an offence has been'

committed.

Towards the end of the learned Magistrate's order it appears that the main

reason she has given for releasing the Suspect Respondent on bail is the

fact that the police report states that it is an offence punishable under

I, I

f I I

tI1

I I I 1 i 1 I j I I t

.~.

41

section 298 of the Penal Code that the Suspect Respondent is alleged to

have committed. If that is the sole reason for her decision, and if she had

chosen to accept and act upon that report, there is no necessity for her to

go into the question of credibility of the witnesses. It is relevant to note

that at no time no charge punishable under section 296 was ever

mentioned as the offence that the Suspect Respondent is suspected to

have committed in any of the reports filed by police.

In these circumstances, it is the view of this court that the impugned

findings set out below; made by the learned Magistrate cannot be

justified.

Further, it would be inevitable that certain parts of the impugned findings

of the learned Magistrate would adversely affect any prosecution that may

be launched subsequently against the suspects as the learned Magistrate

has already held that some of the witnesses had given false evidence.

For the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the following

conclusions arrived at by the learned Magistrate namely,

i. that the evidence given by the pillion rider(Heripitiyalage Sachin

Chaturanga) cannot be accepted as a truthful testimony;

i i I

I

42

ii. that the said pillion rider had deliberately attempted to show to

court, by giving false evidence that this incident is a murder;

iii. that this incident is not a murder;

iv. that this incident may have been occurred due to shooting by Police

officers as the deceased had failed to obey the orders to stop;

v. that this incident had occurred due to negligence of the Suspect

Respondent Police officer in handling his fire arm,

has been arrived at without any jurisdiction on her part to do so.

Therefore, acting in revision, we set aside the above conclusions arrived at

by the learned Magistrate.

We further direct the learned Magistrate to take the next step according to

law i.e. to take proceedings under Chapter XIV and XV, of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act.

Before parting with this judgment this Court needs to state here for

avoidance of any misinterpretation of this judgment, that it is purely due

to the inappropriacy of the aforementioned conclusions that this Court

decided to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction. As has been submitted

43

before us by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, this matter is already

under consideration by the Hon. Attorney General who would decide the f ! I[ next course of action to be taken by him. Thus it would only be the

aforementioned specific conclusions that would be set aside by this

judgment.

Further, this Court also has to emphasize that this judgment should not be Iinterpreted either as having effected an alteration of the finding with

regard to the apparent cause of death by the learned Magistrate, or as

having held that the Suspect Respondent is alleged to have committed a

particular offence16
