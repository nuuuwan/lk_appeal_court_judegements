CA 433/2013 WRIT

This Court heard both the Counsel for the Petitioner and learned Additional

Solicitor General. By way of this application for judicial review the Petitioner seeks

the following remedies.

1. A writ of certiorari to quash P8 dated 01.07.2013, which was a revocation of an

Environmental Protection License (hereinafter referred to as EPL) granted to the

Petitioner for a period between 08.11.2010 and 07.11.2013.

2. A writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the 5th Respondent - the Secretary

to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environmental Renewable Energy,

which was a decision given upon an appeal made to the Secretary against the

revocation of the environment protection license-P11(c).

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner argues that P8 dated 01.07.2013 was

issued despite the fact that his stone crushing operation was not in progress at

the time of the site inspection made by officers of Central Environment Authority.

It has to be observed though that P8 narrates a violation of a condition attached to

the EPL that was granted to the Petitioner namely, the Petitioner should maintain

a clean environment in which the particles that are likely to escape from the

crushing operation have to be eliminated by way of measures specified in the EPL.

The letter of revocation of the EPL (P8) dated 1.07.2013 recites that there has been

an infringement of this condition. In any event the Petitioner made use of his

statutory right of appeal and he was afforded an opportunity of being heard at an

inquiry conducted on 14.10.2013. At this inquiry, residents who were living in the

vicinity of the site had been present and made representations before the

Secretary to the Ministry. The Petitioner himself made representations on his

behalf at this inquiry. Thus, this Court finds that as far as procedural impropriety

is concerned, this requirement has been fully met by the statutory functionary

affording an opportunity to be heard. It is evident that though some of the trees

that were meant to prevent injurious metal particles flying into the vicinity were in

a state of dilapidation, the Petitioner had not taken steps to ameliorate the

conditions of this protective coverage.

The Secretary to the Ministry who conducted this inquiry has considered all the

representations that were made before him. This Court does not fmd any grounds

on which the decision of the Secretary could be vitiated. The Counsel for the

Petitioner contended that the Secretary also recites as a ground for his decision

the fact that the Petitioner lacked title to the land on which the operations were

conducted. It was contended that this was not a requirement imposed by the

statute. An administrative authority can take into account as relevant

considerations grounds which are not even specified in a statute. In the light of

the fact that people who live in the vicinity have to be protected from

environmental depredations having regard to the fact that sustainable

development certainly factors into its consideration a clean environment and a

healthy neighborhood, more weight has been given by the Secretary to relevant

considerations such as environmental pollution and clean environment and in a

situation where the statuary functionary has taken due account of relevant

considerations, the fact that the secretary has referred to lack of title on the part

of the petitioner to the land on which the petitioner is carrying on his business is

not grave enough to invest the decision of the Secretary with Wednesbury

unreasonableness. In the circumstances, this Court cannot conclude that the

decision maker acted unreasonably in the Wednesbury sense. In other words the

decision is not "so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could have come to

it" -vide Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation.!

This Court wishes to reiterate that in matters of judicial review this Court is not

concerned whether a decision is right or wrong. The issue is not whether a

decision of a statutory functionary is right or wrong, nor whether the court agrees

with it, but whether it is a decision which the Secretary in this case was lawfully

entitled to make.

Given the above indicia, we fmd no reason to interfere with the decisions marked

P8 & PIIC which are sought to be challenged in these proceedings. Therefore, we

refuse the application of the petitioner.
