The instant Appeal was filed against the impugned Judgment of the learned

Judge of the District Court of Colombo dated 12.07.1999 in case bearing

No. 16262/M.

The said District Court action was filed by the Plaintiff -Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) against the 1 st and 2nd Defendant -

Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Appellants) and the 3 rd Defendant

Seemasahitha Wennapupuwa J anatha Santhaka Pravahna Sevaya.

The Plaintiff sought inter alia for;

a) A declaration that his removal as Director of the 3rd Respondent

Company was illegal, null and void;

b) A sum of Rs. 500,0001- as compensation from the 1st - 3rd Defendants

jointly and severally for the pain of mind, social and financial loss

suffered as a result of his removal.

By judgment dated 12.07.1999 the learned Trial Judge found in favor of the

Plaintiff and awarded Rs. 200,0001 as compensation to the Plaintiff, to be paid

by the Defendants jointly and severally.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgement the instant Appeal was preferred on

several grounds and the Appellant's main contention was that Article 10 of the

Articles of Association was misinterpreted. The Appellants further contended

5

that the 1 sl - 3rd Defendants could not have been held jointly and severally liable

for a breach of contract of employment which subsisted between the Plaintiff

and the 3rd Defendant.

In brief the Plaintiff took up the position that the principal grievance of the

Plaintiff -- Respondent relates to his removal as Director of the 3 rd Respondent

Company by the 1 sl Appellant. The cause of action of the Plaintiff is solely

based on Article 10 of the Articles of Association marked as P2 and attached to

the Plaint, wherein it is stated as follows;

'Such first executive directors may be removed by the Secretary to the

Treasury or the Board of Directors, for any reason whatsoever but

without prejudice to any claim they many have for damages for breach of

any contract of service between them and the Company. '

The Plaintiff - Respondent had been appointed as one of the first directors by

letter of the 1st Defendant dated 27.06.1991 marked as P3 as attached to the

Plaint and marked as P2 at trail. He had been removed from this position by the

letter of the 1 sl Defendant by letter dated 24.ll.1994 marked as P5 as attached

to the Plaint and marked as P4 at trail.

The crux of the Appellants case is a misinterpretation of Article 10 of the

Articles of Association by the learned Trial Judge.

The Plaintiff was appointed to the post of General Manager by the Defendant -

Respondent pursuant to a contract date 29.06.1991 which has been marked as

P4 as attached to the Plaint and marked as P3 at trail. It is significant that the

6

Plaintiff has not alleged a breach of this contract as the basis for his prayer for

compensation.

The Appellant's position is that this provision allows for a removal of a Director

for any reason whatsoever, by the 1 st Defendant and even goes so far as to say

that even a removal on a political basis is justified. The Appellant contends that

the only exception to the limitless capacity of the 1 st Defendant to remove a

Director is the statement that "without prejudice to any claim they many have

for damages for breach of any contract of service between them and the

Company" which the Appellants contends is unambiguous and clear in this

regard.

In this light the Appellants are of the view that at trial however, the Plaintiff did

not pursue the breach of contract as the cause of action but the removal per se.

The Plaintiff submits a list of technical faults which he alleges have been

committed by the Appellants in preferring this Appeal. The Respondent

contends that the 3 rd Respondent Company was incorporated as a limited

Company under the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 in 09.07.l991 and that it is

governed by the Articles of Association and further that the appointment of the

Plaintiff as a Company Director under Article 10 of articles of association and

allowing the Respondent to continue his work without signing any new

employment contracts its tantamount to the assurance that the employment

contract prior to the incorporation would continue under the new management.

Reference is made to section 3(2) of the Conversion of Government Owned

Business Undertakings into Public Corporations Act, No. 22 of 1987 which

states that;

II

7

(c) all officers and servants of that business undertaking all the day

immediately preceding the relevant date who are not offered employment

with the Corporation or who do not accept any such offer of employment

shall be entitled to the payment of such compensation and gratuity as may

be determined by the Cabinet of Ministers;

(d) all contracts and agreements entered into for the purposes of that

business undertaking and subsisting on the day immediately preceding

the relevant date shall be deemed, with effect from the relevant date, to be

contracts and agreements entered into by that corporation;

The Plaintiff therefore submits that the former employment contract reflected in

appointment letter marked and produced as P4 along with the Plaint would be

fit and proper to entitle the Respondent to institute an action to claim this right

for damages under Article 10 aforementioned.

The learned Counsel for the Appellants brings to the attention of this Court

cases CA No. 456/98 (F), Mendis Vs. Seema Sahitha Panadura lanatha

Santhaka Pravahana Sevaya and others 1995 (2) SLR 284 and Seabridge

Shiiping Ltd Vs. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation 2002 (1) SLR 126.

The case of CA No. 456/98 (F) concerns a similar but factually different case to

the instant appeal, where Article 10 of Association of the Maharagama 1 anatha

Santhaka Pravahana Sevaya was considered by Chitrasiri 1.

This Court is of the view that a plain reading of Article 10 of the Articles of

Association marked as P2 and attached to the Plaint, wherein it is stated as

follows;

IIII!

'Such first executive directors may be removed by the Secretary to the

Treasury or the Board of Directors, for any reason whatsoever but

without prejudice to any claim they many have for damages for breach of

any contract of service between them and the Company. '

Is clear in that the Secretary to the Treasury may for any reason whatsoever

remove an executive Director and as such this Court finds that the termination

of the Plaintiff was not illegal and therefore not null and void and that the

learned Trial Judge has misapplied the above Article. This Court further finds

that the award of compensation to Plaintiff was unsubstantiated and as such bad

in law.

For the aforesaid reasons this appeal is allowed. The action filed by the Plaintiff

- Respondent is dismissed. The learned Trial Judge is directed to enter decree

accordingl y.

Appeal allowed.
