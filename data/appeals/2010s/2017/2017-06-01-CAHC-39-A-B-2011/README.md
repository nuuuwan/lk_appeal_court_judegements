Charge No.2:-

That on the same transaction did cause hurt to one Malinda Dinesh Wijekoon an offence

punishable under section 315 of the Penal Code.

After trial the learned high court Judge of Colombo found the 1st and the 2nd accused

appellants guilty of the 1st charge while acquitting all three accused from the second charge

levelled against them.

The 1st and the 2nd accused were sentenced to a term of 4 years imprisonment and a fine of Rs.

10,000 along with a default term of 6 months imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence imposed by the learned high court

judge, the appellant lodged an appeal and moves this court to quash and set aside the same.

When this matter was taken up for hearing learned counsel for the appellant submitted

following grounds of appeal:-

(1) The accused appellants were not offered a fair trial as there had not been a proper

evaluation of the evidence of the prosecution.

(2) The evidence as regards to the 1st and the 2nd accused appellants in furtherance of a

common intention has not been adequately considered by the learned trial judge.

(3) The issue of accused exercising the right of private defence has not been considered by

the learned trial judge.

Both learned counsel for accused appellants submitted that according to the injured, Jayadewa

Mahinda he had received a blow from his behind and then he fell down then the 1st and the 2nd

accused attacked him with clubs to his hands and legs. They further submitted that the injured

had not seen the person who caused injuries to his head. Also submitted that according to

witness Dayananda Siriwardena, the 1st accused appellant dealt a blow to Jayadewa Mahinda's

head and he fell down. After that they carried him to the road.

The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant was that the medical evidence was

hearsay since the dr. who wrote the bed head ticket was not called to give evidence at the trial.

The medical report does not reveal any injuries caused to arms and legs. Further, according to

the short history provided by the injured, the 1st accused appellant's name is not implicated as

he caused injuries to the injured. It was the 2nd accused appellant who caused injuries.

According to the submissions of the counsel for the first accused appellant was that the only

evidence against the 1st appellant was that he was unknown to witness Sugath Dayaynanda

Siriwardena who assaulted Jayadewa Mahinda and there was no identification Parade held. I,I

Therefor it was merely doc identification and the learned high court judge had not considered

this aspect. Further stated that the learned high court judge neither had the opportunity of

observing the demeanour of the witness nor the previous high court judge recoded the same.

Both counsel submitted that there was no proper evaluation of evidence against both the

appellants by the learned high court judge.

Learned counsel for the 1st Appellant submitted that in the case of Rex Vs Aranolis 44 NLR 370 it

was held that when there were more than one person who could have committed the offence

and when there was no evidence of common intention both accused have to be acquitted of

the charge. Therefor both appellants in this case need to be acquitted.

The JMO when giving evidence categorically rejected that the injuries were not due to a fall and

testified that the injuries were of a very serious nature. According to evidence the injured's

skull was crushed to the extent where the fluid inside was leaked out of his ears.

The 2nd accused appellant claimed that a group of 30-40 people invaded his land break opening

his gate but that position was not established by evidence. The police officer who conducted

the investigation categorically stated that they were no signs of break opening a gate.

Therefore it is abundantly clear that there was no such act committed by the victims. According

to evidence the appellants had ample time to have recourse to the protection of the public

authorities. Thereby they were not entitled to exercise their Right of Private Defence under

section 92(3) of the Penal Code.

Though the appellants rely on the defence of the Right of Private Defence, they have not

adequately established that they were entitled to exercise their Right of Private Defence within

the ambit of the provisions stipulated in section 90 of the Penal code.

Considering all above I am of the view that the learned trial judge has very correctly and cautiously considered the evidence and taken a correct decision .I see no merit in this appeal. Therefore I affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge.

The appeal is hereby dismissed.
