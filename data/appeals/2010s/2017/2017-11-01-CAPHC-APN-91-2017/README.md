ORDER

P Padman Surasena 1

The 1st Party Respondent - Petitioner - Petitioners (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Petitioners) and the 2nd Party Respondent -Respondent -

Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Respondents) are

two rival parties in the instant case which is a proceeding instituted under

section 66 (1) (a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act by the officer in

Charge of Police Station Rathnapura.

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into the complaint, by his

order dated 2015-03-26, had concluded that the Respondents are entitled

to have the possession of the land which is the subject matter of the

dispute.

Being aggri.eved by the said order made by the learneq Primary Court

Judge, the Petitioners had filed an application for revision in the Provincial

High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Rathnapura seeking a

revision of the order of the Primary Court.

5

The Provincial High Court after hearing refused the said revision

a ppl ication.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner conceded at the outset that an appeal

has also been filed in respect of the same matter i.e. against the said

judgment of the Provincial High Court. It was his submission that the

purpose of filing this revision application despite the pending appeal is to

obtain the interim relief prayed for in the prayers of this petition.

The interim order prayed for by the Petitioner is an order to remove all the

obstructions constructed by the Respondents on the disputed road way. It

is common ground that the said constructions impugned in these

proceedings had been put up after the delivery of the order of the

Provincial High Court. 1 Thus, it is clear that this construction had not

formed part of the subject matter of the dispute before the lower Courts.

In the case of Jayantha Gunasekara V Jayatissa Gunasekara and others2

this Court had held that mere lodging in the Court of Appeal, an appeal . .

against a judgment of the High Court in the exercise of its revisionary

power in terms of article 154 P (3) (b) of the Constitution, does not

1 Paragraph 24 of the petition.

automatically stay the execution of the order of the High Court. A passage

from that judgment which would be relevant here is as follows.

" .... Obviously, to put off the execution process until the appeal is heard

would tantamount to prolong the agony and to let the breach of peace to

continue fora considerable length of time. This in my opinion cannot be

the remedy the Parliament has clearly decided upon. Hence I am confident

that the construction we are mindful of placing by this judgment would

definitely suppress the mischief and subtle inventions and evasions for

continuance of the mischief .... "

This Court cannot find fault with the Respondents for putting up a wall to

enjoy their rights vindicated by a Court process.

Since there is an appeal pending before this Court it is open for the parties

to have their rights decided by this Court in that appeal.

Further, as pOinted out by the learned counsel for the Respondents it is not

possible for this Court to assume original jurisdiction to adjudicate a new

matter in respect of which there is no pronouncement by the Primary

Court.

.. 7

In these circumstances this Court sees no basis to issue notices on the

Respondents.

The revision application should stand dismissed.

I agree,
