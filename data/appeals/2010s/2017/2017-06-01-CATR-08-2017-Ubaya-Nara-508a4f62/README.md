Heard learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Petitioners and the Counsel for the

Defendant-Respondent. Plaintiff-Petitioners have come before this Court seeking an

order under Section 46 of the Judicature Act for a transfer of a matter pending before

the District Court of Kaduwela. As observed by this Court the petitioner's main

argument before this Court was based on pre-payment cost ordered by the learned

District Judge when the matter was fIxed for argument before the said Court on

25.01.2017. However, in this regard we observed that the learned District Judge after

making an order for Rs. 100,000/- to be paid as pre-payment cost had thereafter

reduce the amount to Rs. 25,000/-. As submitted by the learned Counsel for the

Defendant-Respondent, it is her Senior Counsel who made the application for pre-

paid cost before the District Court. In these circumstances, it is observed that making

an order for pre-payment of cost on a trial date alone cannot consider a ground to

transfer a case since the said act is insuffIcient to establish that a fair and impartial

trial cannot be taken up before the said District Judge. As further observed by this

Court the plaintiff-petitioners have made an application to lay by the proceedings in

I!

,

the District Court until the Criminal Proceedings are completed before the High

Court of Colombo. The said application was made not before the present District

Judge but before his predecessor and when an application was made to vacate the

said decision it is the predecessor of the present Judge who overruled the said

application and fIxed the matter for trial on 25.01.2017. In the said circumstances,

we are not satisfIed with the material placed before this Court by the learned Counsel

for the petitioner to establish that the said conduct of the District Judge of Kaduwela

amounts to an act comes within Section 46 of the Judicature Act. In the said

circumstances, we are not inclined to issue notices in this matter and notices are

accordingly refused.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.
