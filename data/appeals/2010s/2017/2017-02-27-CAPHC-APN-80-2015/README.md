L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This matter comes up before us on a revision application filed by

the Hon. Attorney General against the sentence imposed by the learned

High Court Judge of Anuradhapura. The Accused Respondent (the

Accused) was indicted before the High Court of Anuradhapura on 3

charges namely;

1. Committing abduction on Chandrika Kumari Ariyapala who is less

than 16 years of age from her legal guardian, punishable under

section 354 of the Penal Code

2. Committing sexual harassment on Chandrika Kumari Ariyapala,

punishable under section 345 of the Penal Code

3. Committing robbery of a gold chain and a pendent worth of Rs.

25,000/=, punishable under section 380 of the Penal Code

The Accused at the first instance pleaded not guilty to all charges

but after few trial days, tendered an unqualified plea of guilty to all three

charges. He was convicted on his own plea and sentenced as follows:

st 1. 1 count, 2 years RI suspended for 5 years

Fine of Rs. 1000/= in default 6 months simple

imprisonment

2. 2nd count, 2 years RI suspended for 15 years

Fine of Rs. 1000/= in default 6 months simple

imprisonment

Compensation of Rs. 25,000/= to be paid to the

victim, no default term ordered

3. 3 rd count, 2 years RI suspended for 10 years

Fine of Rs. 1000/= in default 6 months simple

imprisonment

Being dissatisfied with the adequacy of the sentence, the Hon.

Attorney General presented this revision application seeking to revise the

order of sentence by ordering an appropriate sentence.

The Accused was issued with notice of this application on two

occasions but did not appear in Court personally or through a Counsel.

Therefore we were deprived of the privilege of hearing from the Accused

side; we considered the submissions made by the Counsel at hearing

before the learned High Court Judge prior to imposing the sentence.

In the case of Abeywardene v. Fernando et al. 27 NLR 97 Bertram

C.J. in explaining the meaning of the breach the peace within the meaning

of sections 80 and 81 of the Criminal Procedure Code expressed the

opinion that;

The King is entitled to require that all persons living under the

protection shall not be subjected to violence in respect of their

persons or their property. Any person who does subject to violence

either the person or property of one of the King's subjects has

committed a breach of the King's peace.

A person who is committing the breach of the King's peace has to

be punished for violating the law irrespective of the surrounding

circumstances which led the Accused to commit the violence act against

the King's subject. In deciding the adequate punishment, the Court can

consider the aggravating and mitigatory factors, within the parameters of

the law.

The Indian Supreme Court held in the case of Raviji @ Ram

Chandra vs State of Rajasthan 1996 AIR 787 considering the proper

punishment for a murder of the wife of the accused and his miner

children and two outsiders held that; II II

"It is the nature and the gravity of the crime but not the criminal,

which are germane for the consideration of appropriate

punishment in a criminal trial. The Court will be failing in its duty if appropriate punishment is not awarded for a crime which has

been committed not only against the individual victim but also

against the society to which the criminal and the victim belong.

The punishment to be awarded for a crime must not be irrelevant

but it should confirm to the end be consistent with atrocity and

brutality with which the crime has been perpetrated, the enormity

of the crime warranting public abhorrence and it should respond

to the society's cry for justice against criminal. In our view, if for

such heinous crimes the most deterrent punishment for wanton and

brutal murders is not given, the case of deterrent punishment will

loose its relevance. "

Indian Supreme Court in the case of Dhananjoy Chaterjee vs State

of W.B. 1994 SCR (1) 37 where a school girl was raped and murdered

held that;

"Imposition of appropriate punishment is the manner in which the

Courts respond to the society's cry for justice against criminals.

Justice demands that the Courts should impose punishment

befitting the crime so that the Courts reflect public abhorrence of

crime. The Courts must not only keep in view of the rights of the

criminal but also the rights of the victim of crime and the society at

large while considering the imposition of appropriate punishment."

Keeping the above legal environment in mind, I now consider the

incident. The victim is a school going girl preparing for the GCE OIL

examination. She used to go to school and to other tuition classes by her

bicycle. On the day of the incident, while she was returning home from a

tuition class, the Accused obstructed her and asked her to kiss him. She

5

has refused and scolded. Thereafter he dragged her to the nearby corn

field and bitten her face and forcibly removed her blouse and compresses

her breast. She has resisted and struggled to escape. At this time her aunt

came in search of her calling her name and the Accused had run away

snatching her gold chain and pendent.

The Accused has admitted all the charges leveled against him. In

his statement to the police also he has admitted the incident. The

explanation given by the Accused is that he was annoyed by her scolding.

He has ignored the fact that the incident was created by him by stopping

the victim and asking her to kiss him. If he has not taken the first step of

obstructing the victim and asking to kiss him, she wouldn't have scolded

the Accused. The first step taken by the victim to defend herself is

scolding the Accused. Therefore the explanation of the Accused that he

was annoyed is not acceptable.

There is no evidence that they had a love affair and no evidence to

show that the victim consented. The investigation notes of the police

revealed that there were struggle marks and the footsteps that show that

she was dragged to the com field. The Accused used force on the victim

to satisfy his immoral cravings. This is not only a crime against the victim

but a crime against the society.

In considering the appropriate punishment, Court has to consider

the punishment prescribed by the law and then the aggravating and

mitigatory factors.

Chitrasiri J. in the case of Asan Mohamed Rizwan v. Attorney

General CA [PHC] APN 141113 CA Minutes dated 25.03.2015 expressed

several guide lines in sentencing policies. His Lordship after a

comprehensive analysis of authorities held that;

Having referred to the importance of looking at the available

statutory provisions, 1 will now advert to the other aspects that are

necessary to consider before a sentence is determined. Those can

be categorized as follows:

(a) The maximum and the minimum (if any) penalty

prescribed for the offence;

(b) The nature and gravity/seriousness of the particular

offence.

(c) The offender's culpability and degree of his/her

responsibility for the offence

(d) mental state of the accused at the time the offence was

committed;

(e) Evidence as to pre-arrangement for the commission of

the offence;

(j) The impact of the offence on any victim and the injury,

loss or damage caused as a result of the offence

committed;

(g) Whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence and if

so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did

so or the stage at which it was indicated;

(h) The conduct of the offender during the trial as an

indication of remorse or the lack of remorse;

(i) Any action taken by the offender to make restitution of the

injury, loss or damage arising from the offence, including

his or her willingness to comply with any order for

restitution that a court may consider.

0) The offender's previous character, good or bad;

f I I ,I

IIl I

(k) Imprisonment should be used when no other sentence IS

adequate;

(I) Proportionality between the crime and the sentence;

(m) Possibility of reforming the offender;

(n) To ensure consistency in deciding sentences;

(0) Presence of any aggravating or mitigating factors

concerning the offender or any other circumstance

relevant to the commission of the offence; and

In the present case the Accused was pre prepared to commit this

high handed action against the victim. He got down from the motor

bicycle in which he was travelling after seeing the victim coming and

waited at a place where there are no houses until she comes. Then he

forcibly stopped the victim's bicycle and forced her to kiss him. On

refusal, he used force on her to commit the offences.

The learned High Court Judge's observation that if an adult has

gone with the victim this incident wouldn't have happened and therefore

the responsibility casting on the adult relations of the victim; is not

tenable in law. The Legislature in its wisdom provided the protection to

the minor children, and to all persons, by enacting necessary laws to

protect them and making the violation of it is punishable. The law does

not require the parents to go after their children all the time to protect

them. Punishing the Accused leniently for not providing protection by

parents to the victim is not acceptable. The culpability of the Accused in

the present case is very high and there is no culpability on the part of the

victim or her relations. The Accused needs to be punished severely.

The Accused submitted that he is a married person and having a

child and the learned High Court Judge has considered this fact in

sentencing. In the case of Mohamed Amza Mohamed Roshan v AG

CA 137/2015 CA Minutes dated 11.11.2016 where a boy of 8 years was

I! l II

subjected to grave sexual abuse punishable under section 365B (2)(b) of

the penal code, S.Devika De Livera Thennakoon J. after considering

several authorities held that

"the judicial discretion should not be exercised to impose a lesser

sentence and/or suspended sentence in matters concerning serious

offences such as the offence for which the appellant in the instant

application stand convicted. "

Thennakoon J further cited with approval the citation made by

Gunasekara J in the case of Attorney General vs Mendis [1995] 1 Sri L R

138 at 144 that

"In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender

the judge should consider the matter of sentence both from the

point of view of the public and the offender. Judges are too often

prone to look at the question only from the angle of the offender. A

judge in determining the proper sentence should first consider the

gravity of the offence, asst appears from the nature of the act itself

and should have regard to the punishment provided in the penal

code or other statute under which the offender is charged. He

should also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent and

consider to what extent it will be effective. /I

Section 303 of the Criminal Procedure Code specifies the instances

where a suspended sentence can be imposed. It enacts;

303.

(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, on sentencing an

offender to a term of imprisonment, a court may make an

order suspending the whole or part of the sentence if it is

satisfied, for reasons to be stated in writing, that it is

appropriate to do so in the circumstances, having regard to-

9

(a) the maxzmum penalty prescribed for the offence In

respect of which the sentence is imposed;

(b) the nature and gravity of the offence:

(c) the offender's culpability and degree of responsibility for

the offence:

(d) the offender's previous character;

(e) any injury, loss or damage resulting directly from the

commission of the offence:

(f) the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor

concerning the offender;

(g) the need to punish the offender to an extent, and in a

manner, which is just in all of the circumstances;

(h) the need to deter the offender or other persons from

committing offences of the same or of a similar character;

(i) the need to manifest the denunciation by the court of the

type of conduct in which the offender was engaged in;

0) the need to protect the victim or the community from the,

offender;

(k) the fact that the person accused of the offence pleaded

guilty to the offence and such person is sincerely and truly

repentant; or

(I) a combination of two or more of the above.

(2) A court shall not make an order suspending a sentence of

imprisonment if-

(a) a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment has

been prescribed by law for the offence in respect of which

the sentence is imposed; or

(b) the offender is serving, or is yet to serve, a term of

imprisonment that has not been suspended; or

(c) the offence was committed when the offender was subject

to a probation order or a conditional release or discharge;

or

(d) the term of imprisonment the aggregate terms Where the

offender is imposed, or of imprisonment where the offender

is convicted for more than one offence in the same

proceedings exceeds two years.

The learned High Court Judge has only considered from the point

of view of the Accused. The Accused got married after the incident and

having a child at the time of conviction. No doubt that it is a mitigatory

factor that has to be considered, but as I pointed out earlier the Accused

pre prepared to commit the offence, the way he committed the offence,

and the brutality of the offence, are aggravating factors. The society's cry

for justice in this type of offences committed against young children is

also one aspect that the Court has to keep in mind.

Had the Learned Trial Judge given her mind to these aggravating

factors that should have been taken into consideration as set out above in

imposing sentence we are inclined to take the view that the sentence

imposed may well have been different. The facts of this case warrants

that the Accused should be imposed a custodial sentence.

I set aside the sentence of the learned High Court Judge and impose

the following sentences.

1. Count 1, two years RI and Rs. 1000/= fine in default 6 months

simple imprisonment.

2. Count 2 three years RI and Rs. 1000/= fine in default 6 months

simple imprisonment.

In addition Rs. 25000/= compensation to be paid to the victim.

In default 6 months Simple Imprisonment

3. Count 3 one year imprisonment and Rs. 1000/= fine in default 6

months simple imprisonment.

I further order the jail terms to run concurrently.
