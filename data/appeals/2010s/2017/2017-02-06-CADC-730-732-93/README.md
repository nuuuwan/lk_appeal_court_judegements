CASE-NO- CA. 730/731/732-93(F)- JUDGMENT- 17.01.2017

P.R. Walgama, J

By this instant appeal the 20- 24th Defendant-

Appellants had assailed the judgment dated 04.11.1993,

In the case bearing No. 4643 /P in the District Court

of Kalutara.

The Plaintiff - Respondent instituted the above styled

action to partition the land described in the schedule

to the plaint and more fully depicted In the

preliminary plan bearing No.2586 marked as 'X'.

The land sought to be partitioned is known as

Paiyagalawatta alias Kandagahalandawatta, containing In

extent approximately 4 acares.

In sequel to the above impugned judgment the 20-

24th Defendants and the 3rd Defendant had lodged the

instant appeal, and it was brought to the notice of

Court that appeal bearing No. 731/ F was settled In

6

the Supreme Court,

732/F was dismissed

was out of time.

and the appeal bearing No.

by this Court as the appeal

Therefore this Court will only embark on the appeal

of the 20-24th Respondent - Appellants. But it is seen

that the 7TH Defendant who IS sailing with the

appellants moves for a exclusion of lot D from the

corpus.

At the trial in the court below the contentious issues

were whether the lot D depicted In the plan marked

'X' formed a part of the corpus and also in respect

of devolution of shares.

As depicted In preliminary plan marked 'X' the land

sought to be partitioned consists of lots A -G. At the

commencement of the trial the parties agreed to

exclude the lot marked 'G' from the corpus. But the

20-24 Defendants and along with them some other

defendants filed a common statement of claim seeking

an exclusion of lot 'D' from the land sought to be

partitioned.

It is the contention of the Counsel for the Appellants

that the said lot marked 'D' IS Henawatta alias

Kandagahalandawatta, which was possessed by one

Bastian alias Raphael. To buttress the above position

the Learned Counsel for the Appellants had stressed

the following;

7

That there IS a line of five trees to separate the

said lot 'D' from the corpus. But it IS contended by

the counsel for the Plaintiff- Respondent, that those

trees are there for the convenIence of the posseSSIOn.

That the document marked '3V1' , VIZ, Deed bearing

No. 7031 dated 06.06.1911, which IS a fiscal

conveyance, the Eestern . boundary of the

Kandagahawatta containing In extent A1-R1-P38 , IS the

land called Kandagahahenawatta possessed by Raphial

Gurunnanse, and it IS further said that the Eastern

boundary of the said land depicted In afore said

plan marked 3V1 IS consonant with Western boundary

of the lot 'D' which is the disputed land.

In addition, the Learned Counsel also had adverted

court to the fact that as per plan marked 'X' the

Northern boundary of lot 'D' IS Walakadayawatta

Paddy field, which IS compatible with the Northern

boundary described in the Deed bearing 30990 dated

12.04.1940 which IS marked as 9V4. On perusal of

the said deed it IS apparent that the land is known

as Henawatta alias Kandagahawatta and not

Kandagahalandawatta and moreover the Northern

boundary indicates as Walakadayawatta IS a land

containing In extent one acare. But it IS apparent

that the extent of lot marked 'D' in the plan marked

as X IS only R1-and P37.7. Therefore the said the

position taken by the learned counsel, of the fact

8

that the lot 'D' IS not a part of the corpus IS

untenable.

Further per contra, the counsel for the PI ain tiff-

Respondent

Appellants

has

had

urged

not

in confutation that

established their position

cogent evidence, . . VIZ- a-VIZ that no imposition of

the

by

the

another plan to establish that lot 'D' is a different

land. The only basis of which that the counsel for

the Appellants had planked his position IS the

Northern boundary of lot 'D' is Walakadayawatta Paddy

field which IS the Northern boundary depicted in the

deed marked as 3Vl and bears slightly different

name from the land claimed by the Appellants.

Therefore the said fact is not a sufficient ground to

prove that the disputed lot 'D' IS not a part of the

land sought to be partitioned.

Further it IS noted that the Learned District Judge

had made a reference to the fact that the land

claimed by Rapihal IS to the East of the corpus.

Therefore it was held that land possessed by Raphial

is to the east of this land and lot D is a part of

the land sought to be partitioned.

In the above exposition of the facts clearly confirm

that the disputed lot 'D' is a part of the corpus,

(refer to deeds marked 9v4- 9v7)

It IS viewed from the impugned judgment that the

Learned District Judge has directed that the list of

9

shares should be prepared by the Plaintiff according

to the judgment. Therefore this court IS not In a

position to decide the allocation of the shares to the

parties to this action.

In deciding the devolution of title the Learned District

Judge has answered the Issue no. 20 In the

negative, in that it was rejected that the original

owner of this land was Bastian Gurunanse alias

Raphial.

It is noted with care that the Learned District Judge

has glVen due consideration In arnvlng at the

devolution of title. Therefore this court need not

interfere with the findings of the trial judge.

Therefore In the above setting I concur with the

findings of the Court below.

Accordingly I dismiss the appeal.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
