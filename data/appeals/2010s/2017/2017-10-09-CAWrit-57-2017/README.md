It is observed that, in Kekirawa Magistrate's Court case bearing No. A.R.

808/2017, the Learned Magistrate has issued a restraining order to facilitate the

security arrangements of the Petitioner, as averred in paragraph 39 of the Petition.

It is rightly within the discretion of this Court to refuse to issue writ, if it is

perceived that the Petitioner has an adequate and appropriate remedy.

In the circumstances I hold that the Petitioner has an adequate alternative

remedy to address the relief prayed for.

Notice refused.

Petition is dismissed without costs.
