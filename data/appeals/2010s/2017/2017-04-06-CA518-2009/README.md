The petitioner has filed this application praying for a writ of

mandamus to direct the 1 st or 2nd respondents to give effect to the

documents marked as P4, P4A, P3, P11 and P12.

2

An insurance scheme titled Agrahara was introduced under the

patranage of the 2nd respondent in 1997 (P3) for all state officers

employed by the government who were holding pensionable posts. This

scheme offered three types of insurance covers medical, personal

accident and loan protection schemes. The issue in the instant case is

the loan protection scheme. The petitioner's deceased husband had

obtained a housing loan under this scheme in 1998 to the value of Rs.

3,31,8001= while he was employed at the Registrar General's

Department. The scheme was operated and managed by the 2nd

respondent at that time. The petitioner's husband has died in 2006 while

working at the Ministry of Industrial Development.

In 2006 the said Agrahara loan scheme was transferred to the 1st

respondent board that was to be incorporated and a new insurance

scheme was introduced in place of PA 5/9 (P3) namely P12/2006 Public

Administration Circular (P12) and the 1 st respondent board was

established by Act no. 28 of 2006 entitled National Insurance Trust Fund.

After the death of the petitioner's husband the petitioner had called

the 1st respondent by P7 to comply with the circular marked P3 and settle

the outstanding balance of the loan. The 1 st respondent has sough to rely

on a purported opinion expressed by an officer in the Attorney General's

3

Department by P13 who based his opinion on sec. XXIV of the

Establishment Code but this opinion has failed to consider the effect of

certain clauses in P12.

The petitioner's counsel has stated that the Ombudsman by his

letter marked as P11 recommended that the loan should be settled in

terms of the circular marked P3. The petitioner argued that the petitioner's

rights under circular P3 were lot varied, withdrawn, revoked or overridden

by the circular P12.

The petitioner further stated that the 3rd respondent requested the

1 st respondent to take steps to settle the balance loan payment and

release the title deeds to the heirs which the 1 st respondent failed to

comply with. By P7 the 2nd respondent has written to the pt respondent

stating that the 1 st respondent was responsible under the Agrahara

Insurance Scheme to make the balance payment. The argument of the

petitioner is that the 1 st and 2nd respondents were under a duty to abide

by the terms of circular P3 in relation to the insurance cover taken by the

petitioner's husband and that circular P12 could not take away the rights

given to the deceased by P3.

4

The argument of the respondents was that the obligations pleaded

by the petitioner are in the nature of a contract and not a statutory

obligation that is amenable to a writ of mandamus. Citing the judgments

in Weligama Multipurpose Corporative Society vs Chandradasa

Daluwatte 1984 1 SLR 195 and Perera vs Municipal Council of

Colombo (1947) 48 NLR 66 the respondents stated that a writ of

Mandamus should not be issued in the instant case since the liability

pointed out by the petitioner arises out of a contract. The respondents

also stated that the petitioner does not claim a statutory duty owed to her

by the 1st respondent. The judgments cited by the respondents are not

relevant to the instant case. The loan was obtained by a circular issued

for pensionable public servants, this does not form a contract between

the parties.

Section 11 of circular no. 12/2005 reads thus;

"o~ IN:)c:roO 6de~ Q)@a) ~ 6Jd2S ~ ~C) 6de~

~Q}~ l1!~ ~ ~m l1!~ ~C) ~ gJ~oo e. ~

~ 0da.fJJ ~ me> ~ ~ eJ ~

~~."

It is very clearly stated in this circular no. 1212005 in section 11 that

the loans obtained under the previous circular will also be incorporated in

the new scheme.

5

The petitioner's late husband had obtained the housing loan under

the insurance scheme in P3 with the expectation that the insurance

scheme will cover him when he obtained the loan under the previous

scheme. He had legitimate expectations that he will be covered by the

said scheme. The 1st Insurance scheme was converted into a new

scheme by P12. Section 11 of P12 clearly states that the new scheme

will incorporate the loans obtained by the previous scheme. By letter

marked P16 the secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration and

Home Affaires has stated that the said loan should be settled by the 1 st

respondent. The provisions of the Establishment code which are

misinterpreted by the officer of the Attorney General's Department is also

referred to in this letter. The 1 st respondent is legally bound and obliged

to settle the outstanding loan as premised and undertaken by the 1 st

respondent in terms of sec. 11 of circular no. 12 of 2005.

For the afore stated reasons I decide to grant the relief prayed for

in pray 11 of the petition. The petitioner's application for writ is allowed.

L.U. Jayasuriya J.

I agree.
