1

The Petitioner being a member of the Provincial Council of North

Central Province, in public interest, filed this action challenging the

calling for applications for recruitment of teachers for the North Central

Province. The Petitioners contention is that the method of recruitment is

not in conformity with the Service Minute of Sri Lanka Teachers'

Service. His argument is that the recruitment shall be on school basis

according to paragraph 7.2.3. of the service minute, but the NCPC has

adopted a division basis recruitment method. He moves for an interim

order to restrain to the Respondents from giving appointments until final

determination of this application.

2

The learned Counsel for the respondent submitted that the NCPC

has promulgated a Service Minute for the Teachers' Service of the North

Central Provincial Public Service. As per paragraph 7.2.3. the recruitment

is on the basis of Educational Zone. Among other things he further

submits that the Petitioner is guilty of laches.

The Service Minute for the Teachers' Service of the North Central

Provincial Public Service was promulgated with the sanction of the

Governor of the North Central Province on 28.11.2016. The public

service Commission of the NCPC is bound to act under the said service

minute. The Petitioner in this application is a councilor of the NCPC and

he is the 'Monitoring Member' in respect of education in the NCPC.

Therefore he is expected to know the activities of the NCPC in relation to

education. He cannot say that he is unaware of the service minute of

NCPC. The Petitioner in this application has not disclosed the said

service minute. Further he is not making any application to annul the said

service minute. Until the said service minute is in force, the public service

commission of the province is bound by that and cannot deviate from it.

The Petitioner is challenging the calling for applications for

recruitment. The advertisement was published in the 'Dinamina' news

paper on 23rd December 2016. The Petitioner waited until the

examination was conducted and the qualified candidates were called for

the interview to file this application. The application was filed on 28th

July 2017, after 7 months from calling for applications.

The Petitioner has come to Court on public interest. If the Court

restrains the respondents from making the appointments to the teachers'

service, the vacancies will remain unfilled and the children of the

province will undergo the difficulties in education. The Court cannot, in

3

the guise of protecting public interest, defeat the interest of one sector of

public (the school children) to protect another sector.

Under these circumstances we refuse to issue the interim order.

We issue notice on respondents.

President, Court of Appeal

Shiran Gooneratne J.

I agree.
