The Petitioner in this case alleges that she was interdictedby the Second

Respondent with immediate effect by Document marked P-ll and claims that the

purported act was unlawful, illegal, ultra vires, mala fide and in excess of the 2nd

Respondents powers and functions under the law.

The Petitioner had been the District Irrigation Engineer attached to Gampaha

since 1st April 2008. She submitted that the Director Irrigation of Western

Province on 22nd July around 7.00 pm informed her by Telephone that her

presences with her Technical Officers was required for a meeting on the following

day morning. This was confirmed to her by an e-mail dated 22.07.2014 sent at

6.18:49 pm (R-l).

The Petitioner was made to understand that the discussion would be relating to a

purported walk way which was to be allegedly built around the Kesbewa- Wewa

which is situated in the Colombo District outside the jurisdiction of the

Petitioner's Irrigation Office.

In her Petition at Paragraph 12 the Petitioner explains as to what happened on

23nd when she attended the meeting.

At the meeting she was issued with two documents p-s and P-SA namely a letter

and a plan giving details of the work to be attended to by the following day. Since

the Technical Officers who attended the meeting along with the Petitioner

informed her that they did not have the necessary expertise, this was brought to

the notice of the 3rd Respondent who informed the persons present to address

such concern in writing.

According to paragraph 13 of the Petition, the Petitioner makes the following

statement-

II On or a about 24th July 2014, the petitioner received a letter addressed to the

3rd Respondent from 04 Technical Officers attached to the Gampaha Irrigation

District Engineer's Office, which stated, inter alia, that

a) To - date, all engineering matters relating to the Kesbewa Wewa

Walkway has been handled by the Colombo District Irrigation

Engineer's Office and the Gampaha District Irrigation Engineer's

Office is unaware of the details, specification of the Kesbewa Wewa

whch are required for such purpose;

b) The Technical Officers attached to the Gampaha District Irrigation

Engineer's Office do not have expertise, nor the training to design

and provide an estimate for a walk way since designing a walk way

requires Engineers who specialized in Town and Country Planning;

c) It would be safe and productive if such design and construction is

conducted by Engineers who specialize in Town and Country

Planning since all matters relating to irrigation in the said Project

have already been completed by the Colombo District Irrigation

Engineer's Office;

d) Furthermore, since the Gampaha District Irrigation Engineer's Office

is currently involved with many projects on a Ministerial Level as

well as on a District Level, and considering that the Gampaha

Irrigation Engineers Office does not have the expertise, the

Technical Officers requested the 3rd Respondent to release the

officers attached to the Gampaha Irrigation Engineers Office form

the Kesbewa Wewa Walk way Project."

The Petitioner conclusively stated that this letter which was marked and pleaded

as part of the Petition as P6 was forwarded to the 3rd Respondent. There was no

reference to P6 or a copy there of having been given to the 3rd Respondent on

23rd July 2013.

According to paragraph 15 of the petition, on 28th July 2013 the petitioner

received a Letter from the 3rd Respondent requesting the Petitioner together with

the Technical Officers attached to Gampaha Irrigation Engineers Office to attend

another discussion regarding the same project. This Letter was produced P-7.

In response to the said letter the Petitioner claims in the Petition that she

received another letter from 9 technical Officers attached to her Office stating

inter alia that as intimated in their letter marked P6 they do not have the

)

\

f

technical skills, knowledge, training and expertise for such a project and

requesting that they be released from the said project. (P-8)

The Petitioner wrote to the 3rd Respondent attaching P-8 on 30th, informing that

none of the Technical Officers are coming forward to attend the meeting and

faxed the above to the 3rd respondent on the same day i.e. 30th July 2014. (P-9)

On 2nd August she received an e-mail with a letter dated 30th July 2014 from the

2nd Respondent Interdicting the petitioner with immediate effect. (P-ll)

When the above position was submitted to this Court at the support stage, this

Court was satisfied with the material presented before this Court and decided to

grant interim relief prayed for in sub paragraph (b) of the prayer to the effect.

tissue an appropriate interim order suspending the operation of the

decision contained in letter marked P-ll and P -15 and thereby permitting the

petitioner to continue in service as District Irrigation Engineer-Gampaha until the

final determination of this Application lIand granted interim relief for a initial

period of 10 days.

The above version of the Petitioner was challenged by the 2ndand 3rdRespondents

in their limited objections with regard to the question of granting interim relief.

Paragraph 7 (i-I) of the limited objections reads as follows.

i. Accordingly, the petitioner was requested on 22.07.2014 to come for a

meeting on 23.07.2014 as more fully described above. Similar requests

were made from the Engineers of Kaluthara and Colombo District Offices;

j. However as afore said, the petitioner did not attend the said meeting;

k. the petitioner came to the office of the 3rd Respondent at or about

11.30 am and met the 3rd Respondent subsequent to the said meeting and

handed over to the 3rd respondent, a letter bearing the date stamp

23.07.2014 signed by the Technical Officers who are under the Petitioner

and informed that they do not have the training or experience to prepare

! I I li II I

the said estimate. A true copy of the said letter dated 23.07.2014 is

annexed hereto marked R4;

I. Thereafter, the 3rd Respondent informed the Minister Irrigation of

the refusal of the Petitioner and the Technical Officers to prepare the

estimate. At the request of the Minister, a meeting was called on 28.07.2014 at which the Petitioner was present. At the said meeting, when

the Minister inquired from the Petitioner whether she is unable to perform

the duty entrusted to her, the Petitioner informed that she will perform the

duty and accordingly the Petitioner was requested to be present at the

office of the 3rd Respondent on 30.07.2014 to prepare the estimates

together with engineers and technical officers of the other District. 1/

As this Court has already pointed out, as submitted by the Petitioner, in

Paragraph 13 of the Petition, she claims that it was on 24th July the day following

the meeting on 23rd July that she received the letter med P-6 from the 04

Technical Officers who attended the meeting along with her. This letter carries a

seal dated 24 July 2014.

However the 2nd and 3rdRespondents impugn this position stating that same

letter (P6) was handed over to the 3rd Respondent on 23rd July and this version is

corroborated in that the letter carries a seal dated 23 July 2014 and the letter

which was thus handed over on 23rd July 2014 has been marked as R4 and

tendered to Court.

We are very much concerned as to how and when this letter was prepared and

handed over to the 3rd Respondent. From the seal on R-4 it is clear that it was

handed over to 3rd Respondent on 23rd , but what was submitted to us when the

petition was supported was a letter carrying a date stamp of 24th which

corroborates the version given in Paragraph 13 to the Petition. At no stage in the

course of supporting the application for interim relief, an attempt was made to

set out in detail nor do the pleadings available at the support stage bring out the

salient point that on an anterior date namely 23rd July 2014 that P6/R4 was

drafted with the assistance of a Management Assistant at the Head Office.

!I I ;, J f I( ! ! I

t I i 1 ! ! !

i ! I i t

It is only in the counter objectionsthat the Petitioner seeks to explain the disparity

appearing in the dates of the seals on the two documents namely P6 and R4. In

the absence of an affidavit from the unnamed Management Assistant, this Court

is not inclined to accept the explanation now tendered by the Petitioner in her

counter affidavit since the Petition is patently devoid of any reference to the

reluctance or otherwise of her office to carry out instructions which was given in

writing and the omission to refer to such reluctance in writing at the earliest

opportunity that the Petioner had namely the support stage for interim relief is a

culpable failure on the part of the Petioner. If P6 containing intransigence on the

part of her subordinate officers for whatever reason had been handed over to

the 3rd Respondent on the 23rd July 2014, this material fact which the Petitioner

claims is exculpatory of her should have been brought to the attention of Court as

an important averment in the Petition. It should not be proffered to this Court

rather belatedly in a counter-affidavit. This belatedness which goes counter to

paragraph 13 of her Petition would amount in our view to a serious

omission/suppression of a material fact.

Similarly this court finds another important contradiction between the version

given by the Petitioner and the documents submitted.

According to Paragraph 15 of the Petition, on 28th July 2014, the petitioner

received a letter requesting her to be present with the Technical Officers for

another meeting on 30th, which she did not attend due to two reasons, one was

the receipt of P-8, indicating that none of the Technical Officers were coming

forward to attend the meeting with her and the other was the fact that 30th being

a Wednesday she could not leave the office due to Several circularsin operation

preventing her leaving the office.

However according to paragraph 7-1 of the limited Objection, on 28th the

Petitioner attended a meeting with the provincial Minister and agreed to be

present for a meeting with the 3rd Respondent together with her Engineers and

Technical Officers.

Even though Petitioner contradicts this by simply saying that she received the said

letter on 28th, the fact that she attended a meeting with the Minister is clear from

"II

t It

the 1st Paragraph of P-7to the affect "This refers to the instructions received from

the Minister at the meeting on the above subject".

If the Petitioner had attended a meetingwith the Minister and agreed to be

present on 30th what is stated in Paragraph 15 of the Petition is contradictory to

the documents submitted to this court by the Petitioner herself. We find that the

Petitioner had suppressed and misrepresented some of the material facts at the

time the application was supported for interim relief before us. We are not

satisfied with the explanationthat the Petitioner is now offering though her

counter objections. This Court bears in mind the useful reminder of that

celebrated jurisprudence as propounded by PathiranaJ in the case of in Alphonso

Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi 77 NLR 131at 135 that a full and fair disclosure of all

the material facts has to be placed before Court when an application for a writ or

injunction is made and the process of Court is invoked. A party applying for a

prerogative writ is under a duty to the Court to disclose all material facts within

his knowledge, and this duty of disclosure is similar to the duty on a party

applying for an injunction. This useful guideline is equally applicable to stay orders

and since we find that the Petitioner has not kept to this duty, we are compelled

to vacate the interim relief that has been granted on 30th September 2014.

Under these circumstances we are not inclined to extend the interim orderas we

have originally issued on 30th September 2014 and we vacate the same. In any

event in judicial review this Court is sufficiently clothed with power to make

interim orders ex mere motto and exercising that power we direct that the

Petioner be paid half her monthly salary during the pendency of this application

until this application is fully disposed of and concluded. JA
