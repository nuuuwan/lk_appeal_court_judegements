A W A Salam, J (PICA) T

his application has been filed by the 18t respondent-

petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the "petitioner")

seeking a revision of the order of the learned and High

Court Judge dated 20.12.2013. The impugned order has

been delivered consequent upon an application made by

the Central Authority namely, the Secretary to the

Ministry of Justice under Section 9 of the Civil Aspects of

International Child Abduction Act No.10 of 2001. In the

said application the Secretary to the Ministry of Justice

cited the father and the mother of the children whose

return is sought to Australia where the children are

alleged to be from and had their habitual residence. The

petitioner to the instant revision application is the

mother of the children and the 18t respondent-

respondent (referred to in the rest of this judgment as

2

I

r !

1 I I

1 I

!

" 1 st respondent") is their father against whom an order

seeking the return of the children to their habitual

residence in Australia is sought. When the matter was

supported for notice the learned President's Counsel of

the 1st respondent raised several preliminary objections

as to the maintainability of the application.

namely;-

1. The petitioner has no locus standi to make this

application;

2. She is guilty of laches;

3. That by the Central Authority has not filed an

appeal and assuming that the petitioner has locus

to maintain the present application she is bound to

establish exceptional circumstances;

4. The affidavit filed by the petitioner if fatally

irregular in that there is no com pliance of the

imperative Provisions of the relevant law;

5. When the competent authority decides not to

challenge the impugned order, this Court will not

exercise the revisionary jurisdiction.

As regards laches, it has to be noted that the

impugned judgment has been delivered on 20 December

2013 and the instant revision application has been filed

on 18th February 2014, approximately after two months

of the order. The 1st respondent urges that the petitioner

has failed to give any explanation whatsoever as to the

delay and therefore the revision application should be

3

II

fIII

t

It

dismissed on that ground alone.

In this respect the petitioner has adverted us to the

judgment in Gunasekara v. Abdul Latiff [1995] 1 SLR

at 225, Ceylon Carriers Ltd v. Peiris [1981] 2 SLR at

119 and Sithambaram v. Palaniappa 5 N.L.R 353.

Taking into consideration that the petitioner is resident

in Australia, it is difficult to subscribe to the view voiced

on behalf of the 1 st respondent that the petitioner is

guilty of laches. The delay in filing the revision

application is only eight weeks. As has been contended

by the learned President's Counsel for the petitioner

communication, correspondence and co-ordination need

to take place as between the Counsel and client before

the filing of the application and particularly when the

petitioner is resident in Australia a period of two months

cannot be considered too long to pronounce an utterance

that the petitioner is guilty of laches.

As regards the affidavit attached to the application the

1st respondent maintains that the supporting affidavit of

the petitioner is defective in that the petitioner has

neither sworn nor affirmed to the correctness of the

contents in the affidavit. On the contrary the 1st

respondent states that the petitioner in making her

application to the Competent Authority has categorically

affirmed to the contents of the affidavit. The affidavit has

been attested in New South Wales and the details of the

driving licence of the petitioner are also given in the

4

affidavit.

As the affidavit has been attested outside Sri Lanka

probably, it may have been attested according to the law

applicable in that country. We were not provided with

any assistance on that matter. However, in terms of

section 9 of the oaths and affirmations ordinance, the

irregularities pointed out by the 2nd respondent are not of

serious nature that warrant the rejection of the affidavit.

In the circumstances, the objection raised against

entertaining the affidavit being too technical, merits no

serious consideration.

The question whether an appeal is available against the

impugned order was argued at length. The learned

Presidents Counsel for the 1 st respondent emphasised

that the procedure in regard to an application made

under Section 9 of Act No.10 of 2001 being summary,

there is always an appeal available under the Provisions

of the Civil Procedure Code. The petitioner's response to

this is that a right of appeal has to be a specific creation

of a Statute and as the Civil Aspects of International

Child Abduction Act No.10 of 2001 has not conferred any

such right, no party enjoys a right of appeal. It is well

established principle of law that no appeal is available.

Even though the procedure for the institution of

proceedings under section 9 has been referred to as

summary. The mere reference to the mode of institution

of proceedings under section 9 as summary, does not

5

I

I

mean that the right of appeal is extended against an

order made under section 9 of the Civil Aspects of

International Child Abduction Act. Since there is no right

of appeal specifically conferred by any Statute against an

order under section 9 it cannot be implied that the

reference to summary procedure made in the said Act as

regards the mode of institution of proceedings can be

interpreted to mean that an order under section 9 is

appealable. In the circumstances, the objection raised in

that respect, in my opinion is not helpful to the 1 st

respondent.

The learned President's Counsel of the 1 st respondent

heavily relied on his objection pertaining to the locus of

the petitioner to maintain the present application. He

argued that the Act in question has been enacted in view

of the fact that Sri Lanka is a signatory to the Hague

convention. The preamble to the Act inter alia focuses

on the necessity to make provisions for the return of the

children wrongfully removed from Sri Lanka or their

country and retained in any specified country including

Sri Lanka. Therefore the learned President's Counsel of

the 2nd respondent submits that it is in an affair between

the two authorities, namely the Sri Lankan authority and

the authority abroad. Countering this argument the

learned President's Counsel for the petitioner stated that

his client being the mother of the two children has every

right to maintain the revision application as an aggrieved

6

party by the decision of the High Court. The 2nd

respondent cannot deny that the law against him has

been set in motion on a complaint made to the relevant

authority in Australia by the petitioner. Rightly or

wrongly the petitioner has been made a party to the

proceedings although she may not have filed in the

pleadings. The second respondent has not objected in the

High Court to the petitioner being made party to the

proceedings. Further, the act in question does not speak

of the necessary parties to an application under Section

9.

The preamble to the act sheds enough light as to the

actual necessity for enacting such a piece of Legislation.

Basically it is an act to give effect to the Hague

convention against deprivation of the right of custody of

children by the removal of the children from one country

to another by any person. The Act contemplates on the

return of children wrongfully removed from Sri Lanka or

their country habitual residence and retained In any

specified country or Sri Lanka and to seek redress

through the central authority invoking the special

jurisdiction conferred on the High Court of Western

prOVInce.

Section 9 of the relevant Act merely authorises the

Central Authority to make an application to the High

Court established under Article 154 P of the Constitution

7

I

r I t !

for the Western Province to seek an order for the return

of such child to the specified country in which the child

has his or her habitual residence. Strictly speaking as

no relief is sought against the petitioner it is unnecessary

to have him cited as a party in the petition made to the

High Court. However, once she is made a party and not

objected to she remains a party in the case unless her

name is struck off under section 18 of the CPC on the

basis that she has been improperly made a party. In my

opinion therefore in order made under section 9 is not

appealable.

For the foregoing reasons, I am of the opinion that the

preliminary objections raised on behalf of the 2nd

respondent are overruled.
