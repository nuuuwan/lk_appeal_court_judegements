revision application filed by the accused-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the "appellant"). The description given in the

caption as the accused-appellant is misleading and should be

corrected as re spondent::. appellant.

The background to the appeal is as follows; The complainant-

respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

"complainant") filed an application in the relevant Magistrate's

Court seeking the ejectment of the appellant from the land and

premises identified by him as a land belonging to the State.

The application has been made in terms of the State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act. The appellant was issued with

notice to appear in the Magistrate's Court on a particular day

and show cause as to why an order of ejectment should not be

made as prayed for in the application of the complainant.

On the day fixed for the appearance of the complainant she

was not present in court and according to the order of the

learned and Magistrate her father had appeared but shown rio

cause against a possible order being made for the ejectment of

the appellant. The proceedings in the Magistrate's Court do

not indicate that a postponement was sought on that day on

behalf of the appellant. The learned Magistrate, thereupon

entered an order of ejectment, on the footing that no cause had

been shdwn as required by the State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act.

Against the said order of the learned Magistrate the appellant

filed a revision application that too was dismissed on the basis

that she had failed to make out a case for revision. This appeal

has been preferred against the s~d judgment.

Page I 2

The learned counsel for the appellant contended that the

procedure adopted by the learned Magistrate before he issued

the order of ejectment is fatally irregular and that he has failed

to charge the appellant under Section 183 (2) (b) of the Code Page I 3

of Criminal Procedure.

Section 183 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with

an admission of offence by the accused. On the other hand

Subsection 2 (b) provides a situation where the accused does

not make a statement or makes a statement which does not

amount to an unqualified admission of guilt. In such a

circumstance the Magistrate is obliged to ask the accused if

he is ready for trial and if he replies that he is not ready for

trial by reason of the absence of witnesses or otherwise the

Magistrate shall, subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of

section 263, either postpone the trial to a day to be then fIxed

or proceed forthwith to try the case in manner hereinafter

provided.

I

The grievance of the appellant seems to be that she was not

asked whether she is guilty of the offence and had she stated

that she was not guilty the learned Magistrate would have had

to postpone the trial. The learned counsel for the appellant

appears to have misconstrued that Section 183 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure is applicable to proceedings initiated

under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act as well.

According to the records maintained by the learned Magistrate

no application has been made for a postponement on the day

the appellant was required to appear in the Magistrate's Court.

Had an application been made for a postponement to show

cause the learned Magistrate may have accommoda,ted the

appellant. As no such application had been made the learned

Magistrate had proceeded on the basis that the appellant is

unable to produce a permit or written authority entitling her

to remain on the land.' -

As a matter of law, if the appellant was absent on the day ftxed

for her 'to show cause against an order of ejectment being

made, she should have purged the default in the original court.

As she has failed to do that it is not open to the appellant to

take up the question of nonappearance due to whatever

reasons that may be, in the High Court or before this court.

In the circumstances, the Magistrate was correct in taking up

the matter and disposing of the application whatever may be

the unfortunate condition that would have prevented

appellant from attending Court. In this type of applications it

is necessary to be borne in mind that the particular Legislation

under which the eviction of the appellant is sought being a

draconian law which requires strict compliance of the

Provisions of law to continue In possession of the land ill

question, the appellant was under a legal obligation to

establish that she was in possession or occupation of the land

in question upon a valid permit or other written authority of

the State granted in accordance with any written law and that

such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or

otherwise rendered invalid.

The position of the appellant as regards her right to occupy the

premises in question is quite unusual. She takes up the

position that had she been granted a postponement, she would

have produced the letter dated 8 August 2000 : signed by

Navalage Benette Cooray, Member of Parliament ~olombo

Page 14

District and Deputy Minister for Transport and Highways,

which document spells out that the appellant was entitled to

a portion of the said land in question. She further states that

the said letter spells out the positive legitimate expectation of Page I 5

her to be in possession and occupation of the land in question

and the learned Magistrate failed to give her an opportunity to

produce this letter.

It is my considered view that even if this letter was produced

yet she would not have been able to discharge the burden of

establishing that she had a valid permit or other written

authority of the State granted in accordance with any written

law and that such permit or authority is in force and not

revoked or otherwise rendered invalid.

In the circumstances, I am not inclined to grant relief to the

appellant on the petition of appeal. Appeal dismissed without

costs.
