A W A Salam, J

This appeal arises from the judgment of the learned

district judge of Panadura dated 15 October 1998 in a rei

vindicatio action. The plaintiff-appellant (referred to in the

rest of this judgment as the "plaintiff') filed action against

the defendant-respondents (referred to in the same

manner as the "defendants") for a declaration of title to the

corpus from the western side of the land called

Delgahawatta which he claims is in extent of 28.5 perches.

The learned district judge dismissed the plaintiffs action

for his failure to establish the title and the identity of the

corpus.

--------t( 5 )1------

The title of the plaintiff to the subject matter is connected

with PI to P11. The land in respect of which the plaintiff

claims title consists of an undivided extent of 22 perches

amalgamated with another portion of a land in extent of

29 1/4 perches. The learned President's Counsel has

contended that the identity of the corpus and its exact

location are so inexact which warrants the conclusion that

the plaintiff is not entitled, as has been' held by the

learned district judge to a declaration of title to the said

land of 28.5 perches.

Since the land which is in extent of 22 perches has been

identified separately, it is pertinent to refer to the plan

which depicts the said land of 22 perches. P 13 which is a

plan prepared in 1892 depicts the said land of 22 perches.

Another plan produced at the trial was Plan No 436 A

dated 18 May 1922. This was produced by the defendants.

In this plan the western side is marked as B and the

eastern side as A. According to this plan, lot A is in extent

of 1 Rood and 23 1/3 perches. The extent of lot B is 31

2/3 perches and the total extent of both the lots A and B

aggregates to 95 perches. However, the title passes on PI,

P2 and P3 is only in respect of 22 perches. It is to be

noted that the 2nd land mentioned in P3 (6875) deals with

an undivided 1/ 12 of a land called Delgahawatta.

The vendee In P3 Balapuwaduge Danial Mendis by P4 -------if 6 )t------

\ I I J I

transferred a portion from and out of the allotment of land

in extent of 22 perches by reference to the length and

breadth as stated in the schedule to the deed. Thereafter,

the vendee in P4 has transferred 22 perches and 4/ 14

shares of a separate portion of Delgahawatta in extent of

29 41/100 perches. The emphasis made by the learned

President's Counsel as to the irreconcilableness of the

different extents given in the deed, needs to be given

serious consideration.

It is deep-rooted principle of law, that in a rei vindicatio

action every ingredient necessary has to be proved by the

plaintiff. The two main ingredients necessary to be

established for a successful prosecution of the suit are the

identity of the corpus and the devolution of title. The

weakness of the defence, whatever magnitude it may be, is

of no use to the plaintiff to claim absolution from his

responsibility. Taking into consideration the contradiction

with regard to the extent of the corpus and the uncertainty

of its location, it is hardly possible to conclude that the

learned district judge has erred in dismissing the action.

As regards the chain of title to the particular portion of

land, the plaintiff has failed to establish the devolution of

rights in question from the original owner to the present

owner with special regard being had to the extent of the

corpus. As has been submitted by the learned President's ------t( 7 )t-----

Counsel, there is no identifiable existence of a land in the

Western 1/ 3rd portion of Delgahawatta to which the

plaintiff could be declared entitled to in a rei vindicatio

action.

In the circumstances, it is my VIew that the learned

district judge cannot be faulted for dismissing the

plaintiffs action. Hence, the impugned' judgment IS

affirmed and the appeal dismissed subject to costs.
