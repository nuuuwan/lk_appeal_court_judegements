P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The Complainant - Respondent,.. Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Respondent) had instituted this case against the

Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Appellant) in the Primary Court of Batticaloa under section 66 (1) (b) of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to

as the Act) as a private information. The Respondent had sought an order , --declaring that he be entitled to have the possession of the impugned

premises.

4

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into this complaint,

pronounced his order dated 2003-12-09, holding thatthe Respondent is

entitled to have the possession of the shop, which is the subject matter of

the dispute in this case.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Primary Court Judge, the

Appellant 'had' filed an application for revision in the Provincial High Court

. ., of Eastern Province holden in Batticaloa seeking a revision of the order

made by'ttie Jearned Primary Court Judge. .

The Provincial Hi9b Court after. hearing parties, dismissed 'the ~id revisiOl1 ..

application and affirmed the order made by the learned Primary Court

Judge on the basis that existence of a breach of peace had been

established before the learned Primary Court Judge.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has appealed to this Court.

A peculiar feature in this case which came to light before this Court in the

course of the argument is that the Respondent has filed the said

information about a breach of peace in the Primary Court under section 66 ..

(1) (b) of the Act against a .public entity which is the Municipal Council of

Batticola.

5

Learned counsel for the Appellant invited this Court to make a

determination as to whether such an action is possible.

Section 66(1) (b) states that it is open for any party to a dispute affecting

land, a breach of peace is threatened or likely, to file an information by an

affidavit in the Primary Court.

It is now settled law that a party invoking the jurisdiction vested in Pril1)ary

Court under section 66 (l)(b) of the Act, shall first satisfy the Primary

-' - .... ---Court that a breach of peace is threatened or likely owing to the dispute.he

complains about.

It would be helpful, at the outset, to refer to the case of Kanagasabai V

Mylvaganam.1 It is a case under section 62 of the Administration of justice

law, which had conferred special jurisdiction on the Magistrate to make

orders to prevent a dispute affecting lands causing a breach of peace. It

has been held in that case that the said section requires the Magistrate to

be first"satisfied before initiating the proceedings, that a dispute affecting

lands exists and that such a dispute is likely to caus~ a brea(;;h of peace.

In this regard the following passage from a judgment of this Court in the

case of Punchi Nona V Padumasena and others2 would also be relevant. It

is as follows;

" ... The jurisdiction conferred on a primary Court under section 66 is a

special jurisdiction. It is a quasi - criminal jurisdiction. The primary object

of the jurisdiction so conferred is the prevention. of a breach of the peace

.' arising in respect of a dispute affecting land. The Court in exercising this

jurisdiction is not involved in an investigation, into titl~ or the right to . ~ -.. " -~ .

'. 'possession which is the function of a civil Court. He is required to' take

action of a preventive and provisional nature pending final adjudication of

rights in a civil Court. It was therefore. incumbent upon the Primary Court

judge to have initially satisfied himself as to whether there was a threat or

likelihood of a breach of peace and whether he was justified in assuming

such a special jurisdiction under the circumstances. The failure of the judge

to satisfy himself initially in regard to the threat or likelihood of the breach

of peace deprived him of the jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry and

this vitiates the subsequent proceedings. '" "

This Court at this juncture must turn to the facts of this case in order to

ascertain the correctness of the decision by the learned Primary Court

Judge to pass this threshold, and assume jurisdiction to inquire into this

dispute.

The following facts are uncontroverted;

i. The dispute is with regard to a shop.

ii. This shop is a property of the Municipal Council.

iii. The Municipal Council has 'given it on lease to the Respondent.

iv. The Respondent has failed to pay the rent.

v. The Appellant terminated the lease agreement on account of that.

vi. The Respondent filed an appeal before the Provincial High Court

praying for writs of certiorari to quash the said termination of the

agreement.

vii. The Provincial High Court refused to grant the writs prayed for by the

respondent and dismissed the case.

viii. It is thereafter that the Respondent had filed an information under

section 66 (1) (b) of the Act before the Primary Court naming the

Appellants as Respondents.

8

ix. It is under section 66 of the Municipal Council Ordinance that

Appellants had exercised their statutory power to recover this shop.

x. The Appellant had to abandon the exercise of their statutory power

because of the order of the learned Primary Court Judge.

The question to be decided by this Court in the instant case is whether a

dispossession of an unlawful occupier of state property through an action

. .. ,,",.- '-. . by state institution in the exercise of its statutory power could amount to a

breach ofpeace within the mepning of section 66 of the Act.

It is a fact that in this country the legislature by numerous Acts has

authorized various public institution to recover the state property in

expeditious manner without recoursing to the regular procedure. Acts such

as State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, Government Quarters

(Recovery of Possession) Act and Municipals Councils Ordinance,

Thoroughfares Ordinance as amended could be cited as common

examples.

.:.; . The Respondent admittedly had challenged the decision of the Appellant to

recover the possession of the shop owned by it exercising its statutory

powers. This was initially by way of writ application filed in the Provincial

.; .

9

High Court. The Provincial High Court after consideration of that application

had refused to grant the relief. The said refusal was on the basis that the

Appellants are entitled to exercise their statutory power to recover the

possession of this particular shop.

It is clear that the Appellants were exercising their statutory powers vested

inthe~ . under section 266 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance. The.

Appellants had given the Respondent a statutory notice of ejectment.

. Therefore the Appellants are entitled by virtue. of law namely under section -~..

366 of the Municipal Councils Ordi89Ilce to eject the Respondent.

When one examines part VIII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44

of 1979 it can be observed that the said part commences with the heading

'INQUIRIES INTO DISPUTES AFFEcrING LAND WHERE A BREACH OF THE

PEACE IS THREATENED OR LIKELY'. Section 66 (1) of the said act starts as

follows, "whenever owing to a dispute affecting land a breach of the peace

is threatened or likely ... "

It is 'the view of this Court that exercise of statutory power by a statutory

authority to evict a person fror:n a state land or a building cannot amount

..

10

to a dispute affecting land where a breach of peace is threatened or likely,

within the meaning of section 66 (1) of the Act.

The simple reason is that it is a mere exercise of statutory power. Learned

Primary Court Judge had failed to appreCiate this position. It is the view of

this Court that the learned Primary Court Judge had fell into a grave error

when he had decided that a breach of peace in terms of section 66 (1) (b)

of the' Act: 'exiSts in this instan~e. The learned Primary Court Judge could '

not nave ass~med jarisdictie'fl under section 66 of the Act to inquire into

the instant case because the requirement'that there is a breach of peace or

a likelihood of such breach has not been established by the Respondents.

We have perused the judgement of the learned Provincial High Court Judge

who also had failed to appreCiate this position.

It is the view of this Court that the Respondent had deliberately filed this

information before the Primary Court to prevent the Appellant from

exerCising its sta~utory power .. It is a matter for grave concern of this

Court. The Respondent through the abuse of Court process, had managed

to enjoy the possessiol1 of this pubUc building without paying what is due

to the said pubUc institution for a long period of time.

11

In these circumstances, this Court decides to set aside the order dated

2003-12-09 pronounced by the Primary Court as well as the order dated

2005-09-23 pronounced by the Provincial High Court. This Court directs

that the proceedings relating to this case before the Primary Court must

stand terminated and the application filed before it by the Respondent

must stand refused and dismissed.

The Respondent is directed to pay a cost of Rs. 250,000/ - to the 1st

Appellant.
