Decided on: 2018.10.02.

E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, J.

The Petitioners mentioned above in the caption have filed the writ applications

numbered 241/16, 242/16, 243/16, 244/16, 245/16, 246/16, 247/16 and 248/16

respectively seeking inter-alia the following reliefs;

a) To issue notices on the Respondents.

/

4

b) To issue orders in the nature of writ of certiorari quashing the respective

decisions of the Respondents relevant to each application (as evidenced by

continuing non-reply to letters marked as P7 in each application)

i. To not reinstate the Petitioners

ii. To not give the Petitioners their due ranks and services.

iii. To not allow the Petitioners their just and due benefits.

c) To issue orders in the nature of writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents

to take steps so that;

i. The Petitioners be reinstated duly and/or properly with proper rank and

seniority.

ii. The benefits applicable to the proper rank and seniority of the

Petitioners be given to the petitioners forthwith; and

iii. Due and proper back wages be paid to the petitioners.

d) For costs.

The background circumstances for these applications can be described as follows;

1. All the Petitioners were officers of the Volunteer Force of the Army.

2. An incident occurred in 1997, resulting in the death of a soldier.

3. Subsequently a court of inquiry was held with regard to the aforesaid

incident.

4. After that the Army Commander made his recommendation to send the

Petitioners on compulsory leave without pay pending the Magistra'te's Court

Case. -- vide document marked P2 with each application. However, this

, \ document does not state that they have to be reinstated if they are acquitted

but to withdraw the commission if they are found guilty.

5

5. Some were discharged after the Non-Summary inquiry by the Magistrate's

court and some were committed to the High Court. --(vide document marked

P3 with each application.)

6. However, Five of the Petitioners were indicted in the High Court and later

they were acquitted.

Some of the petitioners have previously filed writ applications in relation to the

same incident. The details of such applications are given below.

Petitioner in C.A.241/16 C. A. Writ 797/2003 (vide Withdrawn with liberty R1A) to file a fresh action.

C.A. writ 1329/2003 (vide Withdrawn in view of the P4 and R1B) High court case that was pending against him. Petitioner in C.A. 246/16 C. A. Writ 798/2003 (vide Application withdrawn R1C) with liberty to file a fresh action.

C.A. writ 1330/2003 (vide Application dismissed. R1D)

Petitioner in C.A. 247/16 C. A. Writ 799/2003 (vide Withdrawn with liberty R1 E) to file a fresh action.

C. A. Writ 1331/2003 Application dismissed. (vide R1F) \

6

As per the document marked as P3 in each case, following petitioners namely J.C

I Dissanayake, (Petitioner 246/2016) S.M.U.1. Sahabandu (Petitioner in 241/2016),

K.A.L. Ariyawasantha (Petitioner in 247/2016) were discharged as aforesaid on

24.04.2002 by the Magistrate's court. However, as per P5, the following persons

were indicted in the High Court.

1. Koswaththage Nirosh Sashen Perera (Petitioner in 242/2016

2. S.M.U.I Sahabandu (Petitioner in 241/2016)

3. W.A.T.L. Gunarathne (Petitioner in 245/2016)

4. K.M.D. Bandara (Petitioner in 244/2016)

5. D.CR. Nimalasena de Silva (Petitioner in 243/2016)

They were acquitted of the charges framed against them on 18.07.2012.

The Petitioner in 248/2016, M.A.D Wijesinghe appears to have been discharged

after the Magistrate's court case as he was not indicted.

As mentioned before, the Petitioner in 246/2016 was discharged on 24.04~2002

and thereafter he had filed the writ application No. 1330/2003. The said application

was dismissed on 16.06.2005 (vide R1D). He was not indicted in the High court

and therefore, the decision of the High court cannot create a new situation for him

to file a fresh writ application. He could have taken the same steps that now he

refers to in this application with regard to P7 before filing the previous writ

application and pleaded the grounds urged in this application even in the said

action. A person should not be allowed to file actions in piecemeal causing

multiplicity of actions. Same logic shall apply to the petitioner in CA. Writ

, application 247/2016 as he too had filed the CA. Writ application 1331/2003 which

was dismissed under a similar situation (vide R1F).

7

This Court also observes that even the Petitioner in C.A. Writ 241/2016 had

previously filed two writ applications, namely C.A. Writ 797/2003 and C.A. Writ

1329/2003. Both were withdrawn by the said petitioner, but he has not reserved

his right to file a fresh application when he withdrew the 2nd application C.A. Writ

1329/2003, though he withdrew it in view of the pending High Court case. This

court shall not encourage the filing of a fresh application when an applicant

withdraws one filed previously without reserving the right to file a fresh

application.

However, all the Petitioners try to argue as there was no response to the letters

marked P7 in each application, it is tantamount to a decision;

a. To not reinstate Petitioners

b. To not give the petitioners their due ranks and service.

c. To not allow the petitioners their just and due benefits.

Even though the Petitioners attempted to convince this court that the indecision

of the Respondents is equal to a constructive decision as aforesaid, as per the

communications marked as R7A, R7B and R7C and their attachments marked as

P10, P12, and P12 respectively in C. A. Writ 1331/03, 1330/03 and 1329/03

tendered with the written submissions of the Respondents, it is clear that as far

back as in 2002, the Petitioners in C. A. Writ 241/20016, C. A. Writ 246/16 and C. A.

Writ 247/2016 were communicated of the decisions that their applications for

, reinstatement were rejected. On the other hand, the Respondents point out that

P7 in each application is an unsigned document and no postal article receipt was

8

tendered to show that it was delivered to the Respondents. No one can expect a

reply for an unsigned document as it is devoid of responsibility. Therefore, this

court cannot give heed to the arguments based on non-response to P7.

However, if there was no duty cast upon the respondents to reinstate the

Petitioners, there was no necessity or duty to reply to aforesaid letters marked as

P7 in each application.

However, if granted, the outcome of reliefs prayed by the Petitioners will be the

reinstatement of the Petitioners with proper rank and seniority along with the back

wages and other benefits. The issue that this court has to look into is whether the

Respondents have a duty to take such decision to reinstate the Petitioners and, if

so, whether they are evading such duty cast upon them to reinstate the petitioners.

If a duty is not entrusted to a Respondent, there is nothing to be enforced by the

orders of this court. In this regard, I would like to quote from Administrative Law -

Eleventh Edition by H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth.

"The prerogative remedy of a mandatory order has long provided the normal

means of enforcing the performance of public duties by public authorities of all

kinds............................ The commonest employment of a mandatory order is as a

weapon in the hands of the ordinary citizen, when public authority fails to do its

duty by him. The quashing order and prohibiting order deal with wrongful action,

a mandatory order deals with wrongful inaction." (Page 520)

"Obligatory duties must be distinguished from discretionary polltfers. With the

later mandatory order has nothing to do" (page 524)

It is common ground that the petitioners were officers of the Volunteer Force of Sri

Lanka Army.

The Section 18 of the Army Act provides that it is only the Regular Force that shall

at all times be liable to be employed on active service. As per the Section 19 of the

said Act the President of the country may call out on active service, for the purposes

mentioned therein, whole or any part of the Volunteer Force by proclamation or

by an order. This shows that the Volunteer Force officers cannot, as of right,

demand or request them to be employed in active service. There is no doubt that

the officers in Volunteer Force are called out on active service when and where it

is necessary. The Petitioners do not plead that the proclamation or the order that

they were called out on active service is still in force and not have been terminated

by the President. As per section 19 (4) of the said act, if such proclamation or order

is terminated, the officers or soldiers belonging to the part of the Army, which was

called out on active service shall not be deemed to be on active service.

Furthermore, the regulations No. 68 published in the Extra Ordinary Gazette No.

476/26 dated 20.10.1987 state as follows;

(/ Where the Regular Reserve, the Volunteer Force, the Volunteer Reserve

or any part thereof, has been called out on active service under Section 19

of the Army Act, the Commander of the Army or any other officer authorized

by him in writing in that behalf may, by order published in the same manner ,

as the Commander of the Army may deem fit, release from active service for

such period as may be specified in that order any officer, any soldier, who

had been called out on and is still on active service. Upon being so released

10

such officer or soldier may return to his civilian occupation during the period

such release.

2. An officer or soldier who has been released under paragraph (1) of this

regulation, shall not during the period of release so specified be entitled to

any payor allowance, he may be entitled to under any regulation made

under the Army Act and for the time being in force, save and except as

provided for in regulation 72 to 79"

The aforesaid provisions indicate that the officers and soldiers in Volunteer Force

are called out on active service only when there is a necessity to engage them in

service and they can be released from service when their service is not necessary.

In such circumstances the Petitioner cannot have any legitimate expectation with

regard to the reinstatement. This court cannot by mandates in the nature of writ

of Mandamus force the respondents to reinstate the petitioners. I do not see that

there is a duty upon the Respondents to engage the Petitioners in service. The

Respondents in their written Submissions refer to these eight Petitioners as officers

of the Volunteer Force released from active service without pay. The following

documents demonstrate that they were released from the active service.

1. The document marked 'R3", dated 15.02.2003 contained in the copy of the

case record in writ application 1331/2003 -this letter instructs the

commanding officer of the Volunteer Force that it is he who should decide

whether the Petitioners to be called out to active servic;::e if there is a

necessity.

11

2. The document dated 10.09.1998, marked "P3", found in the aforesaid case

record. - This letter states that the Petitioner in writ application 247/2016,

K.l Ariya Wasantha, has been released from active service.

3. The document marked "P4", dated 14.09.1998 found in the copy of the case

record in writ application 1329/2003.- This letter states that the Petitioner in

writ application 241/2016, S.M.U.I. Sahabandu has been released from active Service.

4. The document marked P6 l, dated 13.05.2002 _ By this aforesaid Petitioner

S.M.U.I. Sahabandu request a superior officer to take steps to recruit him for active service.

5. The documents marked "P6 (aj" and "P6 (b)" written by the Petitioner in

247/2016 - By these letters the aforesaid petitioner, K.l. Ariyawasantha

requests the superior officers to put him back to active service.

6. The document marked "P6h" and "P6J". --- By these letters, the Petitioner in

246/2016, J.e. Dissanayaka, requests superior officers to put him back to active service.

7. The document marked "P2" found in the copy of the case record in writ

application 1330/2003.-This letter states that the petitioner in writ

application 246/2016 has been released from the active s,ervice.

,

8. The letter, marked P5, dated 03.01.2002 found in the copy of the case record

in writ application 1330/2003 -By this letter one of the petitioners urge the

Prime Minister to engage all the petitioners in active service.

.

12

the communications mentioned above indicate that the petitioners were not

only sent on compulsory leave without pay but were released from the active

service. If one in the Volunteer Force is released from active service it naturally

encompasses sending him on compulsory leave till he being called out to do active

service again. None of these applications challenge the decision of releasing the

petitioners from active service. As explained before calling out the petitioners back

to active service is within the discretion of the relevant authorities when a necessity

to do so arises. There is no obligatory duty entrusted to the respondents to call the

petitioners back to active service.

Hence, I decline' to issue notices on the Respondents and dismiss the applications.
