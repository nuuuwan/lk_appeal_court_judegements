JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

At the commencement of the argument learned counsel for the Accused -

Petitioner - Petitioner (who will hereinafter be called and referred to as the

Petitioner) objected to the learned Deputy Solicitor General making

submissions before this Court. The said objection was on the basis that the

Respondent - Respondent - Respondents (who will hereinafter be called

and referred to as the Respondents) had failed to submit an affidavit along

with the statement of objections. 1 It is on that basis that the learned

counsel for the Petitioner attempted t,o argue that it is a breach of Court of

Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

1 As required by Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990,

4

It was the submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that the

compliance of the rules is mandatory and that this Court must strictly

adhere to and enforce the said compliance.

It was in this backdrop that the learned Deputy Solicitor General also took

up a preliminary objection to the maintainability of this application at the

very inception of the argument. It is the submission of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General that there is no material for this Court to consider as the

Petitioner has failed to submit a certified copy of the impugned

proceedings. It is the position of the learned Deputy Solicitor General that

the Petitioner has defaulted compliance with rule 3 (1) (a).2

We have perused the documents filed by the Petitioner in this Court. It is a

fact that the original docket of this court does not contain any certified

copy of the impugned proceedings.

Learned counsel for the Pet,itioner however sought to argue that the \tru~

copy' he has filed, would be sufficient to comply with the above rule.

This Court has to observe that it is the Petitioner who has first insisted

before this Court that it should strictly enforce the compliance with the

Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990. Thus, it is the view of

this Court that the Petitioner (who has so insisted as mentioned above) is

under a duty by himself to make sure that he complies with the said rules

before pointing his finger at the opposite party for such noncompliance.

Unfortunately, it is a fact that the Petitioner has failed to ensure such

compliance.

Rule 3 (1) (a) and (b)3 is as follows:

" ... Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the

powers vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the

Constitution shall be by way of petition, together with an affidavit in

support of the averments therein, and shall be accompanied by the

originals of documents material to such application (or duly certified copies

thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender any

such document, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the

leave of the Court to furnish such documents later. Where a petitioner fails

to comply with the provisions of this rule the Court may, ex mere mortu or

at the instance of any party, dismiss such application.

3 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

6

(b) Every application by way of revision or restitutio in intergrum under

Article 138 of the constitution shall be made in like manner together with

copies of the relevant proceedings (including pleadings and documents

produced), in the Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution to

which such application relates ............. "

This Court in the case of the Attorney General vs Ranjith Weerawickrama

Charles4 considered the same question that arose in that case. Having

considered the relevant aspects pertaining to this issue, this Court

underlined the importance of tendering to Court, authentic copies of

impugned documents, which must bear an authoritative and responsible

signature. This is not only just to certify such copies but also to take the

responsibility for the authenticity of such documents.

In that case this Court held that a photocopy of proceedings certified by an

Attorney-At-Law as a 'true copy' cannot be considered as a certified copy

within the meaning of rule 03 (1) (a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

procedure) Rules 1990.

Further, it must be stated here that a photocopy of a certified copy of

proceedings would not be a certified copy in as much as a photocopy of

the original would not be an original.

4 CA (PHC) APN 74/2016 decided on 2017-10-09

For the foregoing reasons, this Court has to conclude that, there is no

material before this Court to consider the application filed by the Petitioner.

Rule 3 (13)5 has placed a duty upon the petitioner to take necessary steps

to prosecute his application with due diligence. Rule 3 (1) (a)6 further

provides that where a petitioner fails to comply with the provisions of this

rule the Court may, ex mere mortu or at the instance of any party, dismiss

such application.

The petitioner has not stated in his petition any reason as to why he failed

to tender certified copies of relevant documents material to his application.

It is noteworthy that Rule 3 (1) (aY makes provisions for any party who

would have a genuine reason to state such inability and seek the leave of

Court to furnish such documents later. The wish of the Petitioner has never

been that. Perusal of the averments in the petition shows clearly that he

has never been interested in filing certified copies to comply with the rules.

5 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

6 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

7 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

8

This Court therefore takes the view that the Petitioner is not entitled to

proceed to the next step without compliance with a valid invocation of

jurisdiction in the first place.s

In these circumstances, this Court decides to refuse this application. This

application should therefore stand dismissed without costs.

Application is dismissed without costs.
