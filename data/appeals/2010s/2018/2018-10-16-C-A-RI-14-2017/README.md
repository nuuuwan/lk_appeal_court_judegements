Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff instituted this action against the Defendant under

Chapter LIII of the Civil Procedure Code seeking recovery of a

sum of Rs. 400,000/= with legal interest upon a Promissory

Note marked P1. The Defendant upon summons being served

moved Court to allow him to appear and defend the action

unconditionally. The learned District Judge being dissatisfied

with the bona fides of the defences taken up by the Defendant

by way of an affidavit, straightaway entered Judgment in favour

of the Plaintiff. This application for restitutio in integrum by the

Defendant is against that Judgment.

I have no doubt that the procedure adopted by the learned

District Judge is patently erroneous.

In an action filed under summary procedure on a liquid claim, if

the Court thinks, at the stage of seeking leave from Court to

appear and defend the action, that the defence taken up by the

Defendant by way of an affidavit together with or without

documents is (a) not prima facie sustainable and (b) even if

prima facie sustainable, not bona fide1, the maximum the Court

could do is to order the Defendant to deposit the entire sum

mentioned in the summons as a precondition to appear and

defend the action. In such a situation, the Court has no power

to enter Judgment in favour of the Plaintiff forthwith on the

premise that no prima facie sustainable defence has been made

out by the Defendant.

At that stage of the case, the Court is not expected to go into

finer details of all the defences and try the main case itself. The

task of the Court at that stage was lucidly explained by Justice

G.P.S. de Silva (later Chief Justice) in Esquire (Garments)

Industry Ltd v. Sadhwani (Japan) Ltd [1983] 2 Sri LR 242 at 248

in the following terms:

In this context, sections 704 and 706 of the Civil Procedure

Code are the relevant provisions. On the affidavits and the

documents placed before the Court, the primary question to

which the District Judge had to address his mind in this

case was whether the defence was prima facie sustainable

or feels reasonable doubt as to its good faith. At this

stage, the Court is not called upon to adjudicate upon the

merits of the defence. It is to be noted that section 704(2)

speaks of a prima facie sustainable defence. In other

words, the trial Judge need not, at that stage, be satisfied

that the defence will ultimately succeed. What the District

Judge has to consider is whether a triable issue (and not a

sham issue) arises upon the material placed before him.

(emphasis added)

In C.W. Mackie & Co Ltd v. Translanka Investments Ltd [1995] 2

Sri LR 6 at 7 Justice Ranaraja observed:

Section 704 of the Civil Procedure Code provides:

"The Defendant shall not be required, as a condition of his

being allowed to appear and defend, to pay into Court the

sum mentioned in the summons, or to give security

therefore, unless the Court thinks his defence not to be

prima facie sustainable or feels reasonable doubt as to its

good faith."

4

The Court is required by this section, to consider the petition

and affidavit together with any documents filed, and decide

whether the Defendant has a prima facie sustainable

defence. Even though there appears to be such a defence, if

Court is doubtful of its genuineness, the Defendant may be

ordered to give security before being permitted to appear

and defend. At this stage Court is not called upon to inquire

into the merits of the cases of either party. (emphasis

added)

When the Court is not called upon to adjudicate upon the merits

of the cases of either party at that stage of the case, how can the

Court enter Judgment for the Plaintiff on prima facie

impressions of facts?

In Ramanathan v. Fernando (1930) 31 NLR 495 it was held that:

In an action upon a liquid claim brought under Chapter LIII

of the Civil Procedure Code, the Defendant has the right to

appear and defend upon depositing in Court the amount in

claim, even where the Court finds that no valid defence is

disclosed.

(Acting) Chief Justice Garvin at pp 498-499 explained it thus:

I am prepared to take this case on the footing of the Judge's

finding-though I think a different view is at least possible-

and treat this as a case in which no defence has been

disclosed and that the application was made merely to gain

time. In such a case, has the Court power to refuse leave to

defend and enter judgment for the Plaintiff? It is beyond

question that the Court has the power, in such a case, to

require a Defendant to pay into Court the amount

5

mentioned in the summons as a condition of being allowed

to appear and defend.

Can it refuse to grant leave to appear and defend altogether

and absolutely?

It is the right of every person against whom an action is

instituted to appear and, unless he admits the claim, to file

his answer. For the purpose of expediting the recovery of

claims of the nature specified in section 703 by

discouraging frivolous, vexatious, and purely dilatory

defences, the Legislature has in such cases curtailed this

right by the requirement that a Defendant shall not be

admitted to defend the action until he has first obtained

leave. It is provided by section 706 as follows:-"The court

shall, upon application by the Defendant, give leave to

appear and to defend the action upon the Defendant paying

into court the sum mentioned in the summons, or upon

affidavits satisfactory to the court, which disclose a defence

or such facts as would make it incumbent on the holder to

prove consideration, or such other facts as the court may

deem sufficient to support the application and on such

terms as to security, framing and recording issues, or

otherwise, as the court thinks fit."

The only other part of this chapter which has a direct

bearing on the question under consideration is the proviso

to section 704:- "The Defendant shall not be required, as a

condition of his being allowed to appear and defend, to pay

into court the sum mentioned in the summons, or to give

security therefor, unless the court thinks his defence not to

be prima facie sustainable or feels reasonable doubt as to

its good faith."

It is a feature of these provisions that nowhere is it said

that the Court, may refuse leave. On the contrary, it

requires the Court to grant leave.

For the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the impugned Judgment of

the learned District Judge (but subject to the following

condition).

The next question is whether the learned District Judge is

correct in coming to the finding that the defences of the

Defendants are prima facie unsustainable. In the facts and

circumstances of this case, that finding is correct. The value of

the Promissory Note is Rs.400,000/=. The Defendant admits

borrowing that money. He also admits his signature on it. His

defence is that he paid the entire money. As the learned District

Judge has observed, there is no proof to that effect acceptable to

Court except his own ipse dixit.

In the result I order the Defendant to deposit the full value of the

Promissory Note, i.e. the sum of Rs. 400,000/= as a

precondition to appear and defend the action on or before

15.11.2018 in the District Court of Kaduwela. If the Defendant

fails to do it, the impugned Judgment of the District Court shall

prevail.

Appeal is allowed subject to conditions. No costs.

Send a copy of this Judgment to the District Court of Kaduwela

forthwith.
