The plaintiff-respondent instituted this action in the District

Court of Horana Case bearing No.3734/P on 27.07.1988 to partition the

land called "Manugampitiya" - Lot A in extent of A:O R: 1 P:32 amongst the

plaintiff himself and the 1 st -7th defendants.

The original owner of the land in question were Mendis Perera,

Abiliyon Perera and Doisa Perera. Abiliyon Perera's 1/3 share was

devolved on his wife Bebi Nona and 2 children namely Gunawathei and

plaintiff Jeemon Appuhamy. Later Babi Nona and Gunawathei transferred

their rights to the plaintiff by virtue of Deed No.64 on 30.09.1983.

Therefore, plaintiff-respondent claimed 1/3 share of the aforementioned

land. Mendis Perera had 3 children and after his death his 1/3 share

devolved to 1 st -3rd defendants. Doisa Perera died leaving her 1/3 share to

her children namely. Deemon (4th defendant-appellant), Leelawathi,

Gunawathi and Nandawathi (5th -7th defendant-respondents).

The 4th defendant claimed that the entire land on the basis of

prescriptive right through one Gunawardena who had given him a Deed of

Transfer No.1329 on 26.11.1987.

At the trial the 4th defendant called 2 witnesses on behalf of

him. One is Gunawardena who sold the land to the 4th defendant and a

neighbor called Caldera. According to Gunawardena, who is from another

Village entered this land in 1965.

At the end of the trial the learned District Judge gave

judgment dated 01.10.1995 holding with the pedigree presented by the

plaintiff-respondent and the land to be partitioned accordingly. That the

learned District judge also held that, the 4th defendant had not acquired a

prescriptive right to the land.

Being aggrieved by the said judgement this appeal was filed

by the 4th defendant-appellant praying to set aside the judgment of the

learned District Judge dated 01.10.1995.

Legal Issues

1. Whether Gunawardena possessed/acquired the prescriptive title

against the co-owners.

4

According to Gunawardena's evidence he is from a different

village and entered this land in 1965.

AT Pg.78 of the appeal brief that one Gunawardena testified as,

A - ~Z5f@Z5f Z)lWl.

When he entered into the questioned land in 1965 he was only 17 - 18

years old. (Pg 81).

In the evidence of Gunawardena he has cultivated the said

land without any obstruction from other Co-Owners. And also, he was in

the said land for such a long period of time from 1965 - 1983. But he

couldn't give exact evidence on the cultivations and the boundaries of the

said land.

Considering all the evidence led at the trial and carefully

analyze those evidence it is obvious that Gunawardena did not acquire the

prescriptive title against the other co-owners. And also that the learned

District Judge correctly has come to the conclusion that Gunawardena

has not acquired a prescriptive title against the rights of the co-owners

from 1965.

2. Whether the 4th defendant-appellant entitled to the questioned land.

6

The 4th defendant-appellant is a co-owner to the questioned

land. But knowing that he inherits a share of the said land the 4th

defendant-appellant had bought the whole land from the stranger -

Gunawardena. A person named Caldera was called by the 4th defendant-

appellant to corroborate the evidence of Gunawardena. Caldera testified

that Gunawardena had possessed the said land for over 10 years and he

had given that 4-5 years old coconut trees to him. Caldera further stated

that he did not know whether Gunawardena came as a labourer or in any

other capacity.

At Pg. 94 of the appeal brief

At Pg. 102

\

E ti , ,

According to the evidence of Caldera there is no satisfactory

explanation of prescriptive title acquired by Gunawardena on the

questioned land. And also the 4th defendant-appellant or Gunawardena

has failed to establish a positive act of ouster regarding the other co-

owners. Therefore, Gunawardena does not acquired a prescriptive title

against the other co-owners the 4th defendant-appellant has no right to

the whole land by virtue of Deed No.1329 dated 26.11.1987.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the

findings of the learned District Judge and therefore, I uphold the judgment

dated 01.10.1995 and dismiss the appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
