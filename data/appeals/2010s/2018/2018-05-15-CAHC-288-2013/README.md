ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The Accused-Appellant is present in Court produced by the Prison

Authorities.

The accused-appellant was sentenced to death upon his conviction

for the murder of his wife. The prosecution primarily relied on the dying

deposition made by the deceased, which was recorded by the Police in the

presence of the medical officer, to prove its charge of murder.

In seeking to set aside his conviction and sentence imposed by the

High Court of Colombo, the accused-appellant sought to challenge his

conviction on the basis that the trial Court was in error when it acted upon

the unreliable dying deposition of the deceased, which in effect

contradicted with the evidence of other witnesses presented by the

prosecution. It is alleged by the accused-appellant that the trial Court also

failed to consider the case presented by him in the light of the established

legal principles. Learned Presidents Counsel for the accused-appellant

thereby contended that the accused-appellant was denied of his right to a

fair trial.

Learned President's Counsel further contended that the prosecution

has failed to call a vital witness and the trial Court erroneously failed to

draw the inference under Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance. In

addition, he further submitted in replying to the submissions of the State,

2

that the trial Court has failed to consider the diminishing culpability of the

accused-appellant.

In support of his position that the trial Court acted on the unreliable

dying deposition of the deceased, it was submitted by the learned

President's Counsel that the sister of the deceased, in her evidence has

stated that she was told by her deceased sister how her husband has set

her on fire after pouring petrol on her and what she did thereafter when

she was engulfed by the flames. The written statement of the deceased was

also marked by the prosecution as P2. Then in the bed head ticket, marked

as P3, it is recorded by the admitting medical officer that she was admitted

with a history of "burning" but he/ she has put two questions marks after

writing the word "Assault". The admitting medical officer was not called

as a witness. The accused-appellant submits that there are inconsistencies,

in relation to the claim of the deceased that the accused-appellant has

undressed her, tied her hands and performed an unnatural sexual act with

the deceased prior to setting her on fire, when compared with what she

told her sister who attended to her during the period in which she received

medical treatment and the statement recorded by the Police.

The accused-appellant placed reliance on the judgment of Gamini

Mahaarachchi v The Attorney General CA 106/2002 - Court of Appeal

minutes of 22.08.2007, where it was held that;

"As there are inherent weaknesses in a dying declaration

which I have stated above, the trial judge or jury as the case

may be, must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the

following matters;

3

(a) Whether the deceased in fact made a statement

(b) Whether the statement made by the deceased was

true and accurate

(c) Whether the statement made by the deceased person

could be accepted beyond reasonable doubt

(d) Whether the evidence of the witness who testifies

about the dying declaration can be accepted beyond

a reasonable doubt

(e) Whether the witness is telling the truth

(fJ Whether the deceased was able to speak at the time

the alleged declaration was made,

(g) Whether the deceased was able to identify the

assailant".

It is the contention of the accused-appellant that the dying

deposition on which he was convicted fails to satisfy these stringent tests,

in view of the inconsistencies referred to above and therefore the

prosecution has failed to prove its case against him.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Attorney General sought to

counter the submissions of the accused-appellant on the basis that the

sequence of events as narrated by the deceased in her written statement is

corroborated by medical evidence and therefore the truthfulness and

accuracy of its contents were proved beyond reasonable doubt. In replying

to the claim of the accused-appellant that the trial Court had failed to

consider and analyze his evidence given under oath, learned Deputy

Solicitor General submitted that the trial Court has properly evaluated the

credibility of the accused and in addition it has also considered his

subsequent conduct in coming to the conclusion it eventually did.

4

In replying to the submission that a vital witness has not been called

by the prosecution, learned Deputy Solicitor General stated to Court that

the neighbour who has rushed to rescue the deceased, when she raised

cries, could not be located and it is for that reason his evidence was not led.

In view of these submissions and for its proper appreciation, it is

necessary to set out the evidence presented before the trial Court at least

briefly.

According to Nilanthi, the deceased is her sister and after her

marriage to the accused-appellant, she was residing in Angoda. They had a

male child who was preparing for his grade five scholarship exam at the

time of the incident. In June 2004, the deceased returned to her parental

house at Bomiriya with her belongings, after a scuffle with the accused-

appellant. She also brought her child. On the day of the incident, the

accused-appellant came to Bomiriya in the evening and invited the

deceased to go with him to "settle a problem". The accused-appellant

prevented their son coming with his mother. They went away in a three-

wheeler.

As the deceased did not return for two days, upon enquiry, Nilanthi

learnt that the deceased has suffered burn injuries and had been admitted

to hospital. When the witness visited her sister at the hospital, it was

observed that the deceased has "lost parts of her body". Probably the

witness was referring to the phenomenon of peeling off skin after burn

injuries. Her condition was critical and was being given oxygen. Then,

having removed her oxygen mask, she spoke a little to convey that the

accused-appellant had set her on fire by pouring petrol on her after

5

assaulting her with a bottle and tying her hands with a thick rope. She was

fallen on the ground as she lost consciousness upon the assault, and when

she regained consciousness the accused-appellant was pouring petrol over

her.

Witness Kumara, who claimed to have accompanied the deceased to

the hospital after she suffered burn injuries stated that she merely

complained of the pain due to burning during the journey. He also said

that her body was covered with a cloth which appeared like a sarong. The

other male person who accompanied the deceased, lived in a neighbouring

house and was an employee of the Water Board. The witness claimed that

it is who he called out for his help.

It is through Dr.Ariyaratne, the prosecution has tendered the written

statement of the deceased as her dying deposition, marked P2. The medical

witness also said that the deceased was in good mental state at the time of

making the statement to the Police in his presence. He has then placed his

signature on it. PS 12425 Wipulasena has recorded it.

Dr. Rani, in her evidence stated that she has performed the post

mortem examination on the body of the deceased. She observed one

laceration on the head, in addition to burn injuries which has spread over

both sides of her body above her knees. She further stated that the

deceased had burn injuries over 82% of her body surface. She was of the

opinion that the burn injuries may have resulted in a fire due to some

combustible substance being thrown at her. The deceased has died due to

septicaemia.

6

In cross examination she further opined that it is not a case of

suicide, judging by the injury pattern. She further stated that it is unlikely a

suicide or an accident.

IP Samarasinhe visited the crime scene only after the death of the

deceased. He has observed a guava tree located in a shrub area of the back

garden of one Ranjith, as the place of the incident. The land belonged to the

Water Board and he also noted a boutique. There was also a water tank,

located about 75 meters from Ranjith's house.

When the defence was called by the trial Court, the accused-

appellant elected to give evidence under oath.

It was his evidence that he got married to the deceased in 1988. At

the time of their son's birth the deceased has purchased a house in

Bomiriya. He has allowed the deceased to operate a tailor shop from the

boutique situated in Angoda and three of them lived in its adjacent room.

He was involved in rehabilitating youth addicted to drugs in an

establishment located in Galle.

In describing the incident, the accused -appellant claimed that they

had a dispute over the tailor shop and she left for Bomiriya. Then he

started an eatery in the vacant premises. One day, a person, described as

the husband of deceased's sister, came to see him and told that he needed

to talk to the accused -appellant but he was too embarrassed to reveal the

reason. Then he told the accused-appellant "certain things". After this

incident, he went to Bomiriya, brought back the deceased to Angoda and

assaulted her. When she was assaulted she admitted "certain things"

which took place. She fell on the ground with the assault. Then he went

7

back to the boutique, took some cash and left for Galle. He disclosed what

happened to one of his superiors and later surrendered to Court. He

denied any knowledge of setting fire to his wife.

The most important evidence in relation to the charge levelled

against the accused-appellant came through the statement of the deceased,

marked as P2.

In that statement, the deceased claims that on 7th July 2004, at about

7.30 p.m., her husband took her to the back garden, and assaulted her on

the head with a glass bottle which resulted in a bleeding injury. He then

tied her to a branch of a tree, having undressed her, he performed a

"JaraWedak" and repeated it once more. She felt faintish over this and then

she laid herself on the ground and asked for water. The accused-appellant

then ran to their house, brought a bottle back and poured some liquid over

her body. She heard a match being lit and then she felt heat. Her body was

enveloped by flames. She has then run towards the water tank and

splashed water on her body. There too she was assaulted by her husband.

Learned High Court Judge, in her judgment has devoted significant

space to evaluate the truthfulness and reliability of the dying deposition of

the deceased in order to determine the charge against the accused-

appellant. In her evaluation, the position of consistency has also been

considered. Deceased's sister clearly stated in her evidence that it was the

accused-appellant who set fire to her. Then she repeated the same

allegation in the presence of the Doctor to the Police officer. The deceased

had burn injuries over 80%of her body. In such a state, with the pain from

her extensive burn injuries, it is not reasonable to expect the deceased to

8

narrate how she received her injuries to the two relative strangers who

took her to hospital, immediately after the incident. Even at the time of

admission, it is not clear as to who provided the history of her injuries.

There is evidence that patients are admitted initially to the OPD and then

they are transferred to Emergency Treatment Unit, before commencing

treatment at Ward 73. Then only they are transferred to the specialized

ward.

In these circumstances, no weightage can be attached to the brief

references made in the BHT of " Assault" with two question marks, in order

to conclude that it is a doubtful claim. The medical officer, who performed

the post mortem clearly observed a laceration on her head with skin

damage. This confirmation dispels any challenge on the claim of assault.

The three grounds to which the learned President's Counsel referred

to in his submissions as inconsistencies when the dying deposition is

compared with what her sister said in evidence, this Court finds that they

were consistent except on the claim of "Jara Wade". Both Nilanthi and the

deceased claim that her clothing was removed. The use of rope is also

mentioned in the two versions. The absence of the reference to the

repulsive act of the accused-appellant could easily be attributed to the

condition she was in at the time of its making. The sister clearly said in her

evidence that the deceased spoke briefly after removing her oxygen mask,

whereas when making P2, her condition may have been stabilized as the

expert witness said that she was rational and was in a position to make a

statement.

9

As correctly pointed out by the learned Deputy Solicitor General,

that the contents of the dying deposition are corroborated by independent

sources. The medical evidence confirms that there was in fact an assault on

the deceased. The removal of her clothing is confirmed by witness Kumara

who says that the deceased was only covered by a sarong when she was

taken to hospital. The presence of the guava tree and the water tank are

relevant in this context.

There is no challenge by the accused-appellant for the admission of

the dying deposition of the deceased as relevant evidence under Section

32(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

In the circumstances, we find no merit in the submissions of the

learned President's Counsel that the dying deposition could not be relied

upon and a conviction based on its contents as to the 1/ cause of his death, or

as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his

death" could not be sustained. Once the statement is admitted, the trial

Court would confine itself to the contents of it which relates to the cause of

death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in

death. Any motive as revealed from the contents of such a statement had to

be excluded from its consideration as per the judgment of Silva and

Another v Republic of Sri Lanka (1981) 2 Sri L.R.439.

The trial Court was obviously mindful of the legal principles laid

down in the judgment relied upon by the accused-appellant and Ranasinhe

v Attorney General (2007) 1 Sri L.R. 218, as it has considered the reliability

of truthfulness of the dying deposition at length. Therefore, it is our

10

, , ,

considered view that the reliance placed on the dying deposition by the

trial Court in convicting the accused-appellant is legally acceptable.

The complaint that the evidence presented by the accused-appellant

has not been properly considered by the trial Court must be considered

now.

Upon perusal of the judgment of the trial Court, it is clear that the

trial Court has analyzed his evidence in detail and arrived at a definitive

finding that he has presented an improbable defence. In coming to this

conclusion, the trial Court has considered that the accused-appellant,

having admitted the sequence of events as stated by the deceased up to the

point of her falling on the ground, had then presented a fanciful claim.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General termed this claim as an act of character

assassination of the deceased.

When the proceedings are examined in relation to the accused-

appellant's evidence, it is clearly seen that through a series of leading

questions, learned Counsel who defended him at the trial, introduced the

claim of deceased having an extramarital affair with his brother-in-law. It

did not originate from the accused-appellant himself. The accused only

referred to what he learnt from his brother-in-law as "certain things". It is

his Counsel who suggested what he referred to a "certain things" is in fact

a confession on infidelity. He has mostly agreed with what his Counsel

suggested through his examination in chief. In addition, this claim was

made by the accused-appellant for the first time only in his evidence. He

did not suggest it to the sister of the deceased, who would have been the

best person to answer it affirmatively as it involves her husband. He did

11

.

not suggest this claim even to the witness who has worked under him for

some time, who was evasive in giving answers. Therefore, it is clearly an

inconsistent claim and it was only raised at a very late stage of the

proceedings before the High Court. Therefore, it could reasonably inferred

as an afterthought.

On the question of probability of his version, in our view that it is

highly improbable for a person to confess to the accused-appellant that he

had a relationship with his wife, without any compulsion and absolutely

on a voluntary basis. The trial Court has observed the accused-appellant's

demeanour when he gave evidence before it and concluded that he uttered

falsehood in his evidence. Of course, there is no specific sentence by which

the trial Court states that it rejects the evidence of the accused-appellant.

When it already concluded that the accused-appellant is lying, and thereby

giving a clear indication that it had rejected his evidence in total, we do not

think that the trial Court should add another statement in its judgment that

it has also considered the position whether it could be accepted nor

rejected.

The complaint regarding the witness not called by the prosecution is

based primarily in support of the issue of consistency of the claim of the

prosecution as to how the deceased suffered burn injuries. It is clear from

the other witness who rushed to the scene, that the missing witness only

involved with calling out his help and taking the deceased to hospital and

there was no time gap allowing him to talk to the deceased to verify with

her as to how she got burnt. He does not qualify to be termed as a person

who "unfolds a narration" that is different to the one given by the witness

12

, ,

already called by the prosecution as per the judgment of Walimunige John

v The State (1973) 76 NLR 488.

Lastly, the consideration of diminished responsibility did not arise

before the trial Court since the accused-appellant emphatically claimed that

he did not consume alcohol when he confronted and assaulted the

deceased over the allegation of infidelity and the evidence before the trial

Court did not reveal that he lost his power of self-control over the

suspicion of extramarital affair attributed to the deceased.

Considering the totality of the evidence, this Court is of the view that

the trial Court has arrived at the correct finding and the several grounds of

appeal, as raised by the learned President's Counsel for the accused-

appellant does not suffice to challenge the validity of the conviction.

We affirm the judgment delivered by the learned High Court Judge

dated 15.08.2008. The appeal of the accused-appellant is accordingly

dismissed.
