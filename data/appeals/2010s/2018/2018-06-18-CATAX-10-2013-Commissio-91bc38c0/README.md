JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

1. BACKGROUND

When the Value Added Tax (hereinafter sometimes referred to as 'VAT')

returns were submitted by the Respondent for certain taxable periods1, those

returns were rejected by the Assessor. The Assessor had then issued a new

VAT assessment in terms of section 28 of the Value Added Tax Act No. 14

of 2002 as amended (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 'VAT Act').

The Respondent had then appealed against the said decision of the Assessor,

to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as 'Commissioner General'). The Commissioner General, in the

1 Periods ending on 2004-03-31 and 2005-02-28.

4

said appeal, by his determination dated 2008-06-16, confirmed the decision

of the Assessor.

The Respondent being dissatisfied with the said determination by the

Commissioner General, thereafter appealed to the Board of Review2, As the

said appeal was not concluded by the Board of Review, it was transferred to

the Tax Appeals Commission (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

. 'Commission') by virtue of section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No,

23 of 2011 as amended,

In the said appeal before the Tax Appeals Commission, the Respondent had

raised two preliminary objections,

First Objection

The first preliminary objection raised by the Respondent is that the relevant

assessment is not valid as it has not been signed and/or do not bear the

name and the designation of the person making the assessment.

Second Objection,

2 By appeal dated 2008-08-12.

5

The second preliminary objection was that the said appeal to the Tax Appeals

Commission is time barred.

The Tax Appeals Commission had upheld the first of the above two

preliminary objections raised by the Respondent and overruled the second.

The said determination by the Tax Appeals Commission has been annexed

to the case stated as X 3.

Being dissatisfied with the determination dated 2013-02-26 by the Tax

Appeals Commission; the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue has

taken steps to initiate the appeal proceedings in this court.

2. QUESTIONS OF LAW

The questions of law formulated for the opinion of this Court by the Appellant

who is the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue in terms of section 11

A of the Tax Appeals Commission Act as amended by Act No. 20 of 2013

and Act No. 23 of 2011, are as follows.

1. Whether Tax Appeals Commission has the jurisdiction to annul an

Assessment due to service of unsigned notice of assessment, even all

..

-.

6

other mandatory requirements have been fulfilled in order to make

the assessment.

2. Whether duly served notice of Assessment with omission of signature

affect the validity of assessment.

3. Whether duly served notice of Assessment, which was printed and

issued by the computer, without signature of issuing officer, is an error

covered by section 61 of Value Added Tax Act, No 14 of 2002.

4. Whether Assessee can challenge the validity of assessment at the

hearing of Appeal at the Appeals Commission.

5. Whether Assessee can raise an issue as a preliminary objection at the

hearing of Appeal at the Appeals Commission, which has not been

raised at the time of Appeal.

6. Whether issuing a notice of assessment by an Assessor, which is

generated through computer under the provision of section 28 of

Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002, is exercising of discretionary

power or ministerial act.

7. Whether the name of the Commissioner General, Deputy

Commissioner or Assessor duly printed or signed on the assessment

7

notice under section 60 of Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002 is a

mandatory requirement.

3. FINDING ANSWERS

Since this Court has been called upon to find answers to the above questions

of law, it would be a good idea to reproduce at the outset, for convenience,

. the provision of law contained in section 60 (1) of the VAT Act. It is as

follows:

Sections 60 (1)

" Every notice to be given by the Commissioner General, a Deputy

Commissioner or an Assessor under this Act shall bear the name of the

Commissioner General or Deputy Commissioner or Assesso0- as the case may

be, and every such notice shall be valid if the name of the Commissioner

General, Deputy Commissione0- or Assessor is duly printed or signed

thereon. "

It is common ground that the notice of assessment has neither been signed

by the person making the assessment nor bears duly printed name of the

person making it.

8

The tax appeals commission, for the reasons set out in its determination has

held:

i. that the compliance of section 60 (1) is a mandatory requirement,

ii. that the noncompliance of that section gives rise to a patent lack of

jurisdiction,

iii. that such objection to a patent lack of jurisdiction could be raised at

any stage of the proceedings,

iv. that the question of estoppel does not arise at such a situation.

Thus, there are at least two fundamental questions waiting in the forefront

starving for answers from this Court. They are the two following questions:

i. Is compliance of section 60 (1) mandatory?

ii. Does the noncompliance of section 60 (1) give rise to a situation of

patent lack of jurisdiction?

It would be judicious at this stage to dissect section 60(1) broadly into two

parts, to help this Court understand the true nature of it.

First part

9

" Every notice to be given by the Commissioner General, a Deputy

Commissioner or an Assessor under this Act shall bear the name of the

Commissioner General or Deputy Commissioner or the Assessor, as the case

may be/

and

Second part

every such notice shall be valid if the name of the Commissioner General

Deputy Commissioner or Assessor is duly printed or signed thereon. "

It is to be noted that the first part of the section mentioned above, has

required the notices (referred to therein) to bear the name of the

Commissioner General or Deputy Commissioner or the Assessor. The word

used by the legislature in the section is "shall". Thus, the first observation

this Court makes from the contents of the first part is that the legislature has

required that the name and the signature of the relevant official be included

in the notice. It is therefore clear that the relevant official is not called upon

to exercise any discretion to decide whether he or she should insert the name

and signature. This is because it is the procedure established by law and

. . 10

therefore the official concerned is required to follow the said instructions

without having to exercise any individual judgment.

Therefore, the actions by the relevant official under the first part of the

section are ministerial acts rather than acts involving the exercise of any

discretion.

The second part of the above section categorically state that such notice

would derive its validity from the presence of the duly printed name of the

Commissioner General, Deputy Commissioner or Assessor or their signature

thereon. This is indicated from the phrase " .... and every such notice shall

be valid if... II. In the second part also the word used is "shall". Since the

second part of the section stipulates the requirement for the validity of such

notice, the question this Court has to consider here, is the question whether

the non-compliance of the said stipulated requirement would be fatal to the

validity of such notice.

It would be appropriate for this Court at this juncture, to refer to the

judgment3 of the Supreme Court in the case of Eigitread Lanka (Private)

3 Cited in the written submission by the Appellant.

11

Limited Vs Bino Tyres (Private) Limited 4 has taken the view that in

ascertaining the legislative intent, it is permissible to look at the purpose of

the legislation in which the particular provision sought to be interpreted

occurs. In that case, the Supreme Court had to decide whether the word

'may' in section 4 of the Arbitration Act, makes it mandatory for any dispute

which the parties have agreed to refer for arbitration, has necessarily to be

-determined through arbitration, if the matter is not contrary to public policy

and is capable of being resolved by arbitration. In the endeavor of this Court

to come to the correct conclusion regarding the interpretation of the relevant

provisions in the VAT Act in the instant case, it would be helpful to reproduce

here at this stage, the paragraphS quoted in that judgment by His Lordship

Justice Marsoof. It is reproduced below.

" .... The use of expression ''may'' or ''shall'' in a statute is not decisive, and

other relevant provisions that can throw light have to be looked into in order

to find out whether the character of the provision is mandatory or directory.

In such a case legislative intent has to be determined. The words ''may';

''shall'; ''must'' and the like, as employed in statutes, will in cases of doubt,

12

require examination in their particular context in order to ascertain their real

meaning . .... "

This Court finds that section 61 of the VAT Act has provided situations in

which such notices shall not be quashed or deemed invalid on account of

certain defects in them.

Thus, it would be prudent for this Court to consider next, the question

whether the provision in section 61 of the Act applies to cure any

noncompliance of the provisions in section 60 (1) of the VAT Act on the part

of the Respondents. Reproduction of section 61 of the Act would be

necessary to consider that question.

Section 61

" No notice/ assessmen~ certificate or other proceeding purporting to be in

accordance with the provisions of this Act shall be quashe~ or deemed to

be void or voidable/ for want of form/ or be affected by reason of a mistake/

defect or omission therein if the same is in substance and effect in

conformity with or according to/ the intent and meaning of this Act and if

the person assessed or intended to be assessed or affected thereby is

deSignated therein according to common intent and understanding. "

13

To enable this Court to understand the extent of the applicability of the

above provision, it would be prudent to present the above section in three

separate parts in the following manner.

First Part

" No notice/ assessment certificate or other proceeding purporting to be in

accordance with the provisions of this Act shall be quashect or deemed to

be void or voidable/ .... "

Thus, the first part stipulates that no notice etc. shall be declared invalid

under certain circumstances. The said circumstances are set out in the

second part. It is as follows:

Second Part

i. for want of form/ or

ii. be affected by reason of a mistake/

iii. defect or omission therein

However, for these circumstances (set out in the second part) to qualify for

the application along with the legal provision stipulated in the first part, such

14

circumstances must have fulfilled the conditions described in the third part

which is mentioned below.

Third Part.

a) if the same is in substance and effect in conformity with or according

to/ the intent and meaning of this Act and

b) if the person assessed or intended to be assessed or affected thereby

is designated therein according to common intent and understanding.

With the dissection of section 61 into three parts in place, this Court would

have to consider next whether the impugned notices of assessment in the

instant case qualifies for protection from being invalidated by virtue of the

said section. It is to that question that this Court will now turn.

The words 'notice' and 'assessment' are found in the list of items included in

the first part of the section. The impugned documents in the instant case

are two notices of assessment. Therefore, the first part encompasses both

of the impugned documents of the instant case.

This Court has to consider next, the question whether the defects

complained in the impugned documents of the instant case fall under the

second part of section 61.

15

In the circumstances relevant to the case at hand, what is relevant to

consider is the question whether the provision of law in section 60 (1) is a

provision regarding the 'form' of the notice of assessment.

As has been described before in this judgment, this Court has already taken

the view;

a. that the relevant official is not called upon to exercise any discretion

to decide whether or not he or she should insert the name and

signature on such notice of assessment and therefore the relevant

official concerned is merely required to follow the said instructions

provided in section 60 (1) without having to exercise any individual

judgment,

b. that therefore, the actions by the relevant official under the first part

of the section are ministerial acts rather than any act exercising any

discretionary power.

Therefore, the compliance of requirements set out in the first part of section

60 (1) relate to the 'form' of such notice of assessment. Further, in the

circumstances of this case, this Court is of the view that the non-compliance

pertaining to this case, has occurred by reason of a mistake or by a mere

16

unintended omission on the part of the Appellant. Hence, it stands to reason

that the second part of section 61 applies in its full force to the impugned

notices of assessment in the instant case.

The last question to be considered by this Court is whether the impugned

notices of assessment relevant to the instant case have fulfilled the

conditions set out in the third part of section 61.

In doing so this Court has to consider whether the notices of assessment

relevant to the instant case have fulfilled the conditions in limb (a) and limb

(b) of the third part of section 61 as set out above.

There is no complaint by the Respondent that the Commissioner General has

not complied with any other requirement of the Act in the instant case. The

only error that is complained of, by the Respondent, is the absence of the

name or the signature in the relevant assessment.

It is to be observed that the Respondent had not complained about the

absence of the name or the signature when it had challenged the relevant

notices of assessment at the previous occasions. It is in the course of the

hearing in the Tax Appeals Commission that the Respondent had raised this

issue for the first time. This shows that the Respondent has had no doubt

! I1

IiI

'.

17

that the notices impugned in this case are notices of assessment issued

according to the intent and meaning of the VAT Act.

The view taken by the Tax Appeals Commission is that the requirement of

having the name duly printed or signed by the person authorized to issue

the notice is a mandatory requirement because the identity of the person

issuing the notice under section 60 (1) is material to the tax payer. It is on

.. that basis that the Tax Appeals Commission has held that the complained

defects in the notices impugned in the instant case would give rise to a

situation where there is a patent lack of jurisdiction.

It is clear from the letter dated 30th December 2005 and the letter dated 16th

January 2006 that the Assessor who assessed the return of the Respondent

is Mr. A A Dayaratne. He has taken the responsibility for issuing the said

notice. He has clearly mentioned in his letter dated 16th January 2006 that

the impugned notices of assessment will be issued under TIN NO.

134003642, on the basis of the reasons given in the letter dated 30th

December 2005 signed by him. Thus, the Respondent knew very well that

the impugned notice of assessment, which has its identification, (TIN NO.

. .

18

134003642) printed on its top left hand corner, is the notice of assessment

referred to by Mr. A A Dayaratne in his previous letters dated 30th December

2005 and 16th January 2006. One must not lose sight of the fact that both

the said letters are letters signed by Mr. A A Dayaratne who is the Assessor

who had issued the impugned notices of assessment. In addition, both the

said letters did have the name of the Assessor (A A Dayaratne) printed on

-them. Therefore, it is not a situation in which the Respondent became

flabbergasted after seeing the said notice.

In these circumstances, this Court is able to conclude without any hesitation

that the Respondent was fully aware that the notices impugned in this case,

in their substance and effect, are notices of assessment issued in conformity

with, or according to, the intent and meaning of the VAT Act.

Moreover, this Court notes that the Commissioner General has indeed

defended the said notices of assessment in previous proceedings as notices

issued under the authority and provisions of the VAT Act. At no time, the

Respondent has even attempted to indicate that the relevant notices have

been issued without any authority or their substance and effect are not in

. .

19

conformity with the Act or they are not notices issued according to, the intent

and meaning of the VAT Act.

This Court also notes that the said notices of assessment carry all the other

details relevant to the assessment. They also sufficiently explain the

circumstances under which the Respondent came to be assessed for

payment of tax. There is no complaint by the Respondent that the said

notices of assessment lack any details or explanations in connection with the

act of taxing the Respondent.

Therefore, this Court takes the view that the said notices of assessment

relevant to the instant case, in substance and effect have been issued in

conformity with, or according to, the intent and meaning of this Act as

required by limb (a) of third part of section 61 set out above. That brings

this Court to the last lap of the instant exercise.

Thus, the last question to be considered by this Court is whether the

impugned notices satisfy the condition in limb No. (b) of the third part above.

There is no complaint by the Respondent that the Appellant has not complied

with limb (b) of third part of section 61. It is not disputed that the person

'.

20

assessed or intended to be assessed has sufficiently been designated in the

impugned notices of assessment.

Therefore, this Court concludes that the person assessed or intended to be

assessed has sufficiently been deSignated as per the requirement in limb (b)

above.

The facts and circumstances of the instant case, does not in any manner

show this Court that the absence of the signature of the assessor or his duly

printed name on the impugned notices has caused any prejudice to the

Respondent.

In the above circumstances, this Court concludes that the impugned notices

of assessment relevant to the instant case qualifies in terms of section 61,

for the protection against invalidation on account of absence of the duly

printed name of the Commissioner General, Deputy Commissioner, or

Assessor or their signature thereon.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court holds that the impugned notices of

assessment relevant to the instant case shall not be quashed, or deemed to

be void or voidable due to the above defect.

'.

21

This Court is mindful that the above reasoning is sufficient for this Court to

dispose the matter at its hands. However, this Court in its wider obligation

towards encouraging the smooth functioning of the legal system of this

country thinks it should set out here, some relevant aspects about the

application of some of the provisions of Electronic Transactions Act No. 19

of 2006 to the questions of law to be decided in the instant case. Therefore,

this Court takes this opportunity to set out its views about this aspect of the

case as well.

Objectives of Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006.

First and foremost, it would be a good starting point for this Court to refer

to the objectives, which the Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006 has

attempted to achieve. Section 2 thereof has listed out the said objectives.

They are reproduced below;

(a) to facilitate domestic and international electronic commerce by

eliminating legal barriers and establishing legal certainty;

(b) to encourage the use of reliable forms of electronic commerce;

...

22

(c) to facilitate electronic filing of documents with Government and to

promote efficient delivery of Government services by means of reliable forms

of electronic communications; and

(d) to promote public confidence in the authenticity, integrity and reliability

of data messages, electronic documents, electronic records or other

communications.

These objectives indicate in no uncertain terms that the facilitating and

promoting the use of more and more electronic records and documents,6 is

the definite target, the legislature aims to achieve by enacting the said Act.

Thus, that is the clear intention of the legislature, which should be taken as

a guide to interpret the provisions of this Act.

Application of Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006 to the instant case.

As has been pOinted out by the learned counsel for the Respondent,? it is

true that the said Act came into operation on 19th May 2006 and the notice

of Assessment relevant to this case was issued on 26th April 2006. However,

it is a fact that the provisions of this Act was in operation at the time the Tax

6 This is manifest from the provisions in sections, 2 (c) and 2 (d) of Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006.

7 In his written submissions, paragraphs 33, 34, 35 and 36.

...

. .

23

Appeals Commission made the impugned determination, which is dated

2013-02-26.

This Court notes that section 3 of the Electronic Transactions Act has

provided that 'no data message, electronic document, electronic record or

other communication shall be denied legal recognition, effect, validity or

enforceability on the ground that it is in electronic form.'

There cannot be any room to doubt that the above provision has been put

in place by the legislature to facilitate the admission of the category of

evidence referred to in the said section. Therefore, this Court has no

hesitation to conclude that the provisions of law brought in by the Electronic

Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006, are procedural law provisions relating to

evidence rather than any substantive law provisions relating to the regime

of fiscal legislation.

The general elementary principle adopted and applied for the interpretation

of statutes is that the provisions of a statute must be taken to be prospective

unless the retrospective effect is clearly indicated by the legislature.

However, this principle is subject to exceptions. One such exception is that

this principle does not apply to the procedural laws. The following passage

...

-.

24

from 'Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes'8 describes the above

principle.

" .... The presumption against retrospective construction has no application

to enactments, which affect only the procedure and practice of the Courts.

No person has vested right in any course of procedure,9 but only the right of

prosecution or defence in the manner prescribed for the time being, by or

for the court in which he sues, and if an Act of Parliament alters that mode

of procedure, he can only proceed according to the altered mode. 10

"Alterations in the form of procedure are always retrospective, unless there

is some good reason or other why they should not be." 11 .... "

Further, it would be relevant to reproduce the following paragraph from the

same book,12 which would show clearly that any provision pertaining to

admissibility of evidence is regarded as a procedural provision.

" ... Section 50 of the Companies Act 1967 provides that an answer given by

a person in reply to a question put to him during an inspection of the affairs

2S

of a company under section 167 of the 1948 Companies Act may be used in

evidence against him. This "is a procedural provision providing for the

admissibility of evidence before a court when it comes to hear a case and

deal with the evidence. It applies to future hearings after the Act of 1967

comes into operation; but it then applies even though the hearing be in

respect of matters which arose before that Act was passed." 13 .... "

.- It is not difficult for this Court to find occasions where this rule has been

repeatedly stated in the judgments of our Courts as well. Indeed, our Courts

have been consistent in following this rule in the past. Cases of Appuhamy

vs Brumpy14(a case decided in the year 1913) and in re F J C De Mel and

Thelma De Me11S(a case decided in the year 1975) are good examples of

such consistency.

Thus, this Court takes the view that the provisions of Electronic Transactions

Act No. 19 of 2006 is relevant to the case in hand. Its' provisions are

applicable to the instant case. This Court therefore rejects the argument

13 Selangor United Rubber Estates, Ltd. Vs Cradock (No.2) [1968] 1 W L R 319, per Ungoed-Thomas ] at p.321. 14 16 NLR 59. 15 78 NLR 67

...

26

advanced by the learned counsel for the Respondent stating that the said

provisions have no application to the instant case.

Moreover, the fact that there is a clear reference to TIN No. 134003642, and

its presence, taken in the light of the other circumstances of the case

convince this Court that the impugned document is a computer generated

version of something that exists in electronic form.

Further, there is no basis for this Court to infer that the absence of the

signature of the Assessor has caused any prejudice to the Respondent, as

the Respondents knew very well that it was Mr. Dayaratne who had issued

the said assessment.

This would be the most appropriate instance for this Court to refer to section

7 of Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006, which recognizes electronic

signatures.

Section 7 of Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006

'Where any Act or enactment provides that any information or

communication shall be authenticated by affixing the signature/ or that any

'"

27

document should be signed or bear the signature of any person, then,

notwithstanding anything contained in such law, such requirement shall be

deemed to be satisfied, if such information or matter is authenticated by

means of an electronic signature. '

Section 26 of the Act has defined what an electronic signature is.

Section 26 of ElectroniC Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006

"electronic signature" means any letters, numbers, symbols, images,

characters or any combination thereof in electronic form, applied to,

incorporated in or logically associated with an electronic document, with the

intention of authenticating and, or approving the same, in order to establish

authenticity or integrity, or both.

As has already been referred to above, it is a fact that the impugned notices

of assessment have been issued under TIN NO. 134003642, on the basis of

the reasons given in the letter dated 30th December 2005. Mr. A A Dayaratne

has clearly mentioned in his letter dated 16th January 2006 that the

impugned notices of assessment will be issued under TIN NO. 134003642.

Indeed the said TIN NO. 134003642 has been mentioned in the letter dated

30th December 2005, the letter dated 16th January 2006 and the impugned

28

notices of assessment. Thus, when considering these facts it would be in

order for this Court to form the view that the said TIN NO. 134003642 has

served as an electronic signature.

When that is the case, then, the requirement of the signature of the assessor

or his duly printed name on the notice of assessment, shall in the instant

case, be deemed to have been satisfied by virtue of section 7 of Electronic

. Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006.

4. OPINION

It would be the time now to turn to the questions of law formulated for the

opinion of this Court by the Tax Appeals Commission. At the outset, this

Court observes that the majority of the said questions have been formulated

in such a way that any answer provided to them would have general

application across the board, rather than answering the specific questions

that have arisen in the instant case. Due to this reason, this Court is

compelled to take steps to prevent such misapplication of such wide

interpretations. In these circumstances, the preference of this Court would

be to refrain from providing direct answers in the form of affirmatives and

"1

29

negatives to the questions of law formulated by the Tax Appeals

Commission.

This Court would formulate its opinions relating to the issues cropped up in

the instant case having in its mind, the questions of law formulated by the

Tax Appeals Commission. This Court is confident that such answers would

sufficiently cater to the questions of law in the instant case.

In the background of the foregoing reasoning, this Court answers the

questions of law formulated for the opinion of this Court as follows.

Opinion provided by this Court in respect of question No. 06

Issuing the impugned notices of assessment under TIN NO. 134003642 by

the Assessor Mr. A A Dayaratne, which has been generated through a

computer, is a ministerial act.

Opinion provided by this Court in respect of question No. 03.

Duly served notice of Assessment, which was printed and issued by the

computer, without signature of issuing officer, could be an error covered by

section 61 of Value Added Tax Act, No 14 of 2002. However, it depends on

..

30

the facts of each case. In the light of the facts of the instant case, it is an

error covered by section 61 of the Act.

Opinion provided by this Court in respect of questions No. 01, 02, 04 & 05.

It depends on the facts of each case.

Opinion provided by this Court in respect of question No. 07.

,'Noncompliance of the requirement under section 60 of Value Added Tax Act

No. 14 of 2002, for the name of the Commissioner General, Deputy

Commissioner or Assessor to be duly printed on such notice or be signed

thereon, in the circumstances of this case cannot be held to be fatal to the

validity of the said notices of assessment both in terms of the provision of

section 61 of the Act and also in terms of provisions of the Electronic

Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006.

Further, this Court is of the opinion that the question whether non-

compliance of section 60 (1) is fatal to the validity of the notice of

assessment would depend on the facts of each case.

Therefore, it is the view of this Court that any mere noncompliance of that

section cannot by itself give rise to a patent lack of jurisdiction as has been

.. a

31

erroneously decided by the Tax Appeals Commission. It is the view of this

Court that the question whether such non-compliance gives rise to a patent

lack of jurisdiction or not, would depend on the other circumstances as well.

For the foregoing reasons, it is the considered view of this court that the Tax

Appeals Commission has erred when it decided to annul the notices of

assessment relevant to this case on the basis it had set out in its

'determination.

This Court directs that this case be remitted to the Tax Appeals Commission

with the above opinions of this Court.
