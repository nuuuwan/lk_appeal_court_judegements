JUDGMENT

P Pad man Surasena J

When these cases were taken up for argument on 2018-03-15 learned

counsel for all the parties agreed that the issues to be decided by this court

in respect of the cases namely,

C A (Writ) No. 266/ 2013,

C A (Writ) No. 267 / 2013,

4

are the same. Hence, they agreed that it would suffice for this Court to

pronounce one judgment in respect of both the above cases. Hence, this

judgment must apply to both the cases referred to above.

The permit dated 1952-10-10 produced marked P 1 with the Petition, had

been issue to the Petitioner's father Rathnayake Mudiyanselage Heen Banda,

who had nominated his wife Basnayake Mudiyanselage Gedara Muthumanika

(who is also the Petitioners mother) as the successor to the said land.

Subsequently, said Rathnayake Mudiyanselage Heen Banda was granted two

distinct land grants in terms of the provisions of the Land Development

Ordinance. They have been produced marked P 2 and P 3.

The Petitioner stated that he was born on 1950-11-19 at which time his

parents were not married. However, it is his position that his parents have

registered their marriage according to the Kandyan Law on 1954-06-22. The

said certificate of marriage has been produced marked P 4. The said

Rathnayake Mudiyanselage Heen Banda has passed away on 1989-06-18

and his wife Muthumanika has passed away on 1999-11-02 leaving behind

11 children.

The Petitioner had written a letter dated 1991-03-07 requesting the

Mahaweli Authority to take steps to transfer the rights under the said

grants to him on the basis that he is the eldest son in the family. The

Mahaweli Authority had not acted on the request of the Petitioner on the

basis that the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents namely Surangani Kumarihamy,

Chandralatha Kumarihamy and Leelawathie Kumarihamy who are

Petitioner's sisters had stood nominated as successors by virtue of the

document produced marked P 8. The said nomination has been registered

on 1989-07-25. That is on a date after the death of the holder of the

original grant.

It is the position of the Petitioner that the said nomination is contrary to law

and therefore it is the submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioner

that this Court must act as if the father of the Petitioner had not nominated

any person as the successor to the said land in the said grant marked P 3.

It is on that basis that the Petitioner asserts that he is entitled to succeed

to this land in terms of section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance on

the basis that no person has validly been nominated as the successor of

6

this land and hence the person to succeed has to be decided in terms of

the provisions set out in the 3rd schedule of the Land Development

Ordinance.

Petitioner had instituted an action in the District Court of Polonnaruwa in

respect of the same cause of action. That is to agitate his right to succeed

to the said land against the said rights of the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents.

Learned District Judge of Polonnaruwa on 2009-05-19 had dismissed the

Petitioner's action.

Being aggrieved by the said judgement of the learned District Judge of

Polonnaruwa, the Petitioner has appealed to the Provincial High Court of

North Central Province holden in Anuradhapura challenging the said District

Court judgement. Provincial High Court had delivered its judgement on

2011-12-07 dismissing the Petitioner's appeal and affirming the judgement

of the learned District Judge of Polonnaruwa.

Being aggrieved by the said judgement of the Provincial High Court, the

Petitioner had filed in the Supreme Court, a leave to appeal application

against the said Provincial High Court judgement. The Supreme Court by

its order dated 2013-06-20 had refused to grant leave to proceed and

7

dismissed the Petitioner's application. It is thereafter that the Petitioner has

filed this application on 2013-09-03.

Learned Counsel for the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents had raised the issue

of delay on the part of the Petitioner in filing this application alleging that

the Petitioner has waived his rights for nearly 12 years from 1988 by

sleeping over his rights and thereafter wasting time by going to wrong

forum all of which cumulatively has caused an aggregate of 21 years of

delay after executing the document of P 8.

The Petitioner has only prayed for a writ of Certiorari to quash the

nomination in P 8. This Court observes that the Petitioner for the reasons

best known to him, has not prayed for a writ of mandamus to compel the

authorities either to recognize him as the successor or at its least to

conduct an inquiry to decide that issue.

The Petitioner has not explained the delay except describing the steps he

had taken to go to wrong forum.

It is to be noted that the nomination had been made by the Petitioner's

father before his death. It is just that the relevant officials had not taken

steps to have it registered immediately. The responsibility to ensure the

8

due registration of the nomination is with the public authority. Due to the

lapses on the part of the public authority, the said nomination has been

registered after demise of the Petitioner's father.

This Court is also of the view that the Petitioner has not been able to

explain to the satisfaction of this Court as to why he waited for so long to

challenge what he has now opted to challenge in this Court. Existence of

an inordinate delay in this case is therefore clearly a fact established, which

this Court is compelled to consider against the Petitioner.

It is relevant for this Court to note at this stage that the Supreme Court in

the case of Mallehe Vidaneralalage Don Dayaratne Vs Divisional Secretary

of Thamankaduwa, Polonnaruwa and four others! has stressed the

importance of giving effect to the wish of the deceased holder. The

Supreme Court has also referred to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in

Piyasena Vs Wijesinghe and others2 where the Court of Appeal has also

taken the same view that the intention of the permit holder should be

given effect to.

The jurisdiction to issue writs in the nature of certiorari and Mandamus

which is vested in this Court by virtue of Article 140 of the constitution is a

jurisdiction, which this Court could decide in its discretion to exercise in a

fit case. This Court is of the view that this is not such fit case in which it

should exercise writ jurisdiction. For the foregoing reasons, this Court

decides to refuse both the above-mentioned applications.

Thus, both applications namely C A (Writ) No. 266/ 2013, C A (Writ) No.

267 / 2013, must stand dismissed without costs.
