This appeal relates to an action filed by the plaintiff-

appellant against the 1st and 2nd defendant-respondents by plaint

filed in the District Court of Matughama dated 5th February1988.

The position of the Plaintiff is that the property in suit, that is Lot

No. 1 of land called Mahawatta was sold to the 1 st defendant in

1986 for Rs.60,000/= due to a monetary constraint he had at that

I time. Plaintiff further states that he did not know the real value of I

the land at the time of the sale. Further he avers that he has 1

offered Rs. 75,000/= to the 1st defendant to buy back the property

he had sold to the 1 st defendant.

The plaintiffs position is that the 1 st defendant transferred

half of the land to him on a deed executed by D.J.P.Thilakarathne

Bearing N01131 dated 21.05.1987 for Rs. 75,000/=. This transfer

had been made in name of the one Chandrarathna, the brother in

law of the plaintiff. Subsequently it is alleged that the 1 st

defendant requested a further Rs.60,000/= to recover the

remaining half of the land in suit. When there was no agreement

to this offer it is further alleged that the 1 st defendant had

transferred the remaining half of the land to the 2nd defendant by

Deed No.1199 dated 12.10.1987 attested by the same Notary who

executed the deed No.1199 dated 12.10.1987 attested by the same

Notary who executed the earlier deed relating to the conveyed half

of the property. Plaintiff states that the 1st defendant acted in

collusion with the 2nd defendant who is a relative of the 1 st

defendant.

The 1st defendant answering the plaint on 31.05.1991 brings

to the notice of the Court the following factors.

The plaintiff has framed 7 issues, 1st defendant 5 issues and

2nd defendant 4 issues respectively. (Vide judgment Page 215). The

trial proceeded thereon. District Judge of Matugama in judgment

dated 16.04.1996 dismissed the plaintiffs claim as he had filed to

adduce evidence in his favor to invoke the principle of laesio

enormls.

The main issue to be consider in this appeal is whether the

principle of laesio enormis has been proved the plaintiff appellants.

Plaintiff and the assessor Edward F Wijeratna had given evidence

and marked documents P1-P4. The first defendant had given

evidence and the 2nd defendant had only marked documents V 1-

V6.

The learned District Judge in analyzing evidence of the

assessor, Wijeratna had noted (Vide Page.216) that the value

arrived at by the said assessor was on the basis of another land

called Clarancil Estate which is situated about 2-3 miles away

from the land in suit. Therefore the valued arrived at by the

assessor was of no relevance to the case in point. The District

iJudge has totally disbelieved the evidence of the said assessor and l tI

!

7

had rejected his valuation (vide page 216 2nd par last line

(Emphasis mine)

It is to be noted that the burden of proving the said principle

of laesio enormis, lies with the party who asserts the said right.

Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance, illustration (b) is very clear

on this aspect of the substantive law. Further this Court in the

case of K.Podimenika Vs. Piyadasa rCA No. 99/93 r F) D. C.

Avissawlla case No.170S4/L decided on 1.11.2000 opined that,

when the pela of laesio enormis is raised, the burden is on the

person claiming the benefit of the doctrine to prove the value of the

thing in question. Weeramanthrie Law of Contracts Page 335-

Norman, Purchase & Sale 2nd ed. Page 576.

Learned District Judge further had observed that he is not in

a position to accept the assertion that plaintiff was unaware of the

real value of the property when he executed the deed in question.

The plaintiff has admitted in evidence that he is a business man

who had transactions with banks and in cross examination he had

admitted that at the time of the sale he was aware that the value of

the property was Rs.I00,OOO/=. On the basis of the evidence of

8

the plaintiff the learned District Judge has come to the conclusion

that the plaintiff cannot invoke the principle of leasio enormis.

Therefore this Court refuses to interfere with his aspect of the

plaintiffs case.

The mrun contention of the plaintiff is that the principle of

leasio enormlS lies for his benefit. In order to substantiate this

argument the plaintiff appellant has cited Jayawardena Vs.

Amarasekera 15 NLR 280, Bodiga Vs. Nagoor 45 NLR 1. Roman

Dutch Authorities such a Wessels Law on Contract and professor

Weeramantry Law of Contract Volume 1.

In Jayawardena Vs. Amarasekera , Supra, Lascelles C,J. Had

held that:

"a person who knows the value of his property is not

entitled to recession of the sale merely by reason of the

fact that the price at which he had sold the property is

less than half its true value ..... "

It will be seen that the principle of unjust enrichment has

been n1.entioned in the plaint no issue has been framed in this

respect.

In a recent judglnent the Supreme Court In Appeal

No.4/2012 decided 30.05.2016 bench compnslng of

Wanasundara J., Sisir de Abrew,.J. and Anil Goonerathna J. In

which Anil Goonerathna, J. delivered the judgment of Court, In

which the principle of laesio enormis has been gone in to and I . I

had conch.;tded with an eq.ldite explanation ~f the said pripciple in

Explanation of Principle.

I i

I, I I I I

Though the civil law p~rmits the parties to make as good a : .1 ,- : '.. . ; !

bargain as they can, yet it state~ that g~oss inequality between the i i , I

price which has been paid and the true value of an article implies

I " I I

so~ething in the nature of .fraud of u~d~e influence, and on that : I :, I ' 1 " I " ,"

account allows th~ one party orl his heirs to c~ll upon the other

either to rescind the contract and retuL1. the purchase money o:r

the prope~t~y sold as the case may be) or to correct the price by

10

paying a just value for the article. This inequality between the

value of the thing and the price paid is termed laesio enormis.

A contract may be avoided by Court on the ground of laesio

enormis either when the purchaser pays more than double the

true value of the thing or the vendor sells the thing for less than

half its value. The person sued has the option of restoring the thin

or paying what is wanting to make up the just price. Where the

consideration is less than half ( or more than twice the true value

of the property. The sale is voidable on the ground of laesio

enormls unless there is come special consideration present in the

case which bars the application of the principle. The difference in

price must exist at the time of the transaction and not thereafter.

The doctrine still obtains in full force and vigour in Ceylon.

Bodiga us. Nagoor 45 NLR1 atpara 335.

Action does not lie, where the aggrieved party was aware, or

ought to have been aware of the true value at the time of making

the contract. Jayawardena us. Amarasekera 15 NLR 280; Sobana

11

Vs. Meera Labee (1940)5 C.L.J.46 .The burden IS on the person

claiming the benefit of the true value.

In the case of Jaywardene Vs. Amarasekera (15 N.L.R. 280). I

would advert to a further position very much relied upon by the

plaintiff. As it was held in Jayawardene Vs. Amarasekera (15

N.L.R 280) a person who knows the value of the property is not

entitled to are rescission of the sale merely by reason of the fact

that the price at which he has sold it, is less than half its true

value. The case is otherwise where the property is sold at a price

grossly disproportionate to its true value. In that case the law is on

the said of the party who stands to lose by the transaction, and not

on the side of the party who stand to make an unconscionable

profit. The annulling of the contract on this heads is not permitted

when the other party is prepared to increase or reduce the price of

the thing to its true value ( V.d I 1. 15.10)

But one has to gather its application only In the

circumstances and facts of the case in hand. Though the above

position had been projected by learned counsel for the plaintiff, as

in Jayawardena Vs. Amarasekera it does not appear to be

J,

conclusive, in answer to above I find that Justice I Fernando

observes in Gunasekra Vs, Amarasekera1993 (1) SLR at 176/177

the matter has not been decided conclusively in the manner as

argued by learned Counsel for plaintiff, for the reasons stated

therein as being obiter dictum. This aspect and matter has not

been decided by Justice Fernando. I will refer to the relevant

portion gathered from Page 176/177.

Learned counsel for the defendant submitted that lasio

normis applied even if the vendor was aware of the true value,

citing Wessells, Law of Contract, 2nd ed., Vo.l2, page 1344, Section

5100.

"There is a considerable dispute amongst the jurists whether

the remedy applies in the case of a person who knows the true

value of the thing, but nevertheless sells it for less than half, or

purchase property knowing that it is only worth half. Voet seems to

consider that in both cases the remedy cannot be invoked ( voet,

18.5 .17) ....

Counsel then sought to rely In the further observation of

Lascelles, C.J., in that case, suggesting that knowledge IS

immaterial where the price is grossly disproportionate to the value,

pointing that knowledge is immaterial where the pnce is grossly

disproportionate to the value, pointing out that this dictum was

cited in Walter Pereira's Law of Ceylon, 2nd ed., (1913), page 657.

However, that appears to be an obiter dictum not supported by the

opinion of any Roman Dutch Jurist; and indeed does not appear in

the first edition of Walter Perera's work, it is also not cited by

Weeramantry, in his discussion of laesio enormis. In Sobana Vs.

Meera Saibo, it was held that the plea of leasio enormis could not

be entertained where, assuming the land to have been worth

Rs.500, the plaintiff knew that fact at the time he sold the land for

Rs. 100. l

\

Although Jayawardena Vs. Amarasekera was cited with

Iapproval, that obiter dictum was not applied. While there appears

to be some substance in the contention that this obiter dictum

does not correctly set out the Roman Dutch Law ( and is possibly

based on misunderstanding of the concluding portion of Voet Ir

~~

18.5.1 7)., the matter need not be decided now in VIew of my

decision on the other questions arising in this case".

In all the facts and circumstances of the case, I find following

important factors from which court has to draw conclusion. The

factors in point from are as follows;

(a) Certain items of evidence had been disbelieved by the trial

Judge, and the apex Court would not interfere as regards the

trial Judge's findings on same.

(b)Validity of document VI is in question.

( c ) plaintiff was well aware of the true value of the property in

dispute ( Emphasis mine)

In these circumstances and in the context of the case in had

I affirm as stated above both judgments of the District Court and

the High Court. This appeal is dismissed without costs.
