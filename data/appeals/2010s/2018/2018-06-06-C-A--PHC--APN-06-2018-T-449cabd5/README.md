ORDER

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The 1st Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes called and referred

to as the 1st Respondent) had filed a charge sheet against two accused on

an allegation that they were transporting timber without a valid permit, an

offence punishable under the provisions of the Forest Ordinance. The said

accused had thereafter pleaded guilty to the charges framed against them.

Learned Magistrate had then convicted and sentenced them.

Thereafter the learned Magistrate had thereafter taken steps to hold an

inquiry to decide the question whether the vehicle (which is lorry bearing

registration No. 47 - 8897) should be confiscated or not.

At the end of the said inquiry learned Magistrate by her order dated 2015-

08-13 had confiscated the said lorry on the basis that the petitioner -

Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the Petitioner)

who is the registered owner of the lorry has failed to satisfy Court that he

had taken all possible steps to prevent this vehicle being used for illegal

activities.

4

Thereafter, the Provincial High Court has also refused the application for

revision filed by the Petitioner on the same basis. Petitioner has filed the

instant application for revision in this Court to challenge the said order of the

Provincial High Court.

Evidence of two witnesses on behalf of the Petitioner including the Petitioner

himself had been recorded before the learned Magistrate. The evidence of

the Petitioner only contains a cursory remark with regard to the fact that he

did not have knowledge of commission of this offence. However, he is silent

on the question whether he had taken any steps as precautionary measures

to prevent the relevant vehicle being used to commit illegal activities.

The second witness called by the Petitioner is an agent of the Central Finance

Company, which is the absolute owner of this lorry. His evidence does not

relate to the question whether the Petitioner has had knowledge about the

commission of this offence or not.

In the case of K Mary Matilda Silva V P H De Silva, Inspector of Police,

Police Station, Habarana1, which is a case under the Animals Act, this Court

took the view that in this type of a situation, giving mere instructions is not

sufficient to discharge the burden cast on the owner of a vehicle. This

Court went on to hold in the said case that the owner of the vehicle must

not only prove that genuine instructions were in fact given, but also took

every endeavor to implement the instructions so given. This Court in that

case had held that the failure to prove the above requirements would

indicate that indeed no genuine instructions had been given.

The burden of proving that the Petitioner did not have knowledge or that he

had taken all precautions is on the Petitioner. Therefore, the Petitioner ,

should prove this fact through evidence to the satisfaction of the Magistrate.

Section 3 of the evidence ordinance has defined the word 'proved'. It is as

follows.

'A fact is said to be proved when, after considering matters before it, the

Court either believes it to exist or considers its existence is so probable that

1 CA (PHC) 86/97 Decided on 2010-07-08

6

a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the case, to act upon the

supposition that it exists.'

Perusal of the evidence adduced on behalf of the Petitioner shows clearly

that a prudent man ought not to have believed that the Petitioner has taken

all precautions to prevent the relevant lorry being put to illegal use.

Further, one must be mindful that in the instant case the Provincial High

Court was called upon to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction. According to

the caption of the revision application filed in the Provincial High Court, it is

under Article 154 P of the Constitution read with the provisions of the High

Courts of provinces (Special provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 that the said

application has been made. '

Section 5 of the High Courts of provinces (Special provisions) Act No. 19 of

1990 has made the provisions of written law applicable to appeals and

revision applications made to Court of Appeal, applicable to such cases filed

in the Provincial High Courts. Thus, chapter XXIX of the Code of Criminal

procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 is applicable to the exercise of revisionary

jurisdiction by the Provincial High Courts as well.

According to section 364 therein, the Court can examine the record of any

case for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any

order passed therein or as to the regularity of the proceedings of such

Court. Thus, three aspects, which a Court could consider in revisionary

proceedings, have been speCified by that section. They are legality,

propriety and regularity.

In the instant case there is no complain about the last aspect i.e. regularity

of the proceedings.

This Court has to agree that there had been no basis for the Provincial

High Court to interfere with the conclusion of the learned Magistrate as the

Court can satisfy itself with the' legality and propriety of the order

pronounced by the learned Magistrate.

It is the view of this Court that the learned Provincial High Court Judge is

correct when he decided to refuse and dismiss the application for revision

filed by the Petitioner.

This Court also observes that the impugned order has been delivered by the

learned Provincial High Court Judge on 2016-06-16. The Petitioner has filed

this application in this Court on 2018-01-12. i.e after a lapse of an year and

8

a half. The Petitioner has not even attempted to explain the said delay. Thus,

the Petitioner is guilty of inordinate delay which affects his application and

calls for dismissal on that ground alone.

In these circumstances, this Court decides not to issue notices on the

Respondents. This Court proceeds to dismiss this application without costs.
