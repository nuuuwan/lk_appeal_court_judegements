Samayawardhena, J.

The two petitioners filed this application seeking (a) a writ of

certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st respondent-Land Reform

Commission to execute the deeds in respect of the land depicted in

Plan No. 2023 marked X11 in the names of the 5th and 6th

respondents; and (b) a writ of mandamus compelling the 1st

respondent to hold a proper inquiry and execute the deed in

respect of the said land in the name of the 1st petitioner. The

respondents have filed objections to this application.

In the first place, in relation to the first relief, no such decision has

been tendered by the petitioners for this Court to quash by way of

certiorari. There has necessarily to be a formal decision or

determination before a writ of certiorari could issue quashing that

decision or determination. As that situation has not yet arisen, the

application is premature. (Amirthalingam v. Priyasekera1)

The 1st and 2nd respondents with their objections have tendered

two documents marked 1R1 and 1R2 to say that full investigation

including field visit was carried out with regard to claims and

complaints of various parties including those of the 1st petitioner

in respect of this land, and the 1st petitioner was even represented

by an Attorney-at-Law at the said inquiry. Notwithstanding the 1st

petitioner now says that her lawyer was not given a proper hearing,

there is no affidavit from the said lawyer to that effect. During this

inquiry it has inter alia been revealed that the 1st petitioner is

living in another plot of land and also rented out a three-storeyed

house apparently put up in a different plot of land-vide paragraph

14 of 1R1. The petitioners may not agree with these findings but

the correctness of these findings cannot be tested before this Court

in exercising writ jurisdiction. (Ekanayake v. People's Bank2,

Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board3)

In any event, 1R1 and 1R2 are not decisions but inquiry notes with

recommendations made to the Chairman-Land Reform

Commission by the Director-Investigations for the former to take

suitable decisions and as such not amenable to certiorari.

(Fernando v. Jayaratne4)

Hence application for certiorari shall fail.

For this Court to issue a writ of mandamus compelling the 1st

respondent to hold a proper inquiry and to execute the deed in the

name of the 1st petitioner, the 1st petitioner shall satisfy this

Court that she has a legal right to the performance of that legal

duty by the 1st respondent. If no such legal right with

corresponding legal duty can be established, no mandamus will lie.

Mandamus is not meant to create a legal right but to restore a

party who has been denied that right. (Mageswaran v. University

Grants Commission5, Perera v. National Housing Development

Authority6, Wannigama v. Incorporated Council of Legal Education7,

Janak Housing (Pvt) Ltd v. UDA8, Credit Information Bureau of Sri

Lanka v. Messrs Jafferriee & Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd9) Insofar as

mandamus is concerned, the 1st petitioner fails at the threshold

level itself as she has unable to show any such legal right in her

favour with the corresponding legal duty cast on the 1st

respondent to perform it. 2 [2005] 2 Sri LR 94 3 [1981] 2 Sri LR 471 4 (1974) 78 NLR 123 5 [2003] 2 Sri LR 282 6 [2001] 2 Sri LR 50 7 [2007] 2 Sri LR 281 8 [2008] 2 Sri LR 302 9 [2005] 1 Sri LR 89

In the counter affidavit the petitioners have inter alia stated that

there was a legitimate expectation that the land would be given to

her. But there are no documents originated from the respondents

making some promise or giving some undertaking that the land

would be given to her. Indecipherable document marked X2

issued at the request of the 1st petitioner for a different purpose

cannot be construed as such.

Hence application for mandamus cannot succeed.

Application of the petitioners is dismissed but without costs.
