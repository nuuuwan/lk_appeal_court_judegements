JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The Petitioner - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Appellant) had instituted this case against the Respondent -

Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Respondent) in the Primary Court of Matale under section 66 (1) (b) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, as a private information,

seeking an order declaring that he be entitled to have the possession of

the impugned property.

Primary Court having inquired into the said dispute by its order dated

2008-06-16, had concluded that the Appellant and the Respondent should

continue to possess the respective premises each one of them had up until

that time been possessing separately.

Subsequently upon an application made by the Respondent, the Primary

Court had ordered enforcement of the said order.1 Accordingly the fiscal of

the Court had handed over to the Respondent the possession of the

portion of the land he is entitled to.

Being aggrieved by the said enforcement the Appellant had moved the

Primary Court to inquire into the said enforcement action. However the

learned Primary Court Judge by his order dated 2008-11-20 refused to

reconsider the said enforcement action.

Perusal of the submission made by the learned counsel who appeared for

the Appellant in the Magistrate's Court shows that he had merely made a

, ' statement from the Bar table that there was prejudice caused to his client

as a result of the enforcement action taken by the fiscal. He had moved

Court to conduct an inquiry into that matter. It could however be seen that

the Appellant had not placed any plausible basis before the Primary Court.

Further he has been silent as to what the learned Primary Court Judge

should do to redress his grievance.

Perusal of the order of the learned Primary Court Judge dated 2008-11-20

shows that an assistance of a surveyor also had been obtained to identify

the boundaries.

Perusal of the order of the learned Provincial High Court Judge also shows

that the Appellant had been present at the time of the impugned

enforcement action although he had not made any protest to the

enforcement. It is on that basis that the learned Provincial High Court

Judge had refused the revision application.

The learned counsel for the Appellant in the course of the submissions was

not able to satisfy this court that any basis exists for this Court to intervene

in this case. Further there is no basis for this Court to infer that there has

been any illegality, impropriety or irregularity in the proceedings. Such

basis is necessary to warrant the intervention of the Provincial High Court

exercising its revisionary powers. This court has to be mindful that the

proceedings had before the Provincial High Court was revisionary

proceedings and not appellate proceedings.

After the argument was concluded learned counsel for the Appellant has

undertaken to file further written submissions if necessary. However he has

not filed any written submissions thereafter. Respondent has however filed

his written submissions.

Learned Provincial High Court Judge had taken the view that there is no

exceptional circumstance to warrant his intervention.

It is the observation of this Court that the orders made under part VII of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act No,44 of 1979 are temporarily orders

which are issued pending final determination of the relevant dispute by a

competent civil court. This is specifically mentioned in section 74 of the

said Act.

As has been held in the case of Punchi Nona V Padumasena and others2

the Primary Court exercising special jurisdiction under section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act, is not involved in an investigation into title

or the right to possession, which is the function of a civil Court. What the

Primary Court is required to do is to take a preventive action and make a

provisional order pending final adjudication of rights of the parties in a civil

Court.

It is always open for the Parties to go before the District Court to have

their respective rights adjudicated in civil proceedings. Therefore, this

Court is of the view that it would not be necessary to make any order with

regard to the Appellant's complain. For the above reasons this Court

decides to dismiss this appeal without costs.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
