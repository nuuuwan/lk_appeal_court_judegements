Counsel appearIng for the Respondents have raised

preliminary objections to the said application on the basis of

suppression and misrepresentation of material facts and the

transaction been commercial in nature.

The Counsel for the Respondents has drawn attention to

paragraphs 9, 27 and 29 of the petition where the 1st petitioner

states that he is a shareholder of St. Anthonys Kandy, Siri

Import Export (Pvt.) Limited. However we find that in document

marked P7 the said 1 st Respondent has signed as a Director of

the said company.

We also refer to paragraph 25 of the petition therein the

petitioner has stated that he has been reliably informed that his

property to be auctioned was published In the gazette

notification dated 2017.10.27. Therefore the Petitioner was

clearly on notice regarding the auction of his property and to

seek relief from the appropriate jurisdiction.

This Court will not permit the Petitioners to make cross

applications whereby the Petitioners would be abusing the

judicial process. It is within the discretion of the Court to refuse

to Issue writ if it is perceived that the Petitioners have an

adequate and appropriate remedy to address the relief prayed

for.

It IS also noted that the Petitioners as stated above has

clearly suppressed and or misrepresented material facts averred

to in this petition.

In the circumstance we refuse notice and dismiss the said

petition in limine. We order no costs.
