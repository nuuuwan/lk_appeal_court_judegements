Not only does it fail to provide substantive protection for the victim spouse, it also supplies the guilty party with advantageous gain by such person's wrongful act. This anomaly militates against the principles of justice and equity as well as thefundamental principle of legal jurisprudence that no man or woman can benefit from his or her own wrong. It is imperative that the law commission of Sri Lanka, in its review of marriage law in Sri Lanka, takes account of this anomalous situation and undertakes effective steps to rectify the same at the earliest, in order to avoid afurther miscarriage of justice.\"",

However, such powers would be exercised only in exceptional circumstances where an appeal lay and as to what such exceptional circumstances are is dependent on the facts of each case\". 3. Attorney General Vs Podisingho (51 NLR 385), it was held that, \"1 desire to point out that in exercising its powers of revision, this court is not trammeled by technical rules of pleading and procedure. In doing so, this court has power to act whether it is set in motion by a party or not, and even ex meromotu. Judge of this court has power to call for a record and in proper cases to revise the order of a court of inferior jurisdiction. In doing so, of course, this court w~ll act on the principles laid down by learned judges in the past. Whethel: the application in revision is irregularly brought before this court or not, once an irregularity has 'come to the knowledge' of this court, it can in a proper case act on such knowledge. 1 cannot agree with the submission of learned counsel for respondent that 'the law was made for man and not man for the law'. If that means anything, learned counsel would have this court to stand by powerless, while illegal orders are made by Magistrates and District Judges. That is a proportion to which 1 am unable to assent\".",

Such an application should be preceded in a maintenance matter by first having recourse to the High Court itself in seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court and could apply to the Supreme Court only on a refusal of such application.
