ACJ::-IALA WENGAPPULI, I.

TIle accused-appellant was charged with murder of Henegedara

lv1unasinhe on 15th July 1995. After trial, he was convicted as charged :1nd

sentenced to death. At the hearing of his appeal and in challenging the

said conviction and sentence, the accused-appellant sought to challenge its

validity on the following grounds;

1. the trial Court has failed to consider le[ser culpability based

on knowledge,

ii. the trial Court has erroneously considered the contents of a

statement made by PW 4; "

111. the trial Court has failed to adopt the evidence led before his

predecessors and thereby failed to comply with Section 48 of

the Judicature Act No.2 of 1979 as amended.

The prosecution is primarily based on the evidence of Asilin, the

wife of the deceased. In addition, it led evidence of Sarath, another lay

witness, a Consultant Judicial Medical Officer and the Police officers who

investigated and arrested the accused-appellant.

In her evidence, Asilin stated to Court that her husband was stabbed

on his chest by the accused-appellant in the night at about 8.00/8.30 p.m.

The accused-appellant is one of their neighbours. On the previous day,

Cattle belonged to the accused-appellant has damaged their cultivation of

gherkin. Upon a complaint, Grama Niladhari has directed the accused-

appellant to pay Rs. 600.00 as damages (.md get his cattle released. The

2

accused-appellant paid Rs. 600.00 to the deceased at the Grama Niladhari's

office and undertook to come to take his cattle in the night. The reason to

come in the night was the torch of the accused-appellant was dead and he

was waiting for the moon to come up.

As promised, just before the incident Sarath and another came to the

deceased's house with the instructions of the accused-appellant to get the

cattle released. Then the deceased accompanied by Asilin went over to

open up kadulla enabling the two men to take the cattle. At that juncture,

the accused-appellant who was hiding under the shade of a Domba tree,

I, has stabbed the deceased once on his chest with a knife. She raised cries

accusing the accused-appellant for stabbing of her husband. Thereafter, the

deceased fell on the ground having lost consciousness while accused-

appellant ran towards his house. She made a statement to Police three days

later, once her husband's funeral was over.

At the time of the trial, the medical officer who performed the post

mortem examination on the body of the deceased could not be located and

his report was tendered through the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer.

The expert witness, having described the only external injury as a stab

injury, proceeded to explain the corresponding internal injury. According

to his evidence, the stab inj ury has penetrated through the 3rd and 4th ribs

and made a 20-mm cut on the left lung, before making another 20-mm cut

on the pulmonary artery after damaging the pericardium. The cause of

death was attributed to hypovolaemic shock due to cut injury to the

3

pulmonary artery. The Consultant JMO in his evidence stated that

pulmonary artery is equated to aorta in importance and when it is

damaged by 20-mm long cut injury, substantial amounts of blood could be

lost in an instant and such a large loss of blood leads to shock, which in

turn results in death in a short int~rval of time.

The Police evidence revealed that the accused-appellant has

surrendered to Wilgamuwa Police post with a knife on the same night after

11.00 pm. He was arrested for the murder of the deceased and later

handed over to Laggala Police station for further investigations.

I,

In relation to the 1st ground of appeal of the accused-appellant, the

trial Court has failed to consider lesser culpability based on knowledge. It

was submitted that there was only one stab injury to the deceased and

therefore it negates any murderous intention on the part of the accused-

uppellant and only supports a proposition that he only had knowledge.

Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant then contended that the

learned trial Judge has failed to consider this aspect before he found his

client guilty for murder.

With this argument, the accused-appellant sought to negate the

presence of the required mental element as contained in the 1st to 3rd limbs

of Section 294 of the Penal Code. This argument has already been

considered by this Court in Farook v Attorney General (2006) 3 Sri L.R. 174

4

where there was only one stab injury resulted in death of the deceased. In

this judgment, Basnayake J quoted the judgment of the Supreme Court of

India in Rajwant Singh v State of Kerala AIR 1966 SC 1874, where it was

held in relation to parallel provisions in the Indian Penal Code as to limb 2

of Section 294 of our Penal Code;

"The second clause deals with acts done with the intention of

causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to

cause the death of the person to whom harm is caused. The

mental attitude here is twofold. There is first the intention to

cause bodily harm and next there is the subjective knowledge

that death will be the likily .consequence of the intended

injury ... The mental attitude is thus made of two elements (a)

causing an intentional injury and (b) which injury the offender

has the foresight to know would cause death. "

It is correct that the single stab injury was not labelled as <1

necessarily fatal injury by the Consultant JMO. But his evidence clearly

supports that the 20-mm cut injury to pulmonary artery results in quick

loss of considerable volume of blood and results in shock, due to that

blood loss. The reference to substantial loss of blood in "very short" time

and the nature, location, size and result of the injury clearly satisfies the

characteristics of a necessarily fatal injury. This approach was adopted by

this Court in Chandrasena v Attorney General (2008) 2 Sri L.R. 255.

5

The accused-appellant caused the injury by stabbing the deceased on

his chest. The accused, with his act, has then satisfied the first part as per

the Supreme Court judgment by "causing an intentional injury". The second

part of the 2nd limb as identified by the Supreme Court, namely ,"which

injury the offender has the foresight to know would cause death" should be

decided upon subjective knowledge of the accused-appellant.

When one stabs deep into another's chest with a knife in between the

ribs, right above the heart, then it could safely be inferred that the one who

stabs knows that the injury caused l?Y him would cause death.

I,

In delivering the judgment of Vithana and Another v Republic of Sri Lanka

(2007) 1 Sri L.R. 170, De Abrew J held;

"In my view an accused person charged with murder cannot

claim, when the victim has succumbed to the injury which is

sufficient, in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, that

he did not intended to cause the death of the victim but only

intended to inflict bodily injury and that he should be

exonerated from the charge of murder.

In view of these considerations, it is our view that the 1st ground of

appeal fails as it is devoid of merit.

The accused-appellant's 2nd ground of appeal relates to the

complaint that the trial Court has erroneously considered the contents of a

statement made by PW4. Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant

6

relied on the wording used by the learned High Court Judge in the

judgment to impress upon this point. However, upon examination as to

the way in which the learned High Court Judge has described how he

reached his conclusion, it is apparent he was merely aided by the contents

of the statement to properly evalua~e the inconsistency fought to be

proved against the witness for the prosecution. The inconsistency was in

relation to who asked the deceased to open Kadulla that night. He has

relied or, thE evidence placed before him as substantive evidence and not

what the witness stated in his statement to Police and compared it with

what i.nother witness has testified on the point. Even if he has used the

contents of the statement, it caused'no,prejudice to the accused-appellant

as it is in relation to an ancillary point and not in relation to an element of

the offence or to his identity. This ground of appeal also accordingly fails.

Thirdly, the accused-appellant complained that the trial Court has

failed to adopt the evidence led before his predecessors and thereby failed

to comply with Section 48 of the Judicature Act No.2 of 1979 as amended.

Le<:.med Counsel for the accused-appellant relied on the judgments of

Bandula v Attorney GEneral C.A. 122/2006 decided on 09.10.2014,

Thiyagarajah v Attorney General C.A. 216/2010 decided on 27.11.2014,

Nishantha and Chandrakumara v Attorney General C.A. 96/2010 decided

on 05.12.2014 and Ratnayake v Attorney General (2004) 1 Sri L.R. 390 to

impress upon this Court that failure to adopt the evidence led before his

predecessors is sufficient to vitiate a conviction entered against an accused.

7

Upon perusal of the proceedings, it is clear that the learned High

Court Judge who convicted the accused-appellant decided to adopt the

evidence already recorded by his predecessors on 17.09.2014 and obtained

the signature of accused-appellant to denote that he consented for such an

acoption of proceedings. The accused-appellant was represented by an

Attorney-at-Law.

The judgments relied upon by the accused-appellant do not support

the view that in every instance the succeeding Judge should recall the

already concluded witnesses and ~ecord their evidence afresh as an

inflexible rule. Instead, their Lordships have opted to leave it to the

discretion of the trial Judge.

It is correct that "this case was taken before 7 Judges and evidence

taken before 3 High Court Judges" as the accused-appellant submits, but

the learned trial Judge when he decided to adopt the already led evidence,

he has exercised the discretion vested in him reasonably. The trial is in

relation to an incident which took place in 1995. The first witness was

called before the High Court only in May 2006, after 11 years. Then after

series of adjournments before different Judges, the trial Judge who finally

convicted the accused-appellant took over the proceedings in September

2014. Only the evidence of Consultant JMO and the Registrar have been

led before him. The judgment is dated 23.02.2016. Considering the

circumstances under which he has exercised discretion vested in him

under Section 48 of the Judicature Act, we are of the view that he has

8

adopted a pragmatic approach and decided to proceed with the trial by

exercising his discretion fairly and reasonably. Therefore, the 3rd ground of

appeal also fails.

Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence imposed on the

accused -appellant.

The appeal of the accused-appellant is hereby dismissed.
