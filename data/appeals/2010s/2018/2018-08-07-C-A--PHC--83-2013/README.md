This is an appeal against the judgement of the learned High Court Judge of the North Central

Province holden in Anuradhapura dated 28.05.2013.

The Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant) was at all material times a western music teacher at st.

Josephs College, Anuradhapura. Upon a complaint made by a student, who will be referred to as

"student X" in this judgement, and his mother that the Appellant subjected student X to child

abuse, criminal proceedings were begun against the Appellant. Thereafter the Hon. Attorney

General indicted the Appellant before the High Court of Anuradhapura under section 365B(2){a)

of the Penal Code with an alternative count under section 365A of the Penal Code.

During the pendency of the criminal case, disciplinary proceedings were begun against the

Appellant in terms of the Establishments Code-{E-Code) which resulted in a charge sheet dated ,

11.07.2001 been served on the Appellant.

The Appellant was convicted by the High Court of Anuradhapura on 02.10.2007. He appealed to

the Court of Appeal which on 02.12.2009 set aside the conviction and sentence and acquitted

the Appellant on the basis that the Court is unable to accept the prosecution story as a true story

and therefore the prosecution has not established the charge beyond reasonable doubt.

The disciplinary proceedings against the Appellant concluded on 16.08.2002 and by letter dated

31.03.2003 he was informed that he had been found guilty of the 1 S\ 2nd, 5th and 7th charges and

was therefore dismissed from service. The Appellant appealed to the Provincial Public Service

Commission on 02.05.2003 and after nearly seven and half years the Provincial Public Service

Commission by letter dated 04.11.2010 rejected the appeal.

The Appellant appealed to the Hon. Governor of the North Central Province. The Appellant was

informed by letter dated 15.12.2010 that the Hon. Governor had rejected his appeal.

The Appellant then filed the above action in the High Court of the North Central Province holden

in Anuradhapura and sought, inter alia, the following relief:

(a) A writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the Hon. Governor;

(b) A writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the Provincial Public Service Commission

(c) A writ of mandamus directing the pt and/or 2nd to 5th and/or 6th Respondent to reinstate

the Appellant with back wages and other benefits entitled to him.

The learned High Court Judge dismissed the application and hence this appeal by the Appellant.

The learned High Court Judge dismissed the application on the following grounds:

(a) The High Court did not have jurisdiction in view of Article 61A of the Constitution

(b) The E-Code allowed for diSCiplinary proceedings to be held and concluded despite

criminal proceedings pending before a court of law

(c) Since there was a right of appeal to the Hon. Governor the decisions by the Provincial

Public Service Commission marked P. 2 and P. 9 cannot be quashed in the first instance

by writs of certiorari

I am doubtful whether the ouster in Article 61A of the Constitution applies to decision of a

Provincial Public Service Commission. However, I wish to reserve my opinion on that issue to be

determined in a fit and proper case in the future after having the benefit of a full and

comprehensive argument on that issue.

Even if the learned High Court Judge was wrong in his conclusions on this issue, Article 138 of the

Constitution states that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on

account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties

or occasioned a failure of justice. The learned High Court Judge refused relief to the Appellant after

considering the whole case and this Court must therefore see whether the Appellant is entitled to the

relief claimed upon a consideration of the merits of case.

Page 7 of 11

The Appellant appears to take the position that since he was acquitted of the criminal charges by

the Court of Appeal, the findings of the disciplinary inquiry cannot be sustained. I am unable to

agree with this position for several reasons.

The burden of proof in the two proceedings are different as the charges under the Penal Code in

the High Court has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt whereas the charges in the disciplinary

proceedings must be proved on a balance of probability.

Chapter XLVIII: sections 27:11 of the Establishments Code (E-Code) indicates that there is no

barrier to a departmental inquiry being conducted against a public officer whilst criminal

proceedings are in progress against that public officer for an offence which falls under the E-

Code. The section states that the Disciplinary Authority should hold a disciplinary inquiry

independent of the court proceedings in pro~ress and should only suspend or postpone the

inquiry for compelling reasons and unavoidable obstacles.

The fact that both proceedings can be done in parallel is further supported by section 27:6 of the

E-Code. This section requires the Head of Department or a staff officer to retain certified copies

of any documents that are handed over to relevant authorities for legal proceedings, if those

documents may become necessary for a disciplinary inquiry against the accused public officer.

The retention of certified copies for the disciplinary inquiry is thus mandated because the original

documents will be in the custody of courts in a parallel court proceeding.

Further, section 27:12 of the E-Code states that court proceedings in progress will not inhibit a

disciplinary order being made at the end of the disciplinary inquiry. Section 27:13 of the E-Code

states that a court order being made against the public officer should not inhibit the disciplinary

inquiry if it is still in progress and that it should be concluded and an appropriate disciplinary

order made unless there are unavoidable obstacles to the continuation of the disciplinary inquiry.

These sections reinforce the proposition that both proceedings can be conducted in parallel.

Page 8 of 11

The qlJestion whether parallel proceedings could be conducted when both proceedings deal with

the same charges/offences is also answered in the affirmative by the E-Code. Section 27:11 of

the E-Code requires the relevant disciplinary authority to hold an independent disciplinary

inquiry even where court proceedings for an offence which falls within the Code are in progress.

Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that the disciplinary authority can normally inquire

into the offence that is already before court in addition to other relevant offences. This

conclusion is strengthened when one considers section 27:15 of the E-Code. The section

envisages departmental inquiries and court proceedings being held 'with regard to a charge or a

series of charges' and states that the fact that the officer is acquitted in the Court proceedings

should in no way affect the implementing of the disciplinary order made on the matters

revealed in the departmental disciplinary inquiry.

Similarly, section 27:14 of the E-Code states that,a public officer who has been acquitted of a

charge or series of charges at a departmental inquiry but found guilty of the same charges at a

Court of law, could still be dealt with in terms of the E-Code. Therefore, the provisions of the E-

Code make it very clear that parallel proceedings can be conducted against a public officer even

in relation to the same charge/offence.

Section 28:6 of the E-Code unequivocally states that the fact that an officer has been acquitted

or discharged or found not guilty by a Court of law is no reasons at all why he should not be dealt

with under the E-Code, if there is sufficient material on which disciplinary proceedings can be

taken against him.

Accordingly, I am of the view that the acquittal of the Appellant in the criminal case does not in

any way prevent the disciplinary order been implemented. I came to a similar conclusion in

Jayalath Pedige Prema Jayantha v. Secretary, Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council and others

[CA(PHC) 182/2008; C.A.M. 29.06.2018].

The Appellant contended that the Provincial Public Service Commission and the Hon. Governor

have failed to give reasons for rejecting the appeals of the Appellant and that was a ground for

the issuing of writs of certiorari as prayed for by the Appellant. In Hapuarachchi and others v.

Commissioner of Elections and another [(2009) 1 SrLloR. 1 at page 11] Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake

J. (as she was then) held:

"Accordingly, an analysis of the attitude of the Courts since the beginning of the 20th

century clearly indicates that despite the fact that there is no general duty to give reasons

for administrative decisions, the Courts have regarded the issue in question as a matter

affecting the concept of procedural fairness. Reasons for an administrative decision are

essential to correct any errors and thereby to ensure that a person, who had suffered due

to an unfair decision, is treated according to the standard of fairness. In such a situation

without a statement from the person, who.gave the impugned decision or the order, the

decision process would be flawed and the decision would create doubts in the minds of

the aggrieved person as well of the others, who would try to assess the validity of the

decision. Considering the present process in procedural fairness vis-a-vis, right of the

people, there is no doubt that a statement of reasons for an administrative decision is a

necessary requirement."

The Provincial Public Service Commission and the Hon. Governor have in eo. 9 and @o .. 10 stated

that the appeals are rejected as the Appellant has failed to adduce acceptable grounds to cancel

it. This in my view is sufficient compliance with the duty to give reasons.

In any event, the disciplinary inquiry findings against the Appellant point to grave misconduct on

the part of the Appellant which is unbecoming of a teacher. A child is entrusted to the custody of

a teacher with the full confidence that he will be well cared for and looked after. The Appellant

has breached fundamental norms governing the conduct of a teacher. That itself is a ground to

deny him any relief.

Page 10 of 11

In Selvamani v. Dr. Kumaravelupillai and others [(2005) 2 SrLL.R. 99] Sisira De Abrew J. held:

"A person who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of certiorari is not

entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even

if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a discretion to deny him relief having regard to

his conduct, delay, laches, waiver submission to jurisdiction are all valid impediments,

which stand against the grant of relief."

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgement of the learned High

Court Judge of the North Central Province holden in Anuradhapura dated 28.05.2013.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.

The parties agreed to be bound by the judgement given in this case in the revision application

bearing Case No. CA(PHC)APN 91/2013.
