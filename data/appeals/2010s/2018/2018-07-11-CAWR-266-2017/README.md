Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

With the permission of this Court the learned Senor State Counsel has

tendered by way of a motion dated 25th May 2018 (with copy to the

Petitioner) documents marked (Rl' - (Rlla' while the Petitioner has

tendered by way of a motion a document marked (P22'.

The Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia the following

relief:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the 'Quit Notice' dated 28th January

2016 annexed to the petition, marked (Pl,l.

(b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the (Quit Notice' dated 2nd February

2016 annexed to the petition, marked 'P2'.

1 The Quit Notice has been issued under Section 3(2) of the State Lands(Recovery of

Possession) Act NO.7 of 1979 2

1 (c) An interim order to stay further proceedings in Magistrate's Court

of Mullaitivu Case No. 16603.2

The Petitioner claims that his father, Vadivel Kurusamy. was in

occupation of a land identified as Lot 46A situated in Udayar Kaddu

North, Puthukuddirippu, in extent of 10 acres. 3 There is no dispute that

the said land is State land. According to the Petitioner, his father had

planted coconut and teak trees and developed the said land. He claims

that an annual permit had been issued to his father in respect of this

land, for which the Petitioner claims his father had made the necessary

payments. As proof however, only a letter dated 1st November 1970, by

which a cheque for Rs. 60 had been remitted as lease rent, has been

produced.4 The Petitioner has not produced any other documentary

proof in support of his position that his father had been issued an annual

permit, on the basis that the said documents have been misplaced.

After his father's death in 1994, the Petitioner claims that he had been

in occupation of the said land and cultivated it.s The Petiti'oner claims

that he was forced to leave the area in 2005 due to the then prevailing

situation but claims that he returned to the said land in 2015.

2 Case No. 16603 had been filed in the Magistrate's Court of Mullaitivu under the provisions of the State Lands Recovery of Possession Act No. 7 of 1979, as amended, seeking to eject the Petitioner from the land referred to in the Quit Notices marked 'Pl' and 'P2'.

3 The Quit Notices marked 'Pl' and 'P2' have been issued in respect of this land

4 This letter has been annexed to the petition, marked as 'P3' s As proof of cultivation of the said land, the Petitioner has annexed to the petition, letters marked 'PS' issued by the Grama Niladhari, 'P6' issued by the Udayarkaddu North Rural Development Society and 'P7' issued 3

'.

After returning to the land in 2015, the Petitioner had made

representations that an annual permit be issued to him for the said land.

Pursuant to a letter written by the Petitioner to the Minister of Lands,

the Petitioner had been informed by the Ministry of Lands by a letter

dated 9th June 20156 that any issues relating to the said land could be

submitted to the mobile service that was to be held on 13th June 20157

Accordingly, the Petitioner's request for a permit had been considered

by a committee consisting of the then Land Commissioner General, an

Assistant Director of Lands and an Assistant Land Commissioner.

According to the Report of the said committee dated 13th June 20158,

the Petitioner had claimed the said land on the basis that his father had

a permit for the said land. The said Committee, having examined the

claim of the Petitioner had observed that, "there is no evidence to prove

that Ananda Kumar's father has got a permit for this 10 acre land.

Ananda Kumar's father has got another MCC land earlier". The

Committee had thus concluded that the Petitioners "request cannot be

accepted as there is no proof for issuing the permit". Thus, the

Petitioner's request that an annual permit be issued in respect of the

said land had been rejected.

As the 1st Respondent, the Divisional Secretary of Puthukuddirippu was

of the opinion that the Petitioner was in unauthorized occupation of the

said land, the 1st Respondent had served the Petitioner with the notices

6 Annexed to the petition marked 'P10a'

7 A mobile service had been held to resolve issues relating to lands situated in the North

marked 'Pl' and 'P2'1O, under Section 3(1) of the State Lands (Recovery

of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, as amended, to deliver vacant

possession of the said land, on or before 1st March 2016. The Petitioner

failed to comply with the said notices. Case No. 16603 had thereafter

been filed by the 1st Respondent in the Magistrate's Court of Mullaitivull

under Section 5(1) of the said Act for an order of ejectment of the

Petitioner from the said land. 12

After an inquiry where the Petitioner had been afforded an opportunity

of showing cause13, the learned Magistrate by his Order dated 10th

November 201614, had directed the 1st Respondent to eject the

Petitioner from the said land.

The Petitioner had filed a revision application against the said Order in

the Provincial High Court of the Northern Province, holden in Vavuniya.

The said revision application had been refused by the High Court, by its

judgment delivered on 1st August 201715 The Petitioner does not appear

to have filed an appeal against the said judgment of the High Court.

The Petitioner filed this Writ application soon thereafter on 11th August

2017, seeking to quash the said Quit notices marked 'Pl' and 'P2'. The

10 The 'Quit Notice' - vide Section 3(2) of the Act

11 Case No. 16603

12 The Schedule to the application sets out the boundaries of the land as follows:

North - by TOPO PP20 Lot No. 735 - V. Kurusamy; East - by Road; South - by A35 Road; West - by Suthanthipuram Road

13 The Petitioner had filed written objections before the learned Magistrate and submitted the documents that have now been annexed to the petition in this case.

14 Annexed to the petition marked 'P20'

15 A copy of the Judgment of the High Court dated 1st August 2017 has been annexed to the petition, marked as 'P21' 5

'.

Petitioners position is that he has been in possession of the said land

with the written authority of the State and that the said authority has

not been revoked or rendered invalid. The Petitioner further claims that

the said land was to be given to him on a long term lease, as evidenced

by letters marked 'P13' and 'P14'. On this basis, the Petitioner has

contended that the issuing of the said quit notices is arbitrary and has

moved that the said Quit Notices marked 'Pl' and 'P2'be quashed by

Writs of Certiorari.

A perennial problem faced by the State with regard to land owned by

the State has been the encroachment and unlawful occupation and

possession of such lands. The legislature has introduced through the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act a speedy mechanism to eject

persons who were in unauthorized possession and occupation of State

lands.

Section 18 of the Act defines 'unauthorised possession or occupation' as

follows:

"Unauthorised possession or occupation means every form of

possession or occupation except possession or occupation upon a

valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in

accordance with any written law and includes possession or

occupation by encroachment upon State land."

The defences that could be taken up by a person against whom action

has been filed under the Act for ejectment have been set out in Section

9(1) of the Act and reads as follows:

6

"At such inquiry the person on whom summons under section 6 has

been served shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated

in the application under section 5 except that such person may

establish that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a

valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in

accordance with any written law and that such permit or authority is

in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid."

Thus, the defence open to a person on whom a quit notice has been

served or against whom action has been filed for ejectment is limited to

producing a valid permit or a valid authorization in writing of the State,

granted in accordance with any written law, in respect of the said land.

This Court would now proceed to examine the contents of the letters

marked as 'p131 and 'p141 as these two letters form the basis of the

Petitioners case that he has the written authority of the State to occupy

the said land.

'p131 is dated 9th July 2015 and has been sent to the 1st Respondent by

the 2nd Respondent Land Commissioner General.16 'p13' is titled

On the face of it, 'P13' is clearly not a valid permit or written authority of

the State in respect of the sai(J land. Nor is it evidence of a valid permit

or other written authority of the State given to the Petitioner in respect

of the said land. It also appears that the reference to a prior permit is in

respect of another land. However, this Court would consider 'P13' in the

light of 'R7a', which is the response of the 1st Respondent to 'P13,.17

The relevant portions of (R7a' are re-produced below:

tiThe particular land is not a surveyed Government land situated

at Udaiyarkaddu North, Grama Niladhari Division. The

Suthanthirapuram Middle Class Colonization Scheme is starting

from the Northern Side of this land. The Middle Class Colonization

Respondent to the 2nd Respondent in response to 'P13' has been produced by the learned Senior State Counsel, marked 'R7a'. 8

Scheme had been surveyed and divided and issued in 20 acres of

land (Survey Plan No. TOPO PP 20 inset 17)

20 Acres 02 Rood and 08 Perch was granted to V. Gurusamy the

father of the complainant Gurusamy Anton Ananthakumar in this

said Middle Class Land (Lot No. 735, Plan No. TOPOPP 20 inset 17).

Anton Ananthakumar is governing the said 20 acres of Middle

Class Land. But he is claiming rights of the 10 acres of not

surveyed and reserved for public requirements lands other than

the said land.

The said 10 acres of land, reserved by the Puthukuddyirippu

Divisional Secretary in the year 2005 for the Government

requirement in the area."

The learned Senior State Counsel, relying on the contents of 'R7a'

submitted to this Court that the Petitioners father had in fact been given

a permit for a land in extent of 20 Acres 2 Roods 8 Perches under the

Middle Class Colonisation (MCC) Scheme. She stated that a person is

entitled to only one land under this Scheme. She submitted further that

the land that is the subject matter of the Quit Notices 'P1' and 'P2' is

situated adjacent to the land given to the Petitioners father under the

MCC Scheme. The learned Senior State Counsel contended that the

Petitioner had encroached onto the land referred to in the quit notice,

as well as certain other lands adjacent to the land in respect of which

the permit had been issued under the MCC Scheme.

9

This Court observes that in terms of the Block Survey Tenement List

marked 'RS', the Petitioners father had been issued Permit No. 23444 in

respect of Lot No. 735 of Topo Plan PP20.18 The land in respect of which

the Quit Notices have been issued is situated on the southern boundary

of Lot 735. According to 'RS', the Petitioners father had encroached on

to Lot No. 734, which is the reservation for the main road and Lot No.

736 which is a reservation for a cart track. According to Plan PP20, Lots

734 and 736 are situated on either side of Lot No. 735. Significantly, the

Block Survey Tenement List marked 'RS' does not refer to the land which

is the subject matter of the quit notice, adding credence to the position

of the 1st Respondent's assertion in 'R7a' that the said land had been

reserved for the State and had not been surveyed, In fact, in 2005, the

1st Respondent had issued the letter marked 'R6a' confirming that the

said land19 has been reserved for Government requirements and has not

been divided and granted to any person. This submission of the learned

Senior State Counsel explains the second paragraph of 'p13' relating to

the production of receipts pertaining to a MCC land.

When this Court considers 'R7a', it is clear that even though the

Petitioners father had a permit in respect of Lot 735, neither the

Petitioner nor his father had any permit or written authority granted in

accordance with any written law in respect of the land which is the

subject matter of the Quit Notices 'PI' and 'P2' and that 'p13' cannot be

construed as evidence thereof.

18 Copies of Plan PP20 have been produced with the petition marked as 'R!', 'R2' and 'R3'. The extent of the said Lot 735 is 20 Acres 2 Roods 8 perches.

19 The land which is the subject matter of the Quit Notice

10

The next letter relied on by the Petitioner to establish that he has the

written authority to occupy the said land is 'P14'. This letter is dated 20th

July 201620 and has been sent by the 2nd Respondent to the 1st

Respondent.21 The said letter has the same title as 'P13' and reads as

follows:

It appears from the letter marked tp14' that the 2nd Respondent has not

given due consideration to the letter marked tR7a'. Be that as it may,

20 Annexed to the petition marked 'P14'

21 Similar to 'P13', there is a handwritten endorsement on 'P14' that it has been copied to the Petitioner

11

'P14' is not a written authority of the State authorizing occupation of the

said land by the Petitioner nor is it evidence of such fact.

The learned Senior State Counsel has produced to this Court the letter

dated 3rd August 2016 marked 'RS,22 which is the response of the 1st

Respondent to 'P14'.

The relevant portions of 'RSa' are re-produced below:

itA piece of land located close to the Suthanthirapuram Colonization

Scheme depicted as Lot No. 735 in the plan No. TOPOPP 20 to the

extent of 20A. 2R. 08P had been given away to Mr. V.Kurusamy in the

year 1969 under the Middle Class Colonization Scheme.

Several field inspections and inquiries had been carried out on the

alleged encroachment of the piece of land to the extent of 10 A

adjoining to the aforesaid land of 20 A occupied by the said Kurusamy

and subsequent to his death it is being possessed by his son Anton

Anandhakumar and as a result the following facts revealed.

1. It is revealed from the plan that at the planning stage of the

Middle Class Scheme, lands by side of the A35 Road had been

identified for public purpose and only the piece of lands were

allocated along Suthanthirapuram Colonization Scheme Road.

2. No possibility is found out for the allocation of 10Ac lands

under annual permit in 1970s in violation of Govt. Policies to a

22 The English translation of 'RS' has been produced as 'RSa' 12

persons or member his family for whom a piece of land to the

extent of 20A had already been alienated under MCC in the year

1969. Also it is not possible to ensure location, extent and

boundaries of the land claimed by the party from the documents

furnished.

3. LDO permit had been issued to Mr. Anton Anandakumar in

the year 2003 for an additional piece of land along A35 main road

which was encroached and kept in possession by his late father

V.Kurusamy.

4. Therefore it is confirmed that the lOA land is allocated for

public purpose and the right of possession was not given to Mr.

Kurusamy,

Further it is confirmed that it is a state land by the letter of the

Divisional Secretary dated 2005.05.18 who certify the fact.

5. It was instructed by the Provincial Land Commissioner that

as per his inquiries a grantee of land under MCC cannot have

another piece of state land and hence to grant the claimant with

the appropriate land"

Thus, when this Court considers the contents of 'R8a', it is clear that

even though the Petitioners father had been granted a permit in respect

of Lot No. 735, no permit has been granted in respect of the land which

is the subject matter of the Quit Notice. In these circumstances, this

Court concludes that 'P14' is certainly not a valid permit or written

13

.

authority given by the State nor is it evidence of any such authorization

given by the State to the Petitioner in respect of the said land.

In Nirmal Paper Converters (Pvt) Limited vs Sri Lanka Ports Authority23

this Court held that, lithe only ground on which the petitioner is entitled

to remain on this land is upon a valid permit or other written authority

of the State as laid down in section 9 (1) of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act. He cannot contest any of the other matters."

Referring to the provisions contained in Section 9(1) of the Act, this

Court has held as follows in Muhandiram vs Chairman, Janatha Estates

Development Board24:

liThe said section clearly reveals that at an inquiry of this nature, the

person on whom the summons has been served has to establish that

his possession or occupation is upon a valid permit or other written

authority of the State granted according to the written law. The

burden of proof of that fact lies on that particular person on whom

the summons has been served and appears before the relevant

Court."

This view has been confirmed in Aravindakumar vs Alwis and others25

where Sisira De Abrew J [with Sripavan J (as he then was) agreeing] has

held as follows:

23 1993 1 Sri LR 219

24 1992 1 Sri LRllO

2S 2007 1 Sri LR316

14

'.

"According to the scheme provided in the Act a person who is in

possession or occupation of any state land and has been served with

quit notice under Section 3 of the Act can continue to be in

possession or occupation of the land only upon a valid permit or

other written authority of the State described in Section 9 of the

Act."

While it is obvious that 'P13 and 'P14' is not a written authority by the

State, this court is of the view that neither 'P13 nor 'P14' is evidence

that a written permit or authorisation is to be issued to the Petitioner in

accordance with any written law in respect of the said land. There is no

material before this Court that the position of the 1st Respondent set out

in 'R8a' has been contradicted by the 2nd Respondent. The fact that the

2nd Respondent has not contradicted the position of the 1st Respondent

as set out in 'R8a' and has not issued an annual permit to the Petitioner,

is confirmed by the letter dated 15th December 2017 sent by the 2nd

Respondent, and submitted to this Court by the Petitioner marked

'P22a'. In this factual background, the occupation of the said land by the

Petitioner is clearly unauthorized.

The Petitioner has pleaded that the land in question was to be given on

a long lease to him. The Petitioner appears to rely on 'P13 and 'P14' to

support this position. Although not specifically pleaded, this Court would

now consider whether 'P13 and (P14' can give rise to a legitimate

expectation in the mind of the Petitioner that the land in question will

be leased to him. As set out above, 'p13 and (P14' are internal

correspondence between two Government entities, with a handwritten

endorsement that they have been copied to the Petitioner. This Court

15

.

has already held that the reference in 'P13' to an annual permit is a

reference to the land given to the Petitioners father under the MCC

Scheme and is not a reference to the land which is the subject matter of

the Quit Notices. As observed earlier, 'P14' appears to have been

written by the 2nd Respondent without due consideration being given to

'R7a'. Thus, it is doubtful if the reference to a long term lease in 'P14' is

to the land in question. This Court is of the view that there is no clear

and unambiguous statement either in 'P13 or in 'P14' that the land in

question will be given on a long term lease to the Petitioner. The latest

letter issued by the 2nd Respondent marked 'P22' confirms this position.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that 'P13 and 'P14'

cannot give rise to a legitimate expectation in the mind of the Petitioner

that the State was agreeable or was contemplating to give him a long

term lease of the said land.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the decision of the

1st Respondent to issue the Quit Notices marked 'Pi' and 'P2' is within

the law. This Court does not see any illegality in the issuing of the Quit

Notices 'Pi' and 'P2' by the 1st Respondent. For the reasons set out in

this Order, this Court is of the view that this is not a fit case in which

notices should be issued as Writs of Certiorari will not lie to quash the

Quit Notices marked 'Pi' and 'P2'.

The learned Senior State Counsel appearing for the Respondents took up

the position that this application is futile as the Magistrate has already

made an order for ejectment of the Petitioner from the land in question

and that the said Order has been affirmed by the learned High Court

Judge. She also took up the position that the Petitioner is guilty of laches

16

,

in that the Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court only in

August 2017 whereas the Quit Notices had been issued in January and

February 2016. It has been consistently held by this Court that a

discretionary remedy such as a Writ of Certiorari will not lie where the

petitioner has been guilty of laches or where the issuance of a writ is

futile. Even though the submissions of the learned Senior State Counsel

have much merit, the necessity to consider the said submissions of the

learned Senior State Counsel does not arise in view of the finding of this

Court that there has not been any illegality in the issuance of the Quit

Notices marked 'Pl' and 'P2'.

Accordingly, this application is dismissed, without costs.
