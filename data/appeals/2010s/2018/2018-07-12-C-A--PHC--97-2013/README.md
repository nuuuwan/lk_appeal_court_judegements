ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the "Appellant") seeks to set aside an order of the Provincial High

Court, holden at Nuwara Eliya, on 08.08.2013, by which it had

dismissed his revision application in limine. With filing of the said

revision application, the Appellant sought to set aside an order of

eviction issued against him by the Magistrate's Court of Hatton under

3

Section 10 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979

as amended (hereinafter referred to as the said" Act").

The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the "Respondent") issued a quit notice on the Appellant to handover

vacant possession of the land described in the schedule. Upon the

failure of the Appellant to hand over vacant possession on the due date,

the Respondent made an application under Section 3 of the said Act to

the Magistrate's Court.

The Appellant was issued summons by the Magistrate's Court on

05.02.2013, to show cause on 19.03.2013. On that day the Appellant

sought permission of Court to tender it in written form on 02.04.13, but

thereafter moved for adjournment till 22.04.2013. On that day, the

Appellant complied with the order of Court to show cause by tendering

an affidavit with annexures marked as R1 to R15. The case was to be

called next on 20.05.2013. On 16.05.2013, the Appellant sought to tender

further documents marked as R16, R17 and R18, but was directed by

Court to move on the due date already fixed for the case to be called

and these documents were returned.

On 20.05.2013, the Appellant sought permission of Court to

tender" further show cause" and the Court made order accepting it. The

matter was fixed for order on 29.07.2013. The Appellant has thereafter

tendered an affidavit and the annexed deed of transfer by Land Reform

Commission, marked as R19 to the Registry of the Court apparently on

4

01.07.2013 and tendered written submissions also on 17.07.2013 in

which references are made to R19. However, there are no

corresponding journal entries to confirm its acceptance by Court except

for a seal of the Registry of the Court, which appears on both these sets

of documents.

The Magistrate's Court has ordered eviction of the Appellant

from the State land with its order dated 29.07.2013.

In support of his appeal, the Appellant submitted that both the

Magistrate's Court and the Provincial High Court has failed to consider

the title deed marked as R19, which satisfied the statutory provisions of

the Section 9(1) of the said Act.

The Respondent, in his reply accused the Appellant of

"smuggling" the document R19 into the record without seeking

permission of Court and even without a motion in support.

It is correct that the document R19 has found its way into the

record without following proper procedure. Permission granted by

Court to tender "further show cause" limits to R16, R17 and R18.

Therefore the deed R19 was introduced to the case record through the

Registry of the Court without obtaining approval of Court and when it

reserved order.

, .

However, absence of specific reference to R19 in the order of the

Magistrate's Court cannot be interpreted as total failure to consider its

contents. The Court in allowing the application of the Respondent to

evict the Appellant, concluded that the description of the State land in

the application and the description of the Appellant by his show cause

are in relation to two different lands (vide page 5 of the Order).

In these circumstances, it is appropriate to consider the validity of

this finding of fact, although not canvassed by the Appellant before this

Court.

The western boundary of the State land, as described in the

schedule to the application is described as "land allocated to milk

collecting centre". The western boundary in the land described in R19

"road and Lot No. 34". The schedule in R19 refers to a plan No.

2084/2012 of 30.03.2012 by Surveyor Subramanium, and this plan was

tendered by the Appellant as R2.

The lot No. 36 is allocated to the Appellant by R19 as per plan R2.

As Lot No. 36 is depicted in R2, the western boundary to it, is a

roadway. To the north-west of Lot No. 36, lies Lot No. 34. Clearly there

is no block of land to the exact west from Lot No. 36, but a public road.

The Respondent's description of western boundary of the disputed

State land by a plot of land allocated for a milk collecting centre,

therefore cannot exist as per the description given in plan R2. Thus, it is

6

,.

obvious that the land shown in R19 is not the land described in the

schedule to the application filed by the Respondent.

It is on this basis, the show cause shown by the Appellant was

rejected and an order of eviction was made by the Magistrate's Court.

The Appellant's contention that the title to the land is vested in the

Land Reform Commission and the claim by the Respondent that the

land described in the application is a State land could not be resolved

by the Magistrate's Court as it had no authority to disregard an opinion

of a Competent Authority that it is State land.

The conclusion reached by the learned Magistrate, upon

comparison of the boundaries of the disputed land is based on the

acceptance of the correctness of the boundaries given in the schedule to

the application before it. In doing so, he has acted in conformity with

the relevant statutory provisions. The Magistrate's Court has no

authority to call for evidence in support of the description of the State

land from the Competent Authority as per Section 9(2). The Court has

rightly utilized the discrepancy in the schedule of R19 to determine

the question whether the Respondent has a "valid permit or other

written authority" to occupy the said State land as described in the

schedule to the application by the Appellant. The land described in

R19 is clearly not the State land in respect of which an order of eviction

is made and therefore the Appellant has failed to establish that he has

a "valid permit or other written authority" to occupy the said State

land.

7

t'

Mere fact of not referring to R19 specifically in the order of Court,

would not vitiate its validity as the Court has clearly considered its

contents. The order of the Provincial High Court is also based on this

finding of fact to base its own order of dismissing the Appellant's

revision application in limine.

In the circumstances, we are of the considered view that the

appeal of the Appellant is devoid of merit and therefore it ought to be

dismissed.

Accordingly, the appeal of the Appellant stands dismissed. No

costs.
