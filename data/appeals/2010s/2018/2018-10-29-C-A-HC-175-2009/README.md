The appellants were indicted in the High Court of Matara under

Section 357 read with S~(;tion 32 uf the Penal Code for abduction of

Nadeeka Roshnni as the 1 st charge and under Section 364 (2) (b) read

with Section 364 (2) of the Penal Code for g~ng rape. They were also

charged for robbery under Section 380 reud with Section 32 of the Penal

Code. After trial the first appellant was convicted for the 1st and 2nd

charges and sentenced to 10 years RI with a fine of Rs. 1,00,0001= with

a default term of 2 years for the 1 ~,t charge and for the 2nd ch<Jrge he wa~

convicted for 20 years RI with CJ fine of Rs. 1,00,000/= running u default

2 ,

. term of 2 years. Second appellant "Yas convicted for the 1 st charge and

the same sentence was imposed to him too. For the 3rd charge the

second appellant was convicted and a jail term of 20 years RI was

imposed with a fine of Rs. 1,00,0001= running a default terms of 2 years.

The jail terms imposed are to be run consecutiv!y. This appeal was filEJd

against the s3id conviction and sentences.

The story of the prosecution is thnt the victim Nadeeka who was a

trainee nurse at the time of the incident, has taken a room in a restaurant

where there had been only twq other rooms with her boyfriend on a Friday

,. evening and spent the night together. Early in the morning someb?dy had

knocked on the door and her boyfriend Ajith has opened the door and

three people with their faces covered had come and started assaulting

Ajith. The prosecutrix had screamed and run out of the room. First and

second appellants had dragged her out of the restaurant and while doing

so the first appellant had ass~ulted her. According to Nadeeka the first

and second appellants along with another person had taken her on a

bicycle to a shrub jungle passing a main road. She has stated that she

... was RLlicm the bar of the first appellant's cycle while the other two came

along side by side in their cycles. The prosecutrix has said she did not

shout or try to escape out of fenr for her life. After taking her to a jungle

the first and second appellants have raped her and the third had listened

to her pleas and not done anything to her. After that they have brought

3 '

her to tr:e roadside a!~d kii ht:;r there and she has found her way back to

the restaurant. Ajith and a police team had been at the rE:staurant when

she arrived there. After thnt she was taken to the Matara police station

and subsequently she was taken to the Matara Hospital. The Judicial

Medical OfficEr had spoken to her and she has narrated the story to him.

She W8S not examinE d by the Doctor at that time due to menstrual

bleeding and was told that he will examine her onthe next day. According

to evidence the proseuctrix had left the hospital the next morning prior to

her being examined. The Judicial Medical Officer did not get an

opportunity to examine the victim. The prosecutrix while giving evidence

has explained that she left the hospital to attend an examination the

following day which she could t:1ot afford to miss. There is no :medical

evidence to corroborate the prosecutrix's evidence. She was not

examined by the Judicial Medical Officer.

The date on which the prosecutrix was to sit for the exam there has

j

been no examination held at the Nurses College, Galle. This was

ndmitted by both parties and recorded in page 396 of the brief under

~ection 420 of the Criminal Procedure Code Act. This shows that the

prosecutrix had deliberately lied to court after avoiding a medical

~xamination.

4,

The Judicial Medicnl Officer's evidence did not corroborate the

evidence of the prosecutrix uS ~tated by the learned High Court Judge in

his judgment (vide page 523 of the brief). The High Court should not act

on the uncorroborated evidence of a prosecutrix and should act with

extreme caution in such a situation.

It has been held in Sunil and another vs AG SLLR 1986 1 SLR

230 thus;

"It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated

testimony of a woman victim of a sex offence but if her

evidence is convincing such evidence could be acted,on even

in the absence of corroboration.

The burden of proving absence of consent on the part of the

complainant where the charge is one of rape or abduction

is always on the prosecution and never shifts. "

In the instant case the prosecutrix had deliberately avoided the

medical examination by leaving the hospital with put informing the Judicial

Medical Officer. She was not exnmined by the Judicial Medical Officer

consequently. The excuse she gi..lve for leaving the hospital was later

discovered to be false. Therefore the learned High Court Judge CiS stated

above should have acted with caution.

5 ,

. ',' .~

(d) evidence of accomplices or co-conspirators who have given .

el:idence under a conditional pardon could be accepted and

acted upon provident their evidence has been carefully and

cautiously considered and found to be convincing.

The partner of the prosecutrix Ajith who is alleged to have been

assaulted severely was not called as a witness, there is evidence to say

weapon~ were 'JSC, no weapon has been produced. Corroboration is not

sine qua non for a conviction in a rape C:lse it is only a rule of prudence.

Since the evidence of the victim suffer from basic infirmities and the victim

is unrf'iiable her evidence has to be corroborated by independent

evidence. The prosecution has fCliled to produce evidence objectively.

We are 0; the view that the evidence of the prosecutrix is not

reliable to be acted upon. In view of this finding the consideration of

1 common intention does not arise.

The learned High Court Judge has biled to consider the omissions

by the pronecutrix and not put suffici(;nt weight on these issues which

denies a fair trial to the appellants. The learned High Court Judge has

said she was a victim of Tsunami which hus no bearing on the instant

7 ,

C8f:e. The prusecUtrix herr-olf wh:ie giving evidence has stated she hm.i i1

strong mind and she wc.:nted to stay alive.

For the afore stated reasons we decide to set aside the judgment

dated .08/06/2009 and allow the appeal.

Appeal is allowed.
