Judgment

S. Thurairaja PC J

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) was

indicted before the High Court of Chilaw, for committing offences of trespass and Rape

punishable under section 436 and 364 of the Penal Code.

The appellant was arrested by the Police and enlarged on bail. When the Non-

Summery inquiry was held at the Magistrate Court, the Appellant was present and

represented by his Attorney at Law, after the conclusion of the evidence of important

witnesses, the Accused Appellant did not attend the court but represented himself

through his Counsel. Case was committed to the High Court and Trial was taken up,

the appellant, never surrendered to his bail and contested the case through his

Attorney at Law. After a fully contested trial, the Learned Judge of the High Court

found, the Appellant guilty and sentenced him accordingly. Being aggrieved with the

said conviction and sentence the Appellant preferred an appeal through his Attorney

at Law. Several Counsels appeared on his behalf but none submitted any letter of

authority from the Appellant. Subsequently all of them informed this Court that they

have no 'Proper Instructions' and withdrew from the case. This court issued several

notices, summons and warrant through the Registrar and the Police, all of them

revealed, that the appellant is not in the country and may be residing in Italy and they

are unable to provide the address. This includes the mother of the Appellant.

As I stated above, the Appellant was indicted for trespassing into the home of Pubudhu

Visaka Lasanthi Ponnamperuma and raped her on the 18th May 2001. It was revealed

that the Appellant known as Nimal, was a Son of her mother's brother. The Prosecution

led the evidence of the Prosecutrix, Pubudhu Visaka Lasanthi Ponnamperuma, Pelpola

Gunawardane Jayawathie Gunawardana mother of the Prosecutrix, Judicial Medical

Officer (JMO) Dr. Mohamed Nizar Rahul Haq, Inspector of Police (lP) Warnakulasuriya

Ebert Michal Aubrie and Women Police Inspector (WIP) Jayaweera Arachchige Nimali

Wasundara and moved the statutory statements be admitted under section 420 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act (CCPA). Being convinced with the evidence the Trial

Judge had called the defence of the appellant. The attorney at Law who appeared for

the appellant moved for a date to get instructions and informed on the next date that

he will not be giving evidence or calling witnesses on his behalf.

The grounds of appeal submitted by the Appellant in his Appeal stands as follows;

1. The judgement of the learned High Court Judge is contrary to law.

2. The judgment of the learned High Court Judge is contrary to the facts

related to this case.

3. This judgement must be set aside on the basis that the learned High

Court Judge by prejudging the case contrary to law that the accused

must be convicted.

4. Although the evidence given by the witness No. 01 Ponnamperumage

Pubudu Vishaka Lasanthi who gave evidence with regard to rape as

mentioned in the indictment, contained discrepancies and changing her

evidence from time to time, makes her evidence unreliable and the

failure of the learned High Court Judge to give that benefit of the doubt

to the accused is illegal.

5. The Learned High Court Judge's Judgment is contrary to the evidential

facts adduced in this case. Especially, as a result of the Hon. High Court

Judge accepting the evidence that should have been excluded and

CA/67/2014 JUDGMENT Page 3 of to

excluding the evidence that should have been accepted, has caused

great prejudice to the accused Appellant.

6. In this case according to the evidence of the lady who was said to have

been abused, according to the answers given by her under cross

examination and during the re-examination by the State Counsel and the

questions posed by the Hon. Court at that moment itself, (Evidence of

21.03.2011 pages 12, 13, 14), the accused had never been seen by her

previously. She has further answered that she came to know the name of

the accused only at the Police Station. However, the Police have not

made a request from the Magistrate's Court for an identification parade

to enable the lady who is said to have been raped to identify the accused

appellant. Therefore, as only on the dock identification of the accused

who was in the dock by the main witness in this case, is not conclusive

evidence that can be made use of to find the accused guilty.

7. In this case, although the lady who is said to have been subjected to

sexual abuse, in her evidence in chief had said that she knew him, while

CA/67/2014

answering questions under cross examination, under re-examination by

the State Counsel and questions posed at that moment itself by the Hon.

Court she has stated that she had not known the accused prior to the

incident and based on this incident itself the accused should not have

been made guilty for the two charges made in the indictment, had been

brought to the attention of the Hon. Court and the learned High Court

Judge has not mentioned a judicial opinion with regard to it even by a

sentence, and in his judgment on page 25 in two places he states as

follows: That is, "not a single contradiction has been marked in the

evidence of the complainant" Further, "In relation to this case the

attention is drawn to Inoka Gallage 2002 (1) Vs Kamal Addaraarachchi Sri

Lanka Law Report 307 and Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka Vs

Dingiribandage Sumanadasa but in the evidence of this victim lady, there

is not anything unnatural and it remains firm, uniform and without any

contradictions". There are strong instructions received to the fact that

the learned High Court Judge has arrived at the above observations,

without observing the above evidence and may be due to certain lapse

on the part of the Court. (Per Incuriam).

8. In order to prove that the accused had come to the place of the incident

and to prove that he committed the crime, the foot prints of the accused,

body hormones inclusive of semen or hair follicles or finger prints related

DNA evidence have not been produced by the prosecution.

9. Although the evidence of the witness No. 01 was unsatisfactory to the

extent that Hon. Attorney General should have charged her for going out

of the way in evidence expected from her, her evidence full of

unreliability have been taken as fully reliable at a higher degree is not

acceptable at all and this judgment should be set aside. Especially when

the nature of this evidence is analyzed as a whole, it is unsafe to act on

such an unreliable evidence is apparent here.

10. On the evidence of the prosecution when there arises a reasonable

doubt as to the culpability of the appellant, although the action that

should have been taken by the Hon. High Judge, is to give that benefit

of the doubt to the accused and issued an order acquitting the accused

Appellant, instruction has been received that the Hon. Judge by quoting

alien reasons and convicting the accused appellant is illegal.

11. The reason that the accused appellant not being personally present

before the open Court and his getting married subsequently is censured

by the Hon. High Court in the course of his sentencing and finding the

accused guilty and imposing a severe sentence based on that has caused

great prejudice to the accused.

12. Without prejudice to the averments above, it is humbly declared that in

this case which is more than thirteen years old and the sentence imposed

to this accused for the charges In the indictment IS excessive and

unreasonable.

(Reproduced from the petition of appeal)

One could observe that most of the grounds were elaborated in separate paragraphs,

hence we consolidate all grounds and discuss together.

The first ground is the Judgment is contrary to Law. Since the Appellant was not

represented at the final stage of this appeal we carefully considered all materials

including the Non- Summery inquiry and the trial proceedings. We could not find any

illegal steps were taken against the Appellant. In fact, we found that the Magistrate

and the trial Judge had given more than adequate time for the appellant to surrender

to his bail. The indictment is in order, procedures followed were in-accordance with

the Law and the Appellant was given proper and a Fair trial hence we find that the First

ground fails in its own merits.

Second ground of appeal is that Contradictions and evidence favourable to the

Appellant were not considered fairly. On a careful perusal of the trial proceedings we

find that there is not a single material contradiction marked. We also noticed that there

are some differences in the evidence of the virtual complainant. When carefully

scrutinising the said differences, we find that those are natural variations and not

hiding of facts.

Time and again our Courts had followed the dictum of Justice Thakkar, delivered in

Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai vs State of Gujarat, 1983 AIR 753, 1983 SCR (3) 280.

"Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and shake the

basic version of the witnesses therefore cannot be annexed with undue

importance. More so when the all-important ''probabilities-factor'' echoes in

favour of the version narrated by the witnesses. The reasons are:

1 I

(1) By and/arge a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident It is not as if a

vIdeo tape is replayed on the mental screen,'

(2) ordinarily it so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The

witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has

an element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be

expected to be attuned to absorb the detai/~'

(3) The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one

may notice, another may not An object or movement might emboss

its image on one person's mind whereas it might go unnoticed on the

part of anothet;

(4) By and large people cannot accurately recall a conversation and

reproduce the very words used by them or heard by them. They can

only recall the main purport of the conversation. It is unrealistic to

expect a witness to be a human tape recordet;

(5) In regard to exact time of an incident or the time duration of an

occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work on the

spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot

expect people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such

matters. Again, it depends. On the 'time sense' of indivIduals which

varies from person to person.

(6) ordinarily a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the

sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short

time span. A witness is liable to get confused, or mixed up, when

interrogated later on,'

(7) A witness, though wholly truthfu~ is liable to be overawed by the court

atmosphere and the piercing cross examination made by counsel and

CA/67/20l4 JUDGMENT Page 7oflO

out of nervousness mix up facts,' get confused regarding sequence of

events or fill up details from imagination on the spur of moment The

subconscious mind of the witness sometimes so operates on account

of the fear of looking foolish, or being disbelieved, though the witness

is giving a truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by

him-Perhaps it is a sort of a psychological defence mechanism

activated on the spur of the moment

It will be unfair, to expect a witness to recall all minute details after a long period of

time. In Sri Lanka we expect the witness to reveal the accurate facts to Court to give a

JUST decision. It should be mindful that the Court is not a place to test the memory of

a Victim. The test applicable will be of an ordinary man test not the super man with

extra ordinary memory power.

In the present case, we find that the witness had certain lapses in recalling the incident,

in our view those are not material contradiction which goes to the root of the credibility

of the evidence of the witness.

Considering all factors, we find that there is no infirmity in the findings of the learned

trial Judge. Hence, we find no merit in this ground too.

The Appellant also submitted without prejudice that the Sentence imposed is excessive

and unreasonable.

ARIJIT PASAYAT, J. in State of Punjab vs Ramdev Singh. 17 [2003] INSC 654, (17

December 2003) held,

"Sexual violence apart from being a dehumanizing act is an unlawful intrusion

on the right of privacy and sanctity of a female. It is a serious blow to her

supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and dignity it degrades and

humiliates the victim and where the victim is a helpless innocent child or a

minor, it leaves behind a traumatic experience. A rapist not only causes physical

CA/67/2014 JUDGMENT Page 80fl0

injuries but more indelibly leaves a scar on the most cherished possession of a

woman ie. her dignity, honour; reputation and not the least her chastity. Rape

is not only a crime against the person of a woman it is a crime against the entire

society. It destroys, as noted by this Court in Shri Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Miss

Subhra Chakraborty (AIR 1996 SC 922), the entire psychology of a woman and

pushes her into deep emotional crisis. It is a crime against basic human rights

and is also violative of the victim's most cherished of the Fundamental Rights,

name/'y- the Right to Life contained in Article 21 of the Constitution of India,

1950 (in short the 'Constitution,) The Courts are, therefore, expected to deal

with cases of sexual crime against women with utmost sensitivity. Such cases

need to be dealt with sternly and severely. A socially sensitized judge, in our

opinion is a better statutory armour in cases of crime against women than long

clauses of penal provisions, containing complex exceptions and provisos. "

He further said,

'~ socially sensitized judge, in our opinion is a better statutory armour in cases

of crime against women than long clauses of penal provisions, containing

complex exceptions and provisos. "

(Emphasis added)

In the present case, it is revealed that the Prosecutrix after the act of sexual penetration

was bleeding profusely and treated at the hospital as an in-patient for about a week.

Further it is noted that the victim had suffered not only physically but also

psychologically. It also noted that the Accused Appellant had not regretted in any

means, not even surrendering to his bail. Therefore, after careful consideration we

decided not to interfere with the order of the Learned Trial judge, who had the

privilege to observe the witnesses.
