was done under section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance sub$e~uent to

statements made by the appellants, The second appellant while giving

evidence from the dock has stated that the police came to his house in

the night c.md took the items marked as P7 and P8 in the High Court from

. his house. His evidence has gone in unchallenoed. The learned senior

state counsel conceded that the case against the second appellant was

not proved beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore the second appellant has

been convicted without evidence and we are of the view that he should

have been acquitted by the learned High Court Judge.

According to the prosecution evidence the second accused

appellant is alleged to have an illicit love affair with the deceased's wife.

The first appellant's sister is married to the second appellant. According

to prosecution witness number two Kalubowila who was employed by the

deceased in his garage, deceased was last seen alive on 15/03/2005 and

.,

he had received n phone call from the second appellant's wife and left to

meet her at the grounds, he had not returned to the garage that night.

The next morning he has found the body of the deceased in the grounds.

The medical evidence reveals 25 injuries out of which 7 are cut

injuries on the head. The Judicial Medical Officer while testifying in the

High Court had suid it is difficult to say whether one or more weapons

h(]ve been used to cause the injuries. A knife was recovered after the

statement of the first appellant under section 27 (1) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

The first appellant had made a dock statement denying his

involvement in the incident. After the second appellant made his dock

statement the first appellnnt made another dock statement admitting that

he committed the offence.

The argument of the counsel for the first appellant was that the

evidence of the prosecution was not sufficient to convict the first appellant

for the said murder and that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge

beyond a reasonable doubt. The learned counsel for the first appellant

argued that he has been convicted on his own dock statement which was

made consequent to his first dock statement denying the crime.

Judgment delivered by this court in CA 11/2015 was cited by the counsel

for the first appellant where Lalith Jayasuriya J had stated that the

accLlsed was convicted on his own evidence ana that such a conviction

cannot stand.

In the instant case the first appellant was convicted after he made

a second dock statement 'in whjch he had said "00 Q)C3G5. @@(5) tj!t53ei5 eG5

@@ tj!o6XJcJ 8{;G) ~ei5" an accused is allowed to make a dock statement

where he has the liberty to say anything without being cross examined

but nowhere does it sayan accused can make further dock statements

which are contrary to the earlier dock statement.

In King vs H.R.S. Fernando 48 NLR 249 Barden of proof has

been discussed and it was held;

"where a prima Jacie case is made out by the prosecution

and the accused by his defence offers an explanation, the

Jury should be directed that the burden of proof that the

offence charged has been committed is still on the

prosecution, and that it upon a review of the evidence on

both sides I they are in doubt, they ought to acquit It is a

misdirection to tell them that because the evidence for the

prosecution established a prima facie easel the burden of

proof is shifted to the accused."

The onus of proving the guilt of an accused rests solely on the I

prosecution and an accused can not be convicted on his own statement

given as evidence.

The deceased was last seen alive by prosecution witness number

two cmd he has left after he received a phone calJ from the first appellant's

sister and the second appellant's wife to meet her with whom he was

alleged to have been having an illicit love affair. The prosecution failed to

establish this evidence.

The knife recovered after recording a statement of the first

appellant under section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance was not

identified by the witness and the learned High Court Judge has been

misdirected when she said the evidence established the fact that the

weapon was identified by the witness. The learned High Court Judge has

failed to evaluate the evidence of the prosecution witness in the' correct

perspective thereby has erred in law.

The learned High Court Judge has also failed to consider the law

relating to a case entirely based on circumstantial evidence which is that

the circumstances leads to no other inferences than that of guilt of the

accused.

For the afore stated reasons we decide that the conviction and

sentence dated 25/09/2017 can not stand. We set aside the judgment

dated 25/09/2017 and acquit the first and second appellants.
