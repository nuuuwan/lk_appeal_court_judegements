P. Padman Surasena, J (PICA)

Heard learned Counsel for the Petitioner in support of this

application. Petitioner has filed an application for bail in the High Court.

The basis of that application in the High Court is the alleged failure by

police to mention the place from which the police has recovered the automatic

gun, in the B report submitted to Court.

Petitioner has also taken up a position that Police had failed to

mention the place from which the key of the relevant vehicle (which is

alleged to have been used to commit the relevant crime) was recovered, in

the said report.

3 -

In the course of the proceedings, learned High Court Judge

had verified this positions by getting the learned State Counsel to

produce the information book in Court. It has transpired that the relevant

gun has been recovered from the almaira of the house of the suspect.

The suspect was arrested on 2017.04.11. The impugned order by the

High Court has been delivered on 2017.11.01.

This Court perused the order and proceedings of the High

court. This Court has no reason to interfere with the said order.

Further there is no basis for this Court to issue notices on

the Respondents as this Court is unable to see any irregularity impropriety

or illegality in the impugned order. (This Court has to be mindful that this

is an application for revision. Vide section 364 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act). Therefore we refuse to issue notices on the Respondents.

This application must stand dismissed.

I agree.
