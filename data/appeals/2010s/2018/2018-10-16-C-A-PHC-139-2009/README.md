DECIDED ON

K.K. WICKREMASINGHE, J.

Ac :used-Petitioner-Appellant - On 28J)8.2018

09:10.2018

~ .. The Accused-Petitioner-Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Western

Province holden in Negambo dated 20~ 10.2009 in case of HCRAl15112009 and

seeking to set aside the order of t:he Learned Additional Magistrate of

Minuwangoda in the case No. 64228.

Facts of the Case:

The Accused- Petitioner-Appellant (her~inafter referred to as the "Appellant") was

charged before the Magistrate's Court of Minuwangoda under the Case No. 64228

for an offence of 'assault or criminal fOf(1e with intent to dishonour police officers

otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation' an offence punishable under

section 346 of the Penal Code. The A:ppellant had pleaded guilty to the charge

when it was read in open court and tp.e Learned Magistrate had convicted the,

Appellant. Accordingly the Learned Magistrate had imposed a sentence of on~

year rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.5000.00.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Leanlz.:i Magistrate, appellant had preferred an

appeal to the High Court of Negambo which was later withdrawn. Thereafter, the

appellant had filed a revision applicatiOIl, in the High Court under case No. HCRA

15112009.

"

Since this is an appeal of the revision application made to the High Court, we are

inclined to consider whether the Appellant had demonstrated exceptional

circumstances to the satisfaction of High li~ourt.

I In the case of Rust om V. Hapangama (~978-79) 2 SLLR 225, it was stated that,

,r "The trend of authority clearly indicates that where the revisionary powers

': I of the Court of Appeal are invoked the practice has been that these powers

will be exercised if there is 'an "t.(llternative remedy available only if the

existence of special circumstances 'are urged necessitating the indulgence of

this court to exercise these powers in revision. If the existence of special

circumstances does not exist then this court will not exercise its powers in . . " reVlszon ...

In the case of Rasheed Ali V. Mohamed Ali (1981) 2 SLR 29 it was held that,

! "The powers ofrevision conferre~'on the Court of Appeal are very wide and

the Court has discretion to exerci~'e them whether an appeal lies or not or

whether an appeal had been ta~en or not. However this discretionary

f remedy can be invoked only wh~Te there are exceptional circumstances

warranting the intervention of the court ... "

We observe that the Appellant has failedlo mention any reason for the withdrawal

~, . . of her appeal made to the High Court. Therefore it was mandatory to demonstrate

exceptional circumstances before the Learned High Court Judge of Neg ambo since

the Appellant did not avail her right of appeal.

The Appellant had averred in the pb'tition of appeal that the Complainant-

Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1 st Respondent) had

produced the Appellant before the agistrate' s Court of Minuwangoda on '.'

,i)" Page 4 of 11

17.02.2007 for allegedly committing the offence of poss~n of illicit liqu!f,.

, ~ under the case No. 3742. On 26.05.2008. the case was called for the purpose of

framing charges and the 15t Respondent I1r,d filed a charge sheet for committing an

"j, offence punishable under section 346 of,l~e Penal Code. Therefore the Appellant

has averred that she pleaded guilty to the. said charge by mistake on the belief that

l' she was pleading guilty to the charge of P(. ssession of illicit liquor.

'I

However, upon perusal of the case recor~[s we find that two different cases were

filed under two different numbers. Accordingly we find that police had filed a

report against the Appellant for an 'assault or criminal force with intent to

dishonour police officers otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation' an

offence punishable under section 346 of the Penal Code under case No. 64228 on

j' , 17.02.2007 and on 17.03.2008. Police had filed the report on the charge of

possession of illicit liquor on 12.01.2009 under case No. E 3742.

The Learned President's Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the charge sheet

, for which the Appellant had pleaded guilty was not signed by the Learned

Magistrate and accordingly the said charge sheet was not framed under section

182( 1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Therefore the conviction was bad in

law and it was a denial of her Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 13(4)

and 13(5) of the Constitution.

It was further submitted that in terms o.f the cases of Abdul Sameem V. The ,

Bribery Commissioner (1991) 1 Sri L.R. 76 and David Perera V. The Attorney

General (1997) 1 Sri L.R. 390, convicting an accused on a charge which was not

I legally framed, would vitiate the conviction.

In the case of Abdul Sameem, it was held that,

" ... the failure to frame a charge, as required under section 182 (l) is a

violation of a fundamental principle of criminal procedure, and is not a

e\ defect curable under section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.

15 of 1979. "

However we find these two cases to be ~ifferent from the instant appeal. In the

case of Abdul Sameem, a written report ~}as tiled by the Bribery Commissioner to

the Learned Magistrate that the accused! had committed two offences under the

Bribery Act and the Magistrate had adopted the said report by placing a seal. In the

case of David Perera, there was no separate charge sheet and the Learned

Magistrate had simply adopted the 'amended plaint'.

The Learned President's Counsel has submitted the case of Godage and others V.

OIC, Kahawatte Police (1992) 1 SLR 54.) in which it was held that,

"it is an imperative duty of the Magistrate to frame a charge and read it out

to the accused. Failure to do so is fqtal to the conviction. "

'It In this case it was submitted that no clu'.'ge had been framed or read out at all

either from a charge sheet or on the basis of the plaint or the amended plaint and

therefore no charge sheet at all. Therefor! we find that above three cases are not ,

relevant to the circumstances of the instant appeal.

The Learned President's Counsel has submitted the case of Abubackerge V. OIC,

Anti-Vice Unit, Police Station, AnUlradhapura and others ICA (PHC)

108/2010], stating that the attending circumstances were identical to the instant

case. However in the said case no charge~:)heet was found in the original record or

in the docket maintained by the High Court and only the rubberstamp was placed

on the reverse of the Plaint. Accordingly it was held that,

"The judgments cited above clearly points to the total absence of a written

charge (as is the case in the instant appeal), ought not to be treated as a

mere irregularity. The right to know the charge is a fundamental

requirement. It is a magisterial dVty which cannot be delegated to the police.

Whether there is sufficient grou(d to proceed against the suspect is in the

hands of ajudidal officer who is, expected to address his mind judiciously. If .1 the duty of framing the charge ji's to be entrusted to others the purposive

approach to Section 182 will be remdered nugatory ... "

However we observe that, in the in,tant appeal, the Learned Magistrate of

Minuwangoda had framed and filed a separate charge sheet (Page 35 of the brief).

In the case of D.R.M. Pandithakoralg~ V. V.K. Selvanayagam (56 NLR 143), it

was held that,

"There can be no doubt that the accused was in no way misled by the

mistake as regards the date in tlle plaint. In the case of William Edward . James (l'? CAR 116) it was he/d that a mistaken date in an indictment,

unless the date is of the essence of the offence or the accused is prejudiced,

need not be formally amended ... ,f

In the case of H.P.D. Nimal Ranasinghe V. OIC, Police, Hettipola [SC Appeal.

149/2017], it was held that,

"The question that must be decided is whether any prejudice was caused to

the accused-appellant as a result of the said defect in the charge sheet or

whether he was misled by the said defect. It has to be noted here that the

accused-appellant, at the trial, h(ld not taken up an objection to the char ze

sheet on the basis of the said de/?ct. In this connection judicial decision in

.. the case ofWickramasinghe Vs Chandradasa 67 NLR 550 is important."

According to section 164(4) and sectio.1 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act, the primary object of a charge shel t can be construed as to give notice to the

I' accused of the offence he/she is charged with. ,

In the case of Cooray V. James Appu [22 New Law Report 206] it was held that,

"The Legislature, deliberately d:-~parting from the previous practice, had

\ declared that in every summary (rial, when once the Court has decided to

undertake it, there shall be from the commencement a definite written

charge, which should be read to' the accused, specifying precisely what he

has to meet. This charge may be ,'he subject of reference at any point in the

trial, and must be the basis of an.) ultimate consideration of the case by the

... Court of Appeal. Such a provision may well be regarded as of so

fundamental and all-pervading :1'; character, that its non-observance ought

not to be treated as a mere irre:?ularity. No doubt there may be cases in

which the facts may be so simple, the issues so plain, and the charge so

inevitable that it cannot make the 'smallest difference to the accused whether t'

a written charge is read to him br not. Nevertheless, it is easy to see that

I some provisions may in the intention of the Legislature be of the very

essence of the proceedings, while others may be in the nature of formalities.

The existence "of a deliberately framed written charge is obviously a

condition which may well be so ngarded, whatever the circumstances of the

particular case ... "

In the instant appeal, the Learned MagisTate of Minuwangoda had duly framed the

charge by mentioning the place, date, '. ;.ature of the offence and relevant section

under which the appellant could be punished. Accordingly we are of the view that

such particulars were reasonably sufficient to give the accused (appellant) notice of

PagE 8 of 11

the matter with which she was charged ,lnd in fact satisfied the requisites under

Code of Criminal Procedure Al:t.

I Further we observe that the Learned High Court Judge of Negambo affirming the

conviction has held as follows;

"~@e1 ~~ DJ~Z5)JDc)~ @mJ~2:S)6 Cflt53 @~ @D:f~~J e~", qD~J~@c&

@we1~Ji5f, ~D2:5'!@mJe;) DGJ@"'2:5'! :~C)w2:5'! e5 Cflt53 ltZ5)6, ~ e16J~@c& cmi5f

2:S)6." (Page 82 of the brief)

The Learned President's Counsel for the appellant submitted that the Learned High

Court Judge had misdirected and erred in law since the validity of the charge sheet

does not depend on the fact whether a p~,~judice caused or not. It is imperative to

consider section 436 of the Code of Crim,inal Procedure Act (which is equivalent

to section 425 of the previous Code) in thi.;; regard, which reads;

"Subject to the provisions herein before contained any judgment passed by a

court of competent jurisdiction shad not be reversed or altered on appeal or

revision on account -

(a) of any error, omission, or irregularity in the complaint, summons~

warrant, charge, judgment, sllmming up, or other proceedings before

or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceedings under this Code; ! or

(b) of the want of any sanction ~equired by section 135, unless such error,

, , omission, irregularity, or waf;1t has occasioned a failure of justice."

In the case lof R.T. Wilbert and 3 others V. Newman (75 NLR 138), it was held

that,

"However, a charge which is bad for duplicity is not necessarily fatal

to the conviction if it has not caused prejudice to the accused and is

curable under section 425 o/the Criminal Procedure Code ... "

We further observe that the Learned M~gistrate of Minuwangoda had placed the

,\ seal and entered the signature in the end of journal entries. Accordingly we agree

with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge of Negambo and reject the

contention of the Learned President's Counsel.

Therefore we see no reason to interfere with the findings of the Learned High

Court Judge of Neg ambo.

Accordingly the Appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
