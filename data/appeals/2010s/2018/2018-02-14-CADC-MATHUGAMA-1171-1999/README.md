S. DEVIKA DE LIVERA TENNEKOON J

The Plaintiff - Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) instituted

action in the District Court of Matugama by Plaint dated 25.09.1992 against the

1 st -11 th Defendant - Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Respondents)

to partition the land morefully described in the Plaint. Thereafter, the lih

Defendant - Respondent was added for the purpose of getting an interim relief

preventing road development within the scheduled property.

The Appellant pleaded inter alia that the Appellant and the 15t - 5th Defendant _.

Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 1 st - 5th Respondents) were siblings

and that they were each entitled to a 2/24th share of each land as described in the

schedule to the plaint.

4

Thereafter, the 6th -11 th Defendant - Respondents filed a statement of claim

dated 11.09.1994 and claimed their rights according to the plan and the report

bearing No. 277 dated 28.07.1993 prepared by B.A.P. Jayasooriya Licensed

Surveyor. The 1 st - 5th Respondents did not file a statement of claim.

The matter then proceeded to trial without contest between the parties and the

Appellant gave evidenced which was not subject to cross examination by any of

the Respondents and the Appellant closed his case by marking in evidence

documents "X", "X 1 ", "P 1" - "P7".

The learned District Court Judge accepted the pedigree as averred in the Plaint

dated 25.09. i992 and delivered judgment dated 02.22.1996 ordering the

partition of the land as prayed for by the Appellant and further ordered that the

cultivations and buildings therein be allotted amongst the parties as claimed

before the Licenced Surveyor according to the report marked as "X 1 ".

Thereafter, B.A.P. Jayasooriya Licensed Surveyor prepared the final Partition

Plan bearing No. 1963 dated 29.08.1999.

The 2nd -- 5th Respondents thereafter filed a Petition under Section 189 of the

Civil Procedure Code to amend the said Judgment on the basis that in terms of

deed marked as P4, the Plaintiff and the 151

-5th Respondents were equally

entitled to the house and plantations situated within the land.

After considering the submissions of the parties the learned District Court Judge

delivered order dated 24.09.1999 allowing the application of the 1st -5th

Respondents by allotting the house situated in the land to the Appellant and

ordered that the Appellant should pay the share of the assessed value of the said

house to the 1 5t -- 5th Respondents.

5

Being aggrieved by the said order the Appellant preferred the instant Appeal on

the following grounds;

a) The application made under Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code is

procedurally incorrect, bad in law and impractical,

b) The 15t - 5th Respondents should have made an application under Section

48( 4) of the Partition Act,

c) The learned District Judge going in to the merits of the case by way of

Section 189 application nullifies the purpose of the Partition Act

Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code reads;

"( 1) The court may at any time, either on its own motion or on that of any

of the parties, correct any clerical or arithmetical mistake in any judgment

or order or any error arising therein from any accidental slip or omission,

or may make any amendment which-is necessary to bring a decree into

conformity with the jUdgment."

The question this Court has to consider is whether the error/mistake complained

about by the 15t - 5th Respondents is in fact an error/mistake and if so whether it

could have been corrected under the above provision or whether the 15t - 5th

Respondents could have pursued a different course of action.

In the case of Mohamed Iqbal Vs. Mohamed Sally 1995 (2) SLR 310 it was

held that;

"(1) S. 189 of the Civil Procedure Code is exhaustive of the causes for

which a Decree may be amended.

6

(2) This section cannot be invoked by Court for correcting mistakes of its

o\vn in law or otherwise.

(3) A Judge cannot reconsider or vary his judgment after delivery except

as provided for in S. 189."

Per Ranaraja J.

"This Power of Court under S. 189 is to be exercised entirely at the

discretion of court, and the discretion should be exercised sparingly and

in general to avoid a miscarriage of justice; if not the principle of the

finality of a judgment and decree will have no meaning."

V.L. Abdul Majeed in his book' A Commentary on Civil Procedure Code and

Civil Law' in Sri Lanka Volume 1, revised second edition (at 573) quotes the

case of Wijesundara Vs. Herath Appuhamy et al 67 CLW 63 which held

that;

"An interlocutory decree in a partition action may be amended by the trial

Judge if it appears that the decree is not in conformity with the judgment

and that it has been entered as a result of an accidental omission on his

part."

The learned Counsel for the 2nd, 3rd and 5th Respondents submits the case of

Gunasena Vs. Bandaranayake 2000 (1) SLR 292 in which it was held that;

The Court of Appeal had inherent power to set aside the judgment dated

25.05.1998 and to repair the injury (,<fLlsed to the plaintiff by its ovm

7

mistake, notwithstanding the fact that the said judgment had passed the

decree of court. This could not have been done otherwise than by writing

a fresh judgment.

Per Wijetunga, J.

"The authorities ............... clearly indicate that a court has inherent power

to repair an injury caused to a party by its own mistake. Once it is

recognized that a court would not allow a party to suffer by reason of its

own mistake, it must follow that corrective action should be taken as

expeditiously as possible, within the framework of the law, to remedy the

injury caused thereby. The modalities are best left to such court. and

would depend on the nature of the error."

The nature of the error/mistake complained about by the 15t - 5th Respondents is

that although the Appellant and the 15t - 5th Respondents are siblings who had

equal entitlements i.e. 2/24th share that as per the Judgement of the learned

District Judge, further to the report of the Licensed Surveyor marked as "Xl"

the Appellant has been allotted the house and plantations within the corpus.

However, this Court observes that in report marked as "X 1" dated 25.07.1993

referred to above and Report of B.A.P. Jayasooriya Licensed Surveyor dated

04.09.1997 both clearly indicate that the house and plantations within the

corpus belong to the Appellant. The report of B.A.P. Jayasooriya Licensed

Surveyor dated 04.09.1997 also indicates that the Appellant as well as the 2nd,

3rd, 4th, 5th i h and 11 th Respondents were present before the Licensed Surveyor

when the Appellant claimed the house and plantations within the corpus.

This Court is therefore of the view that the error/mistake complained about is

one which is outside the gamut of Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code as

mentioned above and as such the learned District Judge has erred in law by

allowing the application of the 1 st - 5th Respondents under this Section.

As correctly submitted by the learned Counsel for the Appellant the 1 st -5th

Respondents could have pursued a different course of action but they could not

have made the application under Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code.

This Court reiterates the views expressed by Ranaraja J mentioned above that

'this Power of Court under S. 189 is to be exercised entirely at the discretion of

court, and the discretion should be exercised sparingly and in general to avoid a

miscarriage of justice; if not the principle of the finality of a judgment and

decree will have no meaning."

In the circumstances as discussed above this Appeal is allowed and the order of

the learned District Judge dated 24.09.1999 is hereby set-aside and the reliefs as

prayed for in Petition dated 11.11.1999 is hereby granted.

Appeal Allowed.
