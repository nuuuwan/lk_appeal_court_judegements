Decided on: 04.12.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Homagama

to partition the land described in the schedule to the plaint (and

now depicted in the Preliminary Plan No. 280) among the

plaintiff, and the 1st and 2nd defendants. The 3rd defendant was

later added as a party to the case.

3

There was no contest among the plaintiff, and the 1st and 2nd

defendants. The only contesting party was the 3rd defendant,

who, as crystallized in the issues raised at the trial, sought for

the dismissal of the partition action in view of the Judgment

entered in the previous case No. 531/L. That was his main

contention. Without prejudice to it, the 3rd defendant sought for

the exclusion of Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan on the basis that

he has acquired prescriptive title to the said Lot.1

After the trial, the learned District Judge by the Judgment dated

22.08.2000 dismissed the claim of the 3rd defendant and

partitioned the land among the plaintiff, and the 1st and 2nd

defendants. This appeal by the 3rd defendant is from that

Judgment.

At the trial, the plaintiff and the 3rd defendant gave evidence.

There was no corpus or pedigree dispute. The plaintiff tendered

documents marked P1-P7, which included title Deeds to prove

devolution of title. There was no contest about marking those

title Deeds except to say that some of them were executed after

the Judgment in the previous case No. 531/L.

The 3rd defendant tendered documents marked V1-V3. He did

not unfold any pedigree. Nor did he mark any title Deeds. In

short, he does not claim to be a co-owner of the land. V1 is the

statement of objections tendered by the 3rd defendant objecting

to the application for interim injunction made by the plaintiff.

1 Pages 132-133 of the Appeal Brief.

V2 is the corresponding affidavit. V3 is the Plan No. 709

prepared for the previous case No. 531/L.2

The only point stressed by the 3rd defendant in his evidence in

chief was that the earlier case No. 531/L filed by the plaintiff

against him was dismissed after the trial (and therefore the

matter is res judicata).

During the cross examination the 3rd defendant admitted that he

is living about a kilometer away from the land to be

partitioned.3 He also stated that he has title Deeds to this land.4

But such Deeds were never produced. His standpoint was that

he produced the pedigree in the previous case No. 531/L.5 That

means, he admits that he is a co-owner of the land, but now

claims title to Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan on prescription.

Nevertheless, he did not give any affirmative evidence on how he

prescribed to Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan and when he started

prescriptive possession etc.

Needless to say that proof of prescription is difficult, and proof of

prescription by one co-owner against the other co-owners is

more difficult.

When a co-owner claims prescriptive possession against other

co-owners, proof of undisturbed, uninterrupted, adverse or

independent possession for more than 10 years explicitly

adverted to in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, No. 22 of

1871, as amended, itself is not sufficient.

In a co-owned property, every co-owner does not need to enjoy

the property to have the co-ownership intact. The possession of

one co-owner is in law the possession of other co-owners.

Nothing short of ouster or something equivalent to ouster by an

overt act as opposed to covert act is absolutely necessary to

make possession adverse and end co-ownership.

As was held in Pathmasiri v. Baby [2006] 1 Sri LR 35:

Mere possession of a specified portion of co-owned property for

convenience cannot constitute an adverse possession although

he possessed the specified portion for more than 50 years.

Justice G.P.S. de Silva (later Chief Justice) in Wickremaratne v.

Alpenis Perera [1986] 1 Sri LR 190 at 195 summarized the law in

this respect as follows:

Ever since the decision of the Privy Council in Corea v. Iseris

Appuhamy (1911) 15 NLR 65 it is settled law that-

a) a co-owners possession is in law the possession of other

co-owners;

b) that every co-owner is presumed to be possessing in his

capacity as co-owner;

c) that it is not possible for a co-owner to put an end to his

possession as co-owner by a secret intention in his mind;

d) that nothing short of ouster or something equivalent to

ouster could bring about that result.

It was also stressed in this case that possession of divided

portions by different co-owners in no way inconsistent with

common possession.

As held in Sediris Appuhamy v. James Appuhamy (1958) 60 NLR

297 at 302-303:

Every co-owner is in law entitled to his fractional share of

everything in the co-owned property including the soil as well

as the plantations, but in practice it is not possible for every co-

owner to enjoy his fractional share of every particle of sand

that constitutes the common property and every blade of grass

and every fruit from the trees growing on the land without

causing much inconvenience to himself as well as other co-

owners. To avoid this, for the sake of convenience, co-owners

possess different portions of the common land often out of

proportion to their fractional shares merely because of

improvements they have effected. That is what I understand

convenience of possession to mean and possession of a

specific portion of the common property for such a purpose

would certainly result in material advantage referred to by the

learned District Judge, In my opinion, the evidence in the case

does not justify a presumption of ouster. No doubt possession

of the separate lots A, B and C by Andiris and his heirs has

been for a very long period but this alone is insufficient to

establish title by prescription.

In Maria Fernando v. Anthony Fernando [1997] 2 Sri LR 356 it

was held that:

Long possession, payment of rates and taxes, enjoyment of

produce, filing suit without making the adverse party, a party,

preparing plan and building house on land and renting it are

not enough to establish prescription among co-owners in the

7

absence of an overt act of ouster. A secret intention to prescribe

may not amount to ouster.

I cited those authorities to say that even in cases where there

was strong evidence of long possession with clear boundaries,

the Courts have been loath to transform such possession to

prescriptive possession when it is among the co-owners. But the

facts are different in the instant case. The 3rd defendant in this

case did not give evidence on prescription. He stressed only on

the dismissal of the plaintiffs action in the previous case.

However, it is interesting to note that the 3rd defendant who

placed his complete confidence and reliance in the Judgment of

the previous case No. 531/L, did not at least mark a copy of that

Judgment in evidence!

The learned counsel for the 3rd defendant-appellant in his

written submissions states that: the said case had been

dismissed after considering the evidence of the parties on the

ground that the plaintiff had not proved his title. The defendants

prescriptive title had been admitted by the learned Trial Judge.

It is with regret I have to note that both those assertions are

factually incorrect. A photocopy of the Judgment of the said

case (which is not part of evidence) is found at pages 73-78 of

the Appeal Brief. I cannot find a copy of the plaint in the

previous case in the Brief. The said Judgment has been

delivered on 15.10.1982. According to the said Judgment the

present plaintiff has filed the above action against the 3rd

defendant in the instant case seeking declaration of title to the

same land which is the subject matter of this partition action.

The learned District Judge has dismissed that action on the

8

basis that, the 3rd defendant, according to his pedigree, has

undivided rights to the land, and therefore the plaintiffs action

cannot be maintained.6 In other words, the plaintiffs action has

been dismissed as the plaintiff has failed to prove that he is the

sole owner of the land. The prescriptive claim of the 3rd

defendant to Lot 1 in Plan No. 709 has been left unanswered on

the basis that answering that issue does not arise as the action

of the plaintiff is dismissed.7 No party has appealed against that

Judgment. In my view, it is wrong to say that the plaintiff was

the looser and the 3rd defendant of the present case was the

winner in that case. In my view, both were losers, and the

plaintiff, in consequence of that Judgment rightly filed this

partition action. Even though the 3rd defendant was not made a

party to this case by the plaintiff, the 3rd defendant was later

added as a party and filed a statement of claim and actively

participated in the trial.

There is no res judicata at all as the rights of the parties were

not adjudicated in the earlier case. If I may repeat, what the

learned District Judge stated in the Judgment of the other case

was that both the plaintiff and the 3rd defendant have undivided

rights to the land. But unfortunately, the 3rd defendant did not

produce his Deeds and claim his undivided rights in the

partition action. Instead, he sought dismissal of the partition

action on the strength of the said Judgment, and also, in the

alternative, claimed prescriptive rights to Lot 1 of the

Preliminary Plan without leading any evidence on prescription.

The Judgment of the said Land case was pronounced on

6 Vide penultimate paragraph of page 62 of the Brief. 7 Vide first paragraph of page 78 of the Brief.

9

15.10.1982 and the plaintiff filed this action on 18.06.1990-less

than 8 years after the Judgment of that case.

The Judgment of the District Court is affirmed and the appeal is

dismissed with costs.
