S. DEVIKA DE LIVERA TENNEKOON J.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) in

the instant case was indicted in the High Court of Chilaw on 24.11.2005 for the

following offence;

1) That on or about 17.11.1998 the Accused-Appellant caused the death

of one Walivitage Milton Hettiarachchi and thereby committing an

offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

The Appellant pleaded not guilty to the said charge and the Prosecution

commenced trial. The case for the prosecution was based on circumstantial

evidence along with a Section 27 recovery. The prosecution alleged that there

was an animosity between the deceased and the Appellant. There were no eye

witnesses to the alleged incident but the body of the deceased was found

300metres away from the Appellant's hut and blood spots patches were found

3

inter alia on the ground adjacent to the watch hut of the Appellant. PW3 JMO

who conducted the post-mortem testified that there were two stab injuries near

the left shoulder of the deceased and that there had been internal bleeding and

also that the heart and lungs were damaged.

In defence the Appellant opted to remain silent.

The learned High Court Judge pronounced judgment on 17.09.2014 and found

the Appellant guilty as charged and convicted and sentenced the Appellant to

death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the Appellant preferred the

instant Appeal to set-aside the said conviction and sentence on the grounds that

the;

a) Items of circumstantial evidence are wholly inadequate to support the

conviction,

b) Prosecution has failed to establish the identity of the corpus,

c) Learned High Court Judge has erred by applying the Ellenborough

Principle to the instant case,

d) The Judgement does not accord with the provisions of Section 283 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

Having perused the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 17.09.2014

it is pertinent to consider Primonly whether the said judgment does accord with

the provisions of Section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as submitted

by the learned Counsel for the Appellant and whether the learned Trial Judge

has discharged his judicial duties accordingly.

4

Section 283 states inter alia;

"The following provisions shall apply to the judgments of courts other

than the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal: -

(1) The judgment shall be written by the Judge who heard the case

and shall be dated and signed by him in open court at the time of

pronouncing it, and in case where appeal lies shall contain the

point or points for determination, the decision thereon, and the

reasons for the decision

(2) It shall specify the offence if any of which and the section of

law under which the accused is convicted and the punishment to

which he is sentenced.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that no evidence has been led

before the learned High Court Judge who delivered the judgment and further

that the evidence has not been formally adopted before him. The learned

Counsel for the Appellant further submits that the impugned judgment is only a

mere repetition of the evidence.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant rdies on the Case no: 62-64/2005

decided on 07.06.2011 (2011 ACJ 54) in which Ranjith Silva 1. held inter alia)'

"that a judgment which is only a repetition of evidence does not amount

to a judgment in terms of Section 283 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure."

5

In this light it is prudent to note the dicta in the following case;

Chandrasena and others V. Munaweera 1988(3) SLR 94 which held that;

"The mere outline of the prosecution and defence without reasons being

given for the decision is an insufficient discharge of duty cast upon a

judge by the provisions of S.306( 1).

The weight of authority is to the effect that the failure to observe the

imperative provisions of S.306 is a fatal irregularity."

In the case of Moses Vs. State 1993 (3) SLR 401 it was held that;

"(1) S. 203, s. 283 (1) - Make provision that the judgment shall be written

by the Judge who heard the case and shall be dated and signed by him. It

is a mandatory requirement - A duty is cast on the Judges to give reasons

for their decisions, as their decisions are subject to review by superior

courts."

In the case of Ibrahim Vs. Inspector of Police Ratnapura 59 NLR 235 it was

held that;

"Nowhere has the Magistrate given any reasons for his conclusions, nor

does he appear to have considered the evidence given by the appellant

and his witnesses. The learned Magistrate's omission to state the reasons

for his decision has deprived the appellant of his fundamental right to

have his-conviction reviewed by this Court and has thus occasioned a

failure of justice. \Vithout such reasons, it i:-; impossible for this Court to

6

judge whether the finding is right or wrong. 1 therefore set aside the

convictions and sentences and order a neyv trial."

In the case of C.A. Appeal No. 34-35/2005 decided on 03.04.2007 Sisira de

Abrew J held that;

"In this case the learned Trial Judge has merely narrated the evidence of

the prosecution witnesses without giving adequate reasons for his

conclusion and for the acceptance of the evidence of the prosecution. In

our view a judgment devoid of adequate reasons for the conclusion

reached and a mere reproduction of evidence of witnesses is not a

judgment in the eyes of the law. We find that the judgment of the learned

trial judge in this case is no judgment and would amount to a nullity."

In the same case W.L.R. Silva J held that;

"1 find that under the circumstances proVISIOn to Section 334 of the

Criminal Procedure Code and Article 138 of the Constitution cannot be

availed ot for the simple reason to affirm a judgment there must be a

proper judgment on existence, when there is no judgment and the

supposed judgment is a nullity in the face of law such a judgment cannot

affirmed. One cannot expect the Court of Appeal to rewrite the

judgments when the judgment pronounced by the learned High Court

Judge is a nullity.

The Judges of the Court of Appeal do not have the privilege of observing

the deportment and the demeanour of witnesses. Therefore, one cannot

expect the Court of Appeal to evaluate the evidence of the witnesses in

7

the proper sense. Therefore for the reasons 1 have stated above and by my

brother Judge Justice Sisira de Abrew. I am of the view that the

conviction cannot be allowed to stand and the judgment should be set

aside. We make order that this case be sent back for re-trial."

The instant appeal is based on circumstantial evidence. In the case of The

Queen Vs. K. A. Santin Singho 65 NLR 445 it was held that;

"In a case of circumstantial evidence, a direction given by the trial Judge,

in his summing-up, that the accused person must explain each and every

circumstance established by the prosecution is wrong and would

completely negative a direction given earlier by him that the

circumstances must not only be consistent with the accused person's guilt

but should also be inconsistent with his innocence.

The direction that if a prima facie case is made out the accused is bound

to explain is wrong and misleading."

In the instant appeal the impugned judgment of the learned Trial Judge dated

17.09.2014 is one which merely narrates the evidence elucidated before the trial

and a final paragraph merely states that the evidence against the Appellant and

therefore finds the Appellant guilty as charged.

The learned DSG submits that the learned High Court Judge has clearly

evaluated the evidence led before him and had decided to convict the Accused.

However, I cannot accept this contention. In I ight of the above dicta I am of the

view that the impugned judgment is bad in lavv.

8

When evaluating circumstantial evidence it is a well-established principle that if

an inference of guilt is to be drawn from circumstantial evidence it must be the

one and only irresistible and inescapable conclusion that the accused committed

the offence. This \vas discussed in the following cases;

In the case of AG Vs. Potta Naufer & others 2007(2) SLR 144 Thilakawardena

J held that;

'When relying on circumstantial evidence to establish the charge of

conspiracy to commit murder and the charge of murder, the proved items

of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point

towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence.'

In the case of Kusumadasa Vs. State 2011(1) SLR 240 Sisira de Abrew J has

held that;

'The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had

the opportunity of committing the offence. The accused can be found

guilty only and only if the proved items of circumstantial evidence lS

consistent with their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence.'

Also in the case of Sarath Fernando V s. Attorney General 2014 (1) SLR 16 it

was held that;

'In order to justify the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial

evidence the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence

of the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable

hypothesis than that of his gui It.'

9

In Premawansha V. Attorney General 2009 (2) SLR 205 relied by the learned sse for the Respondent Sisira de Abrew J has held that;

'In a case of circumstantial evidence if an inference of guilt is to be

drawn, such an inference must be the one and only irresistible and

inescapable conclusion that the accused committed the offence'

Therefore, in the instant appeal if the Appellant is to be found guilty it had to be

the one and only inference that could have been drawn from the circumstantial

evidence against the Appellant. As correctly submitted by the learned Counsel

for the Appellant no evidence has been led by the prosecution to the effect that

the deceased was seen in the company of the Appellant on or about the day on

which the alleged murder took place.

It is trite law that the burden of proof is on the prosecution. As discussed in the

case of The Queen Vs. K. A. Santin Singho 65 NLR 447;

"It is fundamental that the burden of proof is on the prosecution. Whether

the evidence the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the

burden is the same. This burden is not altered by the failure of the

appellant to give evidence and explain the circumstances."

It is prudent to note that in the case of Queen Vs. Sumanasena 66 NLR 351 it

was opined that;

"Suspicious circumstances do not establ ish guilt. Nor does the proof of

any number of suspicious circul11stanci..'s relieve the prosecution of its

10

burden of proving the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt

and compel the accused to give or call evidence... The burden of

establishing circumstances which not only establish the accused's guilt

but are also inconsistent with his innocence remains on the prosecution

throughout the trial"

In the instant Appeal the learned Trial Judge has not come to the finding that the

prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. The learned Trial

Judge has simply narrated the evidence and states that;

It is apparent therefore that the learned Trial Judge has arrived at the conclusion

of guilt of the Appellant on the basis that there is evidence to that effect and not

on the basis that and not the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable

doubt. This Court is of the vievv that impugned judgment is bad in law.

11

The next question this Court has to detennine is whether this matter should be

ordered for a re-trial. The learned Counsel for the Appellant relies on the

following case;

W.N. Ratnasuriya Vs. The Hon. Attorney General (C.A. 58/2005 deceided

on 19.12.2008) in which the Court of Appeal refused to order a re-trial on the

grounds that 10 years have lapsed since the commission of the offence.

The case of Ahamad Lebbe Noor lYIahamed and others Vs. Republic of Sri

Lanka (C.A. No. 158 - 159 1 2002 deceided on 16.06.2006) in which it was

held that;

"the alleged incident has taken place more than ] 7 years ago. In the

interest of justice, I agree with the counsel for the accused -appellant that

the case should not be sent for re-trial. Thus, I set aside the conviction

and acquit all the accused - appellants."

The case of Jagath Chandana Weerasinghe Vs. The Commision to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery and Corrupotion (C.A. No. 316/2007) which held that;

"The reasons why a re-trial is not orders; firstly, the offence was

committed about 10 years ago and the convition is in 2007, now four

years. Secondly this Court will not provide an opportunity to the

prosecution to cover their gaps."

In the instant case it is clear that the offence alleged to have been committed by

the Appellant had been committed in 1998 which is almost 20 years ago and the

conviction on 17.09.2014 was entered more than 3 years ago.

12

When perusing the original case record it appears that the Appellant has been in

remand custody for more than 10 years. Under these circumstances we are not

inclined to send this case for re - trial in the interests of justice.

Therefore, in the circumstances as morefully discussed above this appeal is

allowed and the judgment of the learned Trial Judge dated 17.09.2014 is set

aside and the Accused - Appellant is hereby acquitted.

We wish to place on record that we appreciate the well - researched written

submissions of Rasika Lasantha Samarawickrama the learned Counsel assigned

for the Appellant.

Appeal Allowed.
