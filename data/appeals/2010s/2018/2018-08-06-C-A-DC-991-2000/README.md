Decided On: 03.08.2018

E.A.G.R. Amarasekara. J.

The 1st Defendant" Appellant filed this appeal against the Judgement in the Partition

case No. 11979 in the Kandy District Court dated 31.10.2000 praying inter alia;

"

4

a) That the portion of the Judgement of the learned trial Judge excluding Lot 3

in Plan 'X' from the corpus sought to be partitioned be set aside.

b) That Lot 3 in the said plan be declared a part of the corpus to be partitioned

in this case.

c) For cost and such other further reliefs as this court shall seem meet.

Thus, it is clear that the Appellant is not dissatisfied with the learned District Judge's

reasonings with regard to the pedigree and the share entitlements.

The Deceased Plaintiff filed the aforesaid action No. 11979 P seeking a partition of

the land called 'Maddegodahena' of two amunums paddy sowing in extent. As per

the Plaint and the title deeds marked at the trial)t was bounded as follows;

North By Dissanekgadera Hena, and Vihara Hena

East By Ela

South By Yalwela Kumbura

West By Sagama Vihare Hena (vide deeds marked as 'all' to 'al9', '1)4' and

schedule to the Plaint.).

This court observes that in the plaint and the deed marked al 4 the western

boundary is described as Vihare Kumbura.

However, as per the aforesaid boundaries, land sought to be partitioned has to be

bounded on the North and West by lands belongs to a temple ('Viharaya').

A commission was issued and the preliminary plan no. 199 marked as X and the

report marked as Xl were prepared by S.M.K.B Mawalagadera, Licensed Surveyor.

According to the aforesaid report marked as Xl, the Plaintiff has shown lot 1,2,4,5,6

as the land sought to be partitioned and further stated that Lot 3 belongs to the

5

temple while the 1st Defendant claimed Lot 3 as part of the land sought to be

partitioned. The report further reveals that the 5th Defendant, Napana Saranankara

Thero too claimed Lot 3 as part of the temple land.

If Lot 3 in the preliminary plan marked X does not belong to the corpus, but to the

temple land, the description of the boundaries in Plan No. 54552 (552) showing

'Meddegodahena' (Meddegodahena is the name of the land sought to be

partitioned) comprising the Southern and Southwestern boundaries of the land

depicted there in (temple land) becomes more compatible. On the other hand, as

mentioned before, in the plaint and the title deeds, the Northern boundary to the

corpus is described as Dissanekgadera Hena and Vihara Hena (temple land) while

the Western boundary is described as Vihara Hena (temple land) but in the

preliminary Plan Dissanekgadera Hena is found more towards the North East. If

the location of Dissanekgadera Hena in Preliminary Plan is considered as the

Northern boundary, while treating Lot 3 as the temple land (not as part of the

corpus) it will tally with the description of boundaries to the corpus in title deeds

as well as in the schedule to the plaint.

If Lot 3 in the preliminary plan is considered as part of the corpus the temple land

becomes the boundary of the corpus more towards the North but not to the North

and West as described in the title deeds and the plaint. Furthermore, when Lot 3

is considered as part of the corpus (Meddegodhena), Meddegodahena may not

become a part of the Southwest boundary of the Temple land as described in 552.

The Plaintiff, though he tried to change his stance while giving evidence, has stated

in Xl (preliminary Plan Report) to the surveyor that Lot 3 forms part of the land

belonging to the Temple. The surveyor has also reported that the 1st Defendant

claimed Lot 3 as part of the corpus. In such a backdrop, this court cannot think

that the surveyor misreported what the Plaintiff stated to him during the

preliminary survey. Due to the aforesaid circumstances the Plaintiff is not a reliable

6

witness to prove that Lot 3 of Plan X is part of the corpus. Even though 1st Defendant

in his evidence has stated that Lot 3 is part of the corpus, as mentioned before the

description of boundaries in the title deeds, 5V2 and the plaint show that what is

more probable is that Lot 3 is not part of the corpus. On the other hand, other than

her mere statement she has not adduced any material to show that Lot 3 is part of

the corpus, but the 5th Defendant has taken steps to survey the disputed area and

superimpose plan no. 54552 (552) which shows the temple landsJand preliminary

Plan (X). The licensed surveyor C.B. Elangasinghe who did the said survey and

superimposition also has given evidence to show that Lot 3 is temple land.

The 1st Defendant argues that superimposition is not worth .. any consideration

since the surveyor has not surveyed the entire land belong to the temple. If a

surveyor is able to identify the existing boundaries of the disputed area and to

establish the boundaries as per the plans to be superimposed by identifying the

boundary marks or descriptions in those plans, I do not see any obstacle to produce

an acceptable superimposition. The Licensed surveyor Elangasinghe in his 551

report has stated that he identified the land using the following factors;

1. A footpath which has now become a high road.

2. Dasanakgedara Watta alias Dissanekgadera Watta and Arachchige

Meddegodahena which are situated west to that said road.

No cross examination was done or evidence led to show that those factors are not

sufficient to identify the disputed boundaries of the temple land. However, the

surveyor himself has admitted that the correctness of his superimposition is 50%.

Thus, as per the superimposition there is a possibility of 50% for Lot 3 to be a part

of temple land. It is the duty of the parties who ask for a partition to prove the

identity of the corpus. If the superimposition establishes that there is a possibility

of 50% for the disputed Lot 3 to be a part of temple land, the 1st Defendant's mere

statement cannot prove on balance of probability that Lot 3 is part of the corpus to

be partitioned. For the foregoing reasons, I cannot find fault with the findings of

the learned District Judge to exclude Lot 3 from the partition even though there is

,

7

a misstatement in his judgement stating that the 1st Defendant showed Lot 3 to

the commissioner as part of the temple land. In fact, as said before, it was the

Plaintiff who had stated so. The 1st Defendant further argues that the learned

District Judge has not answered the issue No. 25 raised on 24.07.1998 but this court

finds that issue No. 23 raised on 16.05.1997 is materially the same.

The learned District Judge has answered the issue number 23 in the affirmative.

Thus, the answer to issue No. 25 is contained in the answer to issue No. 23.

Hence, I do not see any reason to grant relief as prayed for in the petition of appeal.

Therefore, this appeal is dismissed with costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
