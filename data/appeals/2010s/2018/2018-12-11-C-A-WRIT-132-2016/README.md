Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Thisya Weragoda for the Petitioner.

Manohara Jayasinghe, S.C., for the 1st

Respondent.

Decided on: 10.12.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application naming two respondents

seeking to issue (a) a writ of certiorari to quash the decision in

P9, (b) a writ of mandamus directing the 1st respondent to

reappoint the petitioner to the post of Superintendent

(Covering)-Sri Lanka Railway Security Service, and (c) a writ of

mandamus directing the 1st respondent to re-evaluate the

allocated marks shown in the mark sheet A6(c) utilizing the

marks shown in A6(a) and A6(b) and thereafter prepare a fresh

seniority list for the Sri Lanka Railway Security Service.

The petitioner and the 2nd respondent have faced the interview

for the Assistant Superintendents-Sri Lanka Railway Security

Service. It is common ground that the interview was to be held

according to the procedure set out in A3. A6(a) is the results of

the written examination. A6(b) is the results of the first

interview. A6(c) is the results of the final interview. The

impugned decision P9 is based on A6(c).

Until P9, the petitioner was holding the post of Superintendent

(Covering) of the Sri Lanka Railway Security Service, and the 2nd

3

respondent was holding the post of Deputy Superintendent

(Covering) of the Sri Lanka Railway Security Service. But by P9,

the 2nd respondent was appointed as the Superintendent

(Covering) of the Sri Lanka Railway Security Service, and the

petitioner was appointed as the Deputy Superintendent

(Covering) of the Sri Lanka Railway Security Service.

At the first interview, out of 10 marks, only 5 marks were given

to the 2nd respondent for attendance, performance and

conduct, and full 10 marks were given to the petitioner. At this

interview the 2nd respondent was not recommended for the

promotion, as the petitioner himself admits in the written

submissions, due to certain disciplinary inquiry pending

against the 2nd respondent at that time.

By the time the final interview was held, the 2nd respondent had

been exonerated from the disciplinary inquiry, according to

paragraph 21 of the petition, at the instance of the then

Secretary of the Ministry of Transport (who seems to me to be

the disciplinary authority according to the Establishment Code).

Upon such clearance, all his salary increments have also been

given. Therefore, the final interview panel has given full 10

marks for the 2nd respondent for attendance, performance and

conduct and recommended the 2nd respondent for promotion.

When 10 marks were given to the 2nd respondent as such for

attendance, performance and conduct, the cumulative marks

of the 2nd respondent exceeded those of the petitioner.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that

It was not open to the 4 member structured interview panel (final

interview panel) to alter or amend the marks allocated by the 3

member panel (first interview panel) without the consent of the 3

4

member panel allocated with the task of awarding marks for

attendance, performance and conduct, and therefore the said

alteration of marks was illegal, unlawful and ultra vires the

powers of the said 4 member structured interview panel and

therefore is null and void ab initio.

I am unable to agree with this submission. According to A3, the

three-member panel is not the ultimate deciding authority to

award marks for attendance, performance and conduct.

According to A3, for attendance, performance and conduct, the

General Manager of Railways will allocate marks upon the

recommendation of the three-member panel and submit it to the

board of interview. (, :

only make a recommendation and not a decision. Hence, the

argument that the final interview panel cannot change the

marks given by three-member panel is devoid of merit.

The final interview panel comprising of the General Manager of

Railways as the Chairman has done nothing wrong by giving 10

marks at the final interview to the 2nd respondent as by that

time the 2nd respondent had been cleared from all the charges

and granted all the increments.

It is relevant note that the General Manager of Railways who was

the Chairman of the final interview panel was a member of the

first interview panel as an Additional General Manager at that

time.

According to R6, which consists of 4 documents, the purported

allegations levelled against the 2nd respondent are baseless.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs.
