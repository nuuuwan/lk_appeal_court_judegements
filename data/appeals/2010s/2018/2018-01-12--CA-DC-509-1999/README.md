In this case the Plaintiff-Respondent originally filed a

partition action seeking to partition the land called

" Kumbukepotha" . The original plaint was subsequently amended

by plaint dated 30.11.1987. The preliminary plan No.975

marked as X prepared by R.B.Nawarathna License Surveyor had

depicted the corpus as Lots 1 and 2 having extent of 2 Acres

1Rood and 31 Perches.

3

It is to be noted that the corpus is a paddy field. The

Defendant-Appellant in this appeal had mainly contested the

issue that he is claiming prescription over the said land by virtue

of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. The Defendant-

Appellant had relied on documents 1 VI and 1 V2. It is also to be

noted that the Additional District Judge had taken into

consideration documents 1 V3 and 1 V4 submitted by the

Defendant-Appellant.

The first enactment elating to prescription was the

proclamation of 22.01.1801 later regulation of 13 of 1822

repealed the earlier proclamations and regulations. The present

Prescription Ordinance No.22 of 1871 was passed amending the

earlier legal provision.

Betram C.J. in Thilekerathna Vs. Bastian observed that

"our Prescription Ordinance of 1871 constitutes a complete code

and though not doubt we have to consider any satisfactory

enactments in the light of the principles of t..l,.e common law, it

will be seen that the terms of our own Ordinance are so positive

that the principles of Common Law do not require to be taken in

to account.

This decision bears testimony in the case of Therunnanse

Vs. Menike (1 NLR 200) where it had been held that Roman

Dutch law relating to prescription has been swept away by

legislation.

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance No.22 of 1871

reads as follows:-

Proof of undisturbed and uninterrupted possession

by a defendant in any action, or by those under

whom he claims, of lands or immovable property, by

a title adverse to or independent of that of the

claimant or plaintiff in such action ( that is to say, a

possession unaccompanied by payment of rent or

produce, or performance of service or duty, or by

any other act by the possessor, from which an

acknowledgement of a right existing in another

person would fairly and naturally be inferred) for ten

years previous to the bringing of such action, shall

entitle the defendant to a decree in his favour with

costs. And in like manner, when any plaintiff shall

bring his action, or any third party shall intervene

in any action for the purpose of being quieted in his

possession of lands or other immovable property, or

to prevent encroachment or usurpation thereof, or

to establish his claim in any other manner to such

land or other property, proof of such undisturbed

and uninterrupted possession as herein before

explained, by such plaintiff or intervenient, or by

those under whom he claims, shall entitle such

plaintiff or intervenient to a decree in his favour

with cost:

Provided that the said period of ten years shall only

being to run against parties claiming estates in

remainder or reversion from the time when the

parties so claiming acquired a right of possession to

the property in dispute.

There were 2 admissions vide page 75 of the appeal brief.

The Plaintiff -Respondent has raised 4 issues and the Defendant

-Appellant had raised 3 issues and the 4th Defendant had not

raised any issues in this respect. The main issue that had been

raised by the Defendant-Appellant is issue No.5 on which he

claims prescriptive title. The trial proceeded on these issues and

the learned District Judge delivered the judgment on

13/07 / 1999. Page 4 of the judgment in the appeal brief gives

the breakdown of the shares allocated to the Plaintiff -

Respondent and 1st to 4th Defendants in which the 1st Defendant-

Appellant had been allocated 4/ 18th of the shares. Being

6

aggrieved by the said order of the learned District Judge this

appeal is preferred mainly by the 1 st Defendant-Appellant.

It is observed by the learned trial Judge that if the 1 st and

the 2nd Defendants in order to establish prescriptive title the

burden is on them to prove the ingredients of prescription as

stated in Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance vide page 5

second para of the judgment. Further the learned District Judge

had observed that the Plaintiff has asserted that during the

period of 1950 to 1982 the Plaintiff and the 1 st to 3rd defendants

had cultivated this paddy field. And further he has asserted that

the preliminary work on the paddy field had been done by them

jointly and the yield or the harvest had been shared by them.

In order to prove their long period of possession the 1 st and

2nd Defendant has called 4 witnesses. 1 st witness in his evidence

he had said that the 1 st and 2nd Defendants had cultivated this

land and possessed it and that the Plaintiff had no claim to the

said paddy field. The 1 st Defendant had called Ukkuwa and a

retired Cultivation Officer Albert Marasignhe. In their evidence

they have asserted that they are unaware of the facts regarding

possession either of the Plaintiff or the Defendants. The learned

trial judge has analyzed this evidence and had come to the

conclusion that the witnesses called by the 1 st and 2nd

Defendants has failed to testify in favor of the 1 st and 2nd

Defendants.

In the light of the above evidence it is amply clear that

the Defendant-Appellant had not discharged the burden of proof

as required by law, especially in an assertion of prescriptive title.

In the case of Maria Perera Vs Albert Perera (1983

(20 SLR 399) G.P.S. de Silva J. as he then was held that the

possession of a co-owner would not become adverse to the rights

of the other co-owners until there is an act of ouster or

something equivalent to ouster.

As regards the burden of proof under the Prescription

Ordinance, in the case of Gunasekera vs. Tissera ( 1994 (3)

SLR 245) M.D.H. Fernando J after considering a series of

judgments including the decisions of Corea Vs Isreris

Appuhamy ( 15 NLR 65) and Brito Vs Muthunayagam ( 20

NLR 327) held that if any person wants to succeed he must meet

the requirement of the high order of proof to establish adverse

possession and the burden of proof vests entirely upon the co-

owner who seeks to claim prescriptive title against the other

co-owners.

8

The learned trial judge in evaluating the evidential value of

1 VI and 1 V2 had observed that the corpus in dispute

Kumbukepoththa Kumbura is a different paddy field owned by

the 1st and the 2nd Defendants. This had been revealed by the

evidence of the 1 st Defendant. This had been revealed by the

evidence of the 1 st Defendant. Page 7 appeal brief. In the light of

the above evidence the trial judge has doubted the veracity of

1 V 1 and 1 V2. Furthermore the extracts of the register of the

agrarian lands that had been produced pertains only to 1987. In

the light of this piece of the above evidence the Judge had

doubted the veracity of IVI and IV2.further more the extracts of

the Registrar of the Agrarian Lands that had been produced

pertains only to 1987. In the light of this piece of evidence the

Judge has very clear stated that the 1 st and 2nd Defendants did

not have possession before 1987.

I t is also to be observed that the Appellate Courts will not

interfere with the finding of facts arrived at by the trial judge

unless perverse of not supported by evidence:

18 NLR 382 , 20 NLR 282 (PC) 54 NLR 102

(PC) ISLR (1993) (SC) /SC (CHC)No.43/2010

decided on 5 th August 1913.

9

In the light of the above circumstances, we see no

reason to interfere with the findings of the learned District Judge.

Appeal stand dismissed and parties will have their shares

allocated as described in the judgment of the learned District

Judge.
