ORDER

P Pad man Surasena J

The Petitioner and the Respondent of this application are two rival parties

in the instant case which is a proceeding instituted under section 66 (1) (b)

of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into the complaint, had

pronounced its order.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Primary Court

Judge, the Petitioner had filed an application for revision in the Provincial

High Court of Central Province holden in Kandy seeking a revision of the

order of the Primary Court.

The Provincial High Court after hearing refused the said revision application

by its order dated 2017-05-05.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner conceded at the outset that an appeal

has also been filed in respect of the same matter i.e. against the said

4

judgment of the Provincial High Court.! It was his submission that the

purpose of filing this revision application despite the pending appeal is to

obtain the interim relief prayed for in the prayers of this petition.

In the case of Jayantha Gunasekara V Jayatissa Gunasekara and others2

this Court had held that mere lodging in the Court of Appeal, an appeal

against a judgment of the High Court in the exercise of its revisionary

power in terms of article 154 P (3) (b) of the Constitution, does not

automatically stay the execution of the order of the High Court. A passage

from that judgment which would be relevant here is as follows.

" .... Obviously, to put off the execution process until the appeal is heard

would tantamount to prolong the agony and to let the breach of peace to

continue for a considerable length of time. This in my opinion cannot be

the remedy the Parliament has clearly decided upon. Hence, I am confident

that the construction we are mindful of placing by this judgment would

definitely suppress the mischief and subtle inventions and evasions for

continuance of the mischief .... "

Since there is an appeal, pending before this Court it is open for the

parties to have their rights adjudicated by this Court in that appeal.

When there is a right of appeal provided for by law, an applicant in a

revision application must show the existence of exceptional circumstances

for any intervention by a revisionary Court. This Court cannot accept the

grounds urged in the petition as exceptional circumstances as they are

mere grounds of appeal upon which the petition of appeal may have been

lodged.

In these circumstances, this Court sees no basis to issue notices on the

Respondents.

, The revision application should stand dismissed.
