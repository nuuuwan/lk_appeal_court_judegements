She said that on the day of the incident she was at her place with her child and her sister's children. She received calls from a known person called Sriyani, to show her house at Siripala Pinto's place for a tenant. She went there with her child and brother in Suresh's three-wheeler. On the way she had bought milk powder for her child and proceeded towards Siripala Pinto place. There she had seen Sriyani on the road and slow down to stop the three-wheeler, before it was stopped IP Rangajeeva and another officer got into the three-wheeler from both side and directed the driver to proceed without stop. IP Rangajeeva had told her that you know who I am, and asked her where is it and take it, take it. She then asked him what is it and said she doesn't have anything. Then he had scolded her in filth and asked the three-wheeler driver to stop at the tea kiosk near the petrol shed. He had assaulted the appellant and inquired about the heroin. The appellant had said she is two months pregnant and she doesn't have anything. They inquired about Kumara who sells Heroin, the appellant had said that she know him as a money lender and she had borrowed money from him. She was assaulted and subject to scolding. Then she was asked to call Kumara to come there to collect money, Kumara had told her that he is busy and come later, after several calls he had said that he is in Kandy and cannot come. Thereafter IP Rangajeeva had decided to take her to PNB. She said that she was not taken to her home, officials took her brother. She claims that she was arrested at about 11 am and taken to PNB after 4pm. She categorically denies the fact that she was arrested near Zainstan and",
