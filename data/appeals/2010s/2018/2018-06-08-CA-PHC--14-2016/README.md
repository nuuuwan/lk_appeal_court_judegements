The Applicant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'Appellant')

filed a maintenance action against the Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the 'respondent') on the 10th of September 2013 seeking

a sum of Rs. 80,000 per month from the respondent. The Learned Magistrate held

with the appellant and ordered the respondent to pay her Rs. 15,000 per month in

order dated 2ih November 2014. Aggrieved by the said order, the respondent filed

a revision application. The Learned High Court judge allowed the revision

application and set aside the order of the Learned Magistrate in order dated 29th

February 2016. Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned High Court

Judge, the appellant has preferred the instant appeal in this court.

Facts of the case

The appellant (a divorcee with a child) and the respondent had married on or about

the 26th of October 2006 and thereafter had refused to maintain the appellant or

even pay rent for the premises they were living in the appellant had then filed a

maintenance action in the Magistrate's Court. Evidence was led with respect to the

assets owned by the respondent and that the appellant had given up her job due to

the pressure by the respondent and no income of her own. The respondent

maintained that the appellant had been living in adultery and therefore not entitled

to maintenance by the respondent.

The respondent in his evidence had stated that after his marriage he had rented out

a house in Pelawatte for the appellant and her child and had also purchased a motor

car for her usc. He also stated that the appellant had refused to have sexual

intercourse with him until he purchased a house in her name. The respondent has

3

latcr on rented out several other houses for the appellant as well and had paid rent

each month. He had also provided the appellant with her day to day expenses in

addition to the payment of the rent. The respondent, in his evidence-in-chief

further stated that even by 2010, the appellant was still refusing to have sexual

intercourse with him.

In 2013, the respondent had discovered that the appellant was having an extra

marital relationship with the elder son of the landlord, Rasika Premabandu, of the

house she was living in at that time in Dodamgahahena. According to witness

Piyasiri Premabandu (father of Rasika Premabandu), he had seen with his own

eyes his son come out of the annex rented out to the appellant. The appellant had

then been evicted and moved to another annex located 2km away, and then he had

been informed that his son had been visiting that annex as well. He had then gone

vvith his wife to the annex to find his son's motor bike parked outside and his

slippers. He had also seen his son going upstairs at that time.

The Learned Magistrate held that the first incident was direct evidence while the

second was circumstantial evidence it was highly improbable that mere fact that a

bike and slippers was sighted could not substantiate the act of adultery and

awarded Rs. 15,000 a month to the appellant.

The respondent then filed a revision application in the High Court citing inter alia

that the appellant was living in adultery and therefore was not entitled to

maintenance. The Learned High Court Judge held that the findings of the Learned

Magistrate were contrary to the evidence and reversed the findings.

In Proviso of Section 2(1) of the Maintenance Act No 37 of 1999, it is stated that

a woman will not be entitled to maintenance if she is living in adultery.

4

The Learned Counsel for the appellant quoting 'Law and the Marriage

Relationship' by Shiranee Ponnambalam submits that for a woman to be not

entitled to maintenance since she is living in adultery, there should be continuous

adultery and not a few stray incidents, and there also has to be a substantial period

of time and adulterous activities proven. The burden of proving this is placed on

the person alleging such adultery.

It is also submitted that both instances of adultery are highly circumstantial. These

circumstantial inferences have been denied by the appellant at all stages and does

not establish that the appellant was living in adultery, therefore, the respondent is

not released from his duty of maintaining his wife.

The Learned Counsel also submits that the respondent's reliance of the Ebert V

Ebert (22 NLR 310) to substantiate the respondent's allegation is misconceived in

this case as it deals with the husband's adultery (where only evidence of one

instance of adultery is sufficient). The case puts forward a three-part test;

(a) Guilty affection

(b) Opportunity and

(c ) desertion of the lawful wife.

It is submitted that the appellant is not guilty of any of the above except for a weak

inference of opportunity and it is the respondent who is guilty of desiring his

lawful wife.

The Learned Counsel for the respondent submits the case of Ebert v Ebert 22

NLR 310 where the Supreme Court held that evidence of sexual intercourse where

the relationship is adulterous is extremely rare. This case goes on to show by

necessary implication that it is almost an impossible and uphill task for the

5

innocent spouse to come up with direct/substantial evidence of the guilty spouse

engaging in sexual intercourse in an adulterous relationship. As such betrayal in

the said manner of having sexual intercourse with another while in marriage

wedlock being a very painful experience to the innocent spouse, it is nothing but a

bonus if the innocent spouse can uncover and brinK out direct/circumstantial

evidence of the guilty spouse living in adultery to the satisfaction of the Court

which will then help the innocent party to withhold maintenance. The counsel

submits that this has been exhibited in both the Magistrate's Court and the High

Court.

The Counsel submits that the finding of the Learned Magistrate that the evidence

in the second incident considered as circumstantial is erroneous. Further submitted

that in both incidents, the evidence is strong direct evidence since the witness

Piyasiri Premabandu states that he saw with his own eyes his son coming out from

the annex leased out to the appellant and even in the second incident, he states that

he saw his son going upstairs in the appellant's new amlE'Y. Th.: Counsel also

stresses on the fact that when the witness had followed his son's trail to the new

annex, the landlord himself had stated that Rasika Premabandu had visited the

annex several times before as well. Thus this is direct evidence that the appellant

had taken in Rasika Premabandu several times into the annex proving that she had

been leading a life of continuous adultery.

In Arumugam V Athai 50 NLR 310, the Supreme Court held that to disentitle an

order of maintenance, it is to be proved that the wife is leading a life of continuous

adulterous conduct. Basnayake J declared that 1/ 'living in adultelY' in Section 4 of

the l'vJaintenance Ordinance refers to a course of guilty conduct and not to a single

lapse of virtue". Considering available evidence, respondent has not adequately

proved that, in fact, the appellant was living 111 adultery though there is some

6

evidence to the effect that one Rasika Premabandu had visited her twice. Though

Rasika's father claims that the landlord of the appellant mentioned that Rasika was

a frequent visitor, the landlord has not given evidence to that effect.

In the case of Balasingham v Kalaivany (1986) 2 Sri. LR 378,

"Several decisions of our Supreme Court have considered and constructed the

meaning of S. 05 of the Maintenance Ordinance. The effect of these decisions is

that where a husband seeks to cancel an order for maintenance in favour of his

wife on the ground that she "is living in adultelY" he must; to obtain an order of

cancellation, establish that,

(i) the wife is guilty of a more or less continuous course of adulterous

conduct and not mere(), isolated acts of adultery - there being a clear

distinction betlveen living in adultery and committing adultery. Vide

AruJ1lugam v At/wi and Pushpawatlzy v Santhirasegarampillai and that

(if) the wife was so living in adullery at the time the application for a

cancellation of the order was nzade. Vide Simo Nona v 1'rfelias Singlto,

Wijesinghe v Josi Nonll(supra) and Puslzpawathy v

Santhirasegarampilllli(supra). "

In the case of Selliah v Sinnammah (1947) 48 NLR 26, it was held that

'when allegation is made under section 4 of the l'vlaintenance Ordinance that the

wife is living in adultelY the burden is on the husband to prove that fact '.

In the case of Reginahamy v Johna (1914) 17 NLR 376, it was held that

7

/

/ "if a husband choses to let the marriage tie remain in 5Jpite of adultelY on the part

of his wife, and the wife from choice or necessity returns to an honourable life, the

husband's liabilities unquestionably revive."

Therefore, considering the above we are of the VieW that the order of the

~fagistrate is in accordance with the law by allowing the maintenance to be paid to

the appellant.

Accordingly the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo is set aside

and hereby the appeal is allowed.

Registrar is directed to send a copy of the Judgment to the relevant High Court of

Colombo.
