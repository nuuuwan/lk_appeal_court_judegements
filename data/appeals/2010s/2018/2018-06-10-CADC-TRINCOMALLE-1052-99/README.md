This appeal is against the order dated 17.05.1999 of the learned District

Judge of Trincomalee wherein the learned District Judge dismissed the

action filed by the two Plaintiff-Appellants (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as Plaintiffs). Both Plaintiffs by their plaint dated 06.06.1994

instituted this action for a declaration of title' and ejectment of the

Defendants on the grounds more fully described in the plaint therein.

The case of the Plaintiffs in the District Court had been conducted on the

basis that the Plaintiffs became the owner of the subject matter

described in the schedule by virtue of their relationship with the original

" owner one Ranmanike who had adopted the 1 st Plaintiff. At the forefront

of this rei vindicatio action before the learned District Judge was the

issue whether the 1 st Plaintiff became the owner of the land in question

through the said Ranmanike. The 1 st Plaintiff gave evidence and asserted

that he was adopted by the said Ranmanike who passed away in 1990.

By Deed No: 1520 executed in 1993 the 1st Plaintiff transferred this land

to his daughter, the 2nd Plaintiff. Having regard to the evidence placed

, before the District Court the learned District Judge has come to a finding

that the 1 st Plaintiff has not established her title on a balance of

probabilities before him. In a rei vindicatio action it is imperative on the

part of a plaintiff to establish his/her title and once this title is

established the burden shifts to the defendant to establish the lawfulness

of his/her possession. The fact that the rei vindicatio is an action in rem

was emphasized in Allis Appu v. Endris Hamy (1894) 3 S.C.C 87.

The burden of establishing title devolves on the plaintiff. The significance

of this requirement is that, where the plaintiff fails to prove title in

himself, judgment in the vindicatory action will be given in favour of the

defendant, even though the latter has also not been able to establish

title. In de Silva v. Goonetilleke 32 N.L.R 217- a decision of a Bench of

four Judges - Macdonell C.J. said; "There is abundant authority that a

party claiming a declaration of title must have title himself. The

authorities unite in holding that the plaintiff must show title to the

corpus in dispute and that, if he cannot, the action will not lie." Once title

is established by the plaintiff, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant

to prove that he has a right to possession or occupation of the property.

Though both appellants seek to impugn the finding of the learned

District Judge on issue number 01 namely; whether the 1 st Plaintiff was

the owner of the premises in question the Appellants are not able to

show any item of evidence which conclusively tilts the question of

ownership in the 1st Plaintiffs favour. Except for the bare assertion that

the 1 st Plaintiff-Appellant was adopted by the original owner and

Ranmanike had passed her title to the 1 st Plaintiff in this case, there is

nothing to show that title of Ranmanike devolved on the 1 st Plaintiff.

There are several modes of acquisition of immovable property, such as

inheritance, prescription and paper title that could. establishe at the trial

but this court is of the opinion that none of the modes of acquisition of

immovable property has been established on a balance of probabilities

before the District Judge of Trincomalee. There is: a deeming provision in

the Adoption of Children Ordinance that whenever someone is adopted

in accordance with the provisions of the Adoption of Children Ordinance,

he is deemed to be the: son or daughter of the adoptive parent. Section

6(3) of the Adoption of Children Ordinance states 'as follows:-

"Upon an adoption order being made, the ad,opted child shall for all

purposes whatsoever be deemed in law to be the child born in

lawful wedlock of the adopter:

Provided, however, that unless the contrary intention clearly

appears from any instrument (whether such instrument takes

effect inter vivos or mortis causa), such adopted child shall not by

such adoption -

(a) acquire any right, title or interest in any property

(i) developing on any child of the adopter by virtue of any

instrument executed prior to the date of the adoption

order: or

(ii) devolving on the heirs ab intestate of any child born In

lawful wedlock of the adopter;

(b) become entitled to any succession (whether by will or ab

intestate) jure 'representationis the adopter."

I

Even this deeming provision was not satisfied before the learned District

Judge of Trincomalee. No paper title was ever pleaded or established

before the learned District Judge.

In the circumstances, this court has no reason to interfere with the

answer given to the pivotal issue raised in this case namely, whether the

1 st Plaintiff-Appellant had title to the subject matter in question.

Therefore the 1 st Plaintiff couldn't have passed any title to the 2nd Plaintiff

(his daughter).

In the circumstances this court proceeds to dismiss this appeal.
