Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiffs instituted this action in the District Court of

Hambantota seeking ejectment of the defendants from the land in

suit and damages on the basis that the defendants are licensees of

the plaintiffs. The defendants sought dismissal of the action on

the basis that the land does not belong to the plaintiffs, but to the

State. After trial, the learned District Judge entered the Judgment

for the plaintiffs. Hence this appeal by the defendants.

There cannot be any dispute that the 1st defendant who is the

brother of the 1st plaintiff came into occupation of the land

described in the 1st schedule to the plaint with the leave and

licence of the latter. This was inter alia admitted by the 1st

defendant in P1 which is a letter sent by the 1st defendant to the

plaintiffs and P3 which is a complaint made by the 1st defendant

to the police. This was also categorically admitted by the 2nd

defendant who is the son of the 1st defendant in his evidence. The

2nd defendant also further admitted that at the beginning they

occupied the house which was already there and later put up a

new house without any permission from the 1st plaintiff and it is

because of this new construction the plaintiffs instituted this

action.1 From P2 and P3 it is clear that the new house was put up

under protest about one month prior to the institution of the

action.

The main defence of the defendants as crystallised in the issues is

that the plaintiffs are not the owners of the land and therefore the

plaintiffs cannot maintain this action.

During the course of the trial the defendants seem to have

modified this defence without raising a specific issue to say that

the disputed portion of the land depicted as Lot 1 and 2 in Plan

marked X is a canal reservation, and therefore the plaintiffs could

not have given that portion to the defendants to occupy as it is a

State land.

The new house which the defendants have put up is in Lot 2 of the

said Plan, and there is no scintilla of evidence that Lot 2 is a State

land or canal reservation (even though one can argue that Lot 1 is

a canal reservation).

By Plan X it is abundantly clear that the whole land separated for

convenience in the Plan as Lots 1-3, is one larger block of land

with one boundary fence around the whole land and without any

distinct boundary lines between the three Lots.

Even assuming without conceding that the disputed portion of the

land is a State land and the plaintiffs have no title to the balance

portion of the land, still the defendants cannot succeed in their

defence so long as it has been proved that the defendants came

into possession of the land with the leave and licence of the

plaintiffs. If the defendants are desirous of disputing the title of

the plaintiffs to the land to which they came into occupation as

licensees they must first quit the land and then litigate as to the

ownership.

Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance states that no person who

came upon any immovable property by the licence of the person in

possession thereof shall be permitted to deny that such person had

a title to such possession at the time when such licence was given.

In Reginald Fernando v. Pubilinahamy2 the Supreme Court held

that: "Where the plaintiff (licensor) established that the defendant

was a licensee, the plaintiff is entitled to take steps for ejectment of

the defendant whether or not the plaintiff was the owner of the

land."

The same conclusion was reached in Ruberu v. Wijesooriya3 where

it was held that: But whether it is a licensee or a lessee, the

question of title is foreign to a suit in ejectment against either. The

licensee (the defendant-respondent) obtaining possession is deemed

to obtain it upon the terms that he will not dispute the title of him,

i.e. the plaintiff-appellant without whose permission, he (the

defendant-respondent) would not have got it. The effect of the

operation of section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance is that if a

licensee desires to challenge the title under which he is in occupation

he must, first, quit the land. The fact that the licensee or the lessee

obtained possession from the plaintiff-appellant is perforce an

admission of the fact that the title resides in the plaintiff.

This principle, which stands to reason, was emphasized in a long

line of cases including Aluar Pallai v. Karuppan4, Pathirana v.

Jayasundara5, Bandara v. Piyasena6, Mary Beatrice v.

Seneviratne7, Gunasinghe v. Samarasundara8, Wimala Perera v.

Kalyani Sriyalatha9.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
