Furthermore, it can be observed that in deeds marked as 8V1,8V2 and 8V3 there are two lands called as Medawatta. One is named as Medawatta Uthuru Irawalala while the other is named as Medawatte Dakuna Irawalala. The land called Medawatta Uthuru Irawalala has Abayhamige watta as its northern boundary and Galweta as the eastern boundary. These descriptions are compatible with the northern and eastern lands described as boundaries to Medawatta in P2. On the other hand, boundaries to Medawatta Dakunu Irawalala in 8v1, 8v2 and 8v3 are more compatible with the land sought to be partitioned in the plaint and the plans made. Most probably the foot path described as the northern boundary can now be found in the preliminary plan and plan number 1213A as a road. Eastern boundary of Medawatta Dakunu Irawalala which is described as Kaluhamige watta in 8v1 8v2 and 8v3 can be found in the schedule to the plaint, plans made and even in Medawatta referred to in Pl. Even the southern and western boundaries to the Medawatta Dakunu Irawalala in 8v1, 8v2 and 8v3 are compatible with the lands sought to be partitioned in the plaint,",
