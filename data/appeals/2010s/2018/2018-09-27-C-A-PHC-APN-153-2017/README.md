The Accused-Petitioner has filed a revision application in this court seeking to set

aside the order made on 14.12.2016, ';by the Learned High Court Judge of

Negambo, refusing to enlarge the 2nd Accused-Petitioner on bail.

Facts of the Case:

.1 The 2nd Accused-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the "Petitioner") was indicted

with 1 sl Accused, in the High Court of Negambo on two counts for trafficking and

possession of 244.09g of Heroin under Case No. HC 311/14. The indictment was

read over to the Petitioner on 03.09.2014 and he had pleaded not guilty to Count

01. The Counsel appearing for the Petitioner in High Court had made an

application for bail and the Learned High Court Judge of Negambo had rejected

the same. The case was fixed for trial on 16.02.2015 and on that day the Counsel

for the Accused had moved for a date.

Page 2\of 6

.,* Thereafter, another bail application was made on behalf of the Petitioner (2nd

Accused) on 14.12.2016 and the Learned High Court Judge had rejected that

application due to absence of exceptional circumstances. Being aggrieved by the

said refusal, the Petitioner has preferred a revision application to this court.

Section 83 of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs [amendment] Act

No.13 of 1984 states that "No person sz.,-.5pected or accused of an offence under

section 54A or section 54B of this ordinance shall be released on the bail, except

by the High Court in exceptional circumstances. "

In the case of Labynidarage Nishanthi V. Attorney General rCA (PHC) APN

48/2014], it was held that,

"It is trite law that any accused or suspect having charged under the above

act will be admitted to bail only in.{erms o/section 83(1) o/the said Act and

it is only on Exceptional circumstances. Nevertheless it is intensely relevant

to note, the term "exceptional circumstances" has not been explained or

defined in any o/the, Statutes. Judges are given a wide discretion in,deciding

'~ in what creates a circumstance which is exceptional in nature ... "

Accordingly the intention of the legisla~re is to keep the suspects and accused

under the said Act in remand unless exce~tional circumstances have been proved.

The Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted that failure to

expedite and commence the trial when an Accused is in remand custody should be

considered as an exceptional circumstance. The Learned President's Counsel has

submitted the case of Subramanium Saraswathi V. Attorney General [CA

(PH C) APN 36/2010], in support of his contention, in which it was held that,

Page:p of 6

"If the accused is on remand, it becomes the duty of the learned trial Judge

to expedite and conclude the cas(J without delay but the Learned Judge

instead has postponed the case by dperiod of 01 year and 04 months ... "

However the facts of the two cases are rpanifestly different. Upon perusal of the

journal entries of the instant trial we find that the case was postponed due to the

absence of witnesses and on request of the counsels for the two Accused. We

observe that after refusing the applicatior! for bail, the Learned High Court Judge

had fixed the trial for 04.04.2017 and {YS.04.2017. However on 04.04.2017, the

Counsel for the 1 st Accused has moved fof further date. ,

06/04/20 17 ~Z5)C6 qt:lcocg 2S)@;J." (Page 1 7 of the brief)

Accordingly the trial was re-fixed fo'1' 02.08.2017. Thereafter the trial was

postponed to 29.11.2017 as there were se":leral partly heard cases. On that day trial

was again postponed due to the assignrd Learned High Court Judge was not

. available since he was in High Court of Chilaw.

In the benchmark decision of Ramu Tnamotharampillai V. Attorney General

(2004) 3 Sri. L.R 180, it was held that,

"The decision must in each casel depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances. But in order that like cases may be decided alike and that

there will be ensured some uniformity of decisions it is necessary that some

guidance should be laid downfor the exercise o/that discretion. .. "

Accordingly this court is of the view that it is mandatory to demonstrate

exceptional circumstances to grant bail for an offence committed under the Poisons

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act as stipulated in section 83 of said Act.

....

.1 In the '~;ase of Attorney General V. S.R.! Dam.mika Gunawardene rCA (PH C)

-' ,t. APN 15112016], it was held that,

"In the case of Mohamed Shiyafn, it was held that for an offence of

committed under the above act, sec/ion 83 of the said act will be applicable

and according to section 83, bail will be granted only on exceptional

circumstances. . . 1n the case ofCA (PHC) APN 11012009 a case where the quantity was 4.7

gms. It was held that "the first ground the fact that the suspect had been on

remand for over 4 years cannot be taken as constituting the exceptional

circumstance in view of the punishm

1ent t~at could be imposed for an offence

i of this nature where the charge ca~ries a sentence of life imprisonment or

d th " ea ...

Also in the case of Labukola Ange Wis:in Gedara Ashni Dhanushika V. AG

,:1, rCA (PHC) APN 4/2016], it was held that~

"In the present case the petitioner failed to establish any exceptional

circumstances warranting this court to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction.

The petitioner's first point is that the suspect is in remand nearly for two

years. The intention of the legislat~re is to keep in remand any person who

is suspected or accused of possessing or trafficking heroin until the

:\ conclusion of the case. The section 83(1) of the Act expresses the intention of

the legislature ... "

Further we observe that the quantity of heroin in the instant case is 244.09g, which

in fact, is a commercial quantity.

In the case of Ranil Charuka Kulathunga v. AG rCA (PIlC) APN 134/2015], it

was held that,

Page S~f6 ,

"The quantity of cocaine involved in this case is 62.847 grams, which is a

i commercial quantity. If Petitioner is convicted, the punishment is death or

~ life imprisonment. Under these circUmstances, it is prudent to conclude the

trial early while the Petitioner is kep{ in custody ... "

Considering above, we are of the view that; the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate

exceptional circumstances to the satisfaction. of this court to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction.

We direct the Learned High Court Judge of Neg ambo to consider the possibility of

hearing this case on day to day basis.

The revision application is hereby dismissed without costs.
