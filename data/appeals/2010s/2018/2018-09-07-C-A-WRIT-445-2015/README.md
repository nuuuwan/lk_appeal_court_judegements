The petitioner filed this application seeking to quash the

Settlement Order made in favour of the Crown under section 5(5)

of the Land Settlement Ordinance, No. 20 of 1931, as amended

(hereinafter "the Ordinance"), and published in terms of section 8

of the Ordinance in the Government Gazette No. 9247 of

17.03.1944 in respect of Lot No. 77 of Village Plan No. 429; and to

issue a writ of mandamus against the 1st and 2nd respondents to

conduct a fresh inquiry and settle the said Lot in favour of the

petitioner.

The petitioner admits that the Settlement Notice in terms of section

4 of the Ordinance was published in the Gazette No. 8257 of

20.11.1936. The petitioner further states that the Settlement

Inquiry in terms of section 5 of the Ordinance was held, and his

father participated in the inquiry with an Attorney-at-Law and

3

produced the father's Deed marked P1. This Deed has been

executed on 14.12.1936, that is, after the Settlement Notice was

published. By this Deed, the petitioner's father has purchased

undivided rights of four lands including the land in respect of

which Settlement Order was made, which is Pattiyakumbura.

If the petitioner's father participated in the Settlement Inquiry with

an Attorney-at-Law and his claim was rejected and settled the land

in favour of the Crown, the petitioner's father was not without a

remedy. He, in terms of section 24 of the Ordinance, ought to have

filed an action in the District Court within one year from the

publication of the Settlement Order to vindicate his rights. This

has not been done.

It may be recalled that Settlement Order was published as far back

as in 1944, and the petitioner as the son of the claimant, after

more than 60 years in 2015 cannot challenge the said Order by

way of a writ application. The petitioner's first relief for writ of

certiorari shall in my view necessarily fail.

On what basis does the petitioner challenge the Settlement Order?

He says that his father by Deed marked P2 executed on

16.09.1984 sold his undivided rights to him. This is on the

purported premise that what was transferred by Deed P2 was the

father's undivided rights in respect of the land known as

Pattiyakumbura, the land in respect of which Settlement Order was

made.

Firstly, the land which has been transferred by Deed P2 is not

Pattiyakumbura but a different land known as Gaalpattiyewatta

and therefore the petitioner gets no rights by Deed P2 to the land

in respect of which Settlement Order was made.

4

Secondly, even if it were Pattiyakumbura (which is definitely not

so), the father could not by Deed P2 have transferred it to the

petitioner as his rights on Pattiyakumbura were wiped out by the

subsequent Settlement Order in favour of the Crown. The

petitioner has no locus standi to file this application.

It is elementary that the petitioner must show that he has a legal

right to the performance of a legal duty by the respondents against

whom mandamus is sought. Mandamus is not intended to create a

right but to restore a party who has been denied his legal right.

(Mageswaran v. University Grants Commission1, Perera v. National

Housing Development Authority2, Wannigama v. Incorporated

Council of Legal Education3, Janak Housing (Pvt) Ltd v. UDA4, Credit

Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs Jafferriee & Jafferjee

(Pvt) Ltd5) No such legal right on the part of the petitioner with a

corresponding legal duty on the part of the 1st and 2nd

respondents to hold a fresh inquiry has been shown to exist by the

petitioner. The petitioner's second relief for writ of mandamus

shall also fail.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed but without costs.
