The Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "Plaintiff") filed the above styled action in the

District Court of Tangalle seeking to partition the land called Bogahakella containing in extent lA.

OR. 17P. situated at Moraketiyara in South Giruwa Pattu in the District of Hambanthota.

The parties did not dispute the identity of the corpus. It was admitted that the corpus is depicted

as lot A in plan no. 416 prepared by licensed surveyor D.G. Karunadasa.

The 1st to 7th defendants did not dispute the pedigree pleaded by the Plaintiff. The dispute on the

title was between the Plaintiff and 8th to 10th defendants-respondents (hereinafter referred to as

"8th to 10th Defendants"). The 8th to 10th Defendants pleaded prescriptive title to the corpus.

The learned District Judge of Tangalle held that the 8th to 10th Defendants had established

prescriptive title to the corpus and dismissed the action with costs. Hence this appeal by the

Plaintiff. The Plaintiff moves that the judgment of the learned District Judge dated 10th November

1998 be set aside and judgment be entered as prayed for in the plaint.

In D.R. Kiriamma v. J.A. Podibanda and 8 others1 Udalagama J. adverted to some important points

to be borne in mind in considering a claim of prescriptive title:

"Onus probandi or the burden of proving possession is on the party claiming prescriptive

possession. Importantly, prescription is a question of fact. Physical possession is a factum

probandum. I am inclined to the view that considerable circumspection is necessary to

recognize the prescriptive title as undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party

having paper title. It is in fact said that title by prescription is an illegality made legal due

to the other party not taking action. It is to be reiterated that in Sri Lanka prescriptive title

is required to be by title adverse to an independent to that of a claimant or plaintiff. "2

Plaintiff contended that one A.P. Don Davith, the father of the 8th Defendant, had entered the

corpus as a licensee of Don Davith Ediriweera, the father of the Plaintiff, 1st and 7th Defendants.

This position was admitted by the said A.P. Don Davith somewhere in 1926 in D.C. Tangalle case

No. 2364/P wherein a larger portion of land, including the corpus in this case was partitioned.

The relevant admission is recorded and was marked as OI.S in this action. The Plaintiff contended

that thereafter the said A.P. Don Davith and his successors continued to occupy the corpus as

licensees.

The learned District Judge rejected this position and held that although initially possession was

as a licensee it had later become adverse possession due to an "overt unequivocal act or acts".

He further held that the 8th to 10th Defendants and their predecessors had, due to long and

undisturbed possession, acquired prescriptive title by the application ofthe counter presumption

stated in Tillekeratne et 01. v. Bastian et 0/3.

It is an established principle of law that a person who has entered into possession of land as a

licensee is presumed to continue to possess it in the same capacity.4 Where a licensee claims that

his original possession has later become adverse, he must prove of the manifestation of his

intention to possess adversely to the true owner by what is sometimes referred to as an "overt

unequivocal act" and this burden is both definite and heavy. 5

Where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat

the ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property the burden of proof rests fairly and

squarely on him to establish the starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights. 6

This "overt unequivocal act" relied upon by the learned District Judge should have occurred

between 1926, when the admission as to the status of licensee was made, and 1975 as this action

was filed in 1985. The learned District judge relied on the fact that the 8th Defendant had

constructed a house on the land. In Siriyawathie v. Alwis et aP the Court of Appeal considered

building extensions to a house as circumstances giving rise to the presumption of ouster. The

Plaintiff under cross-examination stated that there was an old house on the land which had been

broken and renovated. He also said that there was a new house on the land which had been built

by the 10th Defendant about 12 years before the action was filed in 1985. It was his position that

a complaint was made to the then Grama Sevaka about this construction. In order to corroborate

this position, the Plaintiff called W.K. Gamage Sirisena who was the Grama Sevaka of the area

between 1966 and 1972. He corroborated the fact that a complaint was made about the

unauthorized construction and that he visited the land and warned the parties to settle the

dispute in courts. In view of this evidence the learned District Judge correctly concludes that at

the latest construction of a house began in 1972, 13 years before the action was filed.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant contends that this evidence is insufficient to establish

adverse possession and that evidence must show that the construction proceeded after the

intervention of the Grama Sevaka. The preliminary survey report indicates that there are seven

buildings on the land of which two are completed houses where the 8th and 10th Defendants

reside. Section 18(2) of the Partition Law states that the survey report may, without further proof,

be used as evidence of the facts stated therein. Only the 8th to 10th Defendants had claimed these

buildings during the preliminary survey. The necessary conclusion based on the preliminary

survey report is that the construction which was sought to be stopped by the complaint to the

Grama Sevaka was continued and completed. Furthermore, the 10th Defendant during her cross-

examination denied the suggestion made on behalf of the Plaintiff that they had not built the

house but had only renovated it. She asserted that they had constructed a house.

The evidence of David Abraham Galappaththi, brother-in-law of the Plaintiff, is also relevant on

this issue. He accepted under cross-examination that the 8th Defendant had built a new house on

the corpus. Another witness called by the Plaintiff, Punchisingho Muthumala, also accepted

under cross-examination that the 8th Defendant had constructed a new house about 35 years

prior to him giving evidence in 1995.

Furthermore, the evidence shows that at least two tombs of family members of the 8th to 10th

Defendants are found on the land. The Plaintiff admitted that the husband of the 8th Defendant,

Kodituwakku, was buried on the land about 12 years prior to the date he was been cross-

examined which was 1993. It was also admitted by the Plaintiff that no permission was sought

from him before the burial and the construction of the tomb.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the 8th to 10th Defendants cannot depend

on the evidence of the witnesses called on behalf of the Plaintiff and that in order to succeed in

their claim of prescriptive title, the 8th to 10th Defendants "must prove the facts necessary for

establishing that prescriptive title actually exist". He relied on Sections 3, 101 and 103 of the

Evidence Ordinance and the decision in The King v. James Chandrasekera8 He further submitted

that an adverse inference should be drawn against the 9th and 10th Defendants for their failure

to give evidence.

In addressing the argument made by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, it is important to

appreciate the distinction between what is referred to as "legal burden" and "evidential burden"

in English law. Legal burden is where the law puts on a party the burden of proving a fact in issue

as a condition of giving him judgment.9 Evidential burden is the burden of adducing or introducing

evidence as to a fact relied on. This does not involve the actual proof of a fact but the introduction

of evidence as to a fact.l0

In The King v. James Chandrasekerall the majority of the Court took the view that ((burden of

proving" in section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance places on the accused the burden of proof as

to the applicability of an exception and he cannot merely adduce evidence or merely create a

reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury. The term ((burden of proof", therefore in our law,

unlike English law, means the legal burden and not the evidential burden and the term is used

only in one sense. But both concepts are relevant to our law and a party may have to accept the

burden in both senses in order to succeed, unless the evidence led by the other side might prove

what a party has to proveY

In this case it is the 8th to 10th Defendants who pleaded prescriptive title. The burden of proving

such title was on them.13 But in fulfilling this burden, they can rely on the evidence elicited from

the Plaintiff and the witnesses called by him through astute cross-examination. This evidence was

also before the trial judge and he was correct in considering that evidence in deciding whether

the 8th to 10th Defendants had proved their claim of prescriptive title. Section 3 of the Evidence

Ordinance states that a fact is said to be proved when, after considering the matters before it,

the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man

ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exits.

Matters include evidence obtained through cross-examination of the witnesses of the opposing

party. In the light of the above circumstances, there was no need to draw any adverse inferences

against the 9th and 10th Defendants for their failure to give evidence.

In Siriyawathie v. Alwis et al14 the Court of Appeal also considered planting the corpus with

coconuts, king coconuts and other plantations as further circumstances giving rise to the

presumption of ouster. The preliminary survey report in this case indicates inter alia that the

Plaintiff claimed praveni rights only in relation to 18 coconut trees more than 75 years old and

02 jak trees more than 10 years old. However, the 8th Defendant denied the Plaintiff's claim and

claimed ownership to them. The preliminary survey report further indicates 10 coconut trees

between 30-35 years old, 02 jak trees about 15 years old, 03 jak trees about 20 years old, 4 mango

trees between 15-40 years old situated on the land, all of which were claimed only by the 8th

Defendant. Her claim was not challenged by the Plaintiff. Therefore, the learned District Judge

was correct in considering this fact as well in concluding that adverse possession had begun at

least 10 years prior to the institution of the action.

In Tillekeratne et al. v Bastian et al. 15 a bench of three Judges decided that it was open to the

Court, from lapse of time in conjunction with the other circumstances of the case, to presume

that a possession originally that of a co-owner had since become adverse. The same principle

applies to licensees. The learned District Judge further held that the 8th to 10th Defendants had

acquired prescriptive title to the corpus by long and undisturbed possession by the application

of this counter presumption. In doing so, he took into consideration the fact that the 8th

Defendant was 84 years old and had lived her entire life on this land. In Walpita v. Dharmasena

et a/16 the Court of Appeal applied the counter presumption considering possession of 40 years

and other circumstances. Even if one takes 1926 as the starting point of possession, due to the

admission of status as licensee, there was 59 years of continuous possession up to the time action

was filed.

The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff submits that the learned District Judge erred in applying

both tests, i.e. overt unequivocal act and counter presumption to the same facts as they cannot

coexist. He argued that one requires an overt act whereas the counter presumption arises when

there is no overt act. I am unable to agree. There can be situations where the counter

presumption can coexist with an overt act as the counter presumption is employed in conjunction

with the other circumstances of the case. For example, where there has been long and

undisturbed possession accompanied by an overt act or acts which occur within less than 10

years prior to any action been instituted. In fact, the Court of Appeal in Siriyawathie v. Alwis et

af17 applied both the overt unequivocal act and counter presumption in concluding that the 9th

Defendant-Appellant in that case had acquired prescriptive title. However, in this case what the

learned District Judge has held is that the 8th to 10th Defendants had acquired prescriptive title

by adverse possession begun with overt unequivocal act or if not by the application of the counter

presumption.

The Counsel for the Appellant further submitted that in answering issues nos. 3 and 19, the

learned District Judge had decided that the 8th Defendant failed to prove that she had demolished

the old house and built a new house and therefore her claim of prescriptive title should fail.

However, this submission disregards the answer given to issue no. 16.

It appears that the learned District Judge has erred in answering issue nos. 3 and 19 which along

with issue no. 16 are reproduced below verbatim with the respective answers given by him:

The learned District Judge in answering issue no. 16 in the affirmative accepted that building No.4

was built by the 8th Defendant. As adverted to earlier, this was clearly established by the evidence

of the Plaintiff and the witnesses summoned by him. Therefore, the learned District Judge erred

in answering issue no. 3 in the affirmative and issue no. 19 as not proved. The answers to the said
