This is an application in revision against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the Southern

Province holden in Matara in Revision Application No. HCRA/134/2013 dated 28.10.2015.

The Claimant-Petitioner-Respondent (Respondent) instituted proceedings in the Magistrates

Court of Matara in case No. 57846 under the provisions of the States Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act No.7 of 1979 as amended (Act) to evict the Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner (Petitioner) from the

land identified as WeI/ana Watta. The Petitioner appeared before the Magistrate and took up the position

that WeI/ana Watta is part of WeI/ana Field of Bisodola Division of the Akuressa Estate, Thelijjawila. The

Petitioner claimed that by operation of law, Akuressa Estate was vested in the Land Reform Commission

(LRC) and that the ownership and possession of Akuressa Estate was transferred to the Sri Lanka State

Plantations Corporation (SLSPC) by the LRC in terms of a notice published in the Gazette Extraordinary No.

181 of 2012 dated 27.02.1982.

The Petitioner further submitted that by Order published in terms of Section 2 of the Conversion of Public

Corporation or Government Owned Business Undertaking into Public Companies Act No. 23 of 1987 in the

Gazette Extraordinary No. 720/2 dated 22.06.1992, the Petitioner was incorporated to take over the

functions ofthe SLSPC and the Janatha Estate Development Board set out in Part I of the schedule thereto

which included the Akuressa Estate. The Petitioner claims that on or about 11.12.1995 a Memorandum

of Record was entered into between the SLSPC and the Petitioner by which the SLSPC agreed to lease out

the estates mentioned in the schedule thereto to the Petitioner for 53 years which included the Akuressa

Estate. A Power of Attorney was also executed in 1995 in favour ofthe Petitioner enabling it to carry out

the management of the estates specified therein including the Akuressa Estate.

Accordingly, it was the position of the Petitioner that it was in possession of Wellana Watt a as

part of Akuressa Estate under a valid permit/written authority of the State.

The Respondent denied this position and claimed that Akuressa Estate referred to in the

documents relied on by the Petitioner and the Wellana Estate in relation to which the application

was made under the Act are two different lands situated about 8 miles apart. To corroborate this

position the Respondent, with the written submissions filed before the Magistrates Court,

Page 3 of 10

. .

submitted copies of two separate statutory declarations made in terms of section 18 of the LRC

Act by the respective owners of Akuressa Estate and Wellana Estate marked as "Yl" and "Y2".

The learned Magistrate concluded that WeI/ana Watta is part of WeI/ana Field of Bisodola Division of

the Akuressa Estate, Thelijjawila and rejected the position of the Respondent that Akuressa Estate and

Wellana Estate are two different lands. He relied on document marked XS by the Petitioner as

part of his show cause and concluded that it was a map prepared by the Survey Department

which corroborated this position.

He further held that possession of Akuressa Estate has been given to the Petitioner on a valid

permit/written authority and dismissed the application of the Respondent.

The Respondent filed a revision application in the High Court of the Southern Province holden in

Matara against the said order of the learned Magistrate. The learned High Court Judge decided

that the learned Magistrate erred in concluding that XS was a map prepared by the Survey

Department when in fact it is stated to be "Extracted from sheet 91 prepared and printed by the

Survey Department of Sri Lanka".

The learned High Court Judge further held that XS was not satisfactory evidence to conclude that

Wellana Watta was part of the Akuressa estate as it was a map of a large area and a small portion

has been darkened and identified as Wellana Watta. The learned High Court Judge set aside the

order of the Magistrate Court of Matara and directed the learned Magistrate to issue an order of

eviction under the Act. Hence this revision application by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner relied on the following grounds in support of this revision application:

(i) Respondent is not entitled to invoke the provisions of the Act against the Petitioner.

(ii) The procedure in the Act cannot be used where there is a dispute on the identity of

the land.

(iii) The Respondent was not the competent authority in respect of the lands vested with

the SLSPC.

(iv) Petitioner has a valid permit/written authority to occupy the land in issue.

Scope of the Act

The Petitioner submits that the Act has been designed to evict persons who are under obligation

to vacate state land which has been given to them on a contractual footing. In support of this

proposition the judgment of the Supreme Court in Senanayake v. Damunupola [(1982) 2 Sri.L.R.

621] was cited where Victor Perera J. stated (at 628):

"A purposive examination and interpretation of this Law shows that it was enacted to get

back possession of State land which had been, given to a person on a contractual footing

and where there was an Obligation to vacate and give up possession or occupation on the

happening of some event as a necessary consequence ...

It was not meant to obtain possession of land which the State had lost possession of by

encroachment or ouster for a considerable period of time by ejecting a person in such

possession. Section 3 of this Law should not be used by a Competent Authority to eject a

person who has been found by him to be in possession of a land in circumstances such as

have transpired in this case."

The long title to the main Act states that it is intended to make provisions for the "Recovery of

possession of State land from persons in unauthorized or unlawful occupation thereof". The main

Act did not have a definition of what was meant by "unauthorized possession or occupation". It

is in this context that the decision in Senanayake v. Damunupola (supra) was made.

After the decision in Senanayake v. Damunupola (supra) the main Act was amended by State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) (Amendment) Act No. 29 of 1983. One of the amendments was

to include a new definition of the word " unauthorized possession or occupation" to mean

"except possession or occupation upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law and includes possession or occupation by

encroachment upon state land". In Shiyam v. Officer-in-Charge, Narcotics Bureau and another

[(2006) 2 Sri. L.R. 156] the Supreme Court held that in case of doubt, it is competent to look at

Parliamentary debates on Acts to ascertain the intention of the law.

Page 5 of 10

The Hon. Minister of Land, Land Development and Mahaweli Development during the second

reading of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) (Amendment) Bill [Parliamentary Debates,

Volume 24 at pages 1504-5], which was subsequently passed as State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 29 of 1983, specifically stated that the amendment is been moved due to

the decision of the Supreme Court in Senanayake v. Damunupola (supra) which made it difficult

to recover land belonging to the State and that recourse to existing law to recover possession

of state land was time consuming. Clearly, the intention of the amendment was to provide a

swift and effective procedure by which the State can recover possession of state land instead of

existing procedures.

The legislative language will be interpreted on the assumption that the legislature was aware of

existing statutes, the rules of statutory construction, and the judicial decisions and that if a change

occurs in the legislative language a change was intended in legislative result [N.S. Bindra's

Interpretation of Statutes; 10th ed., page 235]. Therefore, I am of the view that the ratio decidendi

in Senanayake v. Damunupola (supra) is no longer valid.

A competent authority can have recourse to the Act to evict any person who is in unauthorized

possession or occupation of state land including possession or occupation by encroachment upon

state land. Any possession or occupation without "a valid permit or other written authority of

the State granted in accordance with any written law" is unauthorized possession. The procedure

in the Act can be resorted to even where a party came into possession of the state land upon an

agreement and the agreement has been terminated. The mere fact that the rights and liabilities

under such agreement can be the subject matter of a civil action does not have the effect of

placing the said state land outside the purview of the Act [Ruby Edwin Ihalapathirana v.

Suriyakumara Wanasinghe Piyatissa Bulankulame, Director General, UDA (1988) 1 Sri.L.R. 416,

(1988) II C.A.L.R. 100, Walker Sons & Co. Ltd. v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority and another (CA.

305/90, C.A.M. of 15.06.1995)].

Page 6 of 10

In this context I wish to consider the decision in Edwin v. Tillakaratne [(2001) 3 SrLL.R. 34] where

U. De Z. Gunawardena J. held that the procedure in the Act cannot be resorted to in cases where

the land in dispute was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act. The learned Judge relied on the

decision in Senanayake v. Damunupola (supra) in support of his conclusions. For the reasons

articulated earlier I am of the view that the reasoning and conclusions in Edwin v. Tillakaratne

(supra) is erroneous. We overrule the judgement in Edwin v. Tillakaratne (supra) and hold that

the procedure in the Act can be invoked even where a person is in "unauthorized possession or

occupation" of state land which was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act. The intention of

the legislature on this issue is clear as the Hon. Minister of Land, Land Development and

Mahaweli Development, during the second reading of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

(Amendment) Bill (supra,) specifically stated that recourse to existing law to recover possession

of state land was time consuming.

Dispute as to the Identity of the Land

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the procedure in the Act is not

designed to be used in instances where there is a dispute on the identity of the land.

A person who has been summoned in terms of section 6 of the Act can only establish that he is

in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not

revoked or otherwise rendered invalid. He cannot contest any of the matters stated in the

application made under section 5 of the Act. One of the matters required to be stated in the

application is that the land described in the schedule to the application is in the opinion of the

competent authority State land. This fact cannot be contested by the person summoned and the

submission of the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner that whether the two lots of land

which forms the subject matter of the Magistrates Court action are situated within Akuressa

Estate or outside is a matter to be decided by a District Court in a land action must fail.

Page 7 of 10

-.

Hence, a dispute on the identity of the land cannot arise for the consideration of the learned

Magistrate. The identity of the land can arise for consideration only to the extent of examining

whether the valid permit or other written authority produced by the party summoned is in

relation to the state land described in the application. Where it is not, the Magistrate must issue

an order of eviction in terms of the Act. In CA. 1299/87, C.A.M. 14.06.199S, S.N. Silva J. (as he

was then) held that if the case of the party summoned is that he is in occupation of another land,

then he would not be ejected from the land he is in occupation upon a writ that will be issued in

the Magistrate's Court.

The Petitioner submits that the land identified in the application made under section S of the Act

is in fact Wellana Watta which is part of Wellana Field of Bisodola Division of the Akuressa Estate,

Thelijjawila to which the Petitioner has a valid permit or other written authority of the State granted

in accordance with any written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked

or otherwise rendered invalid. The Respondent submits that Akuressa Estate and Well ana Estate

are two different lands situated about 8 miles apart.

The learned Magistrate cannot call for any evidence from the competent authority in support of

the application under section S of the Act. The burden of establishing lawful occupation or

possession is on the party summoned [Muhandiram v. Chairman, No. 111, Janatha Estate

Development Board (1992) 1 SrLL.R. 110].

The only evidence submitted by the Petitioner to establish that Akuressa Estate and Wellana Estate

is one and the same is the map marked XS. It is an extract of a map on which a small portion of

land has been darkened and at the bottom of the map the darkened area has been identified as

"BISODOLA DIVISION (Wellana Fields)" in typed script and "(Extracted from Sheet 91 prepared

and printed by the survey Department of Sri Lanka.)" typed in the same script. There is no

evidence as to who and when the typed script was included on the extract of the map. The

document XS certainly does not establish that Akuressa Estate and Well ana Estate is one and the

same land. In fact, it has been considered and acted upon by the learned Magistrate in violation

of section 13 of the Survey Act No. 17 of 2002 which prohibits a plan, map or copy or tracing of a

plan been received in evidence in any court in Sri Lanka unless such plan or map has been

Page 8 of 10

prepared (a) by or on behalf of the Surveyor General by a registered surveyor duly authorised by

him and certified by the Surveyor General or by a registered surveyor duly authorised by him for

such purpose; or (b) and certified by a registered licensed surveyor. Furthermore, in terms of

section 83 of the Evidence Ordinance such a plan must be proved to be accurate which was not

done in this case.

On the contrary, though the competent authority does not have any burden in an inquiry before

the Magistrate, the Respondent has produced before the Magistrate the two statutory

declarations made in terms of section 18 of the Land Reform Act by the respective owners of

Akuressa Estate and WeI/ana Estate marked as "Yl/1 and "Y2/1. These clearly show that Akuressa

Estate and WeI/ana Estate are two distinct parcels of land. The learned Magistrate has merely

referred to these two documents without considering their impact on the question of identity.

Instead he relied on X5 and concluded that Akuressa Estate and WeI/ana Estate is one and the

same land. As the learned High Court Judge concluded the learned Magistrate has fal/en into

grave error.

There is a further piece of evidence which establishes that the LRC is the owner of WeI/ana Estate.

The Respondent identified the state land forming the subject matter of the application made

under the Act by reference to a preliminary plan No. Mara 2406 dated 2009.05.15 prepared and

certified on behalf of the Surveyor General. The tenement list to the said plan identifies the

owner of Wellana Estate as the LRC. Section 83 of the Evidence Ordinance states that the Court

shall presume that maps, plans, or surveys purporting to be signed by the Surveyor General or

officer acting on his behalf were duly made by his authority and are accurate.

The Respondent was not the competent authority

The Petitioner submitted that the Respondent was not the competent authority in respect of the

state lands vested with the SLSPC. Such an objection is not a matter that can be taken up before

the learned Magistrate or in these proceedings. One of the facts to be stated in the application

made under section 5 of the Act is that the person making the application is a competent

authority for the purposes of the Act. In view of section 6 of the Act, a person who has been

summoned cannot contest that the claimant is not a competent authority. That is an issue to be

Page 9 of 10

tested in appropriate proceedings. In Dayananda v. Thalwatte [(2001) 2 SrLL.R. 73 at 81] this Court

held that it was open for a party to seek to quash the quit notice by way of certiorari when the

determination was made by the competent authority. In fact, the Supreme Court decision in

Karunawathie Jayamaha and Others v. Janatha Estate Develapment Baard and Others [(2003) 1 ALR 10]

relied on by the Petitioner is a case where the vires of the quit notice was successfully impugned in a writ

application.

In any event, in view of the conclusions set out above, Wellana Estate and Akuressa Estate are

two distinct parcels of land. The owner of Wellana Estate is the LRC and hence the submission of

the Petitioner that the Respondent is not the competent authority for the said land fails.

Petitioner has a valid permit/written authority to occupy the land in issue

The state land forming the subject matter of this application is Wellana Estate. The Petitioner has

failed to produce a valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance

with any written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid.

For the reasons set out above, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High

Court Judge of the Southern Province holden in Matara in Revision Application No.

HCRA/134/2013 dated 28.10.2015.

The revision application is dismissed with costs.

The learned Magistrate of Matara is directed to comply with the order made by the learned High

Court Judge expeditiously.
