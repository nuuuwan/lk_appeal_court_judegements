JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Chairman Urban Council Ambalangoda who is the Complainant -

Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Respondent) has made an application to the Magistrate's Court of

'.

4

Balapitiya seeking a mandatory order from the learned Magistrate under

section 28 A (3) of the Urban Development Law (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as UDA Law), to demolish some unauthorized constructions.

This was pursuant to the Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Appellant) defaulting the compliance with a

notice issued under section 28 A (1) of the UDA Law.

Perusal of the journal entries of the MC record shows that the Appellant

had appeared before the Magistrate's Court and moved for time to show

cause against the demolition of the unlawful construction. This application

has been made on 3rd November 2004.

The Appellant has obtained several other dates also in the pretext of

negotiating with the Respondent about this matter.

The Appellant appears to have made an application on the 2nd March 2005

seeking permission of the Magistrate to lead oral evidence.

The Magistrate has refused the said application. It is that order that is

being canvassed in this appeal by the Appellant.

This Court observes that all what the Appellant need to do, to satisfy the

learned Magistrate, is to produce the permit he is required to obtain from

.

5

the UDA. He cannot achieve this by leading oral evidence before Court.

This is because section 64 of the Evidence Ordinance states that the

contents of documents must be proved by primary eVidence, except in the

cases the Evidence Ordinance has specifically mentioned. The permit

issued by the UDA as per the provisions of the UDA Law is a written

permit. Therefore, it is a document. Thus, that document itself must be

produced before Court to satisfy Court that the Appellant has a valid permit

for the alleged unlawful constructions.

It can be clearly seen that the Appellant without making any attempt to do

the above, has engaged in an attempt of jeopardizing the due process of

law by making frivolous applications. The Appellant does not state any

legal basis as to what has necessitated his seeking learned Magistrate's

permission to lead oral evidence.

Learned Provincial High Court Judge, had pronounced his order dated

2007-02-07 dismissing the revision application filed by the Appellant with

costs.

This Court has no legal basiS to set aside the order of the learned

Provincial High Court Judge or the learned Magistrate.

6

In these circumstances, it is the view of this Court that there is no merit in

this appeal.

Therefore, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal with costs fixed at Rs.

50,000/= payable to the state by the Appellant.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.

I agree,
