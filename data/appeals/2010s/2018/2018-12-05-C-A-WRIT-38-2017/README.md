Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking a Writ of Quo Warranto

declaring that the 1st Respondent is disqualified and/or not entitled to hold

office as a Director of the 2nd Respondent Bank.

The Petitioner states that he is a customer of the 2nd Respondent National

Savings Bank (NSB), which is a licensed Specialised Bank incorporated under

the National Savings Bank Act No. 30 of 1971 as amended (the NSB Act). There

is no dispute between the parties that the 2nd Respondent is a Government

owned Bank with an authorised share capital of Rs. Ten Billion and the shares

of the Bank issued in the name of the Secretary to the Treasury.

The Petitioner states further that he is invoking the jurisdiction of this Court

not only in his capacity as a customer of the 2nd Respondent but also in the

public interest, a fact which has been disputed by the Respondents who

question the motives of the Petitioner in bringing this action.

The 1st Respondent, whose appointment as a Director of the 2nd Respondent is

being challenged in this application, has over 35 years of professional banking

experience and a Bachelor of Commerce (Special) Degree awarded in 1982 by

the University of Kelaniya. The 1st Respondent was an employee of the 2nd

Respondent Bank until his retirement from service on 1st June 2015.

Provisions with regard to the composition of the "Board of Directors of t~e 2nd

Respondent is contained in Section 8(1) of the NSB Act, which reads as follows:

3

II

\ 1 l J I

"The Board shall consist of seven directors of whom-

(a) five shall be appointed by the Minister (hereinafter referred to as the

"appointed Directors") from among persons whom he considers to

be capable of directing the affairs of the Bank efficiently and

effectively in such a manner as will enable the Bank to achieve its

object, and each of whom-

(i) has had experience at a senior managerial level, in banking,

commerce, business or allied fields or has had administrative

experience; or

(ii) as professional qualifications in banking, economics, commerce,

law, accountancy, business management or other discipline;

and

(b) one shall be the Secretary to the Treasury or his nominee; and

(c) one shall be the Postmaster-General or his nominee."

The Petitioner states that by a letter dated 9th February 2015, annexed to the

petition marked 'P2', the Minister of Finance, exercising the powers vested in

him by Section 8(1)(a) of the Act had appointed the 1st Respondent as a

member of the Board of Directors of the 2nd Respondene. In this application,

the Petitioner is not challenging the power of the Minister to appoint Directors

l'P2' reads as follows: "In terms of Section 8(1)(a) of the National Savings Bank Act, No. 30 of 1971, as amended by Act No. 28 of 1995, the Hon. Minister of Finance has been pleased to appoint you as a Member of

the Board of Directors of the National Savings Bank with immediate effect".

to the 2nd Respondent Bank nor is the Petitioner claiming that the 1st

Respondent does not have the required professional qualifications. Instead,

the Petitioner is challenging the 1st Respondent's eligibility to be appointed as

a Director of the 2nd Respondent Bank.

The basis of the Petitioner's case is twofold. The first complaint of the

Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent, by virtue of being an employee of the 2nd

Respondent at the time he was issued 'P2' by the Minister of Finance, was not

eligible to be appointed as a Director of the 2nd Respondent. The second

complaint is that the 1st Respondent continued to be ineligible inspite of his

subsequent retirement from the employment of the 2nd Respondent, as a

period of two years had not lapsed since the cessation of his employment.

It is in this factual background that the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Quo

Warranto on the 1st Respondent.

In Geetha Samanmali Kumarasinghe vs N.W.E Buwaneka Lalitha and Others2

Justice Sisira De Abrew described the Writ of Quo Warranto in the following

manner:

"Quo warranto is a remedy available to call upon a person who is holding

a public office to show the authority under which he claims to hold the

office. This view is supported by the following legal literature. In the book

titled "Constitutional Law and Administrative Law of Sri Lanka (Ceylon)"

by J.A.L Coo ray at page 364 the learned Author says as follows: ~'Under

2SC Appeal 99/2017; SC Minutes of 2nd November 2017.

the law the writ of quo warranto may be granted by the Supreme Court to

determine whether the holder of a public office is legally entitled to it." ....

At page 365 the learned Author states as follows: u the writ is

nevertheless available for the purpose of calling upon a person who is

prima facie disqualified from holding a particular office to show upon

what authority he claims to hold such office. 1/

In the book titled "Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka" by Sunil F

A Cooray at page 8993 the learned Author says as follows: "If the office in

question is a "public office", for quo warranto to be available it must be

shown that the election/appointment of the de facto holder of it is a

nUllity. On the question whether the election/appointment is a nullity, the

relevant facts and the applicable law must be considered in each case.

The election/appointment may be a nullity for different reasons, namely,

absence of a necessary qualification for the office, presence of a

disqualification for the office, incorrect procedure adopted for the

election/appointment, or the wrong person or body has held or

conducted the election or made the appointment."

In Dilan Perera Vs Rajitha Senaratne4 Justice Yapa observed as follows: "It

is to be observed that quo warranto is a remedy available to call upon a

person to show by what authority he claims to hold such office.

Therefore, the basic purpose of the writ is to determine whether the

holder of a public office is legally entitled to that office. If a person is

disqualified by law to hold statutory office the writ is available to oust

Having considered the above legal literature, I hold that writ of quo

warranto is a remedy available to call upon a person to show the

authority under which he holds the public office and that if the holder of

the public office is not legally entitled to hold the public office, court has

the power to grant a writ of quo warranto to oust him."

In the case of N.W.E.B Lalitha and others vs. Geetha KumarasingheS, P.

Padman Surasena, J (as he then was)6, held that the Writ of Quo Warranto

would not be issued unless the statute itself clearly disentitles a person from

holding such office and that the Writ seeks to prevent an occupier or an

usurper of an office of public nature from continuing in that position.

The gravamen of the first complaint of the Petitioner is that the appointment

of the 1st Respondent is contrary to Rule 1.4 of the Direction issued by the

Monetary Board in 1997, under Section 76J(l)7 of the Banking Act No. 30 of

1988 as amended. The said Direction has been annexed to the petition,

marked 'PS'. Rule 1.4 thereof reads as follows:

"No person shall be appointed or elected as a director of a licensed

specialised bank if he is an employee or a director of any other licensed

SCA (Writ) 362 I 2015; CA Minutes of 3'd May 2017. The appeal to the Supreme Court was dismissed on. 2nd

November 2017.

6 With Justice Vijith Malalgoda, P.C , PICA (as he then was) agreeing.

7Section 76J(1) of the Banking Act reads as follows: Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the Monetary Board may give directions to licensed specialised banks or to any category of licensed specialised banks, regarding the manner in which any aspect of the business of such banks is to be conducted ...

specialised bank or an employee (other than the chief executive officer)

of the licensed specialised bank."

The Petitioner states that this Rule prohibits the Minister from appointing the

1st Respondent as a Director of the 2nd Respondent as he was still an employee

on the day he was issued the letter of appointment by the Minister, and thus

not eligible to be a director of the 2nd Respondent. The Petitioner claims

therefore that the 1st Respondent has no legal authority to hold the position of

Director of the 2nd Respondent.

The Petitioner has also annexed to the petition, marked 'pg', Direction No. 12

of 2007 issued by the Monetary Board under Section 76J(1) of the Banking Act

on 26th December 2007. Although not specifically stated, this Direction, being

the later Direction, should supersede the provisions of the Direction 'PS', in the

event of an inconsistency. The Direction 'pg', which is titled, 'Directions on

Corporate Governance for Licensed Specialised Banks in Sri Lanka' contain

detailed rules with regard to the composition of the Board of a licensed

specialised bank.

Rule 3.2(iii) of 'pg' provides for the appointment of employees of a bank as a

director of that bank and reads as follows:

"An employee of a bank may be appointed, elected or nominated as a

director of the bank (hereinafter referred to as an "executive director")

provided that the number of executive directors shall not exceed. one-

third of the number of directors of the board. In such an event, one of the

executive directors shall be the chief executive officer of the bank."

II

I

Thus, although Rule 1.4 of the Direction marked 'pg' issued in 1997 prohibited

the appointment of employees as a Director of a licensed specialised bank, the

subsequent Direction issued in 2007 marked 'pg' specifically provided for the

appointment of employees as directors of that bank. In these circumstances,

this Court is of the view that the appointment of the 1st Respondent as a

Director of the 2nd Respondent is not contrary to the Directions issued by the

Monetary Board and hence, the said appointment is neither illegal nor

arbitrary.

The learned President's Counsel for the 1st Respondent and the learned Senior

Deputy Solicitor General for the 2nd _8th Respondents drew the attention of this

Court to the provisions of Section 42 of the Banking Act, which is contained in

Part VI of the Banking Act titled, 'Disqualification for appointment as Director,

Secretary, & c. of Licensed Commercial Banks'.

Section 42(3)(b) of the Banking Act reads as follows:

"An employee of a licensed commercial bank may be appointed, elected

or nominated as a director of that bank subject to the following

conditions:8

(i) the number of employees appointed, elected or nominated as

directors (hereinafter referred to as "executive directors") shall not

8The third condition specified in Section 42(3)(b)(iii) - i.e. "a meeting of the Board of Directors of the bank shall not be duly constituted although the number of Directors required to constitute the quorum at such meeting is present unless more than one half of the number of directors present at such meeting are directors who are non-executive directors" - is not relevant to the issue under consideration.

f

exceed one-third of the number of members of the Board of

Directors of the bank;

(ii) where employees are appointed, elected or nominated as executive

directors one of them shall be the Chief Executive Officer of the bank

and the others shall be such officers of the bank performing

executive functions as may be determined for the purposes of

section 44A"

By virtue of the provisions of Section 76H of the Banking Act9, the above

provisions would apply to all Licensed Specialised Banks including the 2nd

Respondent. Thus, the appointment of the 1st Respondent as a Director of the

2nd Respondent is in accordance with the provisions of the Banking Act.10

Therefore, this Court is in agreement with the submission of the learned

Counsel for the Respondents that the appointment of the 1st Respondent as a

Director of the 2nd Respondent, at a time when he was an employee of the 2nd

Respondent, is neither illegal nor ultra vires the provisions of the Banking Act.

There is one other matter that this Court would like to advert to, with regard

to the first complaint of the Petitioner. That is the involvement of the Director

of Bank Supervisionll in the appointment process of a person as a Director of a

licensed specialised bank. In terms of Section 42{4} of the Banking Act, the first

step in this process is that the appointment of a Director to the 2nd Respondent

9Section 76H reads as follows: "The provisions of Part V, Part VI of this Act shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to a licensed specialised bank as they apply to a licensed commercial bank."

10 No proof of the number of "executive directors" exceeding one-third of the number of members of the Board has been produced before this Court.

11ln terms of Section 28(2) of the Monetary Law, the Director of Bank Supervision is the head of the Department of Bank Supervision which is entrusted with the continuous supervision and periodical examination of all banking institutions in Sri Lanka.

must be notified to the Director of Bank of Supervision. Section 42(4) reads as

follows:

"Every licensed commercial bank shall notify the Director of Bank

Supervision in such form as may be determined by the Director, the

name, address and occupation of:

(a) each person proposed to be appointed, elected or nominated as a

director of the bank, before such appointment, election or

nomination as the case may be;

(b) each person appointed, elected or nominated as a director of the

bank, within fifteen days after such appointment, election or

nomination as the case may be."

Section 42(5) specifies that the "Director of Bank Supervision may, having

regard to the matters specified in Section 42 (I), (2) and (3), approve or refuse

to approve the proposed appointment, election or nomination as the case may

be as a director of the licensed commercial bank of the person referred to in

paragraph (a) of subsection (4) and shall, within thirty days after submission of

the name of such person under that subsection, notify the bank of such

approval or refusal, giving reasons therefor."

Keeping with the requirements of Section 42 (4) read with Section 76H of the

Banking Act, the 2nd Respondent Bank had notified the Director of. Bank

Supervision of the appointment of the 1st Respondent as a Director of the 2nd

Respondent. It is observed that the appointment by the Minister of Finance

11

II

could only be actualised and the said individual could function in the capacity

of Director, only after obtaining the approval of the Director of Bank

Supervision. By letter dated 2ih March 201512, the 2nd Respondent had

requested the 1st Respondent to submit an affidavit confirming that the

disqualifications set out in Section 42(1) does not apply to the 1st Respondent,

which had been duly complied with, by the 1st Respondent submitting an

affidavit dated 18th June 2015, marked 'IRS'. The approval of the Director of

Bank Supervision had been granted only thereafter, by letter dated 21st July

2015, marked 'lR7'.

By the time approval for the appointment of the 1st Respondent was granted,

which would be the date from which the 1st Respondent can function as a

Director of the 2nd Respondent, the 1st Respondent had admittedly retired

from the service of the 2nd Respondent with effect from 1st June 201513 Thus,

by the time his appointment was approved by the Director of Bank

Supervision, the 1st Respondent was no longer an employee of the 2nd

Respondent and therefore was not in any case subject to any disqualification

set out in 'P8'. Thus, the appOintment of the 1st Respondent as a Director is not

illegal or ultra vires the provisions of the Banking Act or any Direction issued

thereunder.

The Petitioner's second complaint to this Court is that the said appointment of

the 1st Respondent is contrary to the provisions of Rule 3(2)(iv)(c) of the

Directions marked lpg', which reads as follows:

12The said letter has been produced by the lSI Respondent marked 'lR4'

13The fact that the 1st Respondent had retired from service had been notified by the lSI Respondent to the Director of Bank Supervision, by letter dated 1st June 2015, which has been produced by the lSI Respondent marked'lR6'.

liThe Board shall have at least three independent non-executive directors

or one third of the total number of directors, whichever is higher ....

A non-executive director shall not be considered independent if he/she

has been employed by the bank during the two year period immediately

preceding the appointment as director."

The argument of the Petitioner is that once the 1st Respondent ceased

employment with the 2nd Respondent, he could only be appointed in the

capacity of a non-executive Director but that in terms of the said Rule, the 1st

Respondent was not eligible to be appointed as a non -executive Director as a

period of two years had not lapsed since the cessation of his employment. This

Court is of the view that the said Rule does not prohibit an ex-employee from

being appointed as a Director of the Bank where he had been previously

employed but only states that such person shall not be considered as an

independent Director until the lapse of two years. Thus, this Court does not

see any merit in the second complaint of the Petitioner14

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the 1st Respondent

was eligible to be appointed as a Director of the 2nd Respondent while being

employed with the 2nd Respondent and that he continued to be eligible to

function as a Director, even after his retirement.

The learned Counsel for the Respondents raised an objection that the Minister

of Finance and the Director of Bank Supervision, both of whom are statutorily

14 Neither party has submitted any proof that the total number of 'independent directors' is less than three.

13

i I I i If , t If

tasked with the appointment of the 1st Respondent, are necessary parties to

this application and that the failure on the part of the Petitioner to name them

as parties, is fatal to the maintainability of this application. However, in view of

the above findings of this Court, the necessity for this Court to consider the

said objection does not arise.

For the reasons set out in this judgment, this Court is of the view that there is

no merit in the arguments presented by the Petitioner and that there is no

legal basis to issue the Writ of Quo Warranto prayed for. The application of the

Petitioner is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
