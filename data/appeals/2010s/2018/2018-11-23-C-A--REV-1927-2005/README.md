Samayawardhena, J.

The 8A defendant-petitioner has filed this application dated

11.11.2005 for revision and/or restitutio in integrum seeking to

(a) set aside the Judgment and the Interlocutory Decree of the

District Court of Galle dated 26.10.2004, (b) if the Final Decree

is entered to set aside the Final Decree, (c) set aside the order

dated 07.09.2005, (d) order trial de novo, (e) allow the 8A

defendant to tender a fresh statement of claim.

It is clear that the 8A defendant has decided to file this

application not after the pronouncement of the Judgment dated

26.10.2004, but after the delivery of the order dated 07.09.2005

whereby the application of the 8A defendant dated 30.11.2004

was dismissed by the learned District Judge. By that

application the 8A defendant has sought to set aside (a) the

Judgment of the District Court dated 26.10.2004, (b) to allow

her to tender a fresh statement of claim and (c) to conduct a trial

de novo.

The refusal of that application is manifestly flawless. If the 8A

defendant was dissatisfied with the Judgment, she should have

preferred an appeal against the Judgment.

After the pronouncement of the Judgment, the 8A defendant

cannot be allowed to file a fresh statement of claim replacing the

statement of claim of the deceased 8th defendant (her father) to

have a fresh trial.

The reason given by the 8A defendant in the said application

seeking a fresh trial is that she was abroad during the trial.

This has not been established by any documentary evidence

either before the District Court or before this Court. Even if it is

true, it is clear from the proceedings that the 8/8A defendant

has been represented by her Attorney-at-Law throughout the

trial.

In this application, the 8A defendant inter alia states that the

original 8th defendant died on 17.09.1999 and the substitution

in place of the deceased original 8th defendant had not taken

place until the Journal Entry 131 dated 19.09.2005 and

therefore Attorney-at-Law Mrs. Muguntenna could not have

appeared on behalf of the original 8th defendant after

17.09.1999.

This kind of a standpoint was never taken up by the 8A

defendant in his application made to the District Court dated

30.11.2004 (referred to earlier). The 8A defendant has not

tendered a copy of the full case record of the District Court for

this Court to ascertain the correctness of that assertion. The 8A

defendant has tendered the Journal Entry 131 dated 19.09.2005

separately to say that substitution was done on that day. That

is a misleading statement. According to that Journal Entry

dated 19.09.2005, the application of the Attorney-at-Law of the

8A defendant was to add the 8A defendants name to the

amended caption and not to substitute the 8A defendant in

place of the 8th defendant. There is no mention in that Journal

Entry that the substitution was done on that day. When the

proxy was tendered and on what basis it was tendered and by

whom it was tendered and when the substitution was in fact

effected etc. have not been explained.

The 8A defendant drawing the attention of this Court to Deed

marked Z2 states that the learned District Judge has not

considered that Deed. Firstly it has not been produced at the

trial. Secondly it has been executed after the lis pendens was

registered.

Another major complaint of the 8A defendant is that preferential

rights over the foundation marked No.5 of the Preliminary Plan,

which was constructed pending partition action, was not given

to the 8th defendant in the Judgment. The learned District

Judge in the Judgment has stated that, as the said foundation

has been laid under protest and whilst the interim injunction

was in operation, the 8th defendant is not entitled to preferential

rights over it. There is nothing wrong in that finding.

This is not a fit and proper case to exercise the extraordinary

jurisdiction by way of revision to grant reliefs for the 8A

defendant.

Application refused. No costs.
