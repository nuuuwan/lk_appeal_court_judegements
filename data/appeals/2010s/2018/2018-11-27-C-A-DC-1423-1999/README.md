Samayawardhena, J.

The 2B defendant filed an appeal against the Judgment of the

District Court of Galle entered in the Partition Case No.6719/P.

As the appellant did not prosecute the appeal with due diligence,

this Court, by order dated 28.02.2014 abated the appeal.

Thereafter, the 2B defendant made an application seeking to

relist the appeal. That application was dismissed by this Court

by order dated 24.06.2016.

Then the petitioner to this application sought Special Leave to

Appeal from the Supreme Court against the said order of this

this Court mainly on two grounds:

(a) The order of this Court dated 24.06.2016 is a nullity

as the 2B defendant was dead at the time the order

was delivered without making any substitution.

(b) The fundamental objective of the Partition Law is to

investigate title to land, and refusal to relist the

appeal will defeat that objective.

The reliefs sought were:

(a) to substitute the petitioner as the legal representative

in place of the deceased 2B defendant;

(b) to set aside the order of this Court dated 24.06.2016

dismissing the relisting application of the 2B

defendant;

(c) To direct the Court of Appeal to consider the appeal of

the 2B defendant on merits.

3

After hearing both parties, the Supreme Court, by order dated

11.07.2017, has refused Leave to Appeal.

It is thereafter, the petitioner has filed this second Relisting

Application dated 16.10.2017 before this Court seeking:

(d) to substitute the petitioner as the legal representative

in place of the deceased 2B defendant;

(e) to set aside the order of abatement dated 24.02.2014

made by this Court;

(f) to set aside the order of this Court dated 24.06.2016

dismissing the relisting application of the 2B

defendant;

(g) to relist the appeal.

There is no ambiguity that the same petitioner went before the

Supreme Court on the same grounds and seeking the same

reliefs.

However, it is the submission of the learned counsel for the

petitioner that the Supreme Court refused Leave on a technical

ground and therefore there is no bar for this Court to consider

the petitioners Application afresh.

The learned counsel for the respondent (who was also the

counsel in the Supreme Court case) disputes that Leave was

refused by the Supreme Court on a technical ground.

I think that there is no room for argument or conjectures as the

Supreme Court has refused Leave stating We see no basis to

4

grant Special Leave to Appeal in this matter when the petitioner

placed the same facts before the Supreme Court.

The petitioner has not withdrawn the Application filed before the

Supreme Court reserving the right to file a fresh Application

before this Court, nor has the Supreme Court dismissed that

Application subject to such condition. The matter, in my view,

is res judicata.

There must be finality in litigation, even if incorrect orders have

to go unreversed.1

Application dismissed. No costs.
