Presently most of the Cases were taken up before a Judge who is legally competent judicially trained and sensitive to human affairs. There we cannot expect for the Judge to place it on writing the whole legal concept for what he learnt from the Law School up to this point further his human behavioural sensitiveness also cannot be explained in a Judgment. It is common factor that there are huge numbers of cases brought before the Courts, and everybody expects to conclude their matter as early as possible.
