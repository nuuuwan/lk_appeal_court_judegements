Oeepali Wijesundera J.

The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for

possession and trafficking of 6.58 grams of heroin under section 54(d)

and 54(b) of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drug Ordinance (as

amended) Act No. 13 of 1984. After trial he was found guilty for the said

offences and was sentenced to death. The instant appeal is against the

said conviction and sentence.

The story of the prosecution was that on the day in question there

had been a check point manned by the army near the BMICH along

Bauddhaloka Mawatha. The appellant along with another person had

driven in a three wheeler along Baudhdhaloka Mawatha and was stopped

by the army at the check point. They were asked to get down from the

vehicle and army officers Karunaratne and Dilantha had searched the

vehicle. Witness Dilantha has detected a parcel in the right side of the

appellant's pocket and asked him whether it was a "~t:D GJGj" after

taking it out of the pocket they have found five red grocery bags

containing a white substance wrapped in a piece of paper. They have

called the police mobile officers who were stationed close by to identity

the substance. S I Peiris has identified it is containing heroin. S I Peiris

has taken the parcel to the police Narcotic Bureau and weighted the

parcel which contained 23 g. of heroin. Thereafter the parcel and the

appellant were handed over to the Cinnamon Gardens police station. The

two army officers have given evidence at the trial. Their evidence was

that they felt suspicious and searched the three wheeler and found the

parcel with heroin in the appellant's pocket. They didn't know who the

appellant was and they had no reason to fabricate evidence against him.

The learned counsel for the appellant argued that prosecution

witness number two and three have failed the test of probability and they

can not be treated as reliable witnesses. According to the appellant the

two witnesses have differed on the issue of searching the appellant.

Prosecution witness number three had said he saw prosecution witness

number two searching both the passenger and the appellant. This is not

a major issue both of them are army officers who are not familiar with this

kind of detections. Therefore one can not sayan injustice was caused to

the appellant when their evidence was accepted. Their creditability had

been considered by the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment

(pages 342,353 and 354).

The appellant's counsel argued that there was no actual, exclusive

and conscious possession of the parcel with the appellant and cited the

judgment in Banda vs Haramanis 21 NLR 141 where it was held that;

"Criminal liability attaches only to possession on which is proved

to be actual, exclusive and conscious possession on the part of the

person".

The behavior of the appellant had prompted the army officers to

search the appellant and they have found the parcel in his trouser pocket

and called the police officers (prosecution witness number one) who were

nearby and identified the substance to be heroin. The army did not know

the appellant and they were searching the vehicles at the road block and

the appellant's behavior as if he had something to hide prompted them to

search him and the vehicle. This evidence proves that the appellant had

exclusive and conscious possession of the parcel which contained

heroin. It was recovered from his trouser pocket and not from the vehicle

which he claimed was not his.

The appellant's counsel argued that the learned High Court Judge

failed to consider the defence evidence. This is not so the learned High

Court Judge has stated that the defence evidence contradicted each

other. Both of the appellant and the passenger did not deny they had

heroin in the three wheeler, they only disputed the place from where it

was recovered. This has been carefully analysed by the learned High

Court Judge.

Citing the judgment in Moses vs State (1993) 3 SLR 401 the

appellants argued that the trial court must give reasons for accepting the

prosecution evidence and rejecting the defence evidence. It was stated

in the above case that;

"Failure to give reasons may even lead to the inference that

the trial Judge had no good reasons for his decisions."

We find that the learned High Court Judge has given reasons as

stated above for his findings after analyzing the evidence. All grounds of

appeal stated by the appellants have no merit. We are not inclined to set

aside a well considered judgment. Judgment dated 30101/2012 is

affirmed and the appeal is dismissed.
