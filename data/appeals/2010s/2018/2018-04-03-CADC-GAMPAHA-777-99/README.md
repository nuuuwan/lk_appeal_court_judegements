Janak De Silva J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Deceased (Plaintiff) claimed to be the owner of house bearing assessment

no. 184 situated on the land more fully described in the pt schedule to the plaint of which he

claimed to be a co-owner. He averred that there was a right of way from the Kandy-Colombo

road to the said house and land which right of way is more fully described in the 2nd schedule to

the plaint. It was claimed that the said right of way was used by the Plaintiff and his predecessors

uninterruptedly for over 100 years. According to the Plaintiff this right of way only adjoins the

2

land more fully described in the 3rd schedule to the plaint which is owned by the Defendants.

However, the Plaintiff claimed that the Defendants had obstructed this right of way.

Accordingly, the Plaintiff prayed, inter alia, for a declaration that he is entitled to a widening of

the said right of way to a 12 foot wide right of way due to prescription or necessity, prohibiting

the Defendants from obstructing this right of way and damages of Rs. 100/= per day until he is

allowed to use the said right of way.

The Defendants denied the claim of the Plaintiff and submitted that there was another road

access to the Plaintiff's land which is more fully described in the 3rd schedule to the answer. They

further stated that the Plaintiff had failed to make all the owners of the lands over which the

Plaintiff claimed a right of way parties to the action. The Defendants prayed for a dismissal of the

Plaintiff's action, a permanent injunction restraining the Plaintiff from using any other access way

over the lands of the Defendants other than the access road depicted in the 3rd schedule to the

answer. The learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha dismissed the action of the Plaintiff

and granted the permanent injunction prayed for by the Defendants. Hence this appeal by the

Plaintiff.

By the time this matter was argued the Plaintiff was dead and the Substituted Plaintiff-Appellants

(Appellants) were substituted.

One matter that arose for consideration is whether the Plaintiff had made all the owners of the

servient tenements parties to the action. In answering issue no. 27 in the negative and issue no.

28 in the affirmative, the learned Additional District Judge concluded that the Plaintiff's action

must be dismissed due to the failure on the part of the Plaintiff to make all the owners of the

servient tenements parties to the action. The learned Counsel for the Appellants submitted that

this is an erroneous conclusion as there is no need to include as parties' owners of the servient

tenements who did not obstruct or dispute the right of way of the Plaintiff.

3

Ownership of an object consists of a bundle of rights. Some of these rights can be granted to one

person while another continues to be the owner. Such rights are known as iura in re aliena.

Servitudes are examples of iura in re aliena. The essential characteristic of a servitude is that it

limits a person's ownership or dominion. In the case of a right of way the owner of the servient

tenement must allow the owner of the dominant tenement the use of the right of way without

any obstruction.

In view of this limitation on ownership or dominion by a servitude, the logical question is whether

the owner of the servient tenement must be made a party to an action by the owner of the

dominant tenement when a right of way is claimed. This is a live question as the survey plans

presented in evidence indicate that the right of way claimed by the Plaintiff traverses at least two

portions of land owned by other parties who are not parties to this action. This question attains

greater importance as under Roman Dutch law a person obstructed in the enjoyment of a

servitude was entitled to seek his remedy by the actio confessoria which according to Voet1 in

most cases lies against the owner of the servient tenement and if there be more than one, against

each one of them in solidum, because the action is not divisible in this case.

This issue is not devoid of difference of opinion. In Fernando et al v. Dona Maria2 Dalton J. was

of the opinion that where an action is brought to vindicate a right of way over several contiguous

lands, it is necessary to join the owners of all the servient tenements over which the right of way

is claimed. Dalton J. took a similar view in Fernando et 01 v. Angela Fernando 3 A different view

was taken by Drieberg J. in Maralalingam v. Kumarapillai et 014 where he opined that it was not

necessary that all the intervening landowners must necessarily be made parties if they have not

obstructed the right of way. In Fernando et 01 v. Arnolis5 it was held by Drieberg J. and Lyall Grant

J. that in an action for declaration of a right of way all the co-owners of the servient tenement

are necessary parties as such a judgement is against the land and it is therefore necessary that

all the owners of it should be parties to the action. In De Silva v. Nonohamy et 0/6 Macdonnel c.J.,

Garvin S.P.J. and Jayawardene A.J. (Daltons J. dissenting)held that where a person who claims to

be entitled to a right of way which traverses a number of contiguous lands is obstructed and

disturbed in the enjoyment of his rights by the owner of one of these lands, an action brought by

him against the wrong doer for a declaration of his right and damages, is not badly constituted

because the owners of all the intervening servient tenements are not joined as parties.

The Indian courts appear to have adopted a similar position. Madan Mohan Chakravarthy v. Sashi

Bhusan Mukherji7was an action for declaration of a right of way and injunction to remove an

obstruction where the appellants argued that the action should fail since all the owners of the

servient tenements over which the right of way passed had not been made parties to the action.

It was held that only the servient owners who had raised objection to the plaintiff's right of way

need be made parties to the action. In La! Mohammad Biswas v. Emajuddin Biswas and Ors8 it

was held that it would be sufficient to name as defendants the parties that are alleged to be

obstructing the right of way.

Based on the above authorities the position on the need to make owners of servient tenements

parties to an action pertaining to a right of way in Sri Lanka can be stated as follows:

(a) The owner or owners of the servient tenements over which a right of way is claimed in

the pleadings must always be made a party to an action seeking a declaration of a right

of way over that servient tenement

(b) The owner or owners of a servient tenement over which a right of way merely passes

need to be made a party to an action seeking a declaration of a right of way only where

that party has specifically denied or objected to the existence of the plaintiff's right of

way or obstructed it

The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that there was no need to make the owners of

the servient tenements in this case a party to the action as those owners did not obstruct the

right of way of the Plaintiff. I am unable to accede to this argument. The survey plans presented

in evidence indicate that the right of way claimed by the Plaintiff traverses at least two portions

of land owned by other parties who are not parties to this action. The appeal brief contains two

applications made by way of petition and affidavit, one jointly by Mary Jayakody and V.A.

Nishantha Perera and the other by Margaret Perera, to have them added as parties to the action

(Appeal brief pages 310-322). The basis of these applications appears to be that they are the

owners of the land situated to the western boundary of the right of way claimed by the Plaintiff

and that a major portion of the said right of way goes over the land belonging to them. The record

shows that the Plaintiff objected to them being added as parties and therefore the application

was withdrawn later. The point is that the owners of the servient tenement in fact wanted to be

added as parties to the action while claiming that the Plaintiff had fraudulently omitted to make

them parties to the action. Having objected to the said application the Appellant cannot now be

heard to state that they are not necessary parties as they did not cause any obstruction to the

Plaintiff's right of way.

Furthermore, the evidence is that when the land on which the Plaintiff resides was partitioned in

1970, a 4-foot roadway from the Kandy-Colombo road was reserved for the occupants. This

roadway adjoins the land of the Defendants and it is this roadway that the Plaintiff sought to be

extended by way of a declaration to a 12-foot roadway due to prescription or necessity. Greater

portion of such an extended roadway traverses over the two lots situated to the western

boundary of the 4-foot roadway. Yet the owners of the said two lots were not made parties to

this action.

In the aforesaid circumstances, I am of the view that they were necessary parties and that the

learned Additional District Judge has correctly answered issue nos. 27 and 28.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant may have appreciated the above position when he

informed Court that the Appellant was not pursuing the declaratory relief claimed in prayer (q)

of the amended plaint but limiting his relief to prayer (C'J) in the amended plaint.

6

The learned Counsel for the Appellant relied on the decision in Gordon Frazer Co. Ltd. v. Jean

Marie Losio9 where the Court of Appeal held that a plaintiff can in the plaint itself as was done in

that case, seek an injunction to restrain the defendants from committing an act, the commission

or continuance of which would produce injury to the plaintiff, as a substantive relief and that a

decree granting such a substantive relief is permissible in terms of section 217(f) of the Civil

Procedure Code without a prayer for declaratory relief. While I reserve my opinion on the

correctness of this statement, the facts of the two cases are different.

In this case the Plaintiff sought a declaration as to his entitlement to a right of way and thereafter

sought a decree prohibiting the Defendants from obstructing the said right of way. Thus, the

action of the Plaintiff is a combination of a real action, the action for declaration of the right of

way, with a personal action, action preventing the Defendants from obstructing that right of way

and damages. The Appellants cannot then change the character of the action in appeal by

abandoning the real action.

In any event, the evidence in this case does not support even a decree prohibiting the Defendants

from obstructing the said right of way claimed by the Appellants. That is because the Appellants

are seeking to prohibit the Defendants obstructing the right of way depicted in plan nos. 84/1986

and 257/1985 prepared by Ratna Hettiarachchi, licensed surveyor. The evidence shows that the

land depicted in the said plans includes 0.375 perches from the land of the 1st Defendant when

the case of the Plaintiff is that the right of way claimed only adjoins the lands of the Defendants

and does not traverse them. When a plaintiff claims that he has exercised by prescriptive user a

right of way over a defined route, the obligation on the plaintiff to comply with section 41 of the

Civil Procedure Code is paramount and imperative. Strict compliance with section 41 of the Civil

Procedure Code is necessary as the Fiscal would be impeded in the execution of the

decree/judgment if the servient tenement is not described with precision and definiteness. 1o

Servitudes are onerous and the law does not favour them and it is incumbent on a person who

claims a servitude to establish his claim by clear and satisfactory evidence of the strongest kindY

Furthermore, the principle is that a right of way of necessity cannot be granted if there is another

although less convenient path along which access can be had to the public road. In answering

issue nos. 8 and 25 in the negative the learned Additional District judge has concluded that there

is another roadway from the land of the Plaintiff. I see no reason to disagree with this finding of

fact made by the trial judge. The evidence shows that there exists a 12-foot-wide roadway to the

western boundary of the Plaintiff's land which in fact had been used by the Plaintiff. In David v.

Gnanawathie12 Jayasuriya J. held that a way of necessity could only generally be claimed when

there is no other alternative route available. A person is not entitled to claim the best and nearest

outlet on the ground of necessity, if he has another, but less convenient route.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgement of the learned

Additional District Judge of Gampaha dated 28th May 1999.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
