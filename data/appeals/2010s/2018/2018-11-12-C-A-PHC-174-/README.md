This is an appeal filed by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant") against the dismissal of her

revision application No. Rev. 32 of 2012 by the Provincial High Court of

the Western Province holden in Gampaha by its order on 26.11.2013.

In his application to the Magistrate's Court of Gampaha under

Section 28A(3) of the Urban Development Act No. 41 of 1978 as amended

(hereinafter referred to as the "UDA Act"), the Applicant-Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent") sought an order

of Court in respect of two unauthorised constructions effected by the

2

Appellant. It is alleged by the Respondent that he has already served

notice on the Appellant under registered cover and that she had failed to

comply with such directions upon service of notice. The annexed sketch

and report to the said application shows there are two buildings that were

constructed violating the building lines in respect of the two highways it

faces.

The Appellant, in her "petition" filed before the Magistrate's Court

had only raised several technical objections as to the validity of certain

documents.

After an inquiry, the Magistrate's Court issued an order under

Section 28A(3) of the UDA Act authorising the demolition of the

"development activity" described as unauthorised constructions.

Thereafter, the Appellant sought to revise the said order before the

Provincial High Court. During the inquiry before the Provincial High

Court the Appellant submitted that:

i. The said buildings were constructed prior to the date of the

Gazette by which the area was declared a "Development

Area",

11. the affidavit of the Respondent is defective,

111. no prior notice was served on the Appellant directing her to

remove the unauthorised constructions.

In dismissing the application of the Appellant, the Provincial High Court

has, whilst rejecting the objection on the validity of the affidavit as a mere

technicality held that the Appellant has failed to tender any approved plan

for the disputed "development activity" and that the Respondent had in 3

fact served notice prior to his application under Section 28A(3) of the UDA

Act.

The Appellant, in challenging the legality of the said order of

dismissal contended before this Court that the Provincial High Court was

in error when it failed to note that the disputed construction is predated to

the gazette by which the area was declared as "Development Area", the

notice issued by the Respondent is ambiguous and in view of the

unreported judgment of Fernando v Somasiri CA (PHC) 26/2000 decided

on 31.10.2012, there was no opportunity afforded by the Respondent to the

Appellant enabling her to demolish the said buildings and as such had no

authority to seek a Court order.

Section 28A(1) of the UDA Act contemplates two situations under

which the Urban development Authority or its delegate could by written

notice require the person who carried out development activity:-

(a) to cease such development activity forthwith; or

(b) to restore the land on which such development activity

is being executed or has been executed, to its original

condition; or

(c) to secure compliance with the permit under the

authority of which that development activity is carried

out or engaged in, or with any term or condition to such

permit, and for the purposes of compliance with the

requirement aforesaid,

(i) to discontinue the use of any building; or

(ii) to demolish or alter any building work.

4

The two situations that are contemplated could be identified as;

1. any development activity commenced, continued,

resumed or completed without a permit; or

11. development activity commenced, continued, resumed

or completed contrary to any term or condition set out

in a permit issued in respect of such development

activity.

It is inferred from the submissions of the Appellant that she seeks to

rely on the 1st situation referred to above to challenge the validity of the

order of dismissal. Whether the Appellant "commenced, continued, resumed

or completed" any development activity without a valid permit is obviously

a question of fact. The Appellant claims that the disputed buildings did

exist prior to the issuance of the gazette declaring the area as "Development

Area".

However, the Appellant tendered no material to any of the lower

Courts to show that the disputed buildings did exist prior to 1st March

2002. The sketch that had been tendered by the Appellant clearly shows

that there are two buildings, used presumably as business premises that

had been constructed violating the building lines. The sketch was prepared

by Superintendent of Works (Civil) of Mahara Pradesheeya Sabha on

10.12.2009 and the Respondents application to the Magistrate's Court

under Section 28A(3) was filed on 06.07.2011.

In the petition and affidavit filed by the Respondent under Section

28A(3) of the Act, it is specifically alleged that the Appellant had

"completed" the disputed development activity without a permit.

s

Strangely, the Appellant, in her petition and affidavit, did not challenge

this factual assertion by the Respondent nor did she offer any explanation

as to her claim of non-applicability of Section 28A by stating that the

buildings were already constructed prior to the declaration of

"Development Area". Instead, she tendered documents marked X5 to XII

annexed to her revision application for the consideration of the Provincial

High Court.

The Respondent contended that this Court should not consider these

documents as they were never placed before the Magistrate's Court for its

consideration even though she seeks to challenge the validity of the order

it made before the Provincial High Court. In support of this objection, the

Respondent relied on the judgment of CA (PHC) 41/14 decided on

02.05.2017 where it was held by this Court that:-

" As revision is supervisory in nature, and the learned High Court

Judge in exercising the revisionary jurisdiction can only supervise

what has already been submitted in the lower Court. The said

document had not been tendered in the lower Court, hence the

learned High Court Judge in exercising revisionary jurisdiction is

debarred from supervising the said document"

In view of the fact that documents X5 to XII were not placed before

the Magistrate's Court for its consideration in making the impugned order

and had only been tendered belatedly to the Provincial High Court,

seeking to revise the said order made by the lower Court, this Court

6 It I II

should not consider its contents as per the reasoning of the said judgment.

Therefore, we are of the considered view that this ground of appeal is

without merit and accordingly fails.

The other ground of appeal as urged by the Appellant is the failure

of the Respondent to afford an opportunity to the Appellant to comply

with the demolition of the" development activity" before instituting action

before the Magistrate's Court, should be considered next. The Appellant

relied on the judgment of Fernando v Somasiri (supra) in support of her

contention.

This complaint had been dealt with by both Courts below. The

receipt of the registered articles confirms that the notice under Section

28A(1) of the UDA Act was posted to the Appellant on 17.11.2009. The

Respondent in his application to the Magistrate's Court clearly stated that

the notice was posted to the Appellant on 16.11.2009. In her affidavit

tendered before the Magistrate's Court, the Appellant only challenges the

value of postal receipt marked by the Respondent as Pp4";However, she

did not deny the service of notice by post. In addition, the Appellant did

not claim that she was not served with notice in her affidavit filed in

support of the revision application. It is clear from these circumstances, the

Magistrate's Court was satisfied that the Appellant had failed to comply

with the direction on her as per notice issued by the Respondent and thus

satisfied the requirement as highlighted in the judgment of Fernando v

Somasiri (supra).

These circumstances amply justify the inference that she was in fact

served with the prior notice as required by Section 28A(1) of the said Act

7

-. , .

and she did not comply with the directive contained therein. Therefore,

this ground of appeal is also devoid of any merit.

In view of the above considerations, we affirm the orders of both

Courts and dismiss the appeal of the Appellant with costs fixed at Rs.

10,000.00.
