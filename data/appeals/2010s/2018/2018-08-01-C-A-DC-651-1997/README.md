T

he preliminary objection that has been raised against the appeal of the 7 A, 8th, 9th

and lOth Defendant--Appellants is that their notice of appeal is not traceable and it

is not found on the record.

I must observe that Journal Entries recorded in the case prove otherwise and there is

evidence that a notice of appeal has indeed been filed.

The journal Entry No.53 dated 10.09.97 indicates that a notice of appeal was tendered

on 10.09.1997 and it is crystal clear that this notice of appeal was given on behalf of the

7 A, 8th, 9th and lOth Defendant--Appellants.

According to Section 75~)(3) of the Civil ProcedurE Code, the appealable period is

prescribed as 60 days from the date of judgment. That is to say, "anyone who is

dissatisfied with the judgment of the District Court: shall file the petition of appeal

within 60 days of such judgment. But as the first step, he shall file a notice of appeal

within 14 days from the clate of judgment". This is a pre--requisite of appeal proc~:edings.

3

Thus, the present provisions of the Civil Procedure Code, as amended by Law No. 20 of

1977, clearly provide for t'l;VQ stages in the process of appealing, namely:--

(i) the giving of a notice of appeal within 14 days cf the date of judgment; and

(ii) the presentation of a petition of appeal within 60 days of the date of judgment.

-rhe lodging of the notict of appeal within 14 days takes place in terms of Section 754

(3) of the Civil Procedure Code.

The first step that a party who prefers an appeal mus~ take, in terms of the provisions

of Section 754(3) of the C~ivil Procedure Code, is to file' a notice of appeal in the original

court, which passed the judgment or order within such time and in the form and in the

manner prescribed. Sect jon 754(3) states that "every appeal to the Court of Appeal

from any judgment or order of any original Court shall be lodged by giving notice of

appeal to the original Ccurt within such time and in the form and manner hereinafter

provided. "

Actual notice of appeallneans compliance with Sectipn 755(1), (2) and Section 754(4)

regarding the time within which the Notice of App:~al must be presented and also

Section 755(1) and (5). Tissa Dias Bandaranayake,J. (With Wijetunge,J. agreeing) held

in Mahatun Mudalali Cias Parantota v. NA. Naposingho 1986 (3) CALR 318 that

these requirements are ll1andatory to constitute a prorer Notice of Appeal, and if not

fulfilled, the Court has the power to refuse to receive the Notice of Appeal--

Though the complaint ra~sed before this Court is that the notice of appeal is not found

in the record. he same record reflects the fact that the ,.Appellants had filed their notice

of appeal and as junior counsel for the 7 A, 8th, 9th and lOth Defendant--Appellants has

stated in the written submissions, the duty to maint:tin an accurate record with the

documents in tow is an official act of the District Court. In fact this Journal Entry raises

the presumption that Judicial and Official Acts hav~ been regularly performed/see

Illustration (d) to Sectionl14 of the Evidence Ordinance.

The rule embodied in the illustration flows from the,maxim omnia proesumuntur rite et

solemnitere sse acta, i.e., all acts are presumed to have been rightly and regularly done.

4

In my view the minute in'] ournal Entry 53 raises the presumption in Illustration (d) to

Section 114(d) of the Evidence Ordinance.

I had occasion to comment on this presumption in relation to a Journal Entry in CA

! 765/2000 CA minutes of 30.05.2018. Even an earlier case CA 477/2000 (F) decided on

12.09.2017 (A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. with E.A.G.R. Amara~ekara, J. concurring) went into

this rebuttable presumption. It has been laid down that the Court is entitled to

presume that the journal entries, made in a case in compliance with the requirements of

Section 92 of the Civil Pr?cedure Code, set out the sequence correctly-see Seebert Silva

v. Aronona Silva (1957) 60 N.L.R 272

What the learned Justice Frederick Ninian Dimitri (F.N.D) Jayasuriya quite pertinently

observed inJayaweera L Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services, Ratnapura and

Another1996 (2) Sri L.R. 70 becomes pertinent.

"It is not open to the petitioner to file a convenient and self serving affidavit for the first time

before the Court of Appeal and thereby seek to contradict either a quasi judicial act or a judicial

act."

There was nothing proffered in this case to rebut this presumption being'drawn.

Therefore the argument that the notice of appeal is not seen on the record fails and in

any event the resolution of this issue is also founded on the maxim 'actus curiae

neminemgravabit' i.e., an act of Court shall prejudice Ino man. The maxim "is founded

upon justice and good sense, and affords a safe and certain guide for the administration

of the law", said Cresswell, J. in Freeman v. Tranah (12 C.B. 406). If the notice of

appeal is non est in the record, that is no ground to disp1iss the appeal of the Appellant

because it is not through his remissness that the nptice of appeal n1ay have gone

Inissing from the record.

L")nce the notice of appeal is filed, the effect it entails \vas given in the:' case of

MahatunMudalali alias i~t'lrantota v. NA. Naposingho and Another (supra);

5

"the effect of filling the: notice of appeal is to inform the Respondents that the jurisdiction of the

lower court will be suspended once the appeal is taken and also to deprive the respondent

temporarily of the fruits of his victory."

This passage harks back to the observations of the Lord Chancellor Lord Westbury in

the case of The A ttorneJ:> General v. Herman James SiUem (lS64) 11 E.R 1200 at 120S:---

"The ordinary rule is that once an appeal is taken from I~he judgment and decree of an inferior

Court, the jurisdiction of that Court in respect of that case is suspended except of course in

regard to matters to lie. done and directions to be given Jor the pe/Jecting of the appeal and its

transmission to the Court of Appeal."

The fact that the Appellants followed their notice of appeal with a petition of appeal is

evidenced by the day starnp on the Petition of Appeal of the 7 A, S, 9 and lOth Defendant---

Appellants which is dated. 22.10.1997 and there is also -an endorsement by the tegistrar

on the first page of the Petition that it was accepted on 22.10.1997. All this shows that a

properly constituted appr.::11 exists before this Court pe!nding disposal.

Once the petition of appeal as duly constituted has been lodged in this Court, it has

been observed by the S1-~preme Court in Elias v. Cader and another SC Appeal No.

50/200S on 2Sth June 201L-

"For the proper dispensation of justice, raising of technical objections should be discouraged

and parties should be encouraged to seek justice by dea!i ng with the merits of cases. Eaising of

such technical objections and dealing with them and t1:r; subsequent challenges on them to the

superior courts takes up so much time and adds up to the delay and the backlog of cases pending

in Courts. Very often the dealing of such technicalities li~come only an academic exercise with

which the litigants would not be interested. The delay in dispensation of justice can be minimized

if parties are discourCiged from taking up technical objections which takes up valuable judicial

time. What is important for litigants would be their aspiration to get justice from courts on

merits rather than on technicalities. As has often been quoted it must be remembered that

Courts of law are Courts of justice and not academies Ofl(lw."

6

One need not have recourse to Section 759(2) of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) as

there is no mistake, omission or defect in complyingr with the provisions relating to

, I notice of appeal and therefore the preliminary objections raised in regard to the appeal

preferred by the 7 A, 8th, 9th and loth Defendant-Appellants have to be overruled ..

In regard to the other objection raised namely some of the parties who were named in

the District Court have not been named as respondents to the appeal Section 759(2) of

the Civil Procedure Code would come into play.

I took the opportunity~o observe in CA 696/1997 ~CA minutes of 27.01.2017) that

remissness on the part of a draftsman of a petition of appeal in not naming some of the

Defendants as Respondents could not result in an au1tomatic dismissal of the appeal.

The guiding principle is clearly given in Section 759(2) of the Civil Procedure Code in

the following tenor:-

"In the case of any mistake, omission or defect on the part of any in complying with the

provisions of the foregoing sections, (other than a provision specifying the period within which

any act or thing is to be done), the Court of Appeal may, ~f it should be of opinion that the

respondent has not been materially prejudiced, grant relief on such terms as it may deem just."

When Section 759(2) of the CPC alludes to "the pro0sions of the foregoing sections",

Section 758(1)(c) of the CPC which requires the names of the Appellant and

Respondent to be set ou: in the petition of appeal falls within Section 759(2) but the

curative provision Section 759(2) spells out the pow~r of the Court of the Appeal to

grant relief on such terms as it may deem just in the event there is a non compliance

with a foregoing provision such as Section 758(1) (c) of the CPC. The discretion vested

in the Court of Appeal has to be exercised subject to a guiding principle narp.ely the

j Respondents should not have been materially prejudiced ..

This curative provision 759(2) of the CPC has to be read with Section 770 of the CPC.

But Section 770, whilst c;onferring a discretion on the Court of Appeal to implead as

Respondents the parties necessary for the appeal but who had not been joined, does

not spell out a guiding principle as to how and in what manner that discretion should

7

be exercised. As a result one has to look to case lavv to ascertain the remit of the

discretion that our Courts have imposed. I surveyed the case law surrounding this area

in CA Case No. 1105/1996 (F) (CA minutes of 22.06.2018) and I would point to

Section 770 of the CPC that resolves this issue.

Section 770 of the CPC

Section 770 of the Civil Procedure Code states that, 'If, at the hearing of the appeal, the

Respondent is not present and the Court is not satisfied upon the material in the

record or upon other evidence that the notice of appeal was duly served upon him or

his registered Attorney a~ hereinbefore provided, or if it appears to the Court at such hearing

that any person who was a party to the action in the court again~t whose decree the appeal is made, but

who has not been made a party to the appeal, the court may issue the requisite notice of appeal for

service.'

Thus there is a statutory discretion to implead a party and serve notice on him even at

the stage of the appellate hearing. In Kiri Mudiyanse v. Bandara Menika, (1972) 76

N.L.R. 371 Pathirana,j. (with Rajaratnam,j agreeing) considered both Dias v.~4rnolis

17 N.L.R 200 and Ibrahim v. Beebee 19 N.L.R 289. Pathirana, j. (with Rajaratnam, J.)

held that the Supreme Court had the discretionary po\ver under Section 770 of the old

Civil Procedure Code to direct the 1st to 3rd and the 6th to the 8th Defendants to be added

as Respondents. The exercise of the discretion conternplated in Section 770 of the old

CPC was a matter for th~ decision of the judge who heard the appeal in the particular

case. Furthermore, it shuuld be exercised when some' good reason or cause was given

for the non--joinder. The ,discretion which was an unfettered one must, of course, be , exercised judicially and P,)t arbitrarily and capriciously.

In fact Pathirana, j. (with Rajaratnam, j. agreeing) flated that intrinsically there is

nothing in Section 770 either expressly or by necessary implication to inhibit the

discretion to the principles that have been set out ir the case of Ibrahim v. Beebee

(supra) as to do so will b(~ tantamount to saying that the exercise of the discretion is

~ribbed, cabined and confined exclusively to these principles, limiting the exercise of

8

the discretion in a particular way, and thereby putting an end to the discretion itself.

Pathirana,j. quoted the observations made by Lord Wright in Evans v. Bartlam (1937)

~ 2 A.E.R. 646, at 655; (1937) AC 473 at 488:-

"To quote again from Bowen L.]. in Gardner v. Jay 0'885) 29 Ch.D 50: IIWhen a tribunal is

invested by Act of Parliament or by Rules with a discreti~n, without any indication in the Act or

Rules of the grounds upon which the discretion is to be exercised, it is a mistake to lay down any

rules with a view of indicating the particular grooves in which the discretion should run, for if

the Act or the Rules did not fetter the discretion of the Ju~ge why should the Court do so?"

In fact Section 770 of the Old Civil Procedure Code went as follows:-

"If it appears to the Court at such hearing that any persqn who was a party to the act(on in the

. i Court against whose decree the appeal is made, but who has not been made a party to the appeal,

is interested in the res-ult of the appeal, the Court may adjourn the hearing to a future day, to be

fixed by the Court, and direct that such person be made a respondent, and may issue the requisite

notices of appeal to the Fiscal for service."

Pathirana,j. held that Section 770, in his view, gave a very wide discretion to Court and

there was room for introducing other principles by which the Court could exercise its

discretion.

These observations will equally hold true for Section 770 of the current Civil Procedure

Code which enacts a wide discretion, but does not prescribe any particular guideline.

As I observed in CA Case No. 1105/1996 (F) (supru), the criteria to be adopted to

exercise the discretion in Section 770 will depend on the facts and circumstances of

each case and, the previous cases, which upheld preliminary objections based on non-

joinder of the original Defendants or substituted Defendants as Respondents to

petitions of appeal, can~.ot be applied across the board to reject a petition of appeal

which, in the opinion of Court, requires rectification by way of an amendment. '

In the instant appeal, there is no allegation that any party has been materially prejudiced

by the non-joinder of any original party in the case. No material has been placed to

9

substantiate any allegation of material prejudice. In the absence of such material

prejudice as postulated ih Section 759(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, nothing would

inhibit this Court to perrrlit an amendment of the petition of appeal.

His Lordship Justice Priyasath Dep, PCI] (as His Lordship then was) quite percipiently

held in Heenmenike v. Mangala Malkanthi (2016) B.~_.R 110 that the failure to comply

with Section 755(1) by not citing the 2nd substituted Plaintiff as a Respondent in the

notice of appeal and in the petition of appeal is a curable defect under Section 759(2)

and Section 770 of the CPC. His Lordship Priyasath I)ep, PCI] (as His Lordship then

was) drew in aid among a host of judicial precedents the decision of the Supreme Court

in Nanayakkara v. Warnakulasuri)7a (1993) 2 Sri LJL 289 wherein Kulatunga,]. had

held:--

"The power of the Court to grant relief under section 759(2) of the Code is wide and

discretionary and subject to such terms as the Court may deem just. Relief may be granted even

if no excuse for non--cempliance is forthcoming. However, relief cannot be granted if the Court is

of opinion that the respondent has been materially prejudiced in which event the appeal has to be

dismissed. "

In the course of the judgraent, His Lordship also cited t<eerthisiri v. Weerasena (1997)

1 Sri L.R. 70 (G.P.S.de Sihra C]) andJayasekera v. LaRlnini and Others (2010) 1 Sri L.R.

41.

I also take note of the fact, that this matter is yet to be argued and in the absence of any

material prejudice which is palpable, the lA and. 15th Defendant--Appellants are

permitted to amend their petition of appeal in order to bring in the original parties who

are not before Court. Th,. gravamen of the complaint ()f the 4 (a) Defendant--Appellant

is that the Petition of Apl)eal filed by the lA and 15th I)efendant--Appellants is defective

in that it contains the n~me of only the Plaintiff--Respondent and accordingly I allow

the lA and 15th Defendant--Appellants to cite the additional Respondents who should

have been impleaded.

10

It would appear that nOlle of the other objections wOLld impact on these appeals and I

would overrule them. Once the amended petition is filed, this matter could be set down

for hearing.
