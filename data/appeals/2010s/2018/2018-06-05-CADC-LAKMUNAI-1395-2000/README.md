A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. T

he original Plaintiff~Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff")

instituted this action on 18.04.1983 in the District Court of Kalmunai praying for a

declaration of title to the land described in Schedule "B" to the plaint, ejectment of the

Defendants therefrom and for damages and costs.

The Plaintiff stated in her plaint that she became entitled to the said land by Deed

No.3694 dated 09.04.1982 attested by N. Rasiah, Notary Public. She further stated that

she bought this land from one Kathiramathmby Theivanaipillai, who had been in

undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the land along with her predecessors in

title.

The Defendants totally denied the averments in the plaint and they stated in their joint

answer that the 1st and 2nd Defendants were the sons of the 3rd Defendant and the 3rd

Defendant was entitled to the land in dispute by virtue of a Deed bearing No.1l861 dated

23.10.1956 attested by C. Gnanamuttu, Notary Public. But the answer gives a description

of another land which was supposed to have been bought by the 3rd Defendant. The land

described in the answer and the land described in the schedule 'B' to the plaint are not

the same.

The Defendants further stated that they had been in possession and cultivating the said

land since 1956 without any interruption from anyone and they had prescriptive rights

to the same in terms of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance and they prayed for the

dismissal of the plaintiff's action.

When the trial commenced on 04.10.1989, issues were framed by the parties. The Plaintiff

raised the following issues: ~

1. Is the Plaintiff entitled to the land described in schedule 'B' to the plaint as stated

in paragraphs 2,3,4,5 and 6 of the plaint?

2. Are the land described in schedule 'B' to the plaint and the Lots depicted as 2, 3, 4

and 5 depicted in the Plan bearing No. S 64 made by K. Ratnarajah, the same?

2

3. Have the Defendants, since May, 1982, been in unlawful possession of Lot 3 as

depicted in the Plan?

4. Have the Defendants suffered damages? If so how much?

5. If the issues 1 to 4 are answered in favour of the Plaintiff, is the Plaintiff entitled to

the reliefs claimed in the plaint?

6. Prescriptive rights of the parties? (sic)

The 6th issue has been translated into English as above just as it is found in Tamil.

The Counsel who appeared for the Defendants objected to all the issues raised on behalf

of the Plaintiff, and quite particularly he stated that the Plaintiff had not mentioned in

the prayers that he asked relief for the land described in schedule 'B' to the plaint, and

therefore in order to proceed with the case, the plaint must be amended. Having

considered the arguments given by both Counsel the learned District Judge amended the

Issue No.5 as follows:~

5a. If issues Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are answered in the affirmative, is the Plaintiff

entitled to the land described in schedule 'B' to the plaint?

b. If so are the Defendants liable to be ejected therefrom?

c. Further, is the Plaintiff entitled to damages and other reliefs?

Thereafter the follOwing issues were raised on behalf of the Defendants.

7. Have the Defendants been possessing the land depicted as Lot 3 in the said Plan

and described in the schedule 'B' to the plaint as their own land for more than 5

years?

8. If the above issue is answered in the affirmative are the Defendants entitled to

prescriptive rights?

Thereafter, Surveyor Ratnarajah gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff. His Plan No. S

64 dated 08.10.1985 was marked as PI and his report was produced as PIA in his

evidence. According to this witness the plaintiff's husband had shown that Lots 2, 3, 4

3

and 5 were the parcels of land claimed by the Plaintiff. The land in dispute had been

identified as Lot 3. This is a part of the land described in schedule "B" to the plaint' see

page 14 of proceedings of 04.10.1989. This witness testified that Lots 2 and 3 were in the

possession of the Defendants and they must have cleared jungle about 8 or 10 years ago

and they appeared to have been cultivated with paddy for a long time.

According to the surveyor's report PIA, the total extent of Lots 2,3,4 and 5 is five acres

and this corresponds to the land described in schedule 'B' to the plaint. The land in

dispute is Lot 3 which the Defendants were in possession.

The identity of the land in dispute is well established. The Surveyor Ratnarajah's

evidence in this respect is quite clear. He quite accurately differentiates the land claimed

by the Plaintiff from the land claimed by the Defendants. This evidence undoubtedly

settles the issue of identity of the land.

The Surveyor states in his evidence, "The land depicted as Lots 2, 3, 4 and 5 in my plan

relate to T.P.239907. The land in dispute and the land possessed by the defendants is the land shown as

Lot 3 in my plan, which is included in T.P.239907. This Lot is shown as Lot 92570 and 92571

in Primary Plan No. PP 3557. The land described in schedule 'B' is part of TP 92571.The

defendants in their answer have claimed a land as shown as Lot 92582 in 3557 but that

land does not fall within the land surveyed by me. It may be situated beyond the land

surveyed by me".

From this evidence it is abundantly clear that the land in dispute is Lot 3 in Plan S 64 of

Surveyor Ratnarajah which is part of TP 92571 in Plan No. PP 3557 and which is the land

described in schedule 'B' to the plaint. It is, therefore, clear that the land in dispute is Lot

3 claimed by the Plaintiff in her plaint and that is the land now possessed by the

Defendants.

The surveyor said that the Lots 2 ad 3 appeared to have been cultivated. According to the

Plaintiff the Defendants had unlawfully entered the land in May, 1982. If that be so, the

Defendants could have cultivated the land for about 5 or 6 years from 1982, and that is

4

reflected in their Issue No.7 raised in this case stating that they had possession for 5

years.

This action was filed by the Plaintiff on 18.04.l983 and the surveyor gave evidence on

04.l0.l989. That was after over 6 years of the date of the plaint. The Defendants stated in

paragraph 4( d) of their answer dated 02.l2.l983 that their predecessors and they had

been in possession of the land for over 10 years by a title adverse to and independent of

the Plaintiff. But when they raised Issue No.7, they stated, "have the defendants been

possessing the land, depicted as Lot 3 in the said Plan and which is described in the schedule 'B' to the

plaint, as their own land for more than 5 years?".

This issue prominently contradicts the Defendants' position that their predecessors and

they had been in possession for over 10 years.

It is trite law that as a general rule, the claims of a htigant must be determined according

to his rights and the law existing at the date of action brought/see the Full Bench

decision of the Supreme Court comprising Sir Joseph T. Hutchinson, C,J, Mr. Justice

Wendt, and Mr. Justice Middleton in Silva v. Nona Hamine 10 N.LR 44. The institution

of the action is the date on which the plaint was filed. In the instant case the plaint was

filed on 18.04.l983, on which date the Plaintiff had the paper title but the Defendants

were in possession of the land.

From the evidence of the surveyor it is very clear that the land claimed by the Defendants

in their answer was not the land which they were in possession. The land possessed by them

was the land claimed by the Plaintiff and I am of the view that the Defendants have been in

unlawful possession of the land described in schedule 'B' to the plaint since 1982.

At this juncture I wish to take a look at Issue No.7 raised by the Defendants. It states

"Have the defendants been possessing the land depicted as Lot 3 in the said Plan and

described in the schedule 'B' to the plaint as their own land for more than 5 years?"

Generally prescriptive rights claimed by a party is premised on uninterrupted and

undisturbed possession for 10 years previous to the bringing of an action. Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance No. 22 of 1871 is quite clear on this requirement. Five years' 5

possession cannot confer prescriptive rights on a party. This issue clearly exposes the

hidden truth of the matter that when the trial commenced on 04.10.1989, Le., after 6 years

of the filing of the plaint, the Defendant had only 5 years' possession and not 10 years to

make them eligible for prescriptive title.

The Issue No.7 raised by the Defendants refers to the defendants' adverse possession.

When an issue relating to adverse possession over 10 years (in the instant case 5 years) is

raised by the Defendants as against the legal title of the Plaintiff, it is an important

requirement in law that he must prove his 10 years' uninterrupted possession very

cogently. Further, the claimant for prescription must also establish a starting point

which signified the commencement of ten years. If this is not clearly proved, even the

statement of the Defendants that they had 5 years' possession is liable to be rejected,

since there is no starting point alleged of the commencement of 5 years.

In Dingiri Appu v. Mohottihamy Basnayake CJ held, inter alia, that where a land is

owned in common, there must be clear evidence of ouster of all other co~owners, by the

co~owner, who claims that he enjoyed the land exclusively without recognizing the

rights of others. He must also establish that he commenced to do so from a certain

date and that ten years have elapsed from that date. (Emphasis added)

This principle had already been formulated, albeit in somewhat different language by

Bertram c.]., in Tillekeratne v. Bastian~ "Where any person's possession was originally

not adverse, the onus is on him to prove it. And what must he prove? He must prove not

only an intention on his part to prove adversely, but a manifestation of that intention to

the true owner against whom he sets up his possession".2

The requirement of starting point of prescription has also been emphasized in

subsequent cases. In Sirajudeen and two others v. Abba~ (SC) G.P.S. de Silva, C.]

(with Kulatunga,]. and Ramanathan,]. agreeing) stated that where a party invokes the

provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of

1 68 N. LR. 40.

2 (1918) 21 N.LR.12 at p.19.

3 (1994) 2 Sri.LR 365 at p. 370. 6

an adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof rests squarely and fairly

on him to establish a starting point for him or her acquisition of prescriptive rights.

In this case the Defendants have failed to state from when their 5 years' possession

commenced. Furthermore, if they had only 5 years' possession of the said land, that

possession cannot be considered to give them prescriptive rights under Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance.

The Plaintiff did not give evidence in this case but her husband testified on her behalf.

His evidence establishes his wife's title to the land but he stated under cross~

examination that before he bought this land for his wife, he did not know who was in

possession of the land. Other than this witness, the son of the vendor to the Plaintiff

Thangarasa Nadesan also gave evidence for the Plaintiff and in his evidence he stated that

he knew the land in dispute which had been cultivated by his father from 1973 to 1976.

Giving evidence on behalf of the Defendants, the 3rd Defendant testified that, "he cleared

forest and has been cultivating this land for the last 35 to 40 years". And no one had posed any

obstruction to his cultivation and no other person had cultivated this land. His evidence

was supported by one Udumalebbe Abdul Careem who was the cultivator of an adjacent

land. With regard to possession of the land in dispute by the 3rd Defendant it is also

overwhelmingly established by the Vatta Vidane Ismalebbe and Grama Sevaka Mohamed

Haniffa Thajim. They all corroborated the evidence of the 3rd Defendant and other

witnesses who had given evidence for the Defendants.

Even if this evidence is true, it cannot be accepted in view of the fact that the Defendants

themselves admitted that they had possession only for 5 years.

The Defendants had also raised the issue on this basis. I am of the view that even if the

land was with shrub~jungle in 1982, the Defendants could have cleared and possessed

adversely to the plaintiff's rights.

"It is the duty of the Court to record the issue on which the right decision of the case

appears to the Court to depend. Once issues are framed, the case which the Court has to

7

..

hear and determine becomes crystallized in the issues and the pleadings recede to the

background"~PerG.P.S. De Silva C.J. in Hanaffi v. Nallamma (1998) 1 Sri L.R. 73.

This is a rei vindicatio action, in which the trite principle followed by court is when the

Plaintiff has paper title and the Defendant is in possession, the burden is on the Plaintiff

to prove his title. Only when this burden is satisfactorily discharged, the onus of proving

prescriptive possession devolves on the Defendant~see the PC decision of Siyaneris v.

Jayasinghe Udenis De Silva 52 N.L.R. 289.

Upon an evaluation of the evidence led in this case it is abundantly clear that the

Plaintiff, by documents marked P2~ P6 has satisfactorily established that she is entitled

to the land in dispute. But the Defendants have failed to establish that their predecessors

in title or they ever possessed and cultivated this land for more than 10 years. In this

regard, the evidence of the independent's witnesses, the Surveyor Ratnaraja, the Vadda

Vidana and the Grama Sevaka has to be considered.

It is settled law that scanty and vague evidence without details of the people who

possessed a land is insufficient to satisfy a Court that there was possession within the

meaning of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance~See Romanis & Others v. Siveth

Appuand Another.4 T.S. Fernando, J. (with Sri Skanda Rajah, J. agreeing) stated in

Romanis (supra) that vague evidence without details, that people "possessed" a land is

insufficient to satisfy a Court that there was possession within the meaning of section 3

of the Prescription Ordinance.

In Hassan v. Romanishamy,s Basnayake, C.] (with Sirimane,]. concurring) said: "Mere

statements of a witness, "I possessed the land", or ''we possessed the land" and "I planted plantain bushes

and also vegetables", are not sufficient to entitle him to a decree under section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance, nor is the fact of payment of rates by itself proof of possession for the purposes of this section".

The land described in the answer of the Defendants is not the land in dispute. In terms of

the evidence of the Surveyor Ratnarajah there is no doubt about this position. This

468 C.L.W 40

5 66 C.L.W. 112 8

matter is also corroborated by the Plan and Report of the second Surveyor Jalaldeen.

Both these surveyors state that the land in dispute is Lot 3 depicted in Plan No. S 64.

Hence, the identity of the land in dispute is well established.

The legal title of the Plaintiff to Lot 3 is not contradicted by the Defendants. As against

this position, the only question that is placed before this Court is whether the

Defendants had had undisturbed and uninterrupted possession for ten years as claimed

by them against the title of the Plaintiffs from a certain date. As stated in this judgment

earlier the Defendants have failed to establish a starting point from which they began to

possess this land. In the absence of this evidence, I hold that the Defendants did not have

prescriptive possession over 10 years to enable them to become entitled to this land. I

therefore reject the claim of the Defendants on prescriptive rights.

The Defendants had encroached on the land belonging to the Plaintiff and since May,

1982 they have been in unlawful possession of the land and cultivating it to the loss and

detriment of the Plaintiff. Therefore, the Defendants are liable to pay damages to the

Plaintiff.

The learned District Judge, after considering all the evidence led in this case has entered

judgment on 12.01.2000 in favour of the Defendants, holding that the Defendants had

been possessing the land in dispute for a long time. This finding is totally against the

evidence led in this case and contrary to the law of prescription.

I therefore hold that the judgment of the learned District Judge of Kalmunai dated

12.01.2000 is erroneous and must be set aside. For the reasons stated above, I allow the

appeal and declare that the Plaintiff is entitled to the land described in schedule 'B' to the

plaint, together with costs payable to the Plaintiff. The claim for ejectment of the

Defendants is allowed. Since the Defendants have unlawfully possessed and cultivated

the land in dispute, I also allow the plaintiff's claim for damages as prayed for in the

plaint.
