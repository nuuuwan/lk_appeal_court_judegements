This appeal was filed by the Accused-AppeVant seeking to set aside the conviction

and sentence imposed by the Learned Higp Court Judge ofWelikada, in the case of

HC 49/06. The Respondent has informed that they do not wish to file written

submissions.

Facts of the case:

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) was arrested on

or about 17.10.2003 along with another who was an Indian National, for

., . possession of heroin 142.3g. Thereafier,::both suspects were produced before the

1 Learned Magistrate of Maligakanda and :were ordered to be remanded. The Indian

National was released from the case on the advice of the Hon. Attorney General,

"'1 and the Appellant was continued to be in ~emand. Subsequently, the Appellant was

ii indicted in the High Court of Colombo on two counts under sections 54A (c) and

54A (b) of the Poison, Opium and Dangetous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the

Act No. 13 of 1984. The Appellant pleaded not guilty to the said charges and

Page 2 of 8

.,.

"

\ ., commenced the trial against him. The prosecution had led 4 witnesses and the

"r I-defence had led one witness and the Appellant had made a dock state~ent. On

19.06.2007, the Learned High Court Jud~e delivered the Judgment convicting the

Appellant and imposed death sentence.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment, the Appellant filed this appeal seeking to I':. set aside both the conviction and the sentence.

The Counsel for the Appellant submitted following grounds of Appeal:

1. The chain of the custody. of the production (inwards and outw8:rd

journey) 'was not establishf;d by the Prosecution,

., 2. Identity of the production 'Yas not proved,

3. Material discrepancies and inacy,uracies in the prosecution case.

)

Numerous discrepancies have been specified by the Counsel for the Appellant.

Accordingly the date of committing the offence in the indictment was 17.1 0.2003.

,j" As per the evidence of PW 01-Chiran Buddhika, the date on rubber seal of the

Government Analyst's Department on tJ?e cover of production was 20.02.2003

~ t (page 82 of the brief). According to the evidence of the Assistant Government

Analyst, the production was handed over to the Government Analyst's Department

on 20.10.2003 (Receipt No: CD/2901l03). However to the contrary, the Analyst's

Report marked as 'P11' stated that the request letter by the OIC of Police Narcotic

Bureau (PNB) was sent on 29.10.2003. (Page 10 of the brief) ;i

". In the evidence of the Assistant Government Analyst, she had identified and

marked two packets of production as T1;~md T2 (page 169 and 1,70 of the brief),

. i whereas the Government Analyst's report had indicated those as PI and P2.

Page 3:of 8 ,

We observe that the chain of custody of the production from the Government . . Analyst's Department to Court was not challenged by the defence and accordingly

marked as an admission under section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. ]50fI979.

In the case of Perera v Attorney General](1998) 1 Sri. LR 378 it was held that,

"The most important journey is the inwards journey because the final

Analyst Report will depend on that. :

As the Defendant had admitted the ,correctness of the procedure adopted by

the prosecution in sending the production to the Analyst Department he is

estoppedfrom contesting the validity oJthe correctness of the Analyst Report

even if the prosecution had not led in evidence the receipt of acceptance of

the productions by the Analyst Department ... "

The Counsel for the Appellant submitted) that the production sent from the PNB

was taken over by one K.P. Chandrani at the Government Analyst's Department

and she had not been called to testify. j",

In the Judgment dated 19.06.2007, the Learned High Court Judge has stated as follows;

"~@eJ! @~:>~eJ! ~825f2.5) e5""b~Z) i!58~ f!J q~D Z5)~C) 338 ~8~ ~cfd:> Z5)oh

of the Judgment/ page 211 of the brief)"

However, upon perusmg the proceedings of the trial it is evident that the

prosecution witness Jayamanne had haf!ded over the production to one K.P.

Chandrani at the Government Analyst's Department and the Assistant Government

Page 4 of8

Analyst had acquired production from said K.P: Chandrani (Page 154 and 167 of

the brief).

In the case of Mohammed Kaldeen Mij~ammed Nilam v. Attorney General

leA 98/2002 (unreported)], it was held that,

\ ',1 " ... the prosecution cannot escapeifrom the responsibility of proving the

inward journey of the production beyond any reasonable doubt and

establish the inward journey in order to show that the productions were

never tampered with at any stage of the inward journey which is much more

significant and relevant than the outwardjourney ... "

We find that one K.P. Chandrani had handled production at a subsequent stage of

inward journey and she had not been ,called to give evidence. Therefore the I. ' Prosecution had failed to establish the chc:in of the custody of production beyond

reasonable doubt.

Further we observe that there was a differ~nce between the total weights of the two

~ packets of heroin as per the evidence of the police officer who conducted the raid

and the Government Analyst's report. According to the evidence of Chiran

"~I Buddhika, IP, the total weight of two pack,ets was 504g (page 82 of the brief) while

I the evidence of the Assistant Government Analyst indicated the total weight as

! 142.03g (Page 170 of the brief). However, it is understood that the Assistant

Government Analyst was referring to the JVeight of pure heroin (nett weight) after

conducting the HPLC test (page 169 of the brief), and the Police officer was

referring to the gross weight of packets without removing polythene cover (Page

75 of the brief).

, page 75 of the brief)

In the case of Van Der Hultes v. Attorn~y General (1989) 1 Sri. LR 204, it was

held that, "

"Discrepancies in the weight a/the heroin at the time of detection and at

the time of analysis and in the s~;ze of the packings are insufficient to cast

doubt on the evidence of the identity ... "

It is pertinent to note that the Learned H,igh Court Judge, in the Judgment dated

19.06.2007, had stated that the Police raid~was done on 22.11.2000.

)lC)~@~ qzsj qruoCQ)C) cr.ns)Z5):) C~@~ ... " (Page 1 0 of the judgment! page

197 of the brief)

We observe that the said date mentioned by the Learned High Court Judge is

manifestly erroneous since the date of commission of offence as per the indictment

was 17.10.2003.

Further, the Learned High Court Juqge has stated In the Judgment that

Jayamanne(PW) had delivered produ;etion to the Government Analyst's

Department on 27.l0.2003 while said Jayamanne had testified that he delivered

" production to the Department on 20.10.2Q03. (Page 154 and 205 of the brief)

The position of the Respondent with regard to these discrepancies and inaccuracies

was that those were typographical mistakes of stenographers of the High Court, but

we are of the view that the Learned State Counsel who conducted the trial had

Page f of 8

f'r. , ,

ample opportunity to rectify those mistakes before the Learned High Court Judge

and that was hislher duty.

Further, when there are discrepancies and1errors in the proceedings which go to the

root of the case, the trial judge should have considered and got them corrected

before pronouncing the Judgment. But tht1 Learned High Court Judge had blatantly \ disregarded the important contradictions. Therefore we find that the Learned High

Court Judge has misdirected himself in certain instances as mentioned above.

Under these circumstances, we are of, the view that it is unsafe to stand the

conviction against the Appellant wittlout rectifying the discrepancies and

shortcomings of the prosecution case. The date of conviction was far back in 2007

and the Appellant has been in the remand prison for over 10 years.

Therefore considering above mentioned cjrcumstances, we set aside the conviction

l and the death sentence imposed by' the,I,earned High Court Judge of Welikada

under case No. 49/06.

Accordingly, the Appeal is allowed. . i ,

Registrar is directed to send a copy of the Judgment to the relevant High Court and

infonn prison authorities to produce the Appellant before the Learned High Court

Judge when pronouncing the Judgment.
