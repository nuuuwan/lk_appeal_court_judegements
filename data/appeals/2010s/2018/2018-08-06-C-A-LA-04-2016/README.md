Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed the action to partition the land described in the

schedule to the plaint. After trial the District Judge by Judgment

dated 21.05.1984 dismissed the action. The 1st defendant then

filed a decree dated 21.05.2000 incorporating inter alia that the

land was partitioned between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant.

This he did solely by clinging onto the affirmative answer given in

the Judgment to issue No. 2 of the plaintiff. Issue No. 2 was

whether the land shall be partitioned between the plaintiff and the

1st defendant as pleaded in paragraph 11 of the plaint. The

District Judge signed the said decree and the 3rd defendant was

ejected by executing the writ.

The application of the 3rd defendant for restoration of possession

on the basis that he was evicted upon an erroneous decree was

refused by the District Judge by order dated 12.09.2002, which

was later set aside by this Court by Judgment dated 16.10.2007 in

Revision Application No. 1704/2002 wherein this Court came to

the strong conclusion that the aforesaid decree signed by the

District Judge is not in conformity with the Judgment and the

injury caused to the 3rd defendant by execution of the erroneous

decree shall be remedied by invoking the inherent powers of the

3

Court. Based on this Judgment an amended decree has been

entered at the instance of the 3rd defendant and signed by the

District Judge.

Thereafter the 1st defendant has again filed an application dated

08.03.2011 seeking to refuse the amended decree and execution of

the writ to restore the 3rd defendant in possession. This

application has been rejected by the District Judge by order dated

01.04.2011 and the same has been affirmed both by the Civil

Appeal High Court of Kurunagala and the Supreme Court.

It is thereafter the 1st defendant has again filed an application

dated 20.10.2015 (a) to leave the decree filed by the 1st defendant

dated 21.05.2000 intact (b) to reject the amended decree filed by

the 3rd defendant and (c) not to issue the writ against the 1st

defendant.

This application has been rejected by the District Judge by order

dated 29.04.2016 on the basis that these reliefs have already been

refused by the earlier orders of the superior Courts. It is against

this order the 1st defendant seeks leave to appeal.

From the above narration, it is abundantly clear that the impugned

order of the District Judge is perfectly correct. There is no

necessity for this Court to give any more reasons to justify the said

order.

Leave to appeal against that order is refused with costs.
