Decided on : 04.04.2018

P. Padman Surasena, lCP/CA)

On the last occasion on 08.03.2018, this court heard the submissions of

the learned counsel for the petitioner. The court was not inclined to

issue notice on the respondents on that occasion. However, court

directed the learned counsel for the petitioner to give notice of this

application to the respondents and then support it further and the case

was fixed for further support for today. The learned State Counsel

today informs court that the prayer "C" of the petition has already been

granted to the petitioner. (i.e. the petitioner has been granted the

exclusive privilege of selling toddy by retail in the relevant toddy

tavern). This court observes that it is the main prayer of this

application and the main purpose as to why the petitioner has filed this

application before this court. Since the main prayer has been granted,

there is no further relief that is available for this court to award to the

petitioner. Therefore, there is no basis to permit this application to be

further pending in this court.

Learned counsel for the petitioner concedes that petitioner has

deposited the money as directed by the respondent for the purpose of

obtaining this privilege. However, he states that he was not permitted

to sign the contract in terms of section 11.

This court observes that the said matter does not form part of the

instant application. Learned State Counsel submits that the relevant

license will be granted to the petitioner only after the Commissioner

General of Excise grants approval for the relevant premises.

Learned State Counsel further submits that the prayer "b" does not

arise as the exclusive privilege as per prayer "C" has already been

granted to the petitioner. Since the grievances of the petitioner in the

subject matter pertaining to this application has already been

addressed. We see no reason to entertain this application any further.

Therefore, we refuse to issue notices on the respondents and proceed

to dismiss this application without costs.
