This is an appeal from the judgment of the Learned District Judge of Kuliyapitiya

in respect of a Partition action bearing case Number 6762/P. The Plaintiff-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 'Respondent') filed a Plaint on 31 st

August 1982, inter alia seeking the following reliefs:

a) That the land described in the schedule Malhamige Kumbura in the Plaint

be partitioned under the provisions of the Partition Act No. 21 of 1977.

b) Seeking an order from the District Court that she is entitled to 3/4 of the

land described in the schedule to the Plaint as she had become the owner

of the said share by possessing the said share for a long period; and

c) Costs of partition and all other reliefs that could be granted by Court

According to the said Plaint, the Respondent asserted that the 1 st Defendant who

was subjected to the provisions of the Kandyan Law had gifted 3/4 share of the

said land to Kirimenike Kumarihami by Deed No. 2161 dated 5th July 1980. Later,

the 1st Defendant had canceled the said transfer by deed No. 33964 dated 14th

December 1981, and after cancelling this, he subsequently transferred his rights

to the Respondent by Deed No. 33966 dated 15th December 1981.

According to the Statements of Claim of the 2nd to 6th Defendants, the lis

pendens had not been registered in the correct folio. Therefore, they had taken

up a position that this case cannot be maintained and sought a dismissal of this

action (vide page 71 in the appeal brief).

The impugned judgment had been delivered by the District Judge on 19th

February 1997 in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment this appeal is preferred to this Court by the Defendant-Appellants

When this appeal was taken up before this Court, (before Salam, J) on

12.10.2010 case was fixed for argument on 30.03.2011 and on that date Counsel

for the Defendant-Appellants moved for a date and argument was fixed on

06.07.2011. After that this case had been called before this Court on several

dates.

And on 11.10.2012 when this case was called before Sarath de Abrew, J. 4th and

5th Defendants were present but the Respondent was absent and unrepresented.

Therefore, the Court had directed the Registrar to issue notice on the

Respondent, returnable on 16.01.2013 and to fix a date for argument.

According to Court Appeal minutes dated 11.01.2013, the Court was informed

that the Attorney-at-Law of the Respondent had passed away. And the Court on

several occasions had taken steps to notice the Respondent and her Registered

Attorney. On 27.06.2013 court also was informed that the Respondent's

Attorney-at-Law passed away.

Journal entry of 06.08.2013 indicates that Appellants are represented by counsel

and Respondent is absent and unrepresented; further, it was informed again that

the Registered Attorney for Respondent had passed away.

On several dates, the case had been called and finally on 22.06.2018 counsel for

4th and 5th Defendants had tendered their written submissions and Judgment

reserved for 22.10.2018 before me.

Accordingly, it is to be noted that although this Court had taken steps to hear the

parties involved in the case, there seems to be no interest shown by the said

parties to pursue their case.

In the above back drop, this Court is only provided with the written submission of

the 4th and 5th Defendants-Appellants.

It is noted that the Respondent had summoned several witnesses to testify on

behalf of him; even she was not to do so.

Considering this appeal, the Respondent's main contention was that Kiribanda by

deed No. 33964 had invalidated the gift under the provisions of the Kandyan Law

and thus Kiribanda became the owner of 3/4 shares which he had sold to the

Respondent. The balance 1/4 share was owned by Kiribanda's brother Punchi

Appuhamy (marked as P8). All these facts, testified by the witness - Ukkubanda

had given evidence and had asserted that Malhamige Kumbura was possessed

by Kiribanda (Alice Nona's husband) - (vide pages 93-97 in the appeal brief).

The bone of contention of this case was in regard to the invalidated Deed of Gift

given under the Kandyan Law Ordinance (Act No. 39 of 1939). Section 5 of the

said Ordinance spells out that the gift under the said ordinance cannot be

invalidated.

Section 5(1) of the said Act read as follows:

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4 (1), it shall not be lawful for a

donor to cancel or revoke any of the following gifts where any such gift is

made after the commencement of this Ordinance:-

(a) ........................ .

(b) any gift in consideration of and expressed to be in consideration of a

future marriage, which marriage has subsequently taken place;

(c) ....................... .

,

6

(d) any gift, the right to cancel or revoke which shall have been expressly

renounced by the donor, either in the instrument effecting that gift or in

any subsequent instrument, by a declaration containing the words " I

renounce the right to revoke " or words of substantially the same

meaning or, if the language of the instrument be not English, the

equivalent of those words in the language of the instrument:

Therefore, the submissions of the 4th and 5th Defendant-Appellants were that this

invalidation is illegal and therefore the observation of the Learned District Judge

was wrong. On this point, I am of the opinion that this submission holds the

matter as regards to the invalidation of the said Deed of Gift.

Further, it is contented that the Malhamige Kumbura and Weboda Kumbura

refers to the same land. And the Learned District Judge had not given his mind to

this issue. The conclusion arrived at regarding this point too is erroneous. This

fact is demonstrated by witness Sumanapala, Secretary, Govi Karaka Sabava

that both these names refer to the same land. (Vide page 99 to 103 in the appeal

brief)

In the circumstances as contended by the 4th and 5th Defendant and the reasons

set out above, I think the only course open to me now is to set aside the

Judgment of the District Judge.

Therefore, the appeal is allowed and the Judgment of the District judge dated

19th February 1997 is set aside.

Appeal Allowed.
