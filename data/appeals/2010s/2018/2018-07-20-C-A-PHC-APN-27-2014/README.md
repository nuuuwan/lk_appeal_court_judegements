This Order is on the application made by the Petitioner-Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner

(Petitioner) for interim relief in terms of paragraphs (f) and (g) of the Amended Petition which

reads:

(f) issue an interim order restraining the 6th Respondent from approving any building

plans or documents submitted by the 1st and 2nd Respondents as the owners of

the land and premises forming assessment no. 52, Colombo Road, Kurunegala

pending the final determination of this application;

(g) issue an interim order staying the operation of that part of the aforesaid Order of

the learned High Court Judge dated 20.01.2014 ["A3"] in HCW 4/2013 setting

aside/cancelling the settlement reached/undertaking provided by the 3rd and 6th

Respondents on 22.02.2013 in the writ application numbered HCW 14/2012 and

concluded on 22.01.2013 on the undertaking provided by the 3rd and 6th

Respondents pending the final determination of this application.

The case of the Petitioner is that he is one of the co-owners of the land and premises bearing

assessment no. 52, Colombo Road, Kurunegala by virtue of Deed bearing no. 7555 dated

13.03.2009. Accordingly, he made an application to the 3rd Respondent to have his name entered

in the assessment register maintained at the Kurunegala MuniCipal Council, the 6th Respondent,

to pay rates and taxes. After obtaining legal advice from the lawyer of the 6th Respondent, the

3rd Respondent requested the 4th Respondent to reconsider the view previously taken and to

Page 4 of9

consider whether the name of the Petitioner can be registered in respect of the land in dispute.

Thereafter, by letter dated 28.11.2011 the 3rd Respondent informed that the name of the

Petitioner has been entered in the assessment register.

However, subsequently the Petitioner was informed by the 3rd Respondent that the 4th

Respondent had cancelled the report dated 13.07.2011 by his letter dated 24.11.2011 and the

letter dated 28.11.2011 is cancelled by the 3rd Respondent. Hence the writ application bearing

no. HCW/14/2012 was filed by the Petitioner seeking the following relief:

(a) A writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions of the 1St, 2nd and 3rd Respondents in the said

application (3rd to 5th Respondents in this application) dated 21.11.2011 and 24.11.2011

cancelling the registration of the name of the Petitioner in the assessment register at the

Municipal Council of Kurunegala,

(b) A writ of mandamus directing the pt Respondent in the said application (3rd Respondent

in this application) to register the name of the Petitioner in the assessment register at the

4th Respondent in the said application, Municipal Council of Kurunegala (6th Respondent

in this application),

(c) Interim order preventing the 1st and 4th Respondents in the said application (1st and 4th

Respondents in this application) and/or their servants and/or agents from granting

planning permission to any person or persons to build on the land at No. 52, Colombo

Road, Kurunegala pending the final determination of that application.

On 22nd January 2013, that case was settled on an undertaking provided by the 3rd and 6th

Respondents that the name of the Petitioner will be entered in the assessment register with

respect to property bearing assessment no. 52, Colombo Road, Kurunegala.

The Petitioner submits that the pt and 2nd Petitioners-Respondents-Respondents (pt and 2nd

Respondents) who were not parties to the initial writ application bearing no. HCW 14/2012 had

made an application citing the very caption and case number along with a new case number HCW

04/2013 claiming that the "order" made by the learned High Court Judge on 22.01.2013 was per

incuriam as necessary parties had not been heard before making the said "order". The Petitioner

submits that on 19.03.2013, the learned High Court Judge had proceeded to make order, based

Page 5 of9

on an "agreement" reached between the 1st and 2nd Respondents and 3rd and 6th Respondents

that there will be no changes made to the assessment register maintained by the 6th Respondent

in relation to the disputed property until a determination is made as to the ownership of the said

property. The Petitioner claims that this was done without notice to him.

The Petitioner submits that thereafter he filed papers in the said case stating his case. The learned

High Court Judge had on 20.01.2014 delivered order setting aside/cancelling the settlement

reached on 19.03.2013 in HCW 4/2013 on the basis that the said order is per incuriam as the

Petitioner had no notice of the said application and also proceeded to set aside /cancel the

settlement reached by the 3rd and 6th Respondents and the Petitioner on 22.01.2013 in

application bearing no. HCW 14/2012 as it had been made without the necessary parties. It is

against this order that the Petitioner has filed this revision application and sought interim relief.

The Petitioner has also filed an appeal against the said order bearing no. CA(PHC) 17/2014 which

is pending before this Court.

In Weerawansa and Others v. Attorney General [(2006) 1 Sri. L. R. 377 at 384] Sarath N. Silva c.J.

stated as follows:

"In considering the nature and the extent of the interim relief to be granted it is relevant

to advert to the criteria generally applicable to the grant of interim relief. The criteria that

is generally applicable is to be discerned from the judgments of this Court constituting

precedents that date to the judgment in the case of Jinadasa vs. Weerasinghe. The criteria

fall under 3 different heads. I would summaries the criteria under the following heads:

(i) Prima Facie Case

The party seeking interim relief should make out a strong prima facie case of an

infringement or imminent infringement of a legal right. That, there is a serious question

to be tried in this regard with the probability of such party succeeding in establishing the

alleged ground of illegality.

Page 6 of9

(ii) Balance of Convenience

Under this head the main factor to be considered is the uncompensatable disadvantage

or irreparable damage that would result to either party by granting the interim relief or

the refusal thereof.

(iii) Equitable Considerations

This involves the consideration of the conduct of the respective parties as warrants the

grant of interim relief.

Prima Facie Case

In this regard, it is observed that the Petitioner has failed to add the 1st and 2nd Respondents as

parties to the application bearing no. HCW 14/2012 in the High Court of Kurunegala although he

was aware that their names had been registered in the assessment register maintained by the

6th Respondent. An important rule regarding the necessary parties to an application for a writ of

certiorari is that is that those who would be affected by the outcome of the writ application

should be made respondents to the application. [Amaratunga J. in Wijeratne (Commissioner of

Motor Traffic) v. Ven. Dr. Paragoda Wimalawansa Thera and 4 others [(2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 258 at

267]. Failure to do so can result in the application been dismissed in limine. The Petitioner has

failed to do so.

This is an application in revision. In Perera v. Peoples Bank [(1995) 2 Sri. L. R. 84] the Supreme

Court held that revision is a discretionary remedy and the conduct of the party invoking this

jurisdiction is a matter which is relevant. In this case, the Petitioner has surreptitiously obtained

certain reliefs in HCW 14/2012 in the High Court of Kurunegala without making the pt and 2nd

Respondents parties despite their rights been affected by the said application.

Page 7 of9

The purported settlement entered in HCW 14/2012 in the High Court of Kurunegala between the

Petitioner and the 3rd and 6th Respondents on 22.02.2013 in the writ application numbered HCW

14/2012 also appears to have been done by the 3rd and 6th Respondents acting under dictation.

In particular, it was done even though the State raised an objection that necessary parties have

not been made Respondents, which objection the learned High Court Judge also overlooked.

The dispute between the Petitioner and the 1st and 2nd Respondents is essentially on the title to

the disputed premises. The Petitioner can seek to vindicate his title to the disputed premises

against the 1st and 2nd Respondent in appropriate proceedings and also apply for interim relief in

the said proceedings. Therefore, there is no irreparable or irremediable damage caused to the

Petitioner by this Court refusing interim relief.

The remedy by way of judicial review is not the forum to resolve disputes as to title to immovable

property which invariably involves disputed facts [Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board and another

(1981) 2 Sri. L. R. 471, Dr. Puvanendran and another v. Premasiri and two others (2009) 2 Sri. L.

R. 107]. Yet, the Petitioner sought to do just this in HCW 14/2012 in the High Court of Kurunegala

and indeed was successful by way of a purported settlement. The granting of interim relief in

terms of prayer (g) will result in this Court giving effect to a wrong procedure.

The Petitioner has also suppressed the fact that he has not prosecuted his title against the pt and

2nd Respondents predecessor in title in case no. 5322/l though he had the opportunity to do so.

It is established law that discretionary relief will be refused by Court without going into the merits

if there has been suppression and/or misrepresentation of material facts [W. S. Alphonso

Appuhamy v L Hettiarachchi (77 NlR 131 at 135-6)]. In fact, in Dahanayake and Others v. Sri

Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. and Others [(2005) 1 Sri.L.R. 67] this Court held that if there is

no full and truthful disclosure of all material facts, the Court would not go into the merits of the

application but will dismiss it without further examination.

Page 8 of9

The power of attorney holder of pt and 2nd Respondents have filed an affidavit dated 26.09.2016

wherein it is stated that building plans for the land in dispute has already been approved by the

3rd and 6th Respondents. Copies of the approved building plan and building permit have been

annexed. Therefore, I am of the view that interim relief as prayed for in prayer (f) does not arise

for consideration.

For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the Petitioner has not made out a strong

prima facie case of an infringement or imminent infringement of a legal right and that there is no

serious question to be tried in this regard with the probability of the Petitioner succeeding in

establishing the alleged ground of illegality.

Balance of Convenience

The balance of convenience is not in favour of the Petitioner as he can seek to vindicate his title

to the disputed premises against the pt and 2nd Respondent in appropriate proceedings and also

apply for interim relief interim relief in the said proceedings.

Equitable Considerations

The equitable considerations are also not in favour of the Petitioner as his conduct is

unmeritorious as explained above.

For the foregoing reasons, the interim relief sought by the Petitioner is refused with costs.
