When this matter was taken up for argument on 4th July 2018, the learned

Counsel appearing for all Parties moved that this Court pronounce judgment

on the written submissions that would be tendered by the parties.

The Petitioners have filed this application, seeking inter alia the following

relief:

")

a) Writs of Certiorari to quash the decisions contained in the documents

annexed to the petitionl marked 'Xll111 'X1512 and 'X2113;

b) A Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st - 3rd Respondents from recovering

or taking steps to recover the rates set out in the Schedule annexed to the

petition marked 'X2014;

c) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st -3rd Respondents to duly

investigate and/or inquire the matters raised by the Petitioners in their

letter dated 23rd January 20131 annexed to the petition marked 'X1815;

d) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st - 3rd Respondents to re-assess the

premises No. 545/11 Sangarajah Mawatha l Colombo 10 from the year

1997.

The 1st and 2nd Petitioners are duly incorporated companies. The 1st Petitioner

states that it purchased a land in 1980 bearing assessment No. 5451 Sangharaja

Mawatha l Colombo 101 containing in extent of 1A 2R 30P. The assessment

number had subsequently been amended to No. 545/1. The Petitioners state

that the buildings situated on the said premises were constructed over 50

years ago and that their offices and factories are situated in these buildings.

1 'X11' is a demand notice dated 28th February 2012 sent by the 1S! Respondent demanding the payment of a sum of Rs. 9,079,560 being the arrears of rates due as at 31st December 2011.

2 'X15' is the final reminder dated 16th November 2012 sent by the 1st Respondent seeking the payment of a sum of Rs. 9,079,560 being the arrears of rates due as at 31st December 2011. .

3 'X21' is a seizure notice dated 21't June 2013 issued by the 1 S! Respondent in respect of premises No. 545/1, Sangaraja Mawatha informing that the said premises have been seized for non-payment of a sum of Rs. 9,079,560 being the arrears of rates due as at 31 S! December 2011.

4 'X20' is a schedule prepared by the Petitioners setting out the rates payable for the period 1995 - 2012. s 'X18' is a letter sent by the Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioners seeking a reconsideration of the rates payable.

The Petitioners claim that the said buildings are presently in a dilapidated

condition and that their businesses have not been profitable for several years.

This application relates to two separate matters. The first is the Notice of

Assessment issued by the 1st Respondent for the year 2012 and the alleged

failure by the 1st Respondent to consider the objections of the 1st Petitioner

and to grant the Petitioners a hearing in respect of the said objections. The

second is the non-payment by the Petitioners of arrears of rates due as at 31st

December 2011 in respect of the said premises and the steps taken by the 1st

Respondent to recover the said arrears in rates.

This Court would now proceed to consider the first matter.

Detailed provisions with regard to the assessment of premises for the purpose

of the imposition of rates, issuing of notices of assessment, imposition of rates

etc are contained in the Municipal Councils Ordinance No. 29 of 1947, as

amended (the Ordinance). In terms of Section 235(3) of the Ordinance, the

Council shall cause a Notice of Assessment to be served on or left at the

premises of every occupier, demanding payment of the rate or rates leviable

within such time and in such proportions as the Council may deem reasonable.

Section 235(4) requires the said notice to specify that written objections to the

assessment will be received at the Municipal office within one month from the

date of service of the notice. Section 235(8) of the Ordinance specifies that

every assessment against which no objection is taken shall be final for that

year.

The procedure to be followed when written objections have been lodged in

terms of the Ordinance has been specified in Section 235 (5) - (7). In terms of

Section 235(5) of the Ordinance, the Municipal Council shall cause to be kept a

book to be called the "Book of Objections", and cause every objection to an

assessment to be registered therein. The Council is thereafter required to give

notice in writing to each objector of the day on which and the place and the

time at which his objections will be investigated. Section 235(6) of the

Ordinance provides for the investigations into the objections to be carried out

in the presence of the assessee and for the investigation to be adjourned if

need be, where the assessee is absent. In terms of Section 235(7) of the

Ordinance, once an objection to an assessment is disposed of, the Council shall

cause the decision thereon to be notified to the objector, and such decision

shall be noted in the book of objections, and any necessary amendment shall

be made in the assessment book.

The Petitioners state that they received a Statutory Notice of Assessment

dated 31st January 2012, a copy of which has been annexed to the petition

marked iX9', in respect of the said premises, for the year 2012. By the said

notice, the 1st Respondent had informed that by virtue of the provisions of the

Municipal Council Ordinance, the annual value of the said property had been

assessed for 2012 at Rs. 2,666,400 and accordingly, the amount of rates

payable per quarter would be Rs. 233,310. The reverse of iX9' specified that if

the assessee is aggrieved by the said assessment, written objections to the said

assessment may be lodged with the 1st Respondent within a period of one

month from the date of service of the said notice specifying the grounds'upon

which the objections are made.

The Petitioners state that a letter dated 23rd February 2012 annexed to the

petition marked 'Xl0' containing the objections of the Petitioners was sent to

the 1st Respondent. The Petitioners first complaint to this Court is that the 1st

Respondent did not follow the aforementioned procedure laid down in the

Municipal Councils Ordinance and did not afford the Petitioners a hearing, to

which the Petitioners state they are entitled to.

In their Statement of Objections, the 1st - 3rd Respondents have admitted the

receipt of the letter 'Xl0'. The Respondents state that a notice was thereafter

sent under registered post to the Managing Director of the Petitioners,

requesting him to appear at an inquiry scheduled for 25th April 2012. Although

the Respondents have annexed a copy of the registered receipt article and the

list of recipients containing the name of the said Managing Director, marked

'R2' and 'R2A' respectively, this Court observes that the Respondents have not

produced a copy of the all important notice that was sent to the Petitioners by

'R2'.

The Respondents state that the Petitioners failed to attend the said inquiry

scheduled for 25th April 2012 and hence, the objections were rejected. This

Court observes that the Respondents have not provided any material to

substantiate its position that it carried out an investigation into the objections

raised by the Petitioners in 'Xl0' nor have they submitted any evidence to

show that the 1st Respondent complied with the rest of the provisions of

Section 235 (5) - (7) of the Ordinance, including the requirement to inform the

assessee of the decision on the objections and the recording of such decision

on the book of objections. Therefore, the Respondents have failed to satisfy

this Court that it in fact did comply with the said provisions of the Ordinance.

6

This Court is of the view that the detailed provisions set out in Section 235 (5)

- (7) of the Ordinance must be complied with by the 1st Respondent and that

the 1st Respondent was under a legal duty to consider the objections of the

Petitioners, prior to a final decision being taken in terms of Section 235(7) of

the Ordinance.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that this is a fit case in which a

Writ of Mandamus should be issued on the 1st Respondent directing that the

Petitioners be afforded a hearing in terms of Section 235(6) of the Ordinance

in respect of the objections6 raised in the letter dated 23rd February 2012

marked 'X10' with regard to the Notice of Assessment issued for the year 2012

marked 'X9', before taking steps in terms of Section 235(7) of the Ordinance.

The second matter raised by the Petitioners in this application relate to the

steps taken by the 1st Respondent to recover the arrears of rates due from the

Petitioners as at 31st December 2011, in respect of the said premises.

Soon after the Petitioners responded to the Notice of Assessment for 2012

marked 'X9' by letter dated 23rd February 2012 marked 'X10', the 1st

Respondent had sent the Petitioners a demand notice dated 28th February

2012, annexed to the petition marked 'Xli', which reads as follows:

"Notice is hereby given that if the arrears of rates and warrant costs due

on the undermentioned property is not paid within 14 days from the date

6 The complaint of the Petitioners that other premises situated in close proximity to the property in question had been assessed differently in 2012 can also be considered with the objections raised by the Petitioners in 'X10'.

7

hereof, the movable property of the owner or occupier found in or upon

the premises is liable to be seized in terms of Section 252 of the Municipal

Council Ordinance"

The Petitioners are seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash 'Xll' on the basis that

it is illegal and arbitrary. At the outset, this Court observes that the said notice

'Xll' does not seek to recover any rates payable for the year 2012 and has no

nexus with the Notice of Assessment for 2012 marked 'X9'.

This Court has examined 'Xll' and observes that what is sought to be

recovered in terms of the said notice is a sum of Rs. 9,079,560 which is the

arrears of rates due on the said premises, as at 31st December 2011. The

Petitioners have submitted with the petition marked 'X8', the 'Statement of

Account' with regard to the rates payable for the said premises for the period

1993 - 2012. This Court has examined 'X8' and observes that even though

payments have been made from time to time from 1995, although not on the

scheduled date, the Petitioners have not paid majority of the rates due for the

years 2000 - 2011. The Petitioners have been in default of their obligation to

pay rates for a long period of time and have been consistently in arrears of

rates since 1995. For instance, there was a sum of Rs. 299,703 in arrears as at

the end of 1995, a sum of Rs. 607560 in arrears as at the end of 2000, a sum of

Rs. 3,191,328 in arrears as at the end of 2005 and a sum of Rs. 8,061,480 as at

the end of 2010. There has been a gradual build up of the arrears over the

years, culminating in the 1st Respondent demanding that a sum of Rs.

9,079,560, which is the arrears of rates due on the said premises as at 31st

December 2011, be paid.

The Petitioners have annexed to the petition, marked 'X20', a table comparing

the amounts claimed by the 1st Respondent as the rates and arrears of rates

due and the amount that the Petitioners admit is due. According to 'X20', the

sum due to the 1st Respondent as at 31st December 2011 is Rs. 9,079,560

whereas according to the Petitioners' own calculations, the sum due is Rs.

9,206,260, which is Rs. 126,700 higher than what the 1st Respondent is

claiming is due as arrears in rates. Thus, this Court is of the view that the

Petitioners are estopped from claiming that the sum claimed by the 1st

Respondent is arbitrary.

As observed above, in terms of Section 235 (4) of the Ordinance, any objection

to a Notice of Assessment must be raised within one month and would

become final in the absence of any objection. The Petitioners have not

submitted any documents to prove nor have they claimed in their petition that

they objected to the Notices of Assessment issued by the 1st Respondent since

1995, as and when the notices of assessment for each year was issued. Thus,

the Petitioners have forfeited their right to challenge the quantum of rates

assessed during the period 1995 - 2011 and the 1st Respondent is entitled to

take steps to recover the rates and arrears in rates. This Court is therefore of

the view that the Petitioners are estopped from claiming in 2012, that the

quantum of rates imposed from 1995 to 2011 is arbitrary or illegal or without

any basis. It is thus clear that a Writ of Certiorari will not issue to quash 'Xll'

The 1st Respondent had thereafter published in the Daily News newspaper of

19th May 2012, a notice of the properties identified to be acquired for the non-

payment of rates. This notice, which has been annexed to the petition marked

'Xl2' contains the premises in question. This Court has examined 'Xl2' and

9

i I I I

t I I I 1

observes that the proposed acquisition of the properties referred to therein is

for the purpose of recovering the rates in arrears as at 31st December 2011. By

'X12', the owners of the properties referred to therein have been given a

further opportunity of settling their dues as well as an opportunity of

submitting proof of payments which have not been taken into consideration by

the 1st Respondent. Once again, this Court must observe that 'X12' does not

have any nexus to the Notice of Assessment for 2012, marked 'X9'.

By a letter dated 21st June 2012 annexed to the petition marked 'X13', the

Petitioners have explained the difficulties they were going through and

requested that they be permitted to 'arrive at a workable solution'. By a

further letter of the same date annexed to the petition marked 'X14', which is

a response to 'X12', the Petitioners have set out the payments that they have

made in respect of six properties. This Court however observes that none of

the payments said to have been made by the Petitioners and referred to in

'X13' and 'X14' relate to the premises in question, namely No. 545/1,

Sangarajah Mawatha, Colombo 10. Thus, it is clear to this Court that the

Petitioners have not taken any steps to pay the arrears in rates even though

they have requested that they be permitted to 'arrive at a workable solution'.

The 1st Respondent had thereafter issued a final reminder dated 16th

November 2012, annexed to the petition marked 'XiS', which reads as follows:

"CdtD ~O@ c:oQ)~~ 2011.12.31 ~eDC) 00 ~ Q)~ ~@ 9,079,560.00

&DO (fl;6) 00 1m>Cl;~ ~~."

This Court observes that what was sought to be recovered in terms of the final

reminder 'X1S' was the arrears of rates as at 31st December 2011, which this

Court has already held the 1st Respondent was empowered to do.

Furthermore, it is clear that 'X1S' too, has no nexus to the Notice of

Assessment 'X9'. This Court is of the view that it was within the power of the

1st Respondent to issue the said final reminder 'X1S' and therefore, a Writ of

Certiorari will not issue to quash 'X1S'.

This Court observes that after sending the final reminder, to which too there

was no response by way of payment of the amount in arrears, the 1st

Respondent issued the Seizure Notice dated 21st June 2013 annexed to the

petition marked 'X21'. The Petitioners have complained that the said seizure

notice is illegal and arbitrary and contrary to the representations made by the

Petitioner by 'Xl0'. This Court has examined 'X21' and observes that it has

been issued with regard to the recovery of the arrears of rates due as at 31st

December 2011, which means that 'X21' too does not have any nexus to the

Notice of Assessment 'X9' and to the representations made by the Petitioners

by'Xl0'.

Section 252(1) of the Ordinance contains provisions relating to the recovery of

rates in arrears and the power to seize and auction properties in order to

11

recover rates in arrears. The relevant parts of Section 252(1) are re-produced

below:

"(1) If the amount of any rate assessed under this Ordinance or the

amount of any tax imposed thereunder is not paid into the Municipal

office within such time as the Council may direct, it shall be the duty of

the Commissioner to issue a warrant signed by him to some collector or

other officer of the Council named therein directing him-

(a) in the case of non-payment of any rate, to levy such rate and the

costs of recovery by seizure and sale of all and singular the movable

or immovable property of the proprietor or of any joint proprietor,

of the premises on account of which such rate may be due, and of

all movable property, to whomsoever the same may belong, which

may be found in or upon any such premises;"

As set out earlier, as at 31st December 2011, the Petitioners were admittedly in

arrears of rates in a sum of Rs. 9,079,560 in respect of the said premises No.

545/1, Sri Sangharaja Mawatha, Colombo 10. The Petitioners have not

complied with the demand notice 'Xll' and the final reminder 'X15' issued by

the 1st Respondent. Hence, this Court is of the view that the 1st Respondent is

entitled in terms of Section 252(1) of the Ordinance to issue the Seizure Notice

'X2l' and proceed to seize the property in respect of which the rates are due.

The 1st Respondent would also be entitled, in the event of the Petitioners not

paying the arrears in rates, to sell by public auction the said property and

recover the rates, as provided by Section 252(1) of the Ordinance. This Court

does not see anything illegal or irrational or arbitrary in the 1st Respondent

12

!

exercising the powers conferred on it by law. In these circumstances, this Court

does not see any legal basis to issue Writs of Certiorari to quash 'Xli', 'XiS'

and 'X21', a Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st Respondent from taking

steps to recover the rates due as at 31st December 2011 and the Writ of

Mandamus prayed for, in paragraph (f) of the prayer to the petition.

This Court observes that the Writ of Mandamus prayed for in paragraph (e) of

the prayer to the petition seeks a direction on the Respondents to inquire into

the matters raised by the letter marked 'XiS', which covers the Notice of

Assessment marked 'X9' issued for 2012 and the arrears of rent due as at 31st

December 2011, set out in 'Xli'. This Court has already concluded that the

imposition and recovery of rates by the 1st Respondent for the period upto 31st

December 2011 is in accordance with the law and therefore the necessity to

issue a Writ of Mandamus to inquire into the assessment in respect of the said

period, as prayed for in paragraph (e) does not arise. However, as this Court is

of the view that the Petitioner should be given a hearing in respect of the

Objections raised in 'X10' with regard to the Notice of Assessment 'X9', this

Court issues a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to afford the

Petitioners a hearing in terms of Section 235(6) of the Ordinance in respect of

the objections raised in the letter dated 23rd February 2012 marked 'X10' with

regard to the Notice of Assessment issued for the year 2012 marked 'X9',

before taking steps in terms of Section 235(7) of the Ordinance.

There is one other matter that this Court would like to advert to. The

Petitioners have moved that the affidavit tendered on behalf of the 1st._ 3rd

Respondents be rejected on the basis that the affidavit is dated one day prior

to the Statement of Objections. This identical objection, although in relation to

13

a petition filed under Section 757(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, was

considered and overruled by this Court in Distilleries Company Limited vs

Kariyawasam and others7 This Court has examined the said judgment and is in

agreement with the reasoning adopted in that case. Accordingly, this Court is

of the view that the said objection is without merit. The Petitioners have also

stated that a proxy cannot be filed by several Attorneys-at-Law and that the 1st

- 3rd Respondents cannot appoint several Attorneys-at-Law. This objection has

been considered and overruled in Appuhamy and another vs Kandiah8. This

Court has examined the said judgment and is in agreement, for the same

reasons set out therein, that the said objection does not have any merit. In any

event, this Court observes that the material presented by the Petitioners' was

sufficient for this Court to come to the conclusion that the Writs of Certiorari,

Prohibition and Mandamus, as prayed for, would not issue in the

circumstances of this case. This Court has however relied upon material from

the Statement of Objections in considering whether to grant a Writ of

Mandamus in respect of 'Xl0'.

Subject to the above, this application is dismissed, without costs.
