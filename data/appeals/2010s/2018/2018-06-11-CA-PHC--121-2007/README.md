This is an appeal made by the Petitioners-Appellants (Appellants) against the judgement of the

learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura dated 21.06.2007.

The Appellants were at all material times to this application Directors of the 1st Respondent-

Respondent (pt Respondent). One M. Dayananda (Employee) who was an employee of the pt

Respondent was charged for misconduct and his services were terminated by the 1st Respondent

after an inquiry at which he was found guilty. The Employee appealed to the Co-operative

Employees Commission (Commission) against his termination. The Commission by order dated

20.03.2001 (Direction) directed the pt Respondent to reinstate him with effect from the date of

his interdiction (01.04.1981) without back wages or any salary increments.

The pt Respondent instead of complying with the Direction appealed to the Commission to vary

it purportedly in terms of section 11 of the Co-operative Employees Commission Act No. 12 of

1972 (Act). This was rejected by the Commission by letter dated 20.05.1981. The pt Respondent

was informed by the Commission that legal action will be taken against it if the Direction is not

implemented.

3

Since the pt Respondent failed to implement the Direction, the Commission instituted action

against the 1st Respondent in the Magistrate Court of Pelmadulla in case no. 31125 in terms of

section 35 of the Act to obtain an order for enforcement of the Direction. The learned Magistrate

by her order dated 03.09.1984 ordered the implementation of the Direction and imposed a fine

of Rs. 1000/= and directed the 1st Respondent to pay back wages to the Employee from the date

of the Direction.

The pt Respondent appealed against the said order to the Court of Appeal in case no. CA 241/84

which was dismissed as the court was of the view that there is no reason to interfere with the

conviction and sentence. Thereafter, the pt Respondent reinstated the Employee and paid him

Rs. 157,573/= as back wages from the date of the order by the Commission in view of the order

of the learned Magistrate.

The Employee after receiving the back wages made an appeal to the Provincial Co-operative

Employees Commission for the Sabaragamuwa Province claiming back wages for the period he

was under interdiction. According to the Appellants, at the inquiry into this appeal the then

Chairman of the pt Respondent had agreed to pay the said back wages whereas the pt

Respondent contends that the said back wages were paid according to the order made by the

Provincial Co-operative Employees Commission. By this time the Appellants had ceased to be

Directors of the 1st Respondent.

Thereafter, the Commissioner of Co-operative Development of the Sabaragamuwa Province

directed the Chairman of the 1st Respondent to act against the Directors who were responsible

for not reinstating the Employee without back wages according to the Direction of the

Commission and for deciding to contest the M.e. Pelmadulla case and appealing against the said

decision.

The Appellants were asked by the pt Respondent to pay the said sum which was declined. This

dispute was referred by the Commission to arbitration and the 2nd Respondent-Respondent (2nd

Respondent) was appointed as arbitrator. After inquiry he made his award in terms of which the

Appellants were required to pay a sum of Rs. 272,602.50 with 19% interest.

The Appellants appealed to the 3rd Respondent to set aside the award which appeal was rejected.

4

The Appellants thereafter filed the above application in the Provincial High Court of the

Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Ratnapura and sought, inter alia, the following relief:

(a) writ of certiorari quashing the order dated 2002.08.15 of the 3rd Respondent;

(b) writ of certiorari quashing the award dated 2000.12.01 made by the 2nd Respondent;

(c) writ of prohibition that the Appellants are not bound in terms of rule 62 of the by-laws of

the pt Respondent or the Sabaragamuwa Province Co-operative Societies Statute

The learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura dismissed the application and hence this appeal.

One ground on which the application of the Appellants was rejected by the learned High Court

Judge is that they had not taken steps to challenge the Direction in the Court of Appeal but

instead had appealed to the Commission to vary its order which was refused. In any event, it is

clear that the Appellants did not thereafter resort to any legal process to impugn the Direction

until proceedings were instituted in Magistrate Court of Pelmadulla in case no. 31125 to enforce

the Direction.

Where a statutory functionary gives directions to a subordinate body, the subordinate body must

consider whether the said directive is intra vires the powers of the statutory functionary. Where

it is ultra vires the powers of the statutory functionary, the subordinate body must take steps

according to law to impugn the said directive as an act cannot be denuded of legal validity unless

and until its invalidity is first established in courts. If an act is not the subject of an authoritative

court ruling as to its validity, then the act is presumed to be valid and will be treated as binding

and capable of producing legal effects.l The principle was eloquently stated by Lord Radcliffe in

Smith v. East Elloe RDC2as follows:

"".bears no brand of invalidity upon its forehead. Unless the necessary proceedings are

taken at law to establish the cause of invalidity and get it quashed or otherwise upset, it

will remain as effective for its ostensible purpose as the most impeccable of orders"

The arbitration proceedings against the Appellants were held in terms of section 62 of the by-

laws of the pt Respondent which makes the directors of the pt Respondent liable to any losses

suffered by the pt Respondent by their failure to discharge their duties intelligently. The

Appellants failed to act intelligently in not impugning the validity of the Direction before a

competent court instead of which they sought to unsuccessfully assail the enforcement

proceedings before the Magistrates Court. It is pertinent to note that the Direction was only to

reinstate the Employee with effect from the date of his interdiction (01.04.1981) without back

wages or any salary increments. The refusal of the Appellants to implement the Direction

culminated in the Employee obtaining back wages as well.

The Appellants submit that they were not charged for their liability in the Magistrates Court and

that if the Appellants are liable for non-compliance of the Order the learned Magistrate could

have made them liable in terms of section 35(3) of the Act which reads as follows:

"Where any offence under this Act is committed by a co-operative society, every officer

of that society shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence, unless he proves that the

offence was committed without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to

prevent the commission of the offence."

Accordingly, the Appellants submit that if according to the by-laws ofthe pt Respondent the loss

to the pt Respondent could be recovered from the Directors it would amount to an exoneration

of the pt Responsibility from liability which would make section 35 of the Act redundant.

This submission is tenuous and without any basis in law. The purposes of the two provisions are

different.

Section 35(3) of the Act is a deeming provision by which the Directors are deemed to be guilty of

an offence unless it is established that the offence was committed without their knowledge or

they exercised all due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence.

6

The meaning of the word "deemed" was considered and explained by Ranasinghe, J. (as he then

was) in Jinawathie v. Emalin3 in the following words:

"In statutes, the expression deemed is commonly used for the purpose of creating a

statutory function so that a meaning of a term is extended to a subject-matter which it

properly does not designate ... Thus, where a person is deemed to be something it only

means that whereas he is not in reality that something, the Act of Parliament requires

him to be treated as if he were".

Ranasinghe, J. went onto explain the legal effect and consequences of such a legal fiction in the

following terms:

"Thus, where in pursuance of a statutory direction a thing has to be treated as something

which in reality it is not or an imaginary state of affairs is to be treated as real, then not

only will it have to be treated so during the entire course of the proceedings in which such

assumption is made but all attendant consequences and incidents, which if the imagined

state of affairs had existed would inevitably have flowed from it have also to be imagined

or treated as real".4

The deeming provision is there in section 35(3) of the Act as the 1st Respondent is a legal entity

whereas the directors are natural persons who can be visited with penal sanctions in the form of

imprisonment.

The purpose of section 35 of the Act is to impose penal sanctions where an offence is committed

whereas rule 62 of the by-laws of the pt Respondent enables the pt Respondentto recover losses

it suffers from the Directors where the loss was due to the failure on the part of the Directors to

act intelligently or in accordance with law of its by-laws. The fact that the learned Magistrate did

not charge the Appellants under section 35(3) of the Act does not preclude action against them

in terms of by-law 62 of the 1st Respondent.

The Appellants further submit that the 2nd Respondent failed to conduct an impartial inquiry. It

is submitted that he totally disregarded the lengthy evidence placed on behalf of the Appellants.

The record does not support any such conclusion.

For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge was correct in

dismissing the application of the Appellants.

Accordingly, I see no reason to interfere with the judgement of the learned High Court Judge of

Ratnapura dated 21.06.2007.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
