, .-.

The 2nd Defendant~Appellant in this case (hereinafter referred to as "the 2nd Defendant")

who was a guarantor along with the yd Defendant seeks his exemption from his liability

on the basis that there was no demand made of him.py the Plaintiff~ Respondent (the

2

~ r;.

Finance Company). The: + st Defendant was a hirer ona hire~purchase agreement which

was entered into with the Finance Company on 28.06.~~85 and upon his failure to pay the

installments due on the contract of hire~purchase, the Plaintiff~Respondent had

terminated the hire~purchase agreementon-o-7:-1e:19-86~----------------

It has to be noted that by a memorandum of agreement which was marked as P2, the 2nd

and 3rd Defendants had ~aranteed to the Plaintiff~ Respondent the punctual payment by

the hirer (the pt Defen~ant{ all monthly hire renta,ls and accordingly the Plaintiff~

Respondent instituted action against all three Defencia,nts and when the matter came up

' .. , for trial, 4 admissions were recorded on behalf of the 2n~ Defendant, one of which was that

the 2nd Defendant had subscribed his signature to the memorandum of agreement.

~ __ I!:?llghall three Defenda~ts _vvere sue<:!joingy, ~~~_!~~()~~reveal~that summons could

not be served on the }St Defendant, and a trial inter parties proceeded only against the 2nd . ,,:

Defendant~ Appellant, whilst an ex parte decree was entered against the yd Defen,dant.

The only issues that were framed on behalf of the 2nd lfefendant~Appeliant were two in

number and the two issues engaged the questions whether the 2nd Defendant was a

''"' guarantor in relation to the 1st Defendant (the hirer) and whether in terms of Sec~ion 31 of

the Consumer Credit Act, No. 29 of 1982, the 3rd Defendant was a guarantor. These two

questions, as would be expected, have been answerediD. the affirmative and the-learned

, , District Judge, delivered judgment on 15.08.2000 findiJJ.g the 2nd Defendant liable on the

guarantee.

The judgment was assailed on several grounds.

No Demand

It was contended that there was no demand made o the 2nd Defendant. No do~bt it is

axiomatic that a deman~' is a condition before a guarantor is sued on a guarantee. A

guarantee may expressly provide that a creditor is un~er a duty to notify a gu~antor of

any default by a principa~ debtor. If notice of default is r,nade a condition precedent to the

liability of guarantor, the guarantor will not be liable 1,lnless he has been duly notified 6f I

3

the principal debtor's default~see Eshelby v. Federated European Bank Ltd, (1932) 1 K.B

423.

In Eshelby v. Federated European Bank Ltd, (supra)', a bank provided a guarantee to

cover the liability of a guarantor pertaining to certain ;payments for the renovation of a

building. It was a requirement of the bank guarantee that notice of default by the

guarantor was to be given to the bank. The English Qourt of Appeal decided, inter alia,

that the bank came under no~ability as no notice of default was given by the creditor to

the bank.

In addition, a guarantee lIlay also require a creditor to serve a notice of demand on the

guarantor before commencing legal proceedings against the guarantor. There is a body of

""opiillonTaKIng the viewrliatEeforea--crediror sentiHed toHbriiig an action against a

guarantor, the creditor has to make a demand on the guarantor. In Esso Petroleum Co.

Ltd, v. Alstonbridge Prpperties Ltd, [1975] 1 W.LR. 1474, Walton J. expressed the

view that when a debt was made payable on demand, the giving of a notice of demand

was not a prerequisite to the bringing of an action to enforce payment of the debt. but in

the case of a surety, a demand was generally necessary before an action might be brought.

His Lordship said at p. 1483: "I fully accept, of course, that where there is a pre~existing debt which is

payable 'on demand', such a demand (other than the service of proceedings) is not a pre~requisite to the .' I . .

" bringing of an action to recover that debt...[WJhere the character in which payment is required is that of

surety, a demand is, in general, necessary". Similar views w~re also expressed by Uoyd J. in

General Produce Co. v.. United Bank Ltd, [1979] 2Uoyd's Rep. 255, where Uoyd J.

commenting on a creditor'S duty to give notice of dem~pd to a guarantor before suing on

the guarantee said, at p. 259: "Normally where a debt is rep~yable on demand it is not necessary for

the creditor to make a demanq before bringing his action. It is o,therwise in the case of a guarantee. If a . . i guarantor is liable on demand he cannot be sued until after ademand has been made on him".

Our Courts too have emphasized the need for a demand that should be made ofsureties~

see L.BFinanceLtdv. Manchanayake(2000) 2 Sri.LR142 (CA); Mohinudeen v. Lanka

Bankuwa (2001)1 SrLLR390 (SC).

. , A quick look at the memorandum of agreement makes it clear that demand has been

prescribed in the contract. Clause 21 of the Memorandum of Agreement sets out as

follows:~

The Guarantors hereby~

(a) jointly and severally guarantee to the Owners the regular and punctual payment

by the Hirer of ill the monthly hiring rentals .~pecified in Schedule I hereof and

the performance and observance by the 'Hirer of the several terms and \ . conditions herein; . . (b) bind themselves jointly and severally to pay forthwith all monies which may

become payable to the Owners hereunder whether by way of monthly rentals

. ----darnagejint-I'e-s~,-GOsts,. charges-.g.r-Qtlu~rwise'-however;

( c) agree that the O'wners shall be entitled to sue the Hirer and Guarantors jointly

and~or severalTy or to sue the Guarantors or, either of them only in the first

instance before recourse is had to the Hirer; .'. (d) bind themselves jointly arid severally to pay forthwith on demand to the . '~. Owners the amount of any judgment or d~cree that the Owners may obtain , . against the Hirer under this Agreement;

(e) ,renounce the right to claim that the Hirer should be excused I the first instance . . and the benefit?f division and all other rights and privileges to which sureties

are by law entitled;

.-'It, (1) agree that each of the Guarantors is liable in an respects hereunder to the same

extent and in the same manner as the Hirer.

,-Clause 21 alludes to the liability of the guarantors arisipg only upon demand and though

this was not raised as an issue in the court a quo, Mr. Ashan Fernando argued that there

was no demand made of the 2nd Defendant~the Guarantor. Upon a perusal of the. record, I

, . . . take a different view.

A notice of termination of the hire~purchase agree~ent dated 22.09.1986 in '~erms of

?ection 18(1) of the Consumer Credit Act, No. 29 of 1987 has been given to the hirer, along

with copies dispatched to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants~the Guarantors ~see P8.

.

Thereafter a demand dat~d 16.03.1988 has in fact been ~ade of the guarantors which goes

Attorney~at~Law

. '~.

""Thisexplains the reason as to why no issue wasraised bn the requirement of demand. In the circumstances, this ground of appeal based on want of a demand must necessarily fail.

J oint and Several Liability

Another argument that ~as tangentially taken was tha~ the sureties could not have been

sued in the absence of thelstDefendant (hirer). This argllment goes contrary to Clause 21,

'"' : which imposes joint and' or several liability on the guarantors. In a joint and several

. . guarantee, the liability _ of the guarantors are both jO~ht and several. In Re J.H. Davison

(1884)13 Q.E.D. 50, Cave]. considered the issue of whether a Plaintiff who had obtained

a joint judgment even though he would have been entitled to obtain a joint and several

judgment against the debtors was precluded from pursuing his claim against the other

6

"

'. debtors on their severalli~bility, Holding that the jointj~dgment did not constitUte a bar

! to the further action, CaveJ. said at p.54: "No authorities to the contrary canbefound, and it seems

clear both on principle and authorities that a joint judgment is not a bar to a separate cause of action".

I . -~.--, Therefore this ground too has to be decided against the 2nd Defendant.

Another argument that was advanced was that there has been long delay between the

, . . conclusion of the trial and the date of the judgment. The Counsel for the 2nd Defendant~

Respondent relied on Kujatlif!ga v. Samarasmghe (1990) 1 Sri L.R. 244 where there was

a delay of two years and'four months after the tender of written submissions before the

judgment was delivered~ This was a case which depended on the oral testimonies of

witnesses. The Court cOlnmented that the advantage .of the impressions created by the

WItnesses wouln have fa4edaway from the mmCloflfle1Jlsfflcl:Tlidge WIfn~fnepassage of

time. In fact, the observarions of Basnayake C.J in Mohato v. Sarana 67 Cl W 2 was

~dverted to by H.W. Senanayake J. (with A.S.Wijet\ipga J. concurring). The ~ase was

.' ".j. sent back for a retrial de novo. A similar application W~$ made by Mr. Ashan Fe:rnando ~

the Counsel for the 2nd Defendant.

, ' But'several distinguishing features in this case mark the instant case out from cases such

.as Kulatunga v. Samaf.asmghe and Mohato v. Sarana (supra). No doubt the trial

concluded in this case ;on 30.06.1997 and the writ~en submissions of the Plaintiff~

-Respondent was finally fUed on 16.10.1997. By this time the trial Judge had become a High

'. ... :. Court Judge and it took considerable time before he was gazetted by the Judicial Service

I ~ . Commission tO,deliver th~ judgment~see the Journal ditries from 30.06.1997 onwards. It

, , was not until15.08.2000;when the judgment was finill.y pronounced. This is fl10t a case

where the demeanor and,,4eportmentof witnesses wo~ld have an impact on the outcome

of the case. Only one wi~ness from the Finance Comg,any testified in this case~.with no

real challenge being thro~ to his testimony and even:the want of a demand was never

.; .; , put to him, presumably h~cause there was in fact a deIlland in esse.

'. ' : .

In my view, this case depended wholly or substantiaUy on documentary evidence and ':' \ those documents speak ft?r themselves, as eloquently b,efore this Court, as they did in the

.' 7

f . I . I

, , , ;

trial Court. If this Court ~~n assess the merits and demerits of a case which depend wholly

or substa~tiallyon docu~ents, atrial de: novo would n~edlessly prolong the labyrinth of

litigation and this Couttwould desist from taking that, course.,

-. .",.. . . . Accordingly-o~;'f~ieg~hIg:~on~p~~-tt;s of the view I have taken' of the c-~~'e, {affirm the

. . '," l judgment and dismiss the appeal but with no costs.
