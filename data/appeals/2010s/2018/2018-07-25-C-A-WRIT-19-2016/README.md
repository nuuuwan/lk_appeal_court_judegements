Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner employer filed this application on 18.01.2016

seeking a prerogative in the nature of a writ of certiorari to quash

the decision of the 1st respondent-Commissioner General of

Labour contained in the document marked P8(a) dated 23.09.2013

whereby the petitioner was directed to deposit a sum of Rs.

495,114/60 as Employees Provident Fund payments in respect of

commissions paid to the 3rd respondent-former employee.

This decision has been arrived at by the 1st respondent after a

protracted inquiry which extended not several months but several

years, during which inter alia a heap of correspondence has also

been exchanged between the parties. (I must pause for a while to

say that although photocopies of these letters have been tendered

by the petitioner no separate markings have been given for easy

reference.)

3

P8(a) dated 23.09.2013, as seen from the 1st sentence, is a reply to

the letter sent by the petitioner to the 1st respondent dated

03.09.2013. By reading the said letter dated 03.09.2013 and P8(a)

dated 23.09.2013, it is crystal clear that the predominant position

taken up by the petitioner at the inquiry before the 1st respondent

was that the extra amounts paid to the 3rd respondent in addition

to the salary were not sale commissions but incentives and

therefore the 3rd respondent employee is not entitled to EPF

benefits in respect of those extra payments. This position has not

been accepted by the 1st respondent.

It is significant to note that notwithstanding the petitioner has filed

this application seeking to quash only P8(a), the petitioner does not

pursue that argument anymore.

It is also relevant to note that the petitioner has filed this

application more than 2 years and 3 months after P8(a) decision.

The sole ground upon which the petitioner challenges P8(a) before

this Court is that the 1st respondent arrived at the figure, which is

a sum of Rs. 495,114/60 as EPF, without sufficient proof being

adduced by the 3rd respondent. Such a position has not been

taken by the petitioner in the letter dated 03.09.2013 which

preceded P8(a) or any other letter sent before that letter.

What I have stated so far is sufficient to deny the relief as prayed

for by the petitioner. Nevertheless, I will, in brief, consider the

subsequent events as well.

After the decision P8(a), it is not clear on what basis he did, the

petitioner has by P9(a) dated 21.10.2013 again wrote to the 1st

respondent to repeat the same thing, i.e. what was paid in addition

to the salary was not sale commissions but incentives, and

4

thereafter stated for the first time that the documents tendered by

the 3rd respondent to support his claim and which were relied

upon by the 1st respondent to arrive at the figure are unreliable.

Thereafter an inquiry has again been held and as seen from P9(b)

dated 23.12.2013 the 1st respondent has inter alia asked the

petitioner to submit the documents to counter or contradict the

documents tendered by the 3rd respondent in support of his (the

3rd respondent's) claim. No such documents have been tendered

by the petitioner at the inquiry and the 1st respondent by letter

P11(a) dated 11.08.2015 has informed the petitioner that the

petitioner has no choice but to comply with P8(a).

Thereafter the petitioner has kept silent until the petitioner got

summons from the Magistrate's Court to appear before it on

22.01.2016 to recover the EPF dues.

It is in that backdrop, the petitioner has filed this application on

18.01.2016 (just 4 days before the Magistrate's Court case) to

quash P8(a) and obtained a stay order staying the proceedings

before the Magistrate's Court which is in operation until today.

It is relevant to note that the petitioner does not produce any

document to counter the documents of the 3rd respondent even

before this Court.

The position of the petitioner before this Court is that the burden

is fairly and squarely on the 3rd respondent to prove his claim at

the inquiry before the 1st respondent, which has not been

discharged.

5

There are no strict burden of proof principles applicable at

inquiries of this nature before the Labour Commissioner or for that

matter even at inquiries before Labour Tribunals.

However Justice Mark Fernando in Anderson v. Husny1 had this to

say regarding burden of proof before Labour Tribunals:

While it is true that the Tribunal is not bound by the Evidence

Ordinance, that enactment contains certain basic principles of

justice and fairness relevant to adjudication by any tribunal.

One common sense principle is found in section 102: that the

burden of proof lies on that person who would fail if no

evidence at all were given on either side. There was no good

reason for departing from that principle.

In the instant case the 3rd respondent employee at the inquiry

tendered documents to the Labour Commissioner for the purpose

of calculating EPF payments entitled to him from the petitioner

employer. The Labour Commissioner having prima facie satisfied

with that evidence held with the 3rd respondent. Then the

petitioner complained to the Labour Commissioner stating that the

documents tendered by the 3rd respondent employee were

unreliable. Then the Labour Commissioner again gave an

opportunity to the petitioner employer to tender documents to

counter that position but no documents were tendered by the

employer. May be the employee who is the weaker party did not

produce the best evidence to establish his claim. But the employer

who is the stronger party and who has all the resources at his

disposal did not produce any document to counter that position.

In this type of inquiries the employer cannot keep silent stating

that he who asserts must prove.

The Commissioner of Labour with the material tendered and

matters elicited at the inquiry has come to the relevant figure.

There is no reason for this Court to disturb that finding nor has

the power to embark upon another inquiry to verify the correctness

of the figure by exercising writ jurisdiction.

Application for certiorari to quash P8(a) is dismissed with costs.
