Samayawardhena, J.

The 2nd defendant-appellant-petitioner (petitioner) filed this

application before this Court on 18.05.2018 for revision and

restitutio in integrum seeking to set aside the Judgment of the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal of Kalutara, pronounced

more than two years ago from that date, to be specific on

10.08.2016.

According to Article 154P of the Constitution introduced by the

13th Amendment, there shall be a High Court for each Province.

The High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No.19

of 1990, made provisions regarding the procedure to be followed

in, and the right to appeal to and from, such High Court, and for

matters connected therewith. By this Act, the High Courts of

the Provinces were given original criminal jurisdiction as well as

appellate jurisdiction basically against the Judgments and

Orders of the Magistrates Courts, Primary Courts and Labour

Tribunals of the relevant Provinces.

By the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

(Amendment) Act, No. 54 of 2006, sections 5A, 5B and 5C were

introduced to the aforesaid Principal Act, No. 19 of 1990. This

3

was done to confer appellate and revisionary jurisdiction to the

said Provincial High Courts against Judgments and Orders of

the District Courts of the relevant Provinces. Those Provincial

High Courts exercising civil appellate jurisdiction are

conveniently known as Provincial High Courts of Civil Appeal.

After the said amendment by Act No. 54 of 2006, section 5A of

the Principal Act, No.19 of 1990 (without the proviso) reads as

follows:

5A(1) A High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution for a Province, shall have and exercise

appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

judgments, decrees and orders delivered and made by any

District Court or a Family Court within such Province and

the appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in

fact or in law, which shall be committed by any such

District Court or Family Court, as the case may be.

(2) The provisions of sections 23 to 27 of the Judicature Act,

No. 2 of 1978 and sections 753 to 760 and sections 765 to

777 of the Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101) and of any

written law applicable to the exercise of the jurisdiction

referred to in subsection (1) by the Court of Appeal, shall be

read and construed as including a reference to a High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution for a

Province and any person aggrieved by any judgment,

decree or order of a District Court or a Family Court, as the

case may be, within a Province, may invoke the jurisdiction

referred to in that subsection, in the High Court established

for that Province:

4

According to section 5A(2) quoted above, it is clear that, the

procedure to be adopted in the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeal is the same procedure which is being adopted in the

Court of Appeal.

Section 5C deals with the subject of appeals from the

Judgments and Orders of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeal. According to this section, there is only one direct appeal

to the Supreme Court, with leave obtained, against the

Judgments and Orders of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeal. That section reads as follows:

5C (1) An appeal shall lie directly to the Supreme Court from

any judgment, decree or order pronounced or entered by a

High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution

in the exercise of its jurisdiction granted by section 5A of

this Act, with leave of the Supreme Court first had and

obtained. The leave requested for shall be granted by the

Supreme Court, where in its opinion the matter involves a

substantial question of law or is a matter fit for review by

such Court.

(2) The Supreme Court may exercise all or any of the

powers granted to it by paragraph (2) of Article 127 of the

Constitution, in regard to any appeal made to the Supreme

Court under subsection (1) of this section.

The argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that, a

party can come before this Court against the Judgment or Order

of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal by way of revision

and/or restitutio in integrum in terms of Article 138 of the

Constitution.

5

If that argument is accepted, section 5C referred to above

becomes meaningless, and the intention of the legislature will

blatantly be defeated, as any party dissatisfied with any

Judgment or Order of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal

can come before this Court by way of revision and/or restitutio in

integrum. Then the party dissatisfied with the Judgment or

Order of the District Court will have three appealsfirst to the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal, second to the Court of

Appeal, and third to the Supreme Court. That was obviously

never the intention of the legislature. One of the main objectives

of setting up Provincial High Courts of Civil Appeal is to curb

laws delays in civil litigation and not to multiply it.

Article 138(1) of the Constitution (without the proviso) reads as

follows:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate

jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law

which shall be committed by the High Court, in the exercise

of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any court of

First Instance, tribunal or other institution and sole and

exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and

restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions,

prosecutions, matters and things of which such High Court,

Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution may

have taken cognizance:

I am mindful of the fact that this Article 138 confers the

jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal to correct all errors in fact or

in law which shall be committed by the High Court, in the exercise

of its appellate or original jurisdiction. But it is significant to

6

note that this Article does not confer unrestricted, unfettered,

absolute power for revision and restitutio in integrum on the

Court of Appeal against Judgments and Orders of the High

Courts. If I may repeat, it says: The Court of Appeal shall have

and exercise subject to the provisions of the Constitution or of any

law, an appellate jurisdiction..

Any law encompasses, inter alia, the Laws introduced by Act

Nos. 19 of 1990 and 54 of 2006.

The question whether the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to sit

on Judgments and Orders made by the Provincial High Courts of

Civil Appeal was particularly dealt with by Justice Salam (with

Justice Rajapaksha agreeing) in the Court of Appeal case of

Stephan Gunaratne v. Thushara Indika Sampath [CA (PHC) APN

54/2013 (REV)] decided on 23.09.2013.

That is a case where the plaintiff-petitioner in a partition action

came before this Court by way of revision against the Judgment

of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal at Ratnapura.

Dismissing the application in limine without issuing notice,

Justice Salam stated:

The question that now arises for consideration is whether

the Court of Appeal can exercise its revisionary powers

under Article 138 of the Constitution in respect of a

judgment of the High Court pronounced under the

Provisions of Act No 54 of 2006 when the proper remedy is

to appeal to the Supreme Court. Appreciably, Section 5A of

Act No 54 of 2006 quite specifically states that all relevant

written laws applicable to an appeal, in the Court of Appeal

are applicable to the High Court as well. This undoubtedly

7

demonstrates beyond any iota of doubt that the scheme

provided by Act No 54 of 2006 to facilitate an appeal being

heard by the Provincial High Court is nothing but a clear

transfer of jurisdiction and in effect could be said that as

far as appeals are concerned both the High Court and the

Court of Appeal rank equally and are placed on par with

each other. Arising from this statement of law, it must be

understood that if the Court of Appeal cannot act in revision

in respect of a judgment it pronounces in a civil appeal, then

it cannot sit in revision over a judgment entered by the High

Court in the exercise of its civil appellate jurisdiction as

well, for both courts are to be equally ranked when they

exercise civil appellate jurisdiction.

A similar conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court in

Balaganeshan v. OIC, Police Station, Seeduwa (SC SPL/LA No.

79/2015) decided on 01.04.2016 in interpreting similar

provisions found in the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990.

That is a criminal case where the accused unsuccessfully

appealed to the Provincial High Court against the Judgment of

the Magistrates Court. Being dissatisfied with the Judgment of

the Provincial High Court sitting in appeal, the accused appealed

to the Court of Appeal in terms of section 138 of the

Constitution. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal in limine

on the basis of want of jurisdiction. Rejecting leave to appeal

against that dismissal, Justice Dep (later Chief Justice) with

Justice Wanasundera and Justice Jayawardena agreeing held

that:

8

When the Provincial High Court exercises appellate

jurisdiction, it exercises appellate jurisdiction hitherto

exclusively vested in the Court of Appeal. It exercises a

parallel or concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Appeal.

The High Court when it exercises appellate jurisdiction it is

not subordinate to the Court of Appeal. That is the basis for

conferring jurisdiction on the Supreme Court under section 9

of the High Court of Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No.

19 of 1990 to hear appeals from the judgments of the High

Court when it exercises appellate jurisdiction. I hold that

the Accused AppellantPetitioner should have filed a

Special Leave to Appeal application against the judgment of

the High Court exercising Appellate Jurisdiction to the

Supreme Court in the first instance instead to the Court of

Appeal. The Court of Appeal correctly upheld the

preliminary objection and rejected the Appeal.

Hence I hold that the Court of Appeal has no appellate

jurisdiction to set aside Judgments or Orders of the Provincial

High Court of Civil Appeal by way of final appeal, revision or

restitutio in intergrum. That is vested exclusively in the Supreme

Court.

In Jinadasa v. Hemamali [2011] 1 Sri LR 337 the Supreme Court

held that the application for Special Leave to Appeal before the

Supreme Court shall be filed within 42 days from the date of the

Judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal. This has

admittedly not been done. Instead, the petitioner has filed a

revision application before the Supreme Court, which has later

been withdrawn (understandably for want of jurisdiction).

9

Hence the relief sought by the petitioner to set aside the

Judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal of

Kalutara dated 10.08.2016 cannot be granted. This application

is misconceived in law, and therefore liable to be dismissed in

limine, without issuing notice to the respondents.

Notice refused. Application dismissed.
