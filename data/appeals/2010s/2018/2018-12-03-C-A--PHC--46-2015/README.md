The Aggrieved party-Petitioner-Appellam has filed this appeal seeking to set aside

the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala dated 16.01.2015 in Case

No. HCR 165/2012 and seeking to set aside the confiscation order made by the

Learned Magistrate of Piles sa dated 16.11.2012 in Case No. 69349.

Facts of the case:

The accused-3 rd respondent-respondent (hereafter referred to as the 'accused') was

charged in the Magistrate's Court of Pile,:;sa for committing an offence punishable

under section 25(2) read with sections 40A and 24(1) of the Forest Ordinance as

amended. The accused had pleaded guilty to the charge and the Learned Magistrate

had convicted him accordingly. Thereafter a vehicle inquiry was held with regard

Page 3'. of 13

to the tractor bearing number 36 - 80] 3 and trailer bearing number 46 shri 7863

which had been used for the commissior, Jfthe offence.

The aggrieved party- petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'appellant')

who was the registered owner of the i:lbove tractor and the trailer had given

evidence in the said inquiry. After concluding the vehicle inquiry, the Learned

Magistrate of Pilessa had confiscated the said tractor and trailer by order dated

16.11.20]2.

Being aggrieved by the said confiscation order, the appellant had filed a revision

application in the High Court of Kurunegala under case No. HCR 165/2012 and

the Learned High Court Judge on 16.l' 1.20 15 had dismissed the said revision

application.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the appellant preferred an appeal to this

Court.

Upon perusal of the evidence led in the vehicle inquiry, we observe that the tractor

and the trailer were given to the accused for a monthly rent of Rs.20, 000/= and

accordingly the tractor and trailer were kept at the residence of the accused. The

Learned SSC for the 2nd respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the '2nd

respondent) contended that according to the said evidence, there had been no

consistent supervision of the vehicle.

In the case of The Finance Company PLC. V. Agampodi Mahapedige

Priyantha Chandana and S others [SC I\ppeallOSAl2008], it was held that,

"On a consideration of the ratiO decidendi of all the aforementioned

decisions, it is abundantly clear (lzat in terms of section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance, as amended, tf the nwnt~r of the vehicle in question was a third

Page 4 ::>f 13

party, no order of confiscation size ,/I be made {f that owner had proved to the

sati4clction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use

q( the said vehicle for the cOlnmis.lion of the qr(ence. The ratio decidendi of

all the aforementioned decisions also show that the owner has to establish

the said matter on a balance of probability. "

In the aforesaid case, Justice S. Bandaranayake has referred to the case of

Manawadu V. The Attorney General (1987) 2 SLR 30, in which it was held that,

"By Section 7 of Act No. 13 of 1982 it was not intended to deprive an owner

of his vehicle used by the offendtr in committing a forest offence' without

his (owner's) knowledge and without his participation. The word forfeited'

mllst be given the meaning 'liable to be forfeited' so as to avoid the injustice

that would flow on the constructio'1 that forfeiture of the vehicle is automatic

on the conviction of the accused. The amended sub-section 40 does not

exclude by necessary implication the rule of 'audi alteram partem' . The

owner of the lorry not a party to the case is entitled to be heard on the

question of forfeiture of the lony. if he satisfies the court that the accused

committed the offence without his knowledge or participation, his lorry will

not be liable to forfeiture.

The Magistrate must hear the OWf'er of the lorry on the question of showing

cause why the lorry is not liable to be forfeited. If the Magistrate is satisfied

with the cause shown, he must restore the lorry to the owner. The Magistrate

may consider the question of l'/;; leasing the lorry to the owner pending

inquiry, on his entering into a bond with sufficient security to abide by the

order that may ultimately be bindit1g on him"

Page 5 of 13

Accordingly the practice of the court is t) release the vehicle to the owner if the

owner proves on a balance of probability that he was taking precautions to prevent

an offence being committed or the offence was committed without his knowledge.

In the case of Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd. V. Range Forest

Officer of Ampara and another [SC Appeal No. 120/2011], it was held that,

"The Supreme Court has consistently followed the case of Manawadu vs the

Attorney General. Therefore it is settled law that before an order for

forfeiture is made the owner shoui(,.' be given an opportunity to show cause. If the owner on balance of probab.lity satisfies the court that he had taken

precautions to prevent the commLr .. sion of the offence or the offence was

committed without his knowledge n(Jr he was privy to the commission of the

offence then the vehicle has to be released to the owner. "

However the proviso to Section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance (as amended by

Act No.65 of 2009) reads as follows;

"Provided that in any case whe/e the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in tne commission of such offence, is a third

party, no Order of confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the

satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the

use of such tools, vehicles, impleme!:lts, cattle and machines, as the case may

be, for the commission of the offence. "

However the Supreme Court has not considered the Forest Ordinance

(Amendment) Act No 65 of 2009 in the case of Orient Financial Services

Corporation Ltd (supra) as the amendm~nt came into force after the order of

confiscation was made by the Learned Magistrate in the said case. Since we are

required to consider the said amendment Act No.65 of 2009, it can be construed

Page 6 Jf 13

that the Legislature intended to cast thE' burden on the claimant to prove that he

took all precautions to prevent an offence being committed.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant, has contended that a confiscation order

shall not be made if the owner proves on a balance of probability that he had no

knowledge about the commission of offence. Accordingly the Learned Counsel has

submitted the case of Faris V. The Officer in Charge, Police Station,

Galenbindunuwewa and another (1992) 1 S.L.R. 167, in which it was held that,

"In terms of the proviso to Section 3A of the Animals Act, an order for

confiscation cannot be made if the owner establishes one of two matters.

They are:

1. That he has taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence,'

11. That the vehicle has been used for the commission of the offence without

his knowledge.

In terms of the proviso, if the owner establishes anyone of these matters on

a balance of probability, an orderfor confiscation should not be made ... "

In the case of Nizar V. I.P, Wattegama (1978-79) 2 SLR 304, it was held that,

"In 1968 two new sub-sections were added to section 3 of the Act by Act

No. 20 of 1968. One of them is as! Jllows,'

"Where a person is convicted of an offence under this part or any

regulations made thee under, any vehicle used in the commission of

the offence shall, in addition to any other punishment prescribed for

such offence, be liable, by order of the convicting Magistrate to

confiscation:

Page 7 of 13

Provided however, that in allY case where the owner if the vehicle is a

third party, no order of c mfiscation shall be made, if the owner

proves to the satisfaction of the court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of vehicle or that the vehicle has been

used without his knowledge for the commission of the offence ...

So also in the case of Joslin v. S. Bandara (7), Thamotheram, J said "The

driver of the lorry pleaded guilty tu a charge under the Forest Ordinance

and the lorry was liable to for/eUl re provided that where the owner proved

to the satisfaction of the Court tll( It he had used all precautions to prevent

the use o/the motor vehicle/or the commission o/the offence, no such order

shall be made ............ It has not been suggested that the owner or her

husband were in any way privy fo the commission of the offence or had any

reason to anticipate the commission of the offence. In these circumstances I

am of the view that the owner had led sufficient evidence to show that all

precautions which could have beer taken, had been taken. "

In all these Ordinances and Regulations there was no proviso similar to the

proviso to section 3A of the Animals Act and the decisions in all the cases

turned on an interpretation of the sections in which the words used " be

liable to confiscation " is identical with the words of section 3A. It was held

in all these cases that no order 0/ confiscation should be made without

giving the owner an opportunity cf showing cause and that if he succeeded

in showing that he had taken alll'recautions against the use of the vehicle

for the commission 0/ the offence and that he was not in any way a privy to

the commission of the offence then the vehicle ought not to be confiscated. "

Page 6 of 13

However we observe that these two case~ had dealt with offences committed under

the Animals Act No. 29 of 1958. Acco:dingly we are unable to agree with the

contention of the Learned Counsel for the appellant since the proviso to section 3A

of the Animals Act (as amended) and the proviso to section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance (as amended) are manifestly different.

In the case of Samarathunga V. Range Forest Officer, Anuradhapura [CA

(PHC) 89/2013], K.T. Chithrasiri, J, he;d that,

"The law referred to in the saia' proviso to Section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance empowers a Magistrate to make an order releasing the vehicle

used to commit the offence, to its owner provided that the owner of the

vehicle proves to the satisfactioi1 of the Court that he had taken all

precautions to prevent committing an offence under the said Ordinance.

making use of that vehicle ... Nothing is forthcoming to show that he has

taken any precautionary measures to prevent an offence being committed by

using this vehicle though he was the person who had the power to exercise

control over the vehicle on behalf of the owner. Therefore, it is evident that

no meaningful step had been tak2n either by the owner or his power of

attorney holder, of the vehicle the. t was confiscated in order to prevent an

offence being committed by making use of this vehicle. "

Even though Court can consider the knowledge of the vehicle owner about an

offence being committed, we are of the view that Court should particularly look

into the preventive measures taken by the vehicle owner in question since it is

required by the Statute.

The Learned High Court Judge of Kurul1egala in the order dated 16.01.2015 has

held as follows;

Page ~ of 13

"~0'illzs1 e.n:5)0'zs1 g;5)L))<;2:5) ~b qeJcmsZ5))u(.5 8310'31 q<;)b 86<; 8~ ;63B

(Page 41 of the brief)

We find that the above reasoning of the Learned High Court Judge was well within

the law and indeed we agree with the same.

Further we observe that the appellant has t~stified in the vehicle inquiry that he had

instructed the accused not to use the vehicle for any illegal activities and the

appellant only found out about illegal t!ansportation of timber when he was

informed by the Police station of Mawathar;ama.

Accordingly he had answered in the cross-examination as follows;

In the case of Mary Matilda Silva V. P.H. De Silva rCA (PUC) 86/97J, it was

held that.

"For these reasons 1 hold that giviYig mere instructions is not sufficient to

discharge the said burden. She must establish that genuine instructions were

in fact given and that she took every endeavor to implement the

instructions ... "

Page 10 .Jf 13

In light of the above decision we are of the view that it is imperative to prove to the

satisfaction of Court that the vehicle' owner in question has not only given

instructions but also has taken every possible step to implement them. However we

observe that the appellant has failed to pr0 \le the same on a balance of probability.

Accordingly we agree with the following conclusion of the Learned Magistrate;

" e'3 Cf~ D DJm 25') c.:l zsf ~ 753 e3@61a i 2:5')J b c.:l c.:l zs-! 63 @c.:lJ~ DJ 0'25')J CD zs-! 25')J 0'C e5 2l

c.:l18 CfB2:5')6~c.:l2l e5t~2l oi5!u2l 0'25')Jml~D Cfl75) ... " (Page 86 of the brief)

In the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and others (2004) 1 Sri L R 284, it was

held that;

"In any event to exercise revisionaTY jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justi':e and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irrzgularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience of court. "

In the case of Dharmaratne and another V. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd.

(2003) 3 SLR 24,

"Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court

selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of

rectification should be adopted. 1f such a selection process is not there

revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of every litigant

Page ~ 1. of 13

to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision application or to make an

appeal in situations where the legislature has not given a right of appeal ... "

Therefore we are of the view that the Learned High Court Judge was correct in

dismissing the revision application due tOI the lack of exceptional circumstances.

Accordingly we see no reason to interf~re with the order of the Learned High

Court Judge of Kurunegala dated 16.01 .2015 and the confiscation order of the

Learned Magistrate of Pilessa dated 16.11.2012. Therefore we affirm the same.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
