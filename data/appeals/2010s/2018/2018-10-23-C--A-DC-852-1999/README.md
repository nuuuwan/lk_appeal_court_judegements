M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

This is an appeal stemming from the judgment of the Learned District Judge of

Kurunegala in respect of a Partition action bearing Case No. 5088/P. The Plaintiff

instituted this action to partition the lands called 'Kadurulande' and 'Serugahamulawatte'

which are depicted in Plan No. 717 dated 26th August 1974 prepared by Sarath

Welagedara, Licensed Surveyor marked as 'X', produced and filed of record.

The Plaintiff filed his plaint on 24th July 1973 and the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th and 7th Defendants

filed their amended statements on 18.08.1975, 04.12.1986 and 19.07.1989

respectively.

At the commencement of the trial, the admission was recorded as Kirihamy, Dingiri

Appuhamy, Mudalihamy and their children are Kandyans. The Pedigree of the Plaintiff

is not challenged by all Defendants and there was no dispute as to Kirihamy's share.

It is admitted by the contesting Defendants that said Mudalihamy by Deed of Transfer

No. 232 dated 22.11.1923 transferred his interests to Ukkurala- his son and Sandi

Menika his second wife. Sandi Menika's share devolved on Manikhamy whose children

are the 5th, 6th, and 7th Defendants; Ukkurala's illegitimate son is Kapuru Sanda- the

Plaintiff.

At the end of the trial, the Learned District Judge pronounced his judgment dated

20.08.1993 and decided in favour of the Plaintiff. Sy the judgment and Interlocutory

Decree entered in the action, the Learned District Judge directed that the corpus be

partitioned among the co-owners referred to in the said judgment an the Interlocutory

Decree was entered accordingly.

Thereafter, as required under the Partition Law, the final Decree was also entered

giving effect to the scheme of partition approved by the Court.

3

Nearly six years after entering of the Final Decree, an application was made by the 5th,

6th and 7th Defendants seeking the amendment of the judgment and the Interlocutory

Decree on the ground that, although Bandara Menika is referred to as the 2nd wife of

Ukkurala, who was the father of the Respondent. In answering the issue 13 in the

affirmative the learned District Judge has held that Bandi Menika who was the second

wife of Mudalihamy.

The Judgment and the Interlocutory Decree have been entered on 20th August 1993.

The application for amendment has been allowed on 14th July 1999. The order to

amend the judgment and the decree has been made by the successor in office of the

Learned District Judge who delivered the judgment after six years.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, this appeal was filed by the Plaintiff praying to

set aside the judgment of the Learned District Judge dated 14th July 1999.

This appeal was argued on 11.09.2012 but on that date, the Defendants were absent

and unrepresented. The judgment was delivered on 06.05.2013 allowing the appeal of

the Plaintiff.

Later on, an application had been preferred by the 7th Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner

(hereinafter referred to as the 'Petitioner') on 31 st August 2014 praying for an order to

set aside the order dated 06.05.2013 under section 771 of the Civil Procedure Code, on

the following grounds:

i. The Petitioner received no notices of the date of argument of the Appeal

and,

ii. Before the delivery of the order dated 06.05.2013, some of the parties to

the appeal have died and no substitution was effected.

4

In this case, the appeal had been listed ex-parte in the absence of the Petitioner and

the judgment has been given against him, the procedure and the grounds on which that,

order has to be set aside is contemplated in Section 771 of the Civil procedure Code.

The section is as follows:-

"When an appeal is heard ex parte in the absence of the respondent, and

judgment is given against him, he may apply to the Court of Appeal to rehear

the appeal; and if he satisfies the court that the notice of appeal was not

dulv served, or that he was prevented by sufficient cause from attending when

the appeal was called on for hearing, the Court may rehear the appeal on such

terms as to costs or otherwise as the Court thinks fit to impose upon him. "

However, by contrast, the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

'Respondent') filed his Statement of Objections to this application dated 22.01.2016.

According to Respondent's version, the notice of appeal together with registered postal

article were filed in the District Court of Kurunegala on 14.09.1999 and the address of

the Petitioner is the same address given in the proxy filed on 01.06.1998.

This case was fixed for argument by this court and notices have been dispatched to all

the parties on 20.10.2011. Some of the notices have been returned undelivered, but the

notices in question served on the address given in the notice of appeal and of the proxy

of the Petitioner.

However, the address given by the Petitioner in the application under Section 771 is

Dewamedde Korela, Aluthgama. Since the notices served on Bamunukotuwa,

Aluthgama was not returned undelivered to the Petitioner is deemed to have received

such notice on that date. According to the journal entry dated 23.02.2012 the following

entries have done:

"Matter is fixed for argument on 11.09.2012 ... "

5

"Despite notices having been issued on the Respondents as their absent, the

Registrar is directed (as a matter of courtesy) to inform the registered Attorney

at Law of the Respondents of the date fixed for argument"

Therefore, this Court may presume that official act of posting and dispatch of letters to

the addressee has been regularly performed.

Section 114, illustration -'d' of the Evidence Ordinance read as follows:

liThe court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to

have happened, regard being had the common course of natural events,

human conduct, and public and private business in their relation to the

facts of the particular case. "

Illustration - Id'

liThe court may presume that judicial and official acts have been regularly

performed. "

In Dharmatilake vs. Brampy Singho 40 N. L. R. 497, it was held that section 114 (d)

of the Evidence Ordinance means that if an official act is proved to have been done, it

will be presumed to have been regularly done. It does not raise any presumption that an

act was done of which there is no evidence and the proof of which is essential to a

case. It will therefore be apparent that there is no presumption that an act likes the act

of the obtaining of consent of the child in an adoption case was done.

Our courts have applied this presumption in several contexts. As such no doubt exists

in mind, as there is no other evidence to controvert that position of dispatch of letter,

other than a bear denial, by the Petitioner of receiving same.

In Packiyanathan vs. Singarajah (1991) 2 S. L. R. 205, it was held that,

Relief will not be granted for default in prosecuting an appeal where -

a) The default has resulted from the negligence of the client or both the client

and his attorney-at-law

b) The default has resulted from the negligence of the attorney-at-law in which

event the principle is that the negligence of the attorney-at-law is the

negligence of the client and the client must suffer for it.

As the applicant's default appeared to be the result of his own negligence as

well as the negligence of his attorney-at-law the conduct of the appellant and his

attorney-at-law cannot be excused. The appellant had failed to adduce sufficient

cause for a re-hearing of the appeal.

It is necessary to make a distinction between mistake or inadvertence of an

attorney-at-law or party and negligence. A mere mistake can generally be

excused; but not negligence, especially continuing negligence. The decision will

depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. The Court will in granting

relief ensure that its order will not condone or in any manner encourage the

neglect of professional duties expected of Attorneys-at-Law.

Considering the aforementioned facts and reasons it appears that the notices had been

duly served by this Court on the parties before the date of argument.

The Petitioner's next ground of the appeal was that the 1st, 2A, 3rd and 9th Defendants

were dead at the time, the judgment dated 16.05.2013 was delivered by this court and

no substitution in the room of the deceased parties had been effected before the

delivery of the said judgment.

7

Therefore, the Petitioner produced the death certificates of the 1st, 2A, 3rd, 5th, 8th and

9th Defendants and prayed under Section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code when the

record became defective there should be substitution of a party who is dead and or

undergone a change of status.

Section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code had been applied by this court and the

Supreme Court in many cases. In Munasinghe and Another vs. Mohamed Jabir

Navaz Carim (1990) 2 S. L. R. 163, the Plaintiff Respondent died in July 1980 during

the pendency of an appeal lodged by the 17th and 18th defendant-appellants -

petitioners on 14.11.1975. The appeal was argued on 27.01.1987 and dismissed on

27.03.1987. Counsel marked his appearance for the substituted plaintiff-respondent on

27.01.1987. Substitution had taken place on 20.11.1987 after the record was sent back

to the District Court of Kalutara after the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Counsel could

not have made his appearance in Court for the substituted plaintiff-respondent as no

substitution had been made in terms of Rule 4 or Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules

gazetted in Gazette Extraordinary of the Republic of Sri Lanka No. 44/23 dated

23.01.1974. The action of the counsel misled the Court and the parties to the action.

Therefore, the court held that,

1. The record was defective and the judgment delivered by the Court of Appeal

was a nUllity. Counsel had no status to appear for the substituted Plaintiff-

Respondent as at that time no substitution had been made.

2. The Court has inherent powers to set aside its own judgment which is a nullity.

In Karunawathie vs. Piyasena and Others (2011) 1 S. L. R. 171, it was held that,

"When a party to a case had died during the pendency of that case, it would not

be possible for the Court to proceed with that matter without appointing a legal

representative of the deceased in his place. No sooner a death occurs of a party

before Court, his counsel loses his position in assisting Court, as along with the

said death and without any substitution he has no way of obtaining instructions."

8

However, I do not think that the above decisions are applicable to the instant application

before this Court. I am of the view that the 5th 7th Defendants are the only necessary

parties to this appeal, since they were the only parties to whom shares were allotted of

the subject matter of the present Partition action. Therefore, the death of 1st, 2A, 3rd, 8th

and 9th Defendants do not make the present appeal defective.

Further, the Respondent had brought the attention of Court to the name of the 5th

Defendant given in the caption ii the original appeal and of the application of the 7th

Defendant is Ratnayaka Mudiyanselage Jayatilake and the death certificate of the 5th

Defendant, the name of the deceased is Ratnayaka Mudiyanselage Jayatilake Banda.

Therefore, the Respondent argued that the Petitioner has not proved that the 5th

Defendant was dead before the delivery of the judgment. I am inclined to agree with this

submission.

For the forgoing reasons, I am of the view that, the Petitioner has not proved that he

had not been received the notice; and he failed to prove that the appeal is defective.

Therefore, I dismiss this application with Cost.

Appeal dismissed.
