JUDGMENT

s. Thurairaja, PC. J

This is an appeal by the Accused - Appellant, Welegoda Don Premasiri (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Appellant), against the convictions on double murder.

The Appellant was indicted at the High Court of KUliyapitiya by the honourable

Attorney General for committing the murders of Sandara Sadaralage Rupika

Chandani and Upasaka Lekamlage Wijewardene. After the trial the Accused-

Appellant was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved with the said conviction and sentence the Appellant had preferred

this appeal to the Court of Appeal and submitted following grounds of appeal. In the

original appeal he had submitted the following grounds of appeal (the following are

re-produced from the petition of appeal of the Accused-Appellant).

1) Trial conducted without a jury is unfavourable.

2) The evidence given by the PW1 in the non-summary inquiry cast a

reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.

3) Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by not considering the

material inter se contradictions of the prosecution version.

4) Prosecution does not proved the case beyond reasonable doubt

5) To prove the innocence of the Appellant with the assistance of eminent

Attorney-at- Law before the Court of Appeal.

The Counsel for the Appellant filed a written submission; regrettably there are no

specific grounds of appeal submitted by the Appellant. Counsel who argued this case

had submitted two (2) grounds of appeal and confined his argument to those

grounds of appeal.

1) Dying deposition was uncorroborated and acting on the said deposition is

wrong.

2) The dock statement was not considered by the Learned High Court Judge.

The prosecution led the evidence of Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) Dr. Mathurawa

Mudiyanselage Ajith Jayasena (JMO), Wickramanayake Pathiranalage Anulawathie

Menike, Edirimanne Arachchilage Chandima Wijewardane, Thennakoon

Mudiyanselage Dayani Dhammika Rupasinghe, Kumaragamage Chandrani, Judicial

Medical Officer (JMO) Asarappulige Dayapala, Edirimanne Arachchilage Chanaka

Wijewardhana, Sub Inspector of Police Widana Gamage Kithsiri Walter Ethiliyagoda,

Nishshanka Arachchilage Josapin Nona and Interpreter of Court Manesha Jeewanthi

Alahakoon.

It will be appropriate to consider the facts of the case before we proceed to analyse

grounds of appeal.

According to the prosecution, the Appellant, who was a married person, had an affair

with the 1 st Deceased. Due to some reasons it was discontinued and the 1 st deceased

was living with the 2nd deceased. On the 17th March 2002 the main witness had seen

the 1 st deceased was coming out of the room with flames and crying, "Premasiri

poured petrol and set fire". She had seen the 2nd deceased also burning in the same

room. Both deceased were taken to the Kuliyapitiya Hospital. From there, they were

transferred to the National Hospital, Colombo for treatment. Subsequently, both

succumbed to their injuries.

Considering the 1st ground of appeal, that Dying deposition was uncorroborated and

acting on the said deposition is wrong. According to the evidence available, the

deceased was residing at the residence of the 1 st witness, Wickramanayake

Pathiranalage Anulawathie Menike. She gave evidence at the trial and revealed the

entire incident. According to her, the 1st deceased was married earlier and her

husband died in 1991. Thereafter 1 st deceased had gone to Kuwait in 1998. In the

meantime, she had an affair with the Appellant, who was married earlier to another

woman. The 1st witness, Wickramanayake Pathiranalage Anulawathie Menike, on the

day of the incident heard a cry of "Q'@L. .. Q'L .. " (Ammo .. Ammo ... ) at around

6.00-6.30 in the morning. There, she saw the deceased was in flames running out and

crying "premasiri poured petrol and set fire." (d'So @O~@ ~)@) G36) ffiQ)Q)1.). this

witness was attending to both deceased persons. She made a statement to the Police

on the same day when Police started investigation. Since she made a statement 6 Vz

hours after the incident of which, the Counsel submits a delay statement.

Considering the facts of the case, the deceased was taken to Hospital and transferred

to Colombo and the witness to attend many other matters making a statement after

6 Vz hours cannot be taken as a belated statement under any circumstances.

The daughter of the 1 st deceased revealed the fact that her mother told at the

Hospital that, Premasiri, did this to her. She had made the statement after receiving

burn injuries.

Considering Section 32(1) of the Evidence Ordinance, the prosecution is to prove the

fact that, the deceased had made the statement anticipating the death. Further it can

be orally or verbally.

In Somasundaram v. The Queen (76 NLR 10) the learned trial Judge in the course

of his summing up to the jury had explained the law relating to dying depositions in

the following manner:

"This is a very vital matter for the reason that under our law a statement made

by a man who is very seriously injured is considered with great sanctity, because

the law assumes that a person in that position will not unnecessarily implicate

an innocent man."

In Perera Vs. Jirasinghe ( S. I. Police ),(48 NLR 17), it was held that,

"Statements made by a person who is dead are inadmissible in evidence under

section 32 (7) of the Evidence Ordinance when they do not refer to the cause of

his death or when they do not relate to any of the circumstances of the

transaction which resulted in his death."

In Sigera Vs. Attorney General (2011 - Volume 1 ,Page No - 201) it was held that,

"Under our law a dying declaration can be admitted in evidence under Section

32 of the Evidence Ordinance. One of the salient features discernible in this

section is that the declaration may be written or oral. Even a sign made by a

person who is unable to speak is caught up in this phrase.

First and foremost a judge must apply his mind and decide whether the dying

declaration is a true and accepted statement - in doing so he must be mindful of

the fact that the statement was not made under oath, that the statement of the

deceased person has not been tested in cross examination and that the person

who, made the dying declaration is not a witness at the trial.

An accused can be convicted for murder based mainly and solely on a dying

declaration made by a deceased, - without corroborating under certain

circumstances. It would not be repugnant or Obnoxious to the law to convict an

accused based solely on a dying declaration. "

And further stated that,

"The principle on which this kind of evidence is admitted in certain cases is that

they are declarations made in the extremity when the party is at the point of

death; when every hope of this world has gone; when every motive to falsehood

is silenced; and the mind is induced by the most powerfuL considerations to

speak the truth."

In Arumuga Tevan v. Emperor [A. I. R. 1931 Mad. 180] Jackson J. held that

II when a man who is dead has left a statement throwing light upon the cause of

his death, that statement is relevant evidence under section 32 (of the Indian

Act) but it is not entitled to any peculiar credit . ... It is incumbent upon the

Court before it accepts the statements as true to see how far it is corroborated ".

Considering all, we find that, the dying deposition made by the deceased is well

acceptable under our law. Hence I find that this ground of appeal fails on its own

merits.

The 2nd ground of appeal is that, the dock statement was not considered by the

Learned High Court Judge. It is appropriate to re-produce the Dock statement and its

translation.

(They took me into the Police and at first the IP sir slapped on me. Then they

took me to a house which was situated above to my house, all my clothes were

removed. My hands and feet were tied, and hanged me on a rope. Then they

assaulted. Then they assaulted me with an iron rod. Then I asked, "You want me

to tell lies"?)

In Gunasiri and two other vs Republic of Sri Lanka 2009 (1) Sri L.R 39. It was held

that,

In evaluating a dock statement the trialjudge must consider the following

principles:

(7) If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon.

(2) If the dock statement creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case

the defence must succeed.

(3) Dock statement of one accused should not be used against the other.

On mere reading of the Dock Statement, it shows that the Appellant has not denied

of any charges. He only says that, he was assaulted by the Police. The Learned Trial

Judge had considered all these and delivered an order which contains of 41 pages.

He adequately considered the case for the defence, especially the Dock Statement of

the Appellant. After careful consideration the Learned Trial Judge found the

Appellant is guilty.

In The Queen v. Kularatne [1968] [71 NLR 529] stated that,

'we are in respectful agreement, and are out of the view that such a statement

must be looked upon as evidence subject to the infirmity that the accused had

deliberately refrained from giving sworn testimony".

Acceptance of Dock Statement is discussed in many cases.

After careful consideration we find that there is no merit in this ground of appeal.

Even though the Counsel for the Appellant avoided the grounds of appeal set out in

his original petition of appeal, we considered all five grounds of appeal and find that

those grounds have no merits; hence we dismiss all those grounds of appeal.

Considering all, we find that the findings of the Learned Trial Judge is well founded

and well supported by the evidence. Hence we dismiss the appeal and affirm the

conviction and the sentence for the 1st and 2nd counts.

Appeal Dismissed.
