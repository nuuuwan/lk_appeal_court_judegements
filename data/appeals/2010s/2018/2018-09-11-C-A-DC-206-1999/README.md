This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Bandarawela

dated 17.02.1999.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (Respondent) filed the above action in the District Court of Bandarawela

seeking to partition the land called "Asweddume Mulatha" more fully described in the schedule

to the plaint situated at Ranwanguhawegama in the District of Badulla. There was no contest as

to the identity of the corpus. It was admitted that the corpus is depicted in plan no. 339 dated

17.02.1986 prepared by U.N.P. Wijeweera, Licensed Surveyor.

The pedigree pleaded by the Respondent was contested by the the pt Defendant-Appellant

(Appellant) while the original 2nd Defendant admitted it.

The Respondent alleged that the corpus was at one time owned by one Kumarihamy who died

intestate and her rights were inherited by one Mullegama Muthubandara. The said Mullegama

Muthubandara died intestate and his rights were inherited by one Loku Kumarihamy. The

pedigree of the Respondent is admitted by the Appellant up to this point of time.

The divergence arises on the number of children of Loku Kumarihamy. The Appellant contends

that there were only two, namely Loku Kumarihamy (2nd Kumarihamy) and Heen Kumarihamy

and that he bought the corpus from them by virtue of deed no. 45801 dated 26.07.1961 (5.1).

Page 2 of 8

However, the Respondent contends that Kumarihamy died intestate leaving five children, namely

2nd Kumarihamy, Madduma Kumarihamy, Heen Kumarihamy, Punchi Kumarihamy and Podi

Kumarihamy who each inherited an undivided 1/5th share of the corpus. The Respondent further

submits that the 2nd Kumarihamy died intestate leaving two children namely D.M. Jinadasa and

D.M.D.D. Bandara (the original 2nd Defendant). D.M. Jinadasa sold his 1/10th share to the

Respondent by virtue of deed no. 583 dated 03.11.1973(01.2}. According to the Respondent the

undivided shares of Madduma Kumarihamy and Heen Kumarihamy devolved on D.M.

Gunawardena (the original pt Defendant) who thereby became entitled to an undivided 4/10th

of a share of the corpus. Punchi Kumarihamy sold her undivided 1/5th share of the corpus to the

Respondent by virtue of deed no. 583 dated 03.11.1973(01.2}. Podi Kumarihamy died intestate

and her undivided 1/5th share was inherited by S.M. Seneviratne who by virtue of deed no. 636

dated 20.11.1973 (01.3) transferred his share to the Respondent.

Accordingly, the case of the Respondent was that the shares of the corpus was held as follows:

Respondent an undivided 5/10 share

pt Defendant-Appellant an undivided 4/10 share

Original 2nd Defendant an undivided 1/10 share

The Respondent pleaded only paper title whereas the Appellant pleaded both paper and

prescriptive title.

The learned Additional District Judge held that the Respondent had established the pedigree

pleaded and ordered that the corpus be partitioned accordingly. Hence this appeal by the

Appellant.

Th case of the Appellant is that he is the sole owner of the corpus. One important matter to be

determined in this context is whether Loku Kumarihmay had only two daughters, as pleaded by

the Appellant or five as pleaded by the Respondent. The evidence of Mattamagoda

Sumanasekera, son of Heen Kumarihamy is significant on this issue. He testified that his mother

had four sisters. The Appellant was unable to contradict this statement.

Another important matter was whether deed no. 45801 dated 26.07.1961 (5.1) is valid as the

entire claim of the Appellant is based on this deed. The Respondent attacked the validity of this

deed on the basis that the 2nd Loku Kumarihamy, one of the vendors of deed no. 45801 dated

26.07.1961 (5.1), died on 27.08.1943. The Respondent submitted the death certificate of the 2nd

Loku Kumarihamy (01.6). The Appellant was unable to controvert this position. Accordingly, the

learned Additional District Judge correctly concluded that the deed no. 45801 dated 26.07.1961

(5.1) did not transfer ownership of the corpus to the Appellant as claimed by him.

The learned counsel for the Appellant however submits that the learned Additional District Judge

erred in not considering that the Appellant had, in addition to the paper title, also pleaded

prescriptive title which has received negligible if not no consideration at all. There is some merit

in this submission. However, the proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution states that no

judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect

or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice. Therefore, even where there is a failure to satisfactorily consider the claim of

prescriptive title pleaded by the Appellant, if it is evident on a close examination of the totality

of the evidence that the learned Additional District Judge was correct in pronouncing judgment

in favour of the Respondent, there is no prejudice to the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice and the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge should

not be disturbed [Victor and Another v. Cyril De Silva (1998) 1 Sri.L.R. 41].

The position of the Appellant is that they were in possession of the corpus from the time deed

no. 45801 dated 26.07.1961 (5.1) was executed in 1961. The evidence is that when this deed was

executed in 1961, one Heen Menika was working on the paddy field forming the corpus of the

partition action. She happened to be an aunt of the Appellant. In fact, the wife of the Appellant

admitted that Heen Menika was working the paddy field from 1952 to 1961.

In D.R. Kiriamma v. l.A. Podibanda and 8 others (2005 B.U. 9 at 11) Udalagama J. adverted to

some important points to be borne in mind in considering a claim of prescriptive title:

"Onus probandi or the burden of proving possession is on the party claiming prescriptive

possession. Importantly, prescription is a question of fact. Physical possession is a factum

probandum. I am inclined to the view that considerable circumspection is necessary to

recognize the prescriptive title as undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party

having paper title. It is in fact said that title by prescription is an illegality made legal due

to the other party not taking action. It is to be reiterated that in Sri Lanka prescriptive title

is required to be by title adverse to an independent to that of a claimant or plaintiff. "

Where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat

the ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property the burden of proof rests fairly and

squarely on him to establish the starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights

[Gratiaen J. in Chelliah v. Wijenathan 54 N.L.R. 337 at 342].

The principles of burden of proof and mode of proof where a party claims prescriptive title was

succinctly stated by the Supreme Court in Sirajudeen and two others v. Abbas [(1994) 2 SrLL.R.

365] as follows:

"Where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order

to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of

proof rests squarely and fairly on him to establish a starting point for his or her acquisition

of prescriptive rights.

A facile story of walking into abandoned premises after the Japanese air raid constitutes

material far too slender to found a claim based on prescriptive title.

As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general statements of

witnesses that the plaintiff possessed the land in dispute for a number of years exceeding

the prescriptive period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession

necessary to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses should speak

to specific facts and the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by Court.

Page 5 of 8

One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as provided for in section 3

of the Prescription Ordinance is proof of possession by a title adverse to or independent

of that of the claimant or plaintiff. The occupation of the premises must be of such

character as is incompatible with the title of the owner."

The Appellant has failed to explain how and when he obtained possession of the corpus from Heen

Menika. Thus, he has failed to establish an important element of the burden of proof namely the

starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights.

This failure has further implications in view of the evidence of the Respondent that the Appellant

had previously promised to give him his share of the harvest which the Appellant later failed to

do. The Respondent further stated that thereafter he went before the Conciliation Board and

marked in evidence a certificate issued under section 14 of the Conciliation Boards Act (01.4). It

states that there was a complaint by S.A. Wijeratne, the Respondent, against D.M. Gunawardena,

pt Defendant-Appellant, that the pt Defendant-Appellant had failed to give the Respondent the

promised }{ share from the harvest according to the decision of the Productivity Improvement

Committee. The Appellant failed to challenge this position in cross-examination of the

Respondent. This vital piece of evidence negates the adverse possession that must be established

by the Appellant to succeed in the claim to prescriptive title. As the learned Additional District

Judge correctly points out the Appellant has failed to explain the circumstances set out in the

certificate issued under section 14 of the Conciliation Boards Act (01.4).

In Weragoda v. Peiris and others [(1996) 2 SrLL.R. 56] the plaintiff instituted a partition action

pleading paper title. The defendants pleaded that they have acquired prescriptive title. The

District Court held in favour of the plaintiffs and the defendants appealed. The defendants relied

upon two deeds of their predecessors in title by which they were entitled to an undivided 1/3

share each on their "waga buktiya". The Court of Appeal held that "waga buktiya" means that

they were claiming to be entitled to a 1/3 share each by virtue of their possession of the

Plantation or by virtue of their possession of the undivided 1/3 share each to plant it. In either

Page 6 of 8

case, it acknowledges a right of ownership in some other person or persons and that until such

time as they shed that right of limited possession, adverse possession will not commence.

The Appellant relied on several acreage levy receipts to establish prescriptive title.e:l.4, e:l.6, e:l.7

e:l.8 and e:l.9 are all acreage levy receipts issued after the partition action was filed and the learned

Additional District judge correctly did not attach any evidentiary value to them. e:l.S is dated

21.08.1974 but is in relation to a paddy land named "Aswedduma" whereas the corpus is

identified as "Asweddume Mulatha".

It was admitted that the corpus is depicted in plan no. 339 dated 17.02.1986 prepared by U.N.P.

Wijeweera, Licensed Surveyor. According to this plan the extent of the corpus is A.01 R. 03 P.20.

e:l.10 is an extract from the paddy lands register 1980 which states that the the Appellant is the

owner of the land called "Aswedduma" which is 2 acres in extent. This again is a document

emanating after the filing of the partition action and further refers to to a paddy land named

"Aswedduma" whereas the corpus is identified as "Asweddume Mulatha". e:l.ll is an extract from

the paddy lands register 1970 which states that the the Appellant is the owner of the land called

"Aswedduma Mulatha" which is 1 acre in extent whereas the corpus is A.01 R. 03 P.20 in extent.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that the Appellant has failed to show by clear and

unequivocal evidence that his possession of the corpus was hostile to the real owners and

amounted to a denial of their title to the property claimed as required to be shown in view of the

decision in De Silva v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (80 N.L.R. 292).

For the foregoing reasons, the case of the Appellant that he acquired prescriptive title to the

whole land must fail.

The case of the Respondent is that the Appellant is only a co-owner who is entitled to an

undivided 4/10 share of the corpus. In this context, the plea of prescriptive title raised by the

Appellant must be considered upon the applicable legal principles governing claim of prescriptive

title amongst co-owners. A co-owner's possession is in law the possession of his co-owners. It is

not possible for him to put an end to that possession by any secret intention in his mind. Nothing

short of ouster or something equivalent to ouster could bring about that result [Corea v.

Page 7 of 8

Appuhamy et al (15 N.L.R. 65)]. A person who has entered into possession of land in one capacity

is presumed to continue to possess it in the same capacity. However, such presumption of

continuity of common possession can be negative by a counter presumption of ouster.

[Tillekeratne et al v. Bastian et al (21 N.L.R. 12)].

The facts of the instant case do not establish an ouster as required by law. The evidence of the

Respondent on the certificate issued under section 14 of the Conciliation Boards Act (01.4) and

its background which the Appellant failed to challenge and controvert as well as the failure of the

Appellant to point to a starting point for his acquisition of prescriptive rights prevents the

application of a counter presumption.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned Additional

District Judge of Bandarawela dated 17.02.1999.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
