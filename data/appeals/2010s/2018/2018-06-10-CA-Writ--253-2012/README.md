The Petitioner has h~voked the jurisdiction of this court, inter alia, to seek a

mandate in the nature of writ of Certiorari to quash Gazette No. 1770/26, dated

5

loth August 2012, marked X2, published in terms of the Special Commodity Levy

Act No. 48 of 2007, (sometimes herein after referred to as "the Act") on the basis

that the said Gazette Notification is ultra vires.

All connected applications to this Petition were taken up together as the

Petitioners are all similarly circumstanced. Their grievance and cause for

complaint are similar and the relief sought from this Court are identical.

The Petitioner, a commodity importer, was subject to levies on clearance of

imports in terms of Section 2(4) of the Act. The Act conferred power on the

Minister to detennine the composite levy to be paid through Gazette Notifications.

The Petitioner submits that at the time of submitting the Bill of Entry (CUSDEC),

for clearance of his imports; the applicable levy should have been calculated under

Gazette Notification No. 1766/35, dated 13/0712012, marked X4, and not under

the impugned Gazette Notification dated 10/0812012, marked X2. The impugned

Gazette Notification marked X2, was published subsequent to Gazette Notification

No. 1766135, dated 13/07/2012, marked X4.

Section 2 arid Section 7 of the Act, which are directly relevant to this

discussion, are re-pr-oduced below in whole and in part, respectively;

Section 2. (J) From and ajter the date o/the coming into operation o/this Act,

there shall be imposed a levy to be called the "Special Commodity Levy" on

certain commodity items which shall from time to time be specified by the Minister

by Order published in the Gazette.

(2) The period of validity of every such Order and the rate of the Special

Commodi~y Levy to be imposed in respect of each such specified item, either on ad

valorem or specific basis, shall also be specified in the Order.

(3) Every Order made under subsection (1) which is valid for a period of

over thirty days, may be amend or varied by adding thereto or removing there

from any item or by revising the rates specified therein.

(4) No Order made under subsection (3) may be amend or varied until the

expiration of thir~)l days from the date of the making thereof

(5) The Special Commodity Levy so imposed shall be a composite levy and

during the period any Order published in terms of subsection (1) is in force, no

other tax, duty, levy or cess or any other charge imposed in terms of any of the

laws specified in the Schedule to this Act, shall be applicable in respect of the

.' commodity items specified In any such Order.

Section 7. Every Order made by the Minister in terms of section 2 and section 5,

shall-

0) be in operation immediately upon the Minister affixing his signature

thereto;

(ii) ----------

In tenns of Section 7 (1) of the Act, every order made in terms of Section 2

and Section 5, becomes operative upon the Minister placing his signature thereto.

7

Section 2(2) mandates the Minister to specify a period of validity in the said order.

The Petitioner argues that in tenns of Section 7(1) of the Act, the Minister is

restricted to impose a later date as the operative date of the order made in tenns of

Section 2(2) of the Act and therefore, submits that the operative date of the Act is

the date when the Minister affix his signature and the Minister is thereafter not

empowered to specify a later date as the operative date.

It is observed that Section 2 (2) of the Act imposes a period of validity to be

specified in such order. Section 7(1) of the Act refers to an order made in tenns of

Section 2(2) of the Act to be in operation immediately after the Minister affix his

signature thereto. It is also observed that the word "shall" appear in both Sections

2(2) and Section 7(1), of the Act.

In this background, I will now turn to the mam relief prayed for in

paragraph (d) to the prayer, where the Petitioner is seeking to compel "the 5th to

10th Respondents to apply the commodity levy order dated 13/07/2012, from the

date of making the order, that is from the date the Minister placed his signature on

such order, irrespective of the later date, that is 14/07/2012, stipulated by the

Minister in the said order -;-----"

The Petitioner has made reference to Gazette Notification No. 1766/35,

dated 13/07/2012, marked X4. The said Gazette Notification was followed by the

impugned Gazette Notification No. 1770126, dated 10th August 2012, marked X2.

8

In terms of Section 7(1) of the Act, every order made by the Minister in

terms of Section 2 and Section 5 shall be in operation upon the Minister placing

his signature. The making of the said order would be the date of commencement

of the period of validity in terms of Section 2 (4) of the Act. Accordingly, in terms

of Section 2(3), the order dated 13/08/2012, made by the impugned Gazette

Notification marked X2, dated 10/08/2012, has a validity period of 04 months

from the said date as opposed to the order dated 14/07/2012, marked X4, which

has a validity period of 03 months.

In terms of Section 2(2) of the Act, the Minister is empowered to specify a

time period on the date of making the order. Therefore, Section 2(2) of the Act,

can be clearly distinguished from Section 7(1) of the Act, where the Minister affix

his signature in the said order, and the operation of the order would commence

immediately thereon. Accordingly, the period of validity envisaged in terms of

Section 2(4). of the Act would relate to the date of making the order and as such

has no relevance to the date of operation of the order. Therefore it is clear that the

date of making the said order contemplated by Section 2(4) of the Act would be

the commencement of the period of validity and not the operative date of the order

as contemplated by Section 7(1) of the Act, which empowers the Minister to

specify a later date as the operative date of the order.

Accordingly, the powers exercised by the Minister is clearly within the

confines of the Act, and, could be distinguished from the decision in Wasana

9

1 Trading Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. Vs. Director General of Customs and others, which f

was relied on by the Petitioner, where the relevant Ministers power to set aside a

subsequent operative date was curtailed in that instance, by the operation of a

successive Act.

The Respondents submit that the validity period from the making of the

j order as contemplated in tenns of Sections 2(3) and 2(4) of the Act, are not

mandatory, but are directory through the use of the word "may" instead of "shall",

in the said Sectioris. The Respondents have drawn attention of Court to several

decided cases in support of the above contention.

The Respondents submit that the Court should consider the intention of the

legislature by considering all provisions of the Act concurrently. Whilst referring

to the preamble of the Act, and in particular Section 5 of the Act, the Respondents

submit that the intention of the legislature has been to give the Minister the

prerogative of determining the rate of the levy and the period of validity in

consideration of the economic conditions of the country.

In the case of Howard Vs. Bodington (1877) 2 P.D. 203, Lord Penzance said,

"1 believe that as far as any rule is concerned, you cannot safoly go further

than that in each case you must look to the subject matter; consider the

importance of the provision that has been disregarded, and the relation of

that provision to the general object intended to be secured by the Act; and

I

10

upon a review of the case in that aspect decide whether the matter is what

is called imperative or only directory. "

Lord Campbell L.c. in the case of Liverpool Borough Bank Vs. Turner

(1860) 2 De G.P. & J. 502, held that;

"No universal rule can be laid down for the construction of statutes, as to

whether mandatory enactments shall be considered directory only or

obligatory with an implied nullification for dis- obedience. It is the duty of

the courts of justice to try to get at the real intention of the legislator by

carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute to be considered. "

In terms of Section 5 of the Act, the Minister is empowered to waive the

special commodity levy, taking into consideration the prevailing economic

considerations, for a period of time, specified in such order. Such discretion given

to the Minister is; strongly suggestive of a situation, where the Minister is

empowered to look into divergent considerations which impact economic realities

faced by the country. when implementing taxes, duties levies or any other charge

on specitied commodity items as contemplated in the preamble to the Act.

Therefore, it is my view that the Special Commodity Levy Act, provides for

a wider construction of Sections 2(1) and 2(3), to enable the Minister to take

account of the existing economic exigencies of the country within the intent of the

Act, and not be restricted in any manner. The said contention resonates with good

administration, where the Minister is empowered to impose the special commodity

11

levy on ce11ain commodity items from time to time within the confines of the Act,

by an order published in the Gazette. In relation to the period of validity, Sections

2(1) and 2(3) of the Act, use the word "may", in reference to the 30 day period. In

the circumstances, the Court cannot interpret the word "may" provided in

Sections, 2( 1) and 2(3) of the Act, in isolation or to give a restrictive

interpretation. Accordingly I hold, that the discretion used by the Minister in terms

of the said provisions have been exercised within his power and the spirit of the

enactment.

The Petitioner also challenge the impugned Gazette marked X2, to be in

violation of the provisions of the Electronic Transactions Act. The formulation of

this argument is baseless and has no merit.

Therefore for the reasons stated above, the Petition is dismissed without

costs.
