The Petitioner in this application seeks several writs to

prevent the 3rd Respondent from acting as the temporary trustee

of the Kataragama Maha Devalaya. Section 17 of the Buddhist

Temporalities Ordinance empowers the Commissioner of Buddhist

Affairs to make a provisional arrangement for the purpose of the

duties of the office of the trustee pending the appointment of a

successor in case of suspension of the incumbent trustee.

The Petitioner does not complain that the Commissioner of

Buddhist Affairs had acted without powers or in excess of his

powers.

The Petitioner only relies on two grounds in support of this

application.

Firstly, he claims that the Petitioner has had a legitimate

expectation of being appointed as the temporary trustee of the

Kataragama Maha Devalaya by the 1st Respondent.

Secondly, it is the submission of the learned counsel for the

Petitioner that the 3rd Respondent is unfit for appointment of the

trustee of the Kataragam Maha Devalaya.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that on long

standing traditions the Petitioner should have been appointed to

the post of acting Basnayake Nilame of Kataragama Maha

Develaya. Petitioner relies on the documents produced marked

P 13 and P 15 to prove the claimed tradition.

This Court observes that the P 13 is a letter written by

Basnayaka Nilame of Uggal Aluth Nuwara Kataragama Devalaya

on 31.01.2015. P lSA, P 158, P 18C and P 180 are affidavits

sworn by other Basnayaka Nilames on 11.04.2018. Having

considered these documents, this Court is of the view that the

Petitioner has not established to the satisfaction of this Court that

there has been such a tradition.

Petitioner relies on the documents produced marked P 11 to

argue that the 3rd Respondent is unfit for this appOintment. This

Court observes that P 10 is only a print out of a website. In any

case, learned counsel for the 3rd Respondent submitted to this

court that the 3rd Respondent is no longer holding any public office

and in particular it was so at the time of his impugned

appOintment. Learned counsel for the Petitioner stated to Court

that he is satisfied with that statement from the learned counsel

for the 3rd Respondent. This Court observes that P 11 is only an

article published in a newspaper as a general news item and

hence it is not possible for this Court to accept that as evidence.

In any case, the contents of the documents produced marked

P 11 does not state anything adverse to the 3rd Respondent.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the

Petitioner has failed to prove the two grounds he had relied on, to

canvass for writs prayed for by him in this application. Therefore,

this Court decides to refuse to issue notices on the Respondents.

Application is dismissed without costs.
