M. M. A. GAFFOOR. J

Heard both Counsel in support of their respective cases. The Accused-

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the "Accused") in this case was

indicted in the High Court of Kandy for the following counts:-

1. For committing rape on Tikkalage Gedera Dilrukshi Kumari

Thilakarathne under Section 364(1) of the Penal Code;

2. Causing grievous hurt to Thelkara Gedera Leelawathi under Section

316 of the Penal Code;

3. Robbing a gold bracelet worth of Rs.6000/ - under Section 380 of the

Penal Code.

After the indictment was read, the Accused pleaded not guilty and opted for

a non-jury trial. To prove the prosecution case, prosecution led the

evidence of several witnesses including the victim, Thelkara Gedera

Leelawathi, U. Kanthilatha Rajapaksha, District Medical Officer (DMO)-

Gajanayake, Judicial Medical Officer (JMO)-Seneviratna and several

Investigating Police Officers.

In giving evidence, the Prosecutriox stated that the incident occurred on the

14th April 2018 night, at time of the incident she was 20 years of age, and

was living with her grandmother's house as her mother had gone abroad for

employment.

According to Prosecutrix, on the day of the incident they had gone to sleep

in the room and few minutes later she heard someone throwing stones at

their window. Then the Prosecutrix and her grandmother had woken up and

both of them had come back to their sitting room. The Prosecutrix also

stated that someone broke the door and entered their house flashing a

torch. Through the torch light which was flashed by the intruder, the

Prosecutrix had clearly identified him as Sarath (the Accused) who is from

the same village and known to her previously for several years.

3

Therefore, we have come to a conclusion that there is no issue with regard

to the identification of the Accused.

Prosecutrix further goes on to say that, Sarath, slapped and kicked her

grandmother and then carried her away. After taking her, he had put the

Prosecutrix down on the ground and mounted on top of her and committed

rape on her. Prosecutrix says she shouted for help and her Aunt Kanathilatha

Rajapaksha had come running and then the Accused had run away taking her

gold bracelet.

The following day Prosecutrix had been taken to the Kuruduwatta Hospital

first and then taken to the Gampola Hospital where she had been examined

by the DMO on 17th April 2004. According to the DMO he had noted four

injuries on the body and two tears in the hymen. We observe that the

Prosecutrix had clearly stated that she was raped by Sarath in the history

given to the DMO. We also take in to consideration that DMO is a

professional and impartial witness. Thus, it is observed that Prosecutrix had

told the DMO that she was raped by Sarath, and the DMO had clearly

mentioned the name of the Accused in the MLR. DMO while giving evidence

stated that he noted the above injuries on the body of the Prosecutrix.

Grandmother of the Prosecutrix Leelawathi, giving evidence corroborates

the version of the Prosecutrix with regard to the incident. Leelawathi had

also identified the Accused as Sarath with the aid of the torch light and says

she was assaulted by Sarath. Leelawathi also stated on her evidence that

the Prosecutrix came after about 15 minutes, and the witness Kanthilatha

had also been there. Dilrukshi (the Prosecutrix) had told them that "Sarath

finished her" (Page-196). She also stated that the Prosecutrix told her that

Sarath, the Accused took her bracelet.

According to witness Kanthilatha, she had woken up on hearing the cries of

the Prosecutrix. Witness had run out of her house and had met Leelawathi

coming towards her house. Kanthilatha had noted Leelawathi bleeding from

her mouth. Leelawathi had told her that Sarath jumped in to their house,

I i 1 4

assaulted her and took Dilrukshi away (page-22S). Kanthilatha proceeded

forward and had stopped as she had seen someone coming towards her. She

had met Dilrukshi. Dilrukshi had told her that Sarath had raped her (Page-

227).

JMO, Kandy had also been called to give evidence with regard to the injuries

that he examined on the body of Leelawathi. According to the MLR, JMO had

noted two injuries where the JMO had classified one injury as a fracture.

After being informed of the incident through the hospital Police Post,

Gampola Police had investigated in to the matter. When the Police visited

the house of the Prosecutrix they have observed the broken door. Thus we

come to the conclusion that the version of the Prosecutrix is corroborated

by the Police Officers' investigation.

After conclusion of the prosecution case, the Accused opted to give

evidence on Oath. For the defence Accused and his mother had been called

to give evidence. Accused gave evidence denying his involvement. The

Accused said on the day of the incident he was at his sister's house in

Polonnaruwa (Accused taken up an alibi), and after his father called him

and informed him about the incident he had come back. However, there are

contradictions interse and perse, the accused had said that he was in

Polonnaruwa on the questionable day. Even though, there is a material

contradiction perse that he stated in his statement that he was with one

Nissanka and Jayathilaka on the questionable day and he went to

Polonnaruwa on 14th April 2004. Further this alibi pOSition had never been

suggested to any of the prosecution witnesses. In several decisions it had

been held that absence of cross examination of prosecution witnesses of

certain facts leads to interference of admission of the fact.

In the Indian Supreme Court decision of Motilal vs. State of Madhya

Predesh (1990) (CU NOC 125 MP) it was observed that,

"Absence of cross examination of Prosecution Witnesses of

certain facts leads to interference of admission of the fact. "

5

Furthermore, that principle is echoed in PiUppu Mandige Nalaka

Krishantha Kumara Thisera vs A.G, (CA 8712005 decided on 17-05-2007)

and is line with the approach adopted by Indian Courts as well as evidenced

by the decisions in Sarwan Singh vs. State of Punjab (2002) (AIR SC 111)

where it was held that,

"It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has

declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in

cross-examination it must follow that the evidence tendered on

that issue ought to be accepted .... "

(Also see: AEG Carapiet v. AY Derderian, AIR 1961 Calcutta 359 -

P.B. Mukherjee, J)

Thus, we have come to the conclusion that the defence taken up by the

Accused in his evidence is an afterthought and we reject the same.

After the prosecution and the defence submissions the Learned High Court

Judge fixed the case for judgment.

After trial, the Learned High Court Judge found the Accused guilty of all the

charges levelled against him.

The Learned High Court Judge convicted and sentenced the Accused on

12.10.2011.

Before the sentence was passed the Learned High Court Judge gave the

option of making submissions with regard to the sentence. After considering

the submissions, the Learned High Court Judge, imposed a term of 20 years

Rigorous Imprisonment and Compensation of Rs.200,0001 - and a default

1

;I i 6

term of two years for the 1st Count, 7 years Rigorous Imprisonment for the

2nd charge and 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment for the 3rd charge.

When this matter came up for argument before this Court, the learned

Counsel for the Accused took up several defects in the High Court Trial.

Accordingly, the 1 st defect was that there was no proper identification of

the Accused. We wish to place on record that the Prosecutrix had clearly

identified the Accused when he came in to the house; she had also

mentioned the name of the accused to Kanthilatha. Further, Prosecutrix had

told the DMO who examined her which is recorded in the MLR. Prosecutrix

had mentioned the name of the Accused in her Police Statement. What

more can a Court of law could expect from a Prosecutrix who had been

taken out by force in the night and raped. We see no defect in the

identification of the Accused.

The 2nd defect was the credibility of the witness. When we peruse the

record we find that the witness had sufficiently explained the incident. Even

under cross examination, the Prosecutrix had given evidence to the

satisfaction of this Court. No person is expected have a photographic

memory. The Prosecutrix had given evidence after 4 years. Minor

discrepancies which do not go to the root of the case have to be

disregarded. Therefore, we see no merit in this argument of the Accused

Counsel for the Accused.

Whilst contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect the

trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that the

Court must exercise its judgment on the tenor of the inconsistency or

contradiction and whether they are material to the facts in issue.

Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the basic

version of the witness cannot be given too much importance. (Vide, Boghi

Bhai vs. State of Gujarat, AIR 1983 SC 753)

In the Indian Supreme Court Case of Radhu vs. State of Madhya Pradesh

Appeal (crl.) 624 Ofn 2005, it was held that.

"The evidence of the prosecutrix should not be rejected on the

basis of minor discrepancies and contradictions. If the victim of

rape states on oath that she was forcibly subjected to sexual

intercourse, her statement wUl normally be accepted, even if it

is uncorroborated, unless the material on record requires

drawing of an inference that there was consent or that the

entire incident was improbable or imaginary. "

Justice S. Tilakawardane, J. in A.G vs. Sandanam Pitchai Mary Theresa

(SC Appeal 7912008, SC minutes dated 06.05.2010) has observed that.

"Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and

assail the basic version of the witness cannot be given too much

importance. " (Page at 07)

It was further held in the case that,

"Appellate courts are generally slow to interfere with the

decisions of inferior courts on questions of fact or oral

testimony. The Privy Council has stated that appellate court

should not ordinarily interfere with the trial courts opinion as to

the credibWty of a witness as the trial judge alone knows the

demeanour of the witness; he alone can appreciate the manner

in which the questions are answered, whether with honest

candour or with doubtful plausibWty and whether after careful

thought or with reckless glibness; and he alone can form a

reliable opinion as to whether the witness has emerged with

credit from cross examination." (Page at 11)

When we peruse the case record, the prosecution in this case had proved

the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. The Trial judge had

evaluated the prosecution evidence and arrived at the correct decision by

convicting the Accused under the Section 364(1), 316 and 380 of the Penal

Code. The totality of the evidence proved nothing beyond the guilt of the

Accused. The Trial Judge had correctly taken in to consideration the

seriousness of the Crime committed by the Accused who had raped a young

girl.

When we consider the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge,

this Court is of the view that the sentence is excessive. Therefore, we direct

the sentence to run concurrently.

Further, the Trial Judge had not imposed fines on all three counts.

Therefore, we impose Rs.10,0001 - for each count and a default term of six

months for each count.

The Registrar is directed to issue a copy of this Order to the Learned High

Court Judge of Kandy.

Subject to the above variations and directions, we dismissed the Appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
