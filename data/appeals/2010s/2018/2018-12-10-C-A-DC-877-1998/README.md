By the Judgment dated 27.10.1998 of the D.C. Tangalle partition case No. 2218/P,

the learned District Judge of Tangalle has allocated 15/16 of the corpus to the

1stDefendant-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st

Defendant). Even though the 1st Defendant Respondent and the 2nd Defendant-

Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 2nd Defendant) claimed

rights to the entire corpus in their statements of claims, during the trial they have

conceded that the pt Defendant gets only a 15/16 share of the corpus through

deeds marked as P1 to P5 (vide cross examination of the Plaintiff's evidence by

the 1st Defendant at page 132 of the brief; 2nd Defendant's representative's

evidence at page 166 of the brief; oral submissions made by the pt Defendant's

counsel at pages 102 and 103. Furthermore, the pt Defendant -Respondent has

not challenged the 15/16 share given by the Plaintiff in his evidence by calling any

other witnesses to show any contrary position.)However, the 1/16th share claimed

by the Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiff) was

kept unallotted by the aforesaid Judgment. It appears that it was unallotted due

to the following purported reasons.

1. The Plaintiff failed to prove the deed marked P6 which was marked subject

proof.

2. The Plaintiff failed to prove that the Suddirikku Hennadige Podi Singho,

one-time co-owner to a 1/2 share of the corpus as per the admissions

made, had another child named Dayani other than the three children

Gunadasa, Gunawathie and Karunawathie who were admitted as children

of said Podi Singho by the parties at the commencement of the trial.

The Plaintiff, in his plaint, has claimed title to a 1/16 share referring to the deed

No. 42585(P6)- (Vide Para 7 of the Plaint), but no Defendant has challenged the

due execution of that deed in their statements of claims or amended statements

of claims. In the aforesaid circumstances, marking of P6 subject to proof and

4

rejection of P6 on the objections raised during the trial by the Defendants that it

has to be further proved, contravenes section 68 of the Partition Law. Of course,

as per the provisions of the said section, the learned District Judge on his own

could have required the Plaintiff to prove P6, but he should have elucidated by

giving reasons why he used his discretion to order that P6 has to be further

proved. I do not find any such reasons given by the learned District Judge. In

Wimalawathie Vs Hemawathie and others (2009) 1 SLR 95, it was held that the

finding in relation to the want of proof of the documents produced by the Plaintiff

and the 10th Defendant contravenes Section 6~ of the partition law, which

(-provides that it shall not be necessary in any proceedings under thctflaw to adduce

"/' formal proof of the execution of any deed which on the face of it, purports to

have been duly executed unless the genuineness of that deed is impeached by a

party claiming adversely to the party producing that deed or unless the court

requires such proof.

In the aforesaid circumstances, the rejection of P6 by the learned District Judge at

the trial is unwarranted.

The challenge to the Plaintiff's title is based on the assertion that the aforesaid

Podi Singho did not have a child named fDayani' who was the vendor of P6.

It is clearly stated in P6 that Suddirikku Hennadige Dayani alias Dayani

Jayawickrama is a child of Suddirikku Hennadige Podi Singho. Furthermore, the

Plaintiff has attempted to mark the birth certificate of said Suddirikku Hennadige

Dayani alias Dayani Jayawickrama alias MiissiNona as P7, but it was rejected due

to the objections raised by the Defendants on the ground that it was not properly

5

listed as required by Section 23 of the partition Law. It was held in Pushpa V.

Leelawathie and others (2004) 3 SLR 167 that;

1. "In terms of Section 23(1) of Partition Law list of documents has to be filed

not less than 30 days before the date of trial.

2. When Section 23(1) is considered with Section 25(1), it is clear that the date

of trial is not necessarily the first date on which the case is fixed for trial but

would also include any date to which the trial is postponed.

3. As the additional list is filed on 18.12.1998, well before the next date of

trial, i.e.5.3.99, the documents could have accepted."

The aforesaid birth certificate of Missi Nona was listed in a list dated

13.05.1997. When the said birth certificate was rejected for the 2nd time

0""27.06.1997, it is clear that 30 days from the date of filing of the list has lapsed.

~ I'

On the other hand, it was the duty of the learned District Judge to investigate

the title of the parties involved. In this regard it is his duty to ascertain the

truth with regard to the stances taken by the parties. When P6 indicates that

Dayani is a child of Sudirikku Hennedige Podi Singho, the learned District Judge

should have considered whether it was desirable to grant leave to mark the

birth certificate in evidence. He should have noticed that P7 (the impugned

birth certificate) was a certified copy issued by the District Registrar's office.

As per Section 79 of the Evidence Ordinance the Court shall presume the

genuineness of such document if it is substantially in the form and purports to

be executed in the manner directed by law in that behalf.

Hence, it is my considered view that the learned District Judge should have

granted leave to mark the said birth certificate in the first instance. However,

6

it appears that the learned District Judge in his Judgment has considered the

said birth Certificate. He has stated that in the 2nd cage of the form, the name

is mentioned as Missi Nona and the name 'Dayani Matilda Jayawickrama' has

been inserted on a later occasion. The learned District Judge has further stated

that if there is a name change, it has to be mentioned in cage 12, but the cage

12 of P7 is left blank. It is brought to the notice of this court that the over leaf

of P7 contains the necessary details with regard to the name change even with

reference to the number of the District Court case which ordered the name

change of Missi Nona. It is obvious that such details cannot be inserted in the

small space provided in cage 12. The relevant clerk who attended to the

insertion of the amendment to P7 has not made a cross reference in cage 12,

but it is not a fault of the Plaintiff for him to be penalized. It is my considered

view that P7 is substantially in the form and purports to be executed in the

manner directed by law in that behalf.The learned District Judge should have

presumed the truth of P7 in favour of the Plaintiff. Furthermore, the Plaintiff

himself had stated while giving evidence that he knew aforesaid Missi nona

alias Dayani Jayawickrama as the daughter of said Sudirikku Hannadige Podi

Singho (vide page 136 and 137 of the brief). The 1st Defendant has not given

any evidence to refute this contention of the Plaintiff. It is clear from the

evidence of the representative of the 2nd Defendant that he knew nothing with

regard to the pedigree other than accepting the deeds that gave title to the pt

Defendant.

For the foregoing reasons, it is my considered view that the learned District

Judge should not have kept the 1/16 share unallotted but should have

allocated it to the Plaintiff. In fact, during the argument the 1st Defendant

7

conceded that the Plaintiff should be given the 1/16 share which is unallotted

in the impugned Judgment. (Please see paragraph 6 of the written submissions

of the pt Defendant dated 12.03.2012 and paragraph 22 of the written

submissions of the 1st Defendant dated 98.02.2017.)

The 2nd Defendant had not preferred any appeal against the Judgment but

almost after 10 years from the date of the petition of appeal tendered by the

Plaintiff, the lawyer for the 2nd Defendant has given a notice under Section

772(1) of the Civil Procedure Code on the following grounds,

1). The learned District Judge has misdirected himself in not answering issues

No.7 to 9, 11 to 19, 22 and 26 to 29.

2). The learned District Judge erred in answering issues No. 10, 20, 21, 23, 24,

25, 30, 31 and 32 against the 2nd Defendant.

3). The learned District judge erred in the allocation of shares in the manner as

set out in the Judgment.

I have already dealt above in this Judgment with regard to the allocation of shares

to the Plaintiff which may have some connection to the item 3 and issue No. 23

referred to in item 2 of the aforesaid notice given under Section 772(1). If there

was any dissatisfaction with regard to the allocation of shares to the 1st Defendant

or with regard to the parts of the Judgment that relates to the disputes between

1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant, the 2nd Defendant should have filed a direct

appeal against the Judgment. As per the decision in Doloswala Rubber & Tea

Estate Co. V. Swaris Appu 31 NLR 60, Section 772 of the Civil Procedure Code is

not available to a Respondent, who desires to question the decree in favour of

another Respondent. It has also been stated that an exception may be allowed in

cases where there is an identity of interest between the Appellant and the

8

Respondent against whom the statement of objection is directed. The Plaintiff

Appellant has preferred this appeal to get the unallotted portion allotted in his

favour. Even the lawyers for the 1st Defendant and 2nd Defendant had not asked

that 1/16th share to be allotted to their clients in their oral submissions at the end

of trial in the lower Court. Both the lawyers have moved to leave that 1/16th

share unallotted. Under such circumstances, I do not think that this application

under aforesaid notice fall within the exceptions contemplated in the aforesaid

decision of Doloswala Rubber & Tea Estate Co. Vs. Swaris Appu. In that backdrop,

it is my view that the 2nd Defendant cannot challenge the parts of the Judgment of

the learned District Judge which are in favour of the 1st Defendant by giving the

section 772(1) notice dated 31.07.2008. Furthermore, the brief indicates that;

1. The document which was not allowed to be marked as 251, which appears

to be the deed No.5 dated 19.04.1984, has not been submittedd to the lower

Court or this Court. (without the relevemt document being submitted for

perusal, this court cannot consider the argument presented on the validity of

the said pending partition deed.)

2. As per the evidence of the representative of the 2nd Defendant, he has

joined the 2nd Defendant company, which was established after the

institution of the Partition Action, only in august 1997. Therefore, he

cannot have any personal knowledge with regard to a trust created by an

agreement between the pt Respondent and any of the promoters who took

steps to establish the 2nd Defendant company. Therefore, without any

documentary proof, the witness of the 2nd Defendant was not capable of

establishing a trust that took place prior to his appointment to the 2nd

Defendant Company.

9

3. The witness of the 2nd Defendant has stated that 1st Defendant and the 2nd

Defendant entered in to an oral agreement after the commencement of the

District Court Partition Action to transfer the rights of the l stDefendant that

he was to get from the said action to the 2nd Defendant for 2 million

Rupees. He further has stated Rs 1100000.00 has been already paid and Rs.

900000.00 has to be paid on or before 15.01.1999. Furthermore, if the

balance Rs. 900000.00 is not paid, the 1st Defendant has to return

Rs.l000000.00, forfeiting Rs.l00000/- from the Rs.ll,OOOOO.OO already

paid. (vide page 157 of the brief). This piece of evidence shows that there

was no existing constructive trust with regard to the corpus, since the full

consideration was not paid even at the time of giving evidence. As per the

said oral agreement the date to pay the balance has fallen on a date that

came after the date of the Judgment and a considerable part of the

consideration has to be returned if the balance is not paid.

By moving to send this case back for re trial, the 2nd Defendant is trying to have a

second bite of the same cherry to cover up his failures in proving his case in the

lower Cou rt.

Hence, I dismiss the application made by tendering Section 772(1) notice by the

2nd Defendant with costs.

I allow the appeal by allocating the unallotted 1/16th share to the Plaintiff.

Subject to the amendment caused by the aforesaid allocation of 1/16th share to

the Plaintiff, the Judgment of the learned District Judge prevails.
