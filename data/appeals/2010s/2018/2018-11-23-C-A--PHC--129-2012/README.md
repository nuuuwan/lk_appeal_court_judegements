ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Respondent-Petitionel'-Appellant (hereinc:Jter referred to as the

"Appellant") has invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, seeking

to set aside an order dated 2nd February 2012, in case No. HCRA 86/2009

of the Provincial High Court holden in Colombo. In the said revision

application, the Appellant sought to set aside an ejectment order dated

22nd April 2009, issued by the Magistrate's Court of Colombo in case No.

67282/07, upon an application filed by the Applicant-Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the "Respondent") under Section 5

of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as amended.

This Court had issued notice on the Appellant through the fiscal of

the District Court of Colombo and it was reported that the said notice was

served on him on 04.07.2018. When this appeal was mentioned on

2

J Ii ,

25.07.2018, the Appellant was absent and unrepresented. However, this

Court fixed his appeal for hearing on 10.09.2018 and the parties were

directed to tender written submissions if any. On the date of the hearing of

the appeal also the Appellant was absent and unrepresented. Nonetheless,

this Court will consider his appeal.

In his petition of appeal, the Appellant contended that the Provincial

High Court had failed to consider the material available before it in his

favour. Further, he stated in the appeal that he was occupying the State

land upon an agreement of lease. He claimed that he could not tender the

said agreement before the Magistrate's Court due to the failure of the

Respondent to issue a copy. It is also claimed that the Appellant had

legitimate expectation to continue the occupation of the State land in

respect of which an order of ejectment was issued by the Magistrate's

Court.

It is claimed by the Appellant that he has operated a small shop

upon a rent agreement with the Colombo Municipal Council since 1989

and in 1990, he had put up a building with his own funding with the

approval of Colombo Municipal Council and continued to occupy it.

Thereafter, the Appellant and the Respondent have entered into an

agreement of rent on 01.09.1999.

With his letter dated 04.04.2007, the Respondent had informed the

Appellant regarding the termination of the said rent agreement and

directed him to hand over the vacant possession of the disputed premises

on or before 10.05.2007. The Respondent further informed the Appellant,

3

upon his failure to comply with the said direction would result In

initiating legal action to recover possession of the said premises.

Thereafter, the Respondent had issued quit notice on the Appellant

on 16.07.2007 and upon his failure to vacate the said premises, an

application is made seeking an order of ejectment from Court in case No.

67282/07.

At the inquiry before the Magistrate's Court these factors were

brought to the notice of Court by the Appellant. However, the Magistrate's

Court had issued the ejectment order on 22.04.2009.

When the Appellant sought to challenge the validity of the said

o~der of ejectment in HCRA 86/2009, the Provincial High Court dismissed

his petition as no exceptional circumstances were established to exercise its

revisionary jurisdiction.

The lease agreement was duly terminated by the Respondent with

prior notice to the Appellant. There was no challenge by the Appellant to

the termination of the said lease agreement. After the day on which the

lease agreement deemed terminated, the Respondent took steps to issue

quit notice and upon the Appellant's failure to handover vacant possession

of the disputed premises as per the said notice, an application was made to

the relevant Magistrate's Court, seeking his ejection under the provisions

of State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

The Respondent had therefore acted according to the applicable

statutory provisions and the Magistrate's Court had correctly issued the

order of ejectment upon the failure of the Appellant to satisfy Court that he

had a valid permit. Upon consideration of the material before the 4

, ..

Provincial High Court, it rightly concluded that there were no exceptional

circumstances disclosed in the Appellant's petition.

In view of the considerations that are referred to in the preceding

paragraphs, we are of the firm view that the appeal of the Appellant is

devoid of any merit.

We, accordingly make order dismissing the appeal of the Appellant

with costs fixed at Rs. 10,000.00.
