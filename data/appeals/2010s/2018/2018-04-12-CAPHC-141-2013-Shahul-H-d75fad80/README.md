JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

This Court after the argument of this case was concluded on

2015-09-01 had pronounced its judgment on 2015-11-20. The

said judgment has been pronounced by a bench comprising Her

Ladyships W M M Malini Gunerathne J and P R Walgama J. Their

Ladyships by the said judgment had set aside the impugned

, orders of the learned High Court Judge as well as the order of the

learned Magistrate and had proceeded to allow the appeal.

In-a leave to appeal application filed against the said judgment,

the Supreme Court by its order dated 2017-02-06 had remitted

this case back to this Court for certain clarifications with regard to

the judgment of this Court.

4

As has been directed by the Supreme Court, this Court proceeded

to hear the submissions of learned counsel for both parties before

making this order.

The clarification sought from this Court is whether this Court

decides the relief claimed in prayer (b) of the Petition of Appeal in

favour of the Appellant.

This Court is mindful that their ladyships who pronounced the

judgment dated 2015-11-20 no longer function as judges of this

Court and that this case has come up before the present bench

only to clarify some aspects of the judgment of this Court already

pronounced. This is pursuant to a direction by the Supreme

Court.

It has to borne in mind that it is not open for this bench to re-

decide this case on its facts. Its task is limited to clarify the issue

raised by the Supreme Court.

5

As has been stated before, the Supreme Court by its order dated

2017-02-06 in the application for special leave to appeal, filed by

the Appellant before the Supreme Court1 had directed to remit

this case back to this Court to clarify on prayer "b" of the petition

of appeal dated 2013-10-15 i.e. whether the Court of Appeal is

going to decide the said relief in favour of the Appe"ant or not or

whether the Court of Appeal has already decided (by making the

order "allow the appeal'') that a" the reliefs have been granted.

At the outset it is important to note that their ladyships of this

Court by the judgment dated 2015-11-20 have decided

conclusively,

_ i. that the Party of The 2nd Part - Responde,nt - Respondent

(hereinafter sometimes called and referred to in this order as

the Respondent) (Mohamed Mohamed Thamby) has never

been in possession of the disputed premises. This is clear

1 sc. SPL. LA. NO. 272 / 2015.

6

from the phrase" ... Therefore it is obvious that the

Respondent was never in possession of the disputed

premises ... " which appears in the second paragraph in page

7 of the said judgment.

II. that it is the Party of the 1st Part - Petitioner - Appellant

(hereinafter sometimes called and referred to, in this order

as the Appellant) (Shaul Hameed Mohomed Ruwais) who

has been in the possession of the disputed premises as at

the date of filing the information under section 66 (1) of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act No 44 of 1979 (hereinafter

referred to as the Act). This could be gathered from the

phrase " .. .In the above setting it is ostensible that at the

time the information was filed in terms of section 66 (1) of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the Petitioner - Appellant

has been in possession of the disputed premises ... " which

can be found in the third paragraph in page 7 of the said

judgment.

7

It is the view of this Court that this Court has to take into

consideration the prevailing law pertaining to the subject matter

under dispute when interpreting the judgment of this Court.

As has been mentioned above this Court by its judgment dated

2015-11-20 had decided that the Respondent has never been in

possession of the disputed premises. Perusal of the said judgment

shows clearly that it is only after that conclusion2 that this Court

had proceeded to arrive at the next conclusion, which is as

follows

" ... Therefore as per facts started herein before the only

conclusion the learned Magistrate was compelled to decide was

whether the Appellant was in possession of the premises in suit at

the time the information was filed in terms of section 66 (1) of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act ... "

2at Page 7 of the judgment.

8

This is in keeping with section 68 (1) of the Act which is as

follows,

Section. 68

(1) Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or

part thereof it shall be the duty of the Judge of the Primary

Court holding the inquiry to determine as to who was in

possession of the land or the part on the date of the filing of

the information under section 66 and make order as to who is

entitled to possession of such land or part thereof.

Having considered the provisions in section 68 of the Act, this

--Court is of th~ opinion that it had not been necessary for this --Court to make any determination as to whether any person who

had been in possession of the relevant premises has been forcibly

dispossessed within a period of two months immediately before

the date on which the information was filed under section 66, as

9

required by section 68 (3) of the Act. It is because of the finding

that the Respondent has never been in possession of this

premise. Therefore, a determination under section 68 (3) of the

Act does not simply arise.

Indeed this is in line with the consistent approach taken by this

Court in its previous judgments.

In this regard the following passage from a judgment of this

Court in the case of Punchi Nona V Padumasena and others3

would be relevant.

" ... Section 68 (1) of the Act is concerned with the determination

as to who was in possession of the land on the date of the filing

of the information t9 Court. Section 68 (3) becomes applieable

only if the Judge can come to a definite finding that some other

party had been forcibly dispossessed within a period of 2 months

next preceding the date on which the information was filed. . .. "

3 1994 (2) Sri. L R 117.

10

It is now time to turn to prayer "b" of the petition of appeal dated

2013-10-15, which is as follows,

(b) " ... to make order declaring the Appellant to be entitled to

the possession of the said shop No.18, Main Street,

Puttalam in terms of section 68 (1) and (2) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act and to make order to deliver

possession of the said shop to the Appellant by ejecting

the Respondent and all holding under him therefrom.

It is the conclusion arrived at by this Court by its judgment dated

2015-11-20 that it was the Appellant who has been in possession

of the impugned shop premises as at the date of filing

information in Court. This Court has also held that the

Respondent has never been in possession of the said premises.

This follows that the Appellant is entitled to possess the said shop

premises. Therefore, the possession of this shop must invariably

be delivered to the Appellant. If the Respondent has interfered

..

-~-~-~~-~-------------

11

with the peaceful possession of the Appellant such obstruction

must be cleared as has been required by section 68 (2) and (4) of

the Act which is as follows.

Section 68 (2)

An order under subsection (1) shall declare anyone or more

persons therein specified to be entitled to the possession of the

land or the part in the manner specified in such order untl'l such

person or persons are evicted there- from under an order or

decree of a competent coutt and prohibit all disturbance of such

possession otherwise than under the authority of such an order or

decree.

Section 68 (4)

An order under subsection (1) may contain in addition to the

declaration and prohibition referred to in subsection (2)/ a

direction that any party specified in the order shall be restored to

. j

12

the possession of the land or any part thereof specified in such

order.

In these circumstances the clarification that this Court can offer in

respect of the issues raised by the Supreme Court is that this

Court by making the order "allow the appeal" has granted the

prayer (b) of the petition of appeal dated 2013-10-15 also.
