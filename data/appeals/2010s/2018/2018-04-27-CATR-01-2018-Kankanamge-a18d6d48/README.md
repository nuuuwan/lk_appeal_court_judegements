Court heard the submissions of the learned President's Counsel in

support of his application. Court also heard the submissions of learned

State counsel who opposed this application. Learned President's

counsel on behalf of the Petitioners brought to the notice of this

court several instances where the learned High Court Judge has made

certain orders. It is his position that the cumulative effect of the said

3

orders would point to the fact that the accused petitioners will not be

afforded a fair and impartial trial before this particular High Court

Judge.

The first instance adverted to by the learned President's Counsel

relates to refusal of an application made by the learned counsel who

appeared for the accused petitioners for postponement of the trial on

the basis that he was not ready. When considering the dates on

which the indictment had been served and the date fixed for trial,

i

I l I i f

~ ,

f I I r

~ t r !

there is no justification for the accused petitioners not to be ready for I

trial on the date fixed for it. This court is of the view that it is the

duty of the accused petitioners to take all necessary steps to retain a

counsel who is able to appear for him on the date of tria\. The fact

that the learned High Court Judge had refused a postponement on

that basis does not indicate any bias on the part of the Judge.

Learned President's counsel for the Petitioners next brought to the

notice of this court that the accused petitioners had been placed in

remand by the learned High Court Judge. This court observes that it

was a temporary order and the accused petitioners had been placed

in remand pending the conclusion of the evidence of lay witnesses.

The accused petitioners have subsequently been released on bail as

soon as the recording of evidence of lay witnesses was concluded.

Therefore there is nothing turns out from that instance to support the

petitioners application.

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners also brought to the

notice of this court the order made by the learned High Court Judge

with regard to the custody of the information book which the

petitioner's counsel had wanted kept in courts custody. Even if that

order is to be termed as an inappropriate order, mere making an

\

\

i I f I! f I

IIf

inappropriate order by a Judge cannot be a ground by itself for a \

ltransfer of the whole case out of that court.

~

Learned President's counsel for the Petitioners also brought to the

notice of this court several other instances where the learned High

5

Court Judge had made certain orders. These orders are not illegal

orders as such. As pOinted out by the learned State Counsel in those

circumstances those grounds would at their highest be only grounds

for an appeal.

This court is mindful that this is an application for transfer and not

an application for revision. There is no basis for this court to come to a

conclusion that it should invoke the jurisdiction vested in it by virtue

of section 46 of the Judicature Act to transfer this case out of this

particular High Court.

Learned State Counsel brought to the notice of this court that

the evidence of all the lay witnesses have now been concluded. This

shows that this trial is at its tail - end. Learned State Counsel also

brought to the notice of this court that this trial pertains to an incident

of triple murder and robbery and the learned trial judge endeavours

to conclude the trial as soon as possible. This court is of the view that

such endeavours by Judges should not be interpreted as any bias on

I \

their part. This court is mindful of the struggle a judge has to engage

in to conclude a trial. In those circumstances, this court is of the

view that there is no merit in this application for transfer. Hence this

court decides to refuse to issue notices on the Respondents. The

application must stand dismissed.
