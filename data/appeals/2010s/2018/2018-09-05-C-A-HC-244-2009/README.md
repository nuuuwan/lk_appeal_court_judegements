****************

ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The 1st to 3rd Accused Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted along with four others by the Hon. Attorney

General for the murder of one Kulasinghe Liyanage Sugatapala alias Sugath

Liyanage on 17th August 1994 before the High Court of Kurunegala, and for

causing mischief to his house.

Initially all the accused opted for a trial by jury and on 2nd July 2009,

they informed Court that they elect to be tried a Judge, without a jury.

The trial Court, with the pronouncement of its judgment on 8th

September 2009, acquitted all accused from the two counts of mischief and

proceeded to convict the three appellants for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd counts. It

2

acquitted the other four accused from these three charges. The three

Appellants were sentenced to death in relation to 2nd and 3rd counts. An

imprisonment of 6 months was also imposed on them on account of the 1st

count.

In challenging the validity of the said judgment and sentences, the

Appellants primarily claimed that the trial Court had fallen into grave

error when it acted on the already disbelieved evidence of the two eye

witnesses; in violation of the principle of evidence known as falsus in uno

falsus in omnibus.

The case presented by the prosecution is that the deceased, who was

residing in Walaswewa, had bought a house in an area called

Siyambalagaswetiya. Witness Dhanasena provided first information to

Kobeigane Police in the night of 17.08.1994 that the house of his brother (the

deceased) at Siyambalagaswetiya is under attack by a group of people. He

did not witness the attack on the house but complained to police on his

brother's request to do so. He is not a witness to the fatal attack on the

deceased, which took place sometime after his police complaint.

It was the day on which an election was held. A curfew was

imposed in the area by the Government after the polling was over, to

maintain peace.

Witness Roshan Manjula, one of the two eye witnesses presented by

the prosecution, stated in his evidence that he saw several accused,

including the appellants, have caused damage to Siyambalagaswetiya house.

Thereafter he joined with the deceased at Walaswewa. Upon hearing that

the Police has arrived at the damaged house to investigate the complaint,

3

the witness had accompanied the deceased with the other eye witness to

Siyambalagaswetiya house. On their way, the deceased was attacked by the

appellants in the company of other accused. The 1st appellant has attacked

the deceased on his head with a sword while the 2nd appellant attacked

him with a bottle. The 3rd appellant also had attacked the deceased with a

club and the witness identified the sword (Pl), the bottle filled with sand

(P2) and the club (P3) in Court. He identified the assailants by moonlight

and, in addition, with the aid of an electric torch.

During the cross examination of witness Roshan Manjula, several

omissions were highlighted. These omi~sions are mainly in relation to his

failure to mention the names of any of the seven accused as the persons

responsible for causing damage to Siyambalagaswetiya house in his

statement to Police and that he failed to state that he in fact had witnessed

the act of mischief.

Having considered the evidence placed before it, the trial Court

concluded that the prosecution has failed to establish the two counts of

mischief against all accused beyond reasonable doubt and proceeded to

acquit them of these two counts.

In his lengthy oral and written submissions, learned Counsel for the

appellants, stressed the point that the trial Court has "disbelieved" the

evidence of eye witnesses to the incident, in respect of one charge, but had

erroneously convicted the appellants on a capital offence, based on already

rejected evidence. He relied on the principle as per the maxim falsus in uno

falsus in omnibus, as laid down in the judgment The Queen v ]ulis 65 N.L.R.

505. He emphasised that in the absence of any 1/ compelling reason" to

4

accept the testimony of a witness who was shown to have given false

evidence on a material point, the trial Court has erroneously convicted the

Appellants.

Learned Senior DSG for the Attorney General sought to counter this

submissions by referring to the judgment of Samaraweera v The Attorney

General (1990) 1 Sri L.R. 256 has overruled this position.

Learned Counsel for the Appellants, claimed that the said judgment

has not been overruled by the judgment of Samaraweera v The Attorney

General (ibid) as The Queen v Julis (ibid) was decided by three judges of

the Supreme Court.

Thus, it is clear that the learned Counsel for the Appellants, made

his submissions on this primary ground of appeal based on the premise

that the trial Court has U disbelieved" a segment of the evidence of witness

Roshan Manjula and since there was no compelling reason for it to accept

balance part of his evidence as true, in order to convict the appellants, it

had fallen into error.

In view of these submissions, it is relevant to consider as to the basis

on which the trial Court entered an acquittal of all accused in relation to

the two counts of mischief.

Upon perusal of the judgment of the trial Court, it becomes clear as

to the reason why it acquitted all accused form the said two counts. In this

context it is also relevant to note that the learned High Court Judge who

delivered the judgment is the presiding Judge when witnesses Roshan

Manjula and Premaratne gave evidence and has therefore had the

opportunity of observing their demeanour and deportment.

5

In the narration of evidence, learned High Court Judge has

reproduced all the omissions marked off Roshan Manjula's and Premaratne's

evidence. This is indicative of the fact that the learned High Court Judge

was mindful of the challenge mounted on the truthfulness and reliability

of the evidence of Roshan Manjula and Premaratne by the accused, in

determining their testimonial trustworthiness. Then, in his analysis of the

evidence in relation to the two counts of mischief from the testimony of

Roshan Manjula, learned High Court Judge clearly holds (at p. 694) that the

inconsistency from his statement to police that he only "heard" that

Siyambalagaswetiya house was under attack, taken in conjunction with the -several omissions in relation to the lack of direct reference to any of the

seven accused, the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt and therefore the two charges of causing mischief fails

against all accused.

It is evident from the wording used in the judgment that the learned

High Court Judge has not" disbelieved" his evidence as the Appellants

claim but had merely opted not to rely on that part of his evidence. Its

relevant to remind here that the prosecution must prove its case to the

required degree of proof by placing both truthful and reliable evidence.

Clearly this is an instance where the evidence presented by the

prosecution through witness Roshan Manjula failed to satisfy the reliability

component and not the truthfulness component of the said requirement.

Therefore, it is our view that the learned High Court Judge has considered

the contradictions and omissions marked on the evidence of the two

witnesses in its correct perspective and decided in favour of the accused as

the evidence implicating them of causing mischief is unsafe to act upon.

6

~"~~~.,. ~ k~};3:;.4@J~L~t~JIPf

This proposition is supported by the fact that immediately after the

said conclusion, leanled High Court Judge considers the submissions

placed before him by the accused as to the inconsistencies, in the light of

judicial precedence which lay down the applicable principles on evidence.

The appellants as well as other accused have, in their submissions before

the trial Court, referred to the inconsistencies inter se and per se and

omissions in relation to the evidence of two eye-witnesses to the incident.

In dealing with the omissions it was held in Banda and Others v Attorney

General (1999) 3 Sri L.R. 168, that "omissions do not stand in the same position

as contradiction and discrepancies. Thus, the rule in regard to consistency and

inconsistency is not strictly applicable to omissions".

Then the learned High Court Judge arrived at the conclusion that it

was the three appellants who caused the death of the deceased as per the

evidence of the witnesses Roshan Manjula and Premaratne. Learned High

Court Judge was also mindful of the animosity that existed between the

appellants and the investigating officer Siyambalapitiya due to an

application filed before the Supreme Court alleging violation of

fundamental rights but was convinced as to the truthfulness and reliability

of the testimony of the two eye witnesses, despite the perceived partiality

of the police officer in favour of the prosecution.

In convicting only the three appellants out of seven accused, learned

High Court Judge was satisfied that there was an unlawful assembly and

in pursuance of the common object of that unlawful assembly they have

committed murder of the deceased and thereby committed an offence

punishable under Section 296 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code. If

the evidence of the eye witnesses is "disbelieved" by the learned High

7

. 51- t ":~.~ .--.~-'-C

Court Judge as the Appellants claim, then he had no basis to convict the

appellants under the said count as there was no truthful and reliable

evidence to prove there were five or more persons forming an unlawful

assembly to which the three Appellants were also members.

The acceptance of the evidence of Roshan Manjula and Premaratne as

truthful and reliable, is a question of fact. As already noted, learned High

Court Judge had the distinct advantage of observing their demeanour and

deportment in assessing the testimonial trustworthiness of the witnesses.

The trial Court, aided itself with the principle laid down in

Bandaranaike v Jagathsena (1984) 2 Sri L.R. 397 where it was held;

"When versions of two witnesses do not agree the trial Judge

has to consider whether the discrepancy is due to dishonesty or

to defective memory or whether the witness's power of

observation were limited. In weighing the evidence the trial

Judge must take into consideration the demeanour of the

witness in the witness box."

Witness Roshan Manjula, when confronted by the accused in cross

examination that he is a liar, boldly admitted that he had forgotten some

details of the incident but remembers some. He gave evidence 15 years

after the incident. In Sunil v Attorney General(1999) 3 Sri L.R. 191, it was

re-emphasised the relevancy of the principle that 1/ the Court must not be

unmindful of the fact they are human witnesses and it is hallmark of human

testimony that such evidence is replete with mistakes, inaccuracies and

misstatements." The Court further added that 1/ , the witness should not be

disbelieved on account of trivial discrepancies especially where it is established

that there is substantial reproduction in the testimony of the witness in relation to

8

his evidence is before the Magistrate or the sesszons Court and that minor

variation in language used by witness should not justify total rejection of his

evidence."

We have carefully perused the evidence of the witnesses. In relation

to Roshan Manjula the accused have marked several omissions and few

contradictions. It must be noted that almost all these inconsistencies and

omissions were in relation to the mischief charges. Except for two

omissions, there were no inconsistencies marked off his evidence in

relation to the attack on the deceased. It is almost the same position with

witness Premaratne. The two inconsistencies that were marked off his

evidence in relation to the attack on th~ deceased are on the sequence of

the events. No inconsistency exists which has the character of making a

dent of his credibility. The evidence of the two witnesses, when considered

in its entirety, are not tainted with any defect which /I ~do not go to the root

of the matter and shake the basic version of the witnesses" as per of cited

judgment of Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v State of Gujarat.

In Attorney General v Theresa (2011) 2 Sri L.R.292, adopting a Privy

Council judgment, Tilakawardane J, thought it fit to reiterate the principle

that;

" appellate Court should not ordinarily interfere with the trial Courts

opinion as to the credibility of a witness as the trial Judge alone knows the

demeanour of the witness; he alone can appreciate the manner in which

the questions are answered whether with honest candour or with doubtful

plausibility and whether after careful thought or with reckless glibness

and he alone can form a reliable opinion as to whether the witness has

emerged with credit from cross examination."

9

In view of the above considerations, it is our considered view that

the primary ground of appeal, as urged by the Appellants fails.

The Appellants have raised an ancillary ground of appeal, on the

basis that the trial Court has erroneously considered the contents of the

police statements and the depositions and had "borrowed" material from

these two sources to convict them. This error committed by the trial Court,

according to the appellants, is fatal to their conviction. The appellants have

relied upon the dicta of the judgment of King v Namasivayam 49 N.L.R.

289 and another unreported judgment of this Court in C.A. 9/2010 C.A.M.

of 25.09.2014, in support of their contention, where it was held that the -treatment of the contents of statements and depositions as "substantive

evidence" was illegal and inadmissible.

This complaint against the judgment of the trial Court is based upon

a solitary stC;ltement contained in the judgment (at p. 695 ) where the

learned High Court Judge has stated when the evidence of witness

Premaratne is "weighed" (l5dcmw ) by comparison with his statement to

police and evidence before the Hettipola Magistrate's Court; what remains

is after the attack on the deceased by the three appellants, out of several

sword blows dealt by the 1st appellant, one blow has struck the head of the

deceased. This statement is found in the segment of the judgment where

the trial Court has considered the evidence of the witness to determine its

truthfulness and reliability. This exercise undertaken by the trial Court

was a necessary step in evaluation of Premaratne's evidence for its

credibility.

10

It must be noted that in the process of evaluation of evidence,

contrary to the claim of the appellant, the trial Court has not "borrowed"

material from the statement or deposition and treated them as substantive

evidence when it arrived at the conclusion to convict the appellants. In

Banda and Others v Attorney General (supra), Jayasuriya J cited from the

judgment of Queen v Mutu Banda 73 N.L.R. 8, where it was held that;

" . .. the Judge who has the use of the information book, ought to

use this book to elicit any material and prove any flagrant

omissions behveen the testimony of the witness at the trial and his

police statement in the discharge of his judicial duty and

functions in terms of Section ~22(3) of the Criminal Procedure

Code."

In relation to the depositions of witnesses, the position is identical as

in King v Mudalihamy 42 N.L.R. 103, it has been held by the Court of

Criminal Appeal'that " .. . it was proper for the Judge to examine the extent of

such inconsistency by reference to the whole of their depositions."

It is thus clear that the learned High Court Judge was merely

fulfilling his judicial duty when he referred to the statement and

depositions in evaluating the witnesses evidence before him. This ground

of appeal is therefore necessarily fails.

The appellants also claim that the failure of the prosecution to

explain the injuries suffered by some of the accused challenged the validity

of the conviction. The appellants cited a judgment of the Indian Supreme

Court in support of this position.

11

/

In the judgment of the trial Court, this aspect of evidence has been

dealt with in relation to its explanation by the accused. The 1st appellant

had a laceration above his left ear while the 3rd appellant had five

abrasions on the back of his chest, and shoulder. 2nd appellant also had a

contusion on his forehead.

The prosecution witnesses have admitted that some of the accused

appeared to have suffered injuries when produced in Court. It is the

evidence of Roshan Manjula and Premaratne that they had only an electric

torch when the accused have mounted the attack on the deceased.

According to them, they had no role to play in the attack and were mere -, spectators to it. This attempt by the Appellant to create an impression that

the prosecution has deliberately concealed a part of the sequence of events,

should bound to fail as it is improbable for the two eye witnesses to

proceed to Siyambalagaswetiya house in the company of the deceased

armed, to meet up with the police party that had arrived there to

investigate the act of mischief.

The seven accused were arrested by IP Siyambalapitiya on the same

evening, approximately five hundred meters from Siyambalagaswetiya

house, whilst walking along Pubbiliya Road, shouting. The lstAppellant

had a sword in his hand while the 2nd Appellant had a wooden club. The

4th accused had a bottle filled with sand. They were arrested initially for

violating curfew and at the time of arrest they appeared to be under the

influence of alcohol. The Appellants did not cross examine the two eye

witnesses on the basis that they have caused those injuries to the accused

nor did they suggest that it was the deceased who caused those injuries. IP

Siyambalapitiya in his cross examination negated the suggestion of the 12

appellant that there was a fight among two factions. When questioned

whether he enquired from them about the injuries, his answer was that

due to their high level of intoxication it was not possible to obtain

information from the accused as the injuries. Interestingly, the Appellants

opted not to suggest that there was a fight among the two factions to any

of the eye witnesses during otherwise lengthy cross examination. In

addition, it must be noted that the prosecution claimed that the Appellants

were arrested after an act of mischief and an act of fatal attack on the

deceased. They were arrested more than an hour later.

The appellants have relied on Jhe judgment of The Queen v Santin

Singho 65 N.L.R. 445, before the trial Court that they need not explain their

injuries.

Considering the evidence presented by the prosecution before the

trial Court, we would prefer to follow the reasoning of the local precedent

of the Court of Criminal Appeal judgment in The King v Appuhamy et al

46 N.L.R. 570 where it was observed by the Court that;

" ... the evidence for the prosecution in this case showed that the

accused have assaulted a number of persons in succession and

they may have received their injuries after the attack on the

deceased, and even if the deceased struck some blows on the third

and fourth accused, the possibility that it was after he was

attacked was not excluded. We do not think it is possible to draw

any inference in this case from the fact that the third and the

fourth accused had injuries, in the absence of evidence to explain

these injuries; they have a bearing on the special defences set up

by the accused, .. , II

13

Lastly, the appellants contended that the trial Court has failed to

consider their culpability for a lesser offence. In the judgment, the trial

Court has considered in detail as to the establishment of elements of the

offence of murder, particularly that of the presence of murderous

intention. The Appellants have relied on the judgments of

Wickramanayake v The Queen 73 N.L.R. 273 and Kumarasinghe v The

State 77 N.L.R. 217 in support of their contention.

The trial Court, having observed that the deceased has suffered a

total of 19 injuries out of which the cut injury inflicted by a sword on his

head, termed as necessarily fataL injury, establishes the fact that the

Appellants, with persons unknown to the prosecution, have caused his

death with murderous intention.

In fact the medical evidence revealed that there were five injuries to

the deceased's head. Four of theOm were termed by the medical witness as

contusions caused by blunt trauma resulting in with fractures in the skull.

There was a cut injury on the head and the cut has extended to the brain

matter. In view of these five injuries, the medical witness was of the

opinion that each of these injuries taken individually are fatal in the

ordinary course of nature while their cumulative effect would result in a

very high probability of death. He further estimated that the death of the

deceased could have occurred within an hour of sustaining these injuries.

It is relevant to consider the circumstances under which the

deceased was attacked by the Appellants and others. There was a curfew

imposed by the Government on account of the election, the cultivation

and the house of the deceased was damaged by a mob, the accused was

14

waylaid by the appellants and others. The appellants were among several

others who were arrested by the police whilst walking along a public

road. The 1st appellant had a sword and other appellants were armed with

bottle and a club. They appeared to be intoxicated.

The question raised by the Appellants that whether the trial Court

ought to have considered the possibility of convicting the appellants to a

lesser offence should be considered in the light of these items of evidence.

A similar consideration has already received attention of this Court.

In Farook v Attorney General (2006) 3 Sri L.R. 174, this Court in

determining the scope of limb three.to Section 294 of the Penal Code cited

the following dicta from the judgment of Indian Supreme Court in Anda v

State of Rajasthan AIR 1966 SC 148;

" . .. the emphasis in the third clause is on the sufficiency of the

injury in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. TJie

sufficiency is the high probability of death in the ordinary way of

nature and when this exists, and death ensues and if the causing

of the injury is intended, the offence is murder. 1/

When the medical evidence is considered in the light of this dicta, it

is clear that all the requirements as per this judgment had been satisfied

and the trial Court has correctly convicted the appellants for the offence of

murder. The Appellants, except for the instance of suggestion to the

investigating officer that this was an altercation between two factions,

placed no material before the trial Court that would attract the

consideration of any of the exceptions contained in Section 294 of the Penal

Code.

15

I

Learned Senior DSG contended that Section 105 of the Evidence

Ordinance imposes a burden on the appellants of "proving the existence of

circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the

Penal Code ... ". When the trial Court ruled that the Appellants have a case

to answer, they opted to exercise their right to silence. In The King v

Podimahatmaya 46 N.L.R. 31, the Court of Criminal Appeal noted that in

order to discharge this burden, the accused could " ... adduce some

material in support of it either by way of evidence led by him, or by way of

matters elicited from the witnesses for the Crown, or by way of some

circumstances clearly pointing ... " to such an exception.

The appellants have relied on tne judgments of Wickramanayake v

The Queen 73 N.L.R. 273 and Kumarasinghe v The State 77 N.L.R. 217. In

Wickramanayake v The Queen, the appellate Court interfered with the

conviction purely on ~e basis that there was absolutely no direction t~ the

jury as to the alternative verdict of culpable homicide. The instant appeal is

in relation to a trial before a Judge. In Wickramanayake v The Queen, the

Court of Criminal Appeal altered the verdict on the basis that there was no

distinction made in the summing up of the trial Judge between the

concepts of "knowledge" and "murderous intention" which had the effect

of a possibility of convicting to a lesser offence "virtually withdrawn from

the jury". This is not the position in the instant appeal.

It would have been helpful if the trial Court, indicated its mind in

much clearer terms than it did in the judgment. However, in view of the

evidence placed before the trial Court and the reasoning of the judgment,

we are of the considered view that it has reached a legally tenable

conclusion in convicting the Appellants for murder as there is ample 16

I

evidence to conclude that the Appellants have acted in furtherance of

common object of the unlawful assembly and shared a common murderous

intention.

Accordingly the conviction and sentences of the High Court of

Kurunegala are hereby affirmed by this Court.

The appeal of the 1st to 3rdAppellants is dismissed.
