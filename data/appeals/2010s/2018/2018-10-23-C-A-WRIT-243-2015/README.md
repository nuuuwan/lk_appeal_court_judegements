Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Dr. Sunil Cooray with Sudarshani Cooray for the

Petitioner.

Uditha Egalahewa with S. Rajamuni for the 1st, 2nd,

4th and 5th Respondents.

Decided on: 17.10.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner filed this application basically seeking a writ of

mandamus against the 1st and 2nd Respondents to immediately

give effect to the transfer made by the 3rd Respondentthe

Commissioner of Ayurveda and the 5th Respondentthe

Secretary to the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine, transferring

the Petitioner from the Anamaduwa Ayurvedic Central

Dispensary to the Madampe Ayurvedic Central Dispensary.

Whilst the case was pending, the transfer has been effected.

Hence learned Presidents Counsel for the Respondents submits

that the application shall be dismissed on futility. Learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner insists to look into the

question whether the refusal to carry out the petitioners

transfer by the 1st Respondentthe Provincial Commissioner of

Ayurveda of the North Western Province and the 2nd

Respondentthe Chief Secretary of the North Western Provincial

Council was arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, ultra vires,

erroneous and contrary to law and if it does, to award costs.

The Petitioner does not now seek for damages, although he has

pleaded so in the petition.

I do not think that this Court shall necessarily dismiss the

application on futility merely because the relief has been granted

pending determination of the actioneven after filing objections

to the petitioners application. The Petitioner made repeated

requests to effect the transfer from the 1st Respondent, but he

refused to do so by giving various reasons, compelling the

Petitioner to file this application. It is at the later stage of the

case, the said relief has been granted, may be on legal advice. If

not for the filing of this application, the transfer would not have

4

been effected. If the refusal on the part of the 1st and 2nd

Respondents to give effect to the transfer made by the 3rd and 5th

Respondents is arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, ultra vires,

erroneous and contrary to law, the Court shall make a finding

to that effect and award costs of the action at least to send a

message to the other public officers not be swayed by

extraneous factors in discharging their professional duties.

In Sundarkaran v. Bharathi [1989] 1 Sri LR 46 the main relief

sought by the Petitioner-Appellant from the Supreme Court was

to quash by way of certiorari the determination of the 1st

Respondent not to renew the Petitioner-Appellants licence for

the year 1987. The Judgment of Supreme Court was

pronounced in November 1988. However, Justice Amerasinghe

on behalf of the Supreme Court at page 62 concluded thus:

I do not believe that this Court will be acting in vain or that

quashing the determination of the 1st Respondent not to

renew the Petitioner-Appellant's licences for the year 1987

and requiring that the Petitioner-Appellant be fully and

fairly heard before a decision with regard to any future

applications for licences are made, will be only a useless

formality.

For the reasons I have given I set aside the judgment of the

Court of Appeal, quash the decision of the Respondents and

make order that the Respondents-Respondents do hear and

determine according to law i.e. make due inquiry upon its

merits any application for a licence to sell liquor by the

Petitioner-Appellant may hereafter make.

5

I order that a sum of Rs. 2100 be paid to the Petitioner-

Appellant as costs of the proceedings before the Court of

Appeal and this Court.

In Nimalasiri v. Divisional Secretary, Galewela [2003] 3 Sri LR 85

at 88 Justice Sripavan (later Chief Justice) in the Court of

Appeal followed the above Judgment in quashing a decision by

certiorari relevant to a period which had already expired.

There is no evidence to the satisfaction of the Court to grant any

relief against the 2nd Respondent.

Let me now go into the merits of the matter.

The Petitioner is an Ayurvedic Doctor who is a member of the Sri

Lanka Ayurvedic Medical Service in the Department of Ayurveda

under the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine of the

Government of Sri Lanka. After serving for three years in the

North Central Province, the Petitioner has applied for annual

transfers by P4 dated 31.08.2010 wherein he has sought a

transfer to the Madampe Central Ayurvedic Dispensary of the

North Western Province and two other hospitals of the same

Province.

Then the Commissioner of Ayurveda has transferred him to the

Anamaduwa Central Ayurvedic Dispensary of the North Western

Province and the same has been informed to the Petitioner by

the Provincial Commissioner of Ayurveda of the North Central

Province by P5 dated 27.03.2012.

Thereafter the Provincial Commissioner of Ayurveda of the North

Western Province by P6 dated 29.03.2012 has attached the

6

Petitioner to the Anamaduwa Central Ayurvedic Dispensary with

immediate effect.

The Petitioner by P7 dated 04.08.2013 has informed the

Commissioner of Ayurveda that he was unjustifiably not given

the transfer to the Madampe Central Ayurvedic Dispensary on

the basis that there were no vacancies whereas some others got

transfers to the said hospital.

He has again applied for an Annual Transfer for 2014 by P8

seeking the transfer to the Madampe Central Ayurvedic

Dispensary.

Thereafter by P9 dated 02.12.2013 the Secretary to the Ministry

of Indigenous Medicine has transferred the Petitioner to the

Madampe Central Ayurvedic Dispensary effective from October

2014.

The Commissioner of Ayurveda by P11 dated 20.08.2014

informed the Provincial Commissioner of Ayurveda of the North

Western Province to give effect to the said transfer from

04.10.2014 as doctor Ayesha Bee Bee who worked in the

Madampe Central Ayurvedic Dispensary was to retire on

04.10.2014.

As it has not happened, the Petitioner has written P12 dated

03.11.2014 to the Provincial Commissioner of Ayurveda of the

North Western Province; and then the Provincial Commissioner

of Ayurveda of the North Western Province, referring to the

aforesaid P11, has informed the Petitioner by P13 dated

28.11.2014 that until another doctor is attached to Anamaduwa

Central Ayurvedic Dispensary, the Petitioner cannot be released

to take up duties at the Madampe Central Ayurvedic Dispensary.

7

On the other hand, the 1st Respondent, by R1 dated 11.06.2015

has informed the 2nd Respondent with a copy to the 3rd

Respondent that the Petitioner could not be released to the

Madampe Central Ayurvedic Dispensary upon the retirement of

doctor Ayesha Bee Bee on 04.10.2014, because there were

excess doctors in the Madampe Central Ayurvedic Dispensary

even after the said retirement.

It is clear that the 1st Respondent had been giving various

contradictory reasons not to give effect to the transfer.

Thereafter the Petitioner has sent P14 to the Provincial

Commissioner of Ayurveda of the North Western Province

emphasizing the unreasonableness with which the said officer

was handling this matter.

Then by P15 dated 10.12.2014 the 3rd Respondent-

Commissioner of Ayurveda has also emphasized the

unreasonableness of the 1st Respondent by not giving effect to

the transfer of the Petitioner to the Madampe Central Ayurvedic

Dispensary. The 3rd Respondent in that letter has questioned

the contradictory positions taken up by the 1st Respondent, on

the one hand, by informing the Petitioner by P13 dated

28.11.2014 that the Petitioner cannot be released until a

replacement is sent, and, on the other, by informing the 3rd

Respondent by letter dated 01.07.2014 that there are above 22

excess Ayurvedic doctors in the North Western Province. Then

the 3rd Respondent has asked the 1st Respondent to

(immediately) release the Petitioner to take up duties at the

Madampe Central Ayurvedic Dispensary attaching temporarily

one of the said 22 excess doctors, until a permanent doctor is

sent on annual transfers (in a few days time).

8

P15 reads as follows:

. . . 2014.12.01 .

02. 01/03/20 2013.12.04 2014 2014.10.04 , 02/02/10/02/2014 2014.08.20 .

02. ///08// 2014.11.28 2014.10.04 , .

03. 2015 2014.12.31 /06 2014.07.01 2014.10.04 . 22 .

04. 2015 22 . (emphasis added)

The 1st Respondent has neither replied nor complied with the

said direction.

9

It was held in City Motor Transport Co. Ltd. v. Wijesinghe (1961)

63 NLR 156 that a public officer may legitimately be regarded as

having refused to do his duty if he withholds a direct answer to a

letter requesting him to perform the duty.

It is interesting to note that the 1st Respondent in paragraph 14

of his statement of objections, has admitted that his statement

that there were 22 excess doctors in the Province was incorrect.

Paragraph 14 of his statement of objections reads as follows:

Answering the averments contained in paragraph 16 of the

said affidavit, the Respondents state that though the said

letter marked P15 states that there are 22 additional

doctors in the Department it is not correct situation within

Province.

It is none other than the 1st Respondent himself who has

informed the 3rd Respondent by letter dated 01.07.2014 that

there were over 22 excess Ayurvedic doctors in the North

Western Province.

Thereafter the 3rd Respondent by P16 dated 10.03.2015 has

transferred another doctor to the Anamaduwa Central Ayurvedic

Dispensary effective from 01.04.2015 and stated that the

Petitioner shall take up duties at the Madampe Central

Ayurvedic Dispensary (at least by 01.04.2015) according to the

2014 Annual Transfer already made.

As this too has not happened by 01.04.2015, the Petitioner has

through an Attorney-at-Law sent P17 dated 10.04.2015 to the

1st Respondent demanding to effect the transfer within two

weeks and also stating that if he failed to do it, the Petitioner

10

would invoke the writ jurisdiction to compel the 1st Respondent

to do it.

Then by P19 dated 21.04.2015 again the 3rd Respondent has

informed the 1st Respondent to effect the transfer immediately as

there is absolutely no reason to withhold it.

It is in this backdrop, the Petitioner has filed this application on

05.06.2015 seeking the above relief.

It is abundantly clear that the refusal of the 1st Respondent not

to give effect to the transfer of the Petitioner to the Madampe

Central Ayurvedic Dispensary is arbitrary, capricious and

unreasonable.

The 1st Respondent does not dispute the above factual matters.

He is on technical objections. His main, if not sole, defence or

explanation before this Court why he did not give effect to the

transfer is that:

In terms of section 32 of the Provincial Councils Act, No.42

of 1987 read with List 1 of Ninth Schedule to the

Constitution, the appointment, transfer, promotion,

dismissal and disciplinary control of officers of the

Provincial Public Service of each of Province is vested with

the Governor of that Province. The Governor of the North

Western Province has delegated such powers in terms of

section 32(2) to the Provincial Public Service Commission,

(and therefore) only the Provincial Public Service

Commission of the North Western Province which has the

power to transfer the Petitioner within the Province.

(paragraphs 6 and 7 of the objections)

11

The Petitioner has tendered a number of documents to say that

the appointment, transfer, promotion, dismissal and disciplinary

control of the Petitioner or rather the Sri Lanka Indigenous

Medical Service to which the Petitioner falls into is an All Island

Service and therefore not coming under the Provincial Public

Service Commission but under the Sri Lanka Public Service

Commission.

I have no doubt to hold with the Petitioner on the point that the

appointment, transfer, promotion, dismissal and disciplinary

control of the Petitioner or rather of the Ayurvedic Doctors of the

Sri Lanka Indigenous Medical Service to which the Petitioner

falls into is an All Island Service and therefore not coming under

the Provincial Public Service Commission but under the Sri

Lanka Public Service Commission.

In any event, the 1st Respondent refused to give effect to the

petitioners transfer made by the Secretary to the Ministry of

Indigenous Medicine and also by the Commissioner of Ayurveda

not on the basis that the said orders came from the wrong

Authority and therefore he was not bound to follow, but on

different grounds which are contradictory to each other. It was

never the position of the 1st Respondent at that time that the 3rd

and 5th Respondents did not have power to transfer the

petitioner.

I reject the argument of the Petitioner that the necessary parties

are not before Court. The Secretary to the Provincial Public

Service Commission is a party. There is no necessity to make

the Public Service Commission a party.

12

For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that the refusal of the 1st

Respondent not to give effect to the transfer of the Petitioner to

the Madampe Central Ayurvedic Dispensary was arbitrary,

capricious and unreasonable, and accordingly pro forma issue

the mandamus as prayed for in paragraph (b) of the prayer to

the petition (notwithstanding the relief sought by the Petitioner

has now been granted).

The Petitioner is entitled to recover incurred costs of this

application from the 1st Respondent.
