The Accused pleaded guilty to the charge and the learned Magistrate imposed a fine of~. 25000/-. Thereafter, a claim inquiry was held with regard to the confiscation of the lorry. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Magistrate confiscated the lorry bearing No. 42-4601. Being aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner sought to revise the same in the High Court of A vissawella, where the said revision application was dismissed.

It is claimed that the accused driver could not identify one variety from another, as he was engaged in another business and therefore he was not familiar with the business. The stock of jack timber was not the stock that the appellant had ordered from the supplier and it had been loaded to the lorry by mistake on the part of the timber depot. The Appellant denied total knowledge of the transportation of timber. The Learned Trial Judge made an order rejecting the claim of the appellant on the ground that the said timber had been transported with the knowledge of the appellant.",
