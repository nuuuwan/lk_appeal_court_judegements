The Plaintiff-Respondent in this case, instituted an action

----~-------ift-fhe__1}istriet-Cotlrt ofKandybearingCase-No.-P 11310 on 5th July

1984 to partition the land called "Bulugahapitiya Watta" which is in

extent of 3 Pela among five co-owners. In that case the 1st and 2nd

------------------~------ ---Defendants filed their answers on 5th June 1989. The 3rd Defendant

filed his answer on 13th January,1986. The 5th Defendant filed his

answer on 17th September, 1995 and the 6th Defendant filed his

answer on 6th March,1995 respectively. After triat having analyzed

the evidence and the documents, the learned District Judge had

delivered the judgment on 08.02.1996 and the interlocutory decree

was entered accordingly.

Thereafter, the 4th Defendant -Appellant filed a petition

with an affidavit on 28th May, 1997 and moved Court to set aside the

judgment dated 08th February,1996 in the partition action bearing

No.11310jP. His position was that summons or any notice were

!l_~t_~~rved on him and therefore, the Plaintiff has not followed the

procedure laid down in Section 48(4) of the Partition Law.

Accordingly, the inquiry was fixed for 22.07.1998 and the

4th Defendant gave evidence and stated that he did not receive

summons. In his evidence, he stated that he was 90 years old (at

know the surveyor surveyed the questioned land. It's at page 102 of

the Brief and reads as-follows:--

After inquiry, the learned District Judge having

carefully considered the evidence and documents placed before

him, had observed that according to the journal entry No.13, dated

17.06.1985 tne summenswere--se-FVea- en- the 3rd, 4th and the 5th

Defendants but, the 4th defendant did not appear before Court.

Accordingly, the District Judge made order on 17.11.1999 refusing the

---------appl-ieatie-R-e-f-tfle---4ili-I)e-fenElant-and-affirming-the-j-uagment--aatea----- ----

08.02.1996.

Being aggrieved by the said order dated 17.11.1999 this

appeal was filed by the 4th Defendant-Appellant praying to set aside

the judgment of the learned District Judge dated 08.02.1996.

The 4th Defendant's position right throughout the case

was that summons was not served on him, and therefore, the

Plaintiff has not followed the proper procedure laid down in Section

48(4) of the Partition Law.

The Plaintiff-Respondent took up a preliminary objection

as that the order made by the District Court in respect of an

application made under Section 48(4)(a) is not a judgment within

the meaning of Section 754(1) and 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code

for the purpose of an appeal but it is an order within the meaning of

,~ ! .

7

Section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code which an appeal may be

preferred with the leave of the Court of Appeal.

In Ranjith V Kusumawatlt.i~ th~~_upreme Court has held

~~ ~ that int~~locutorL~~cree is noL finaLand_the o~~~~ of the District

Court is not a judgment within the meaning of Sectin754(1 ) & 754(5)

QLtb-~ Ci~il ProcedureCode for the pur129se of an a12-2eal.

in Salter Rex Vs. Gosh LoraDenntng statea :-

"if their decision whichever 'lDay it is given, will if it stands

finally dispose ofma!tetJ!!_~isputel I thinkifu1tjor the purpose

of these Rules it is final. On the other hand, if their decision, if

given in one way, will finally dispose of the matter in dispu te,

but, if given in the other, will allow the action to go on then I

think it is not finat but interlocutory."

The 4th Defendant-Appellant's position is that the order

dated 17.11.1999 rejecting his petition dated 28.05.1997 was a final

order and it affects his rights completely. But according to the

-judgment of the learned District Judge dated 08.02.1996 the 4th

Defendant has to get 15/60 share of the questioned land and a Vz

share of the building marked as "R" in the plaint. The written

submissions filed by the 4th Defendant in the District Court, it was

referred to as an application under Section 48(4)(a)(i) of the Partition

8

Law. And also according to the journal entry No.13 dated 17.06.1985,

the summons were issued on the 3rd, 4th and the 5th respondents.

In Sivanandan v. Sinnapillai - NLR- 300 of 77[1974] , it is stated:

"Where, in a partition action, a claimant (not being a party to

the action) is mentioned in the Surveyor's report, the Court has _____ ~power to dispense with the service of notice on the person

who is alleged to be a claimant. In such a case, the notice is

imperative under Section 22(1) of the Partition Act and the

prOVIswns of Sections 77 and 79 should be observed and

Section 356 of the Civil Procedure Code followed in serving the

notice. Where these Sections have not been strictly followed,

the Supreme Court has power to set aside, in revision the

Interlocutory Decree entered in the absence of the claimant,

more especially if no declaration under Section 12 of the

Partition Act has been filed by the plaintiff."

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere

witfithe judgment of the learned District Judge. Therefore, the

appeal is dismissed with cost.
