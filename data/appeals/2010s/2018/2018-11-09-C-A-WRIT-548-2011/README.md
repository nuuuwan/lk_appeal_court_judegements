Decided On : 02.11.2018

E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, J.

The Petitioner, by his application dated 11.08.2011, has sought a writ of Mandamus

to compel the pt Respondent to pay the petitioner a sum of Rs.291,220,424/- as

per the award marked 'P20' with the Petition, which was made in respect of the

acquisition of a land belonged to the Petitioner's late husband. It must be noted

that the acquisition per se has not been challenged by the Petitioner and thus, the

scope of this action is limited to the non-payment of the compensation due in

respect of 15 Acres out of 22 Acres acquired by the pt Respondent Acquiring

Officer.

Facts in brief.

1. In 1980, the Wellampitiya Estate of about 22 acres, which belonged to the

Petitioner's late husband, was acquired under Section 38(a) of the Land

Acquisition Act. Compensation for seven acres out of the said 22 acres were

paid. This action relates to the compensation awarded in respect of the

balance, which was 15 acres in extent.

2. Since there was no inquiry for the payment of compensation for the

aforesaid 15 acres, in 1991 the Petitioner's late husband instituted CA.

Writ/1031/1991 in this Court seeking a writ of Mandamus against the

acquiring officer to publish Section 7 notice under the Land Acquisition Act.

Accordingly, an order was made in 1992 to publish the Section 7 Notice as

prayed for in that application. This shows that even to prefer a claim with

regard to the aforesaid 15 acres, the claimant had to wait for 12 years from

2

I I I I

j j

~

the acquisition of the relevant land and to file an application to get the

necessary notice published as per the requirements of law.

3. Pursuant to the aforementioned Section 7 notice being published, the

inquiry under section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act was commenced, but

being dissatisfied with the manner in which the inquiry was conducted, the

Petitioner's late husband instituted the Fundamental Rights Application No.

S.C/FR/207/1994 in the Supreme Court. Even though the leave to proceed

was granted and interim order was issued stating that the valuation should

not be less than Rs. 155 ,000,00 per perch for the said land (vide P6), since

there was no award with regard to the compensation to be given for the land

acquired, said application was dismissed (vide P7) stating that granting of the

reliefs sought would amount to an unwarranted interference with the

statutory process under the Land Acquisition Act. Hence, the aforesaid

Fundamental Rights Application was dismissed as it was a misconceived

application. However, the aforesaid interim order marked P6 indicates that

the Supreme Court considered Rs.155000.00 per perch as the minimum limit

in deciding the market value suggested by the material before it and the

Counsel too have agreed to issuing an interim order on that basis.

4. It appears that another writ application no. 1225/2000 was filed by the late

husband of the Petitioner to get the Section 9 inquiry under the Land

Acquisition Act resumed. As per the Judgment delivered in the said CA.

Application 1225/2000 marked as P12, an initial payment of Rs. 32,150.000/-

seems to have been paid to the claimant as a result of contempt papers filed

in CA. application No. 1031/1991. The said judgment marked as P12 further

indicates that the Respondents had produced a letter dated 28.10.1999 to

3

this court during the above application no. 1225/2000 to show that an award

was made on 04.06. 1997. If there was any award made on 04.06.1997, the

Respondents or their predecessors in office might have misled the Supreme

Court in the aforesaid Fundamental Rights Application since it was dismissed

on the basis that there was no award made. On the other hand, if there was

no such award made on 04.06.1997, 1st Respondent or their predecessors in

office had attempted to mislead this Court by producing the said letter to

this court during CA. Application on 1225/2000 to indicate that there was an

award made on 04.06.1997. However, this Court in the said application No.

0. wo.",.l 1225/2000 has decided that there was no such t I made on 04.06.1997

and even if there was such an award it has no effect or validity in law (Vide P

12) for the following reasons;

a) It has been made at a time when there was a stay order restraining the

acquiring officer from making such award.

b) The acquiring officer had mechanically adopted the Chief Valuer's

assessment without making any attempt to form an independent opinion

about the compensation to be awarded.

5. The Judgment marked P12 states that the said action 1225/2000 had been

filed by the claimant praying for a writ of Mandamus to direct the acquiring

officer to resume the inquiry under section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act to

decide the compensation payable to the claimant in respect of the land

acquired as mentioned before and to make an award. P12 further indicates

that the Petitioner in that action who was the original claimant and the

husband of the Petitioner in this case died before the conclusion of that

4

proceedings and the Petitioner of this case was substituted for him.

However, this Court by P12 had directed the acquiring officer,

a. To resume the inquiry and,

b. To make an award in terms of section 17(1) of the Land Acquisition Act

and that the award shall not be based on Urban Development Law and,

c. To give notice to the Petitioner as required by section 17(1) of the said

Act when an award is made.

6. There is also a finding in the said judgment marked as P12 that the payment

of Rs.32,150,000/= was not a payment in full and final settlement but only

an initial payment pending the final determination of the Petitioner's claim.

7. Pursuant to the Judgment marked as P12, the compensation inquiry was

resumed. The acquiring officer by the document marked as P15 made an

award determining the compensation as Rs. 34A95A27.00 but the

Petitioner challenged the said award by filing Writ Application No.

C.A/Writ/364/2003 seeking to quash the said award and to resume the

inquiry. This Court, by the Judgment dated 15.10.2003 marked as P17,

quashed the said award marked P15 and directed the acquiring officer to

proceed with the compensation inquiry de novo. It appears that this court

was of the view that the acquiring officer in making the award marked P15

was in breach of the rules of natural justice and unable to give a fair hearing-

vide P 17.

8. Therefore, another inquiry was held and an award dated 19.01.2010 marked

as P20 was made by the 1st Respondent. As per the said award the total

compensation was determined at Rs. 323,370A24.00 and after deducting

the initial payment already made as mentioned before in this Judgment, the

5

compensation due to be paid to the Petitioner is Rs.291,220A24,00. This

amount was not paid to the Petitioner and the non-payment of this amount

is the subject matter of this application. However, as per the award made 0.. s~"W\ e>%-

Rs.14,844,879.00 has to be paid from the aforesaid Rs.291,220A24.00 to the ,...

Inland Revenue Department.

9. This Court observes that the land was acquired in 1980. All the applications

except the Fundamental Rights application, filed by the late husband of the

Petitioner (Original Claimant) or the Petitioner were decided in favour of the

Petitioner or the Original Claimant. Those decisions or Judgements were not

challenged by the Respondents in the apex court of the country. P20, which

is the award in issue of this application was not challenged by any functionary

of the State in a Court of law till this application was filed in August 201l.

10. The Petitioner by P21 has informed the pt Respondent that she would not

prefer any appeal to the board of review.

As elaborated above, now there is an award (P20) made by the acquiring officer

made under section 17 of the Land acquisition Act after an inquiry held under

section 9 of the said act. It is clear that there is no appeal made against it to the

Board of Review. Furthermore, there is no material placed before this court to show

that there is any writ application pending against the said award to quash the said

award. Under such circumstances there is a duty upon the 1st Respondent acquiring

officer to tender the amount of compensation to the person entitled to it. If the

person entitled to it consent to receive it, the pt Respondent acquiring officer's

duty is to pay that amount to the person entitled to the compensation awarded_

(Vide section 29 of the Land Acquisition act). By P21 the petitioner as the person

entitled to the compensation awarded has consented to receive the amount. There

6

is no dispute that the petitioner is not the person entitled to the compensation

after the death of her husband. Thus, on the face of the facts placed before this

court by the petitioner, she is entitled to the compensation awarded to her by the

1st Respondent and it is the duty ofthe pt Respondent to pay that to the petitioner.

In this backdrop, I have to consider the objections raised by the Respondents to the

application of the Petitioner.

Analysis

One of the grounds relied upon by the respondents is that the Petitioner has

failed to add necessary parties and therefore, this application cannot be

maintained (Vide paragraph 2 of the statement of objections dated 28th September

2012). It must be noted that in the aforesaid statement of objections, nothing was

mentioned as to who should be added and the reasons for such a need other

than stating that the money had not been made available to him and his duty is

limited to the making of an award. However, after the filing of counter objections

by the Petitioner, the Respondents have filed a statement of further objections

with two affidavits marked as A and B from the Chief Valuer and the Secretary to

the Ministry of Lands annexed to it. In that statement of further objections, it is

stated that the Ministry of Lands was of the view that the award is not valid in Law

since the inquiry was flawed (vide paragraph 13 of the aforesaid further objection

dated 20.12.2012). The Chief Valuer's affidavit was given in support of his

valuation. It appears that the original valuation of the Chief Valuer was there even

at the time of the judgement of CA 1225/2000 was delivered, where it was held

that the acquiring officer mechanically had adopted the valuation of the Chief

Valuer without making any attempt to form an independent opinion. This court

further observes that the award rejected by the judgment in CA 364/2003 was

7

based on an enhanced value of the same valuation referred to in the aforesaid Chief

Valuer's affidavit (Vide paragraph 6 of the affidavit of the Secretary to the Ministry

of Lands marked as B). Though the said rejection and the order for a fresh inquiry

in CA 364/2003 was due to the breach of the rules of natural justice, following

observation made by His lordship Justice Udalagama in that judgment would have

naturally contributed to the said conclusion.

(Quote)

"I am inclined to the view that when property rights of a subject are infringed by

compulsory acquisition, compensation must be adequate, realistic and reasonable.

Perusing the documentation available in particular the orders of the Supreme Court

and the valuation reports as tendered by the petitioner, I am also inclined to the

view that the pt respondent's conduct runs contrary to even the Wendsbury Rules

of fairness". (Unquote)

The aforementioned paragraph quoted from the said judgment indicates that His

Lordship Justice Udalagama who delivered the said judgment was not satisfied with

the award based on the enhanced value of the valuation of the Chief Valuer.

However, the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands in his affidavit marked as B states

that the acquiring officer has not considered the opinion of the Chief Valuer (Vide

paragraph 8 of his affidavit). The Secretary to the Ministry of Lands, while referring

to the order 256 and 259 of the land manual, further states in his affidavit that

when the divisional secretary is unable to obtain the consent of the Chief Valuer to

uplift the valuation, he is bound to make the award in accordance with the Chief

Valuer's valuation. This is the same mischief that His lordship justice Gamini

Amaratunga attended and commented on the application no. 1225/2000 with

regard to the same acquisition. There his lordship clearly pointed out that the duty

8

to make an award is given by law to the acquiring officer and he has to form his

own opinion with the assistance of the Chief Valuer's report. When a duty is cast

upon the acquiring officer by the legislature to form an opinion and make an award

any regulation passed by any other authority compelling the acquiring officer to

accept the Chief Valuer's valuation cannot be considered as valid. The Secretary to

the Ministry of Lands has further stated in his affidavit that the Ministry of Lands

will inform the relevant authorities to take disciplinary action with regard to the

relevant divisional secretary who seems to be the pt Respondent. At this juncture,

it is questionable whether the appearance of the Learned Deputy Solicitor General

for the pt Respondent is ethically correct due to the following reasons;

i) The award in issue in this application is an award made by the 1st

Respondent and in the guise of a statement of further objections by him,

he has been advised to tender affidavits that challenge the validity or

correctness of his own award. By this he is denied of his right to defend

his award and show reasons as to the correctness or legality of his award.

The court is also hindered from getting relevant facts independently from

the 1st Respondent as he has apparently been advised to present the

stance of officers of the State who can take or instruct to take disciplinary

action against him.

ii) When a disciplinary inquiry commences, the pt Respondent will have to

admit that he presented facts or affidavits against his own award in a

court of law which is directly against the interests of the pt Respondent.

In the written submissions filed on behalf of the 1st Respondent it is stated that

Honourable Attorney general has no role to playas this is a writ application and,

however, Honourable Attorney General appears as the counsel for the pt

9

Respondent. It is questionable whether a counsel can act against the best interests

of his client. On the other hand, the Honourable Attorney General being the leader

of the Bar and the highest legal officer of the State has a duty to the court, to the

State and to the Subject to be wholly detached, wholly independent and act

impartially with the sole object of establishing the truth {vide Land Reform

Commission V Grand Central Limited (1981) lSLR 2S0}. In that backdrop, if the

Attorney General was not satisfied with the correctness and legality of the award

made by the 1st Respondent, it would have been more appropriate if he

represented the State which had the benefit of the relevant acquisition and which

would be badly affected by so called over payment of compensation, without

appearing for the pt Respondent who might have conflicting interests with the

stance taken through the statement of further objections most probably on the

advice of the Attorney General's Department. Quite contrastingly, the letter

marked as P28 with the counter objections indicates that the Secretary to the

Ministry of Lands was advised by the Attorney General's department to take steps

to pay since the acquiring officer is the one who is empowered to determine

compensation according to the Land Acquisition Act. Yet, it appears that the 1st

Respondent has been advised to present the stance ofthe Secretary of the Ministry

of Lands than defending his own award. However, this court observes that even

though he annexed the affidavit of the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands to his

statement of further objections the pt Respondent has never admitted in his

affidavit that he did not consider the valuation prepared by the Chief Valuer or that

his assessment of compensation is wrong or excessive. The stance taken by the

Secretary to the Ministry of Lands stating that the acquiring officer is bound to

accept the valuation of the Chief Valuer in accordance with the regulations in the

10

Land Manual cannot be accepted as it is against the intention of the legislature,

which gives the power of decision making with regard to the award to the acquiring

officer through the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. This court also observes

that stance is contrary to the previous judgments delivered in applications CA Writ

No.1225/2000 and CA Writ No.364/2003.

However, after filing the Statement of Objections and Statement of further

Objections in the aforesaid manner, during the argument and in the written

submissions filed on behalf of the Respondents, the learned counsel for the

Respondents have stated that this application is misconceived in law as the

Secretary to the Ministry of Lands and the Chief Valuer have not been made parties

to the application. As mentioned before, even in the Statement of Objections there

is an objection stating that necessary parties have not been made parties, but

without naming whom to be added and giving clear reasons for the need of such

parties other than stating that the money was not made available and the 1st

Respondent's duty is confined to the making of the award.

I am not inclined to accept this argument that the Secretary to the Ministry of

Lands and the Chief Valuer are necessary parties to this application. It is the

acquiring officer who acquired the land and held the inquiry as per the provisions

of the Land Acquisition act. As mentioned before, it is his duty to tender the award

and pay compensation to the person entitled to it when that person consents to

receive it-(vide section 29 of the Land Acquisition Act). It is up to the acquiring

officer to get the money released as the law nominates him as the officer who shall

pay the compensation as per the award. If there is any difficulty in getting the

necessary funds released from another department or officer of the State, the

Petitioner may not have the knowledge with regard to the relevant officers or

11

,

f i ,

department or the facts and reasons for such difficulty. The Petitioner cannot be

expected to go on a voyage of discovery to find the internal mechanisms of

releasing money within and between different organs of the State. Issues relating

to the internal arrangements to release the money shall not be a matter of concern

to the Petitioner to take steps to solve or ask relief from a court of law to solve

them. If the Secretary to the Ministry of Land abstains from releasing funds to pay

the compensation when there is a final award made by the 1st Respondent, he is in

breach of his duty towards the acquiring officer and not to the Petitioner as such.

There is no direct nexus between the Petitioner and the Secretary to the Ministry

of Lands. In the same manner, there is no duty towards the Petitioner that has to

be done by the Chief Valuer. At this juncture, I would like to quote from page 520,

Administrative Law-11th edition by H.W.R. Wade & C.F. Forsyth.

(Quote)

({Like the other prerogative remedies, it is normally granted on the application

of a private litigant, though it may equally well be used by one public

authority against the other" (unquote)

Hence, if there was any difficulty in getting the funds from the relevant authority,

there was a remedy for the 1st Respondent. He could have filed an application

praying for a writ of Mandamus. Thus, the 1st Respondent's statement that money

has not been made available to him for payment (Vide paragraph 22 of the

Statement of Objections of the 1st respondent) is not a tenable reason for not

paying the compensation. Furthermore the 1st Respondent has stated in his

statement of objections that he was advised to state that his statutory duty is

limited to the making of an award but as elaborated before it is his duty to tender

12

the award to the person entitled to the payment and when that person consents

to receive it, to pay the compensation (Vide Section 29 ofthe Land Acquisition Act).

Therefore, aforesaid advice is an incorrect advice only fashioned to support the

position that necessary parties are not made parties to the application. As per the

decisions in Rawaya Publishers v Wijedasa Rajapaksha and other (2001) 3 SLR 213

and Dominic Vs Ministry of Lands and Others (2010) 2 SLR 398, in the context of a

writ application, a necessary party is one without whom no order can be effectively

made. In the case at hand, it is the duty of the acquiring officer to pay the

compensation. If he faces any difficulties, it is his task to get them solved through

administrative or legal remedies. The petitioner cannot be burdened with solving

internal issues between different officers or organs of the State when there is no

direct duty towards the petitioner cast upon them by the relevant Act. In the case

of B. Wijerathne, Commissioner of Motor Traffic V Venerable Dr. Paragoda (2011)

02 SLR 258, it was held that a necessary party to an application for a writ of

Mandamus is the officer or authority who has 'the power vested by law to perform

the act or duty sought to be enforced by the writ of Manda mus. All persons who

would be affected by the issue of Mandamus also shall be made Respondents to

the application'. With regard to the present application, it is the acquiring officer

who is vested with powers and duties to hold an inquiry and pay the compensation

by law and no one else. The Secretary to the Ministry of Lands is not a person

affected by the Writ of Mandamus to the knowledge of the Petitioner if the writ

was issued as prayed for by the Petitioner. In the eyes of the Petitioner, if he knows

that the money has to be released by the said Secretary, the said secretary has only

an administrative function within the departments of the State to release the

money to pay compensation. If anyone else to be affected, it is the State which has

13

to pay from its coffers and, in that respect, the Honourable Attorney General has

been made a party to the application. On the other hand, acquiring officer who

made the award is an officer of the State who made the award on behalf of the

State as per the powers given by the Act.

No material is placed before this court to show that the Secretary to the Ministry

of Lands has any lawful authority to assess and decide the correctness or legality of

the award made by the pt Respondent on his own and stop releasing the money

needed for the payment of compensation. If the award made by the pt Respondent

is ultra vires or tainted with irregularities and affects the duties cast upon him or

the funds ofthe State that he manages according to the materials the said secretary

had, the said Secretary to the Ministry of Lands could have filed an application in

this court to get it quashed, but without doing that he seems to have arbitrarily

stopped the releasing of money needed to pay the compensation. Furthermore, it

appears that he has presented his stance through an affidavit annexed to the 1st

Respondent's statement of further objections in a manner prejudicial to the best

interests of the pt Respondent.

The 1st Respondent cannot be allowed to challenge his own decision and the

Secretary to the Ministry of Lands or the Chief Valuer should not be allowed to

challenge the award through the 1st Respondent when they themselves have

evaded from filing an application to get the award quashed if there is any

irregularity or illegality. This court further observe that there is no prayer to quash

the award in the statement of objections or statement of further objections.

There is no allegation of fraud or collusion between the Petitioner and the pt

Respondent. Though it is alleged that the valuation is excessive, the Respondents

14

{

I I !

have not shown any acceptable ground to establish that the compensation

awarded is excessive, but as per the award the actual compensation computed for

the 15 acres is only Rs.323, 370,424.00 (vide P20). Thus, the value of a perch has

been taken as Rs.134, 737.69 which is less than Rs.155, 000.00 which amount was

considered as the minimum limit for the market value suggested by the material

before it by the Supreme Court during the aforesaid Fundamental Rights

application (vide P6). No material is placed by the Respondents to show that there

is a serious irregularity in computing the value of the land acquired other than

stating through the affidavit of the Secretary to the Ministry of Land that the pt

I"~ Respondent is bound to follow the Chief Valuer's valuation or he failed to consider

Chief Valuer's valuation in making the award. This court observes that twice the

awards based on Chief Valuer's valuation were challenged in this court and they

were rejected due to irregularities and illegalities mentioned in the relevant

judgments (Vide P12 and P17). The pt Respondent as mentioned before is not

bound to accept the Chief Valuer's valuation as the value of the land. He can come

to his own findings with the assistance of the Chief Valuer's valuation. The 1st

Respondent has not stated that he did not consider the Chief Valuer's valuation. As

mentioned before, the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands or any other officer has

not filed any application to quash the award relating to this application on alleged

irregularities. In that backdrop, this court cannot come to a conclusion that the

award relevant to this application made by the proper authority is tainted with

irregularities or illegalities.

This court observes that the acquisition of the relevant land was done in 1980.No

steps were taken by the acquiring officer to hold an inquiry to pay compensation

until the original claimant filed an application No.CA1031/1991 to get the section

7 notice published. Even though there were inquiries and awards, due to

irregularities and illegalities in conducting them by the relevant officers, the original

claimant or the Petitioner had to seek reliefs from the court. After the award

relevant to this application was made, the petitioner had to come to this court to

get it enforced since the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands or some other officer in

that Ministry without seeking legal remedy, decided on his own, without any

authority to do so, that the award is flawed and abstained from releasing money to

pay the compensation. This conduct of the Secretary to the Ministry of Land has to

be condemned, as there was a clear direction in CA No.364/2003, made after

considering the undue delay of payment for 24 years, to conclude the inquiry within

2months.This court further observe that By P28 in 2012, the Attorney General's

department has informed him the legal position and asked him to pay the

compensation. Now it has taken almost 38 years from the acquisition. The original

claimant, the husband of the Petitioner died without getting compensation for his

property acquired by the State. As per the contents of letter 8.2.2012, marked P28,

even the Petitioner was 80 years of age at the date of that letter. Non-payment of

compensation for about 38 years would have caused immense hardship to the

Petitioner and her family. The relevant functionaries of the State must be sensitive

not to delay the payments, and at least, to avoid the harm caused being continued

to the next generation of the Petitioner.

Conclusion

I do not see any merits in the objections filed by the Respondents. I am satisfied

that all the necessary parties are before this court. The award in issue was made by

the proper authority and there is no appeal lying against it and no application has

16

I

been filed to quash it. More than a reasonable time has passed from the date of

award. The State was enriched by the acquisition done in 1980 but the original

claimant, the husband of the Petitioner and the Petitioner were deprived of their

property rights for about 38 years due to the failure of the Acquiring Officer to pay

the compensation as per the duty cast upon him by the Land Acquisition Act.

Hence, I grant relief as prayed for by the prayer (b) of the Petition dated 11.08

2011 by issuing a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to pay the

Petitioner a sum of Rupees 291,220,424.00 as per the award marked P20 together

with the interest as per the said award.

I think it is more than reasonable to grant costs as prayed for by the prayer (c) to

the petition due to the unwarranted delay caused by arbitrary conduct of refusing

to release money to pay compensation by an officer of the State.
