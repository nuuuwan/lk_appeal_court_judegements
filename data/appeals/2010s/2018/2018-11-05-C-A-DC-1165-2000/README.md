Substituted 2nd Defendant-

Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Kamal Dissanayake for the Plaintiff-Appellant.

Anura Gunaratne for the Substituted 2nd

Defendant-Respondents.

Decided on: 01.11.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Galle

naming two defendants to partition the land described in the

schedule to the plaint between him and his brother, who has

been named as the 1st defendant, in equal shares. The 2nd

defendant, according to the plaint, has no title whatsoever to the

land. The 2nd defendant in her statement of claim unfolded a

pedigree, which is not in total harmony with that of the plaintiff,

and claimed undivided share of the land, with the balance

share to be equally divided between the plaintiff and the 1st

defendant.

At the trial, the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant gave evidence.

Having considered the evidence led at the trial, the learned

District Judge, who saw and heard both of them giving evidence,

accepted the pedigree of the 2nd defendant as the more probable

one, and entered the Judgment accordingly.

3

It is against this Judgment dated 10.02.2000 the plaintiff has

preferred this appeal.

According to the plaintiff, the original owner of the land is

Bastian. The learned District Judge has disbelieved that

assertion inter alia by making reference to the plaintiffs first

Deed marked P1, which in my view, is correct. According to P1,

Bastian has got title only to an undivided 7/24 share of the land

and not to the whole land. In terms of paragraph 7 of the plaint,

the balance 17/24 share of Bastian has devolved on Baby and

Emalishamy. The plaintiff either in the plaint or in evidence

does not state how Bastian became entitled to the balance

17/24 share.

Then in paragraph 8 of the plaint, the plaintiff states that the

aforesaid Baby gifted her rights to the plaintiff and the 1st

defendant by the Deed marked at the trial P5 dated 30.09.1994.

Admittedly, the 2nd defendant is in possession of the land. So do

the plaintiff and the 1st defendantvide the Preliminary Plan and

its Report marked X and X1 respectively.

It is the position of the plaintiff, as seen from paragraph 12 of

the plaint, that the 2nd defendant came into possession of the

land with the leave and licence of her mother, and later the 2nd

defendant got a Deed dated 26.01.1994 executed in her favour

from the aforesaid Baby, but no title passes from that Deed to

the 2nd defendant. This Deed was marked at the trial as 2V1.

I cannot understand on what basis the plaintiff says that no title

passes on that Deed. The Deed 2V1 has been executed and

registered before the Deed P1 and therefore gets priority over P1.

4

The fact that the 2nd defendant came into possession of this land

with the leave and licence of the plaintiffs mother was never

proved except ipse dixit of the plaintiff.

In his evidence, the plaintiff says that the 2nd defendant came as

such in or around 1975.1 The action has been filed in 1994.

The plaintiff during the cross-examination has accepted that

Baby had a brother named Alwis2 who was in occupation of this

land even when he was born in 1950.3

It is the position put forward by the 2nd defendant during the

cross-examination that the 2nd defendant came to the house

Alwis was in occupation and bought Babys rights by the afore-

mentioned Deed marked 2V14, which was denied by the plaintiff.

As the learned District Judge has correctly pointed out in the

Judgment, the plaintiff in cross-examination has accepted the

pedigree of the 2nd defendant.5

The pivotal argument of the learned counsel for the appellant is

that when the learned District Judge has accepted the plaintiffs

first Deed marked P1, it is inconsistent to accept the pedigree of

the 2nd defendant. I cannot bring myself to accept that

argument, as I understand, the learned District Judge has

referred to the Deed P1 in the Judgment, to defeat the argument

of the plaintiff that Bastian is the sole original owner of the land

and not for any other purpose.

Against the evidence led at the trial, the learned trial Judge

cannot be found fault with, on balance of probability, to have

accepted the version of the 2nd defendant than that of the

plaintiff as to the pedigree.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
