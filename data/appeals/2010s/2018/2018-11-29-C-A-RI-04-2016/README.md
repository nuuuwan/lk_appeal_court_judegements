Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Respondent.

Nuwan Bopage for the 3rd/10th Defendant-

Respondent.

Decided on: 26.11.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The two petitioners filed this application for revision and/or

restitutio in integrum seeking to set aside the Judgment entered

about 20 years ago, and the Interlocutory Decree and the

amended Interlocutory Decree entered thereafter.

This is a partition action. The petitioners in paragraph 22 of

their petition and paragraph 23 of their affidavit stated that: We

specifically state that we and/or our predecessors were not made

parties to the action.

This is the only point the learned counsel for the petitioners

stressed when successfully supporting the application ex parte

for notice and stay of proceedings of the District Courtvide the

Journal Entry of this Court dated 25.04.2016. This stay order is

still in operation.

This fact was proved by the plaintiff to be a falsehood, who said

that the grandmother of the 1st petitioner and the mother of the

2nd petitioner was the 9th defendant of the partition action.

3

This was later accepted by the petitioners, who in their written

submissions stated that: Further they (the respondents) took up

the position that as the petitioners parents were parties to the

action, the petitioners are not entitled to prefer the present action

as instituted. It is respectfully submitted that the petitioners by

their petition have clearly demonstrated as to why their parents

did not participate at the trial. That means, the petitioners now

accept that their parents were parties to the action, but they did

not participate in the trial.

This (the fact that the petitioners or their predecessors were not

parties to the case) is a blatant suppression of a very material

fact, which warrants dismissal of this application in limine

without going into the merits.

There is no necessity to overstate the utmost importance of

being truthful to Court when invoking the discretionary

jurisdiction of the Court by way of revision, restitutio in integrum,

writ etc. If it is later found that the applicant was lacking in

uberrima fides (utmost good faith) when he successfully

supported the application ex parte, and if there is anything like

deception practiced on the Court, the Court ought not to go into the

merits of the case, but simply sayWe will not listen to your

application because of what you have done.1

In that backdrop, even though there is absolutely no necessity to

go into the merits of the matter, I will nevertheless briefly

1 Collettes Ltd v. Commissioner of Labour [1989] 2 Sri LR 6 at 17 per Gunawardana J. citing Lord Cozens-Hardy M.R. in King v. The General Commissioner of the Purpose of the Income Tax Acts for the District of Kensington-ex parte Princes Edmond de Poignac (1917) KBD 486

4

consider the merits of the application to convince that the

petitioners cannot succeed on merits as well.

The petitioners complaint is that the land to be partitioned has

not been correctly identified and therefore the plaintiffs action

shall fail. This is the point which the 3rd to 10th defendant-

appellants took in the appeal preferred against the Judgment of

the District Court. This argument was rejected by this Court by

the Judgment dated 18.07.2008. The Special Leave to Appeal

sought against that Judgment was also refused by the Supreme

Court by order dated 08.02.2010.

Once the appeal of the 9th defendant (together with that of the

other appellants) was so rejected, her daughters cannot

challenge the same Judgment on the same point by way of an

application in revision. That is plain law. If that is allowed,

there will not be an end to litigation.

The petitioners also challenge the amended Interlocutory Decree.

The Preliminary Plan is Plan No.211. This has been marked as

X1 through the evidence of the surveyor. Thereafter the same

surveyor, upon an inquiry from the Court, has sent another Plan

of the same number, without changing the boundary lines and

the extent, but only amending or rather adding the names of the

boundaries to tally with those of the land described in the plaint.

This second Plan has been marked as X3 through the evidence

of the surveyor. There is no dispute that the premises No.

158/2A & C claimed by the petitioners fall within the

Preliminary Plan from the very beginning. After the Judgments

of the aforesaid Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court cases, I

5

see nothing wrong in amending the Interlocutory Decree in

reference to the Plan X3 for clarity. Amendment of the

Interlocutory Decree to fall in line with the Judgment (in its

proper context) is permissible.2 It shall be borne in mind that

The entering of the decree is a purely ministerial act and the

Interlocutory Decree when entered relates back to the date of

judgment.3

Finally, the petitioner was not before Court at any stage of the

proceedings before judgment, restitutio in integrum will not lie.4

Restitutio in integrum is available only to a party to the action.

Application is dismissed with costs.
