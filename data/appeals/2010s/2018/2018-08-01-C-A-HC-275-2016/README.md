ACHALA WENGAPPUIJ I.

The accused-appellant was indicted before the High Court of

Colombo for the commission of offences punishable under Section 54A(b)

and 54A( d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as

amended, in respect of 16.19 grams of Heroin. After trial, he was convicted

by the High Court only on the count under Section 54A(d) and was

accordingly sentenced to death.

The prosecution case is that the accused-appellant was arrested by

Sub Inspector of Police, Ruwan Kun1ara (PWl) of the Police Narcotic

Bureau, on 22.11.2012 at about 9.30 p.111. at Kosgas Handiya upon

information provided to PC 73162 Dinesh (PVv2) by one of his private

informants. The information revealed that a foreign national would carry

out a Heroin deal. Thereafter, PWI mobilized a team of officers to conduct

a raid. The private informant has met the officers at the car park of the

Suleinlan Hospital and instructed, them to await his call. When the

informant contacted the officers after some time, PWI and PW 2 proceeded

to Kosgas Handiya in a three-wheeler, at which point the accused- appellant

"vas pointed out by tlle informant. The accused-appellanf held three

/I tablets" in his trouser pocket, in the size of large jack fruit seeds at the

time of his arrest.

The accused-appellant is a J'1reign national and oJ the time of his

arrest, he was with another foreigner who is a citizen of a neighbouring

country to that of the accused-appellant. The accused-appellant has

married a Sri Lankan woman, who was employed as his father's maid, in

his country some time ago. They had one child from that marriage and he 2

has come to Sri Lanka to tak2 his child back from his wife lJ his country as

their marriage was not successful.

After the arrest of the accused-appellant, the officers found a key in

his possession. Further investigations led the Police team to a three-storied

house in School Lane, Maradana. The key did not open its front door. At

that time Gle accused-appellant called a woman, who peeped through a

window. She did not let the team in. Having waited outside for about 10

rninutes, they broke into the house to prevent any contraband being

destroyed. There were three foreign men inside the house who engaged a

scuffle with the officers. PWl, having requested for reinforcements, has

taken the two suspects back to his vehicle and kept them under its driver's

supervision. Four Police officers from the local Police arrived at the scene

but they offered no help to bring the situation under control. PWl, decided

to return to the house, in order to manage the situation there.

Few minutes later, the driver rang up him to inform, that a person

came in a vehicle belonged to a dIplomatic n1ission, is trying to take the

hvo suspects away. PWI returned to his vehicle imn1ediately and

prevented the suspects being taken away and had arrested the person who

came in the diplomatic vehicle and it3 Sri Lankan driver.

By this time, the reinforcements requested by PWl from PNB also

has arrived and with their assistance the accused-appellant, th(~ o~h(~r

foreigner who was with him at the time of arrest, the seven inmate.; of

Maradana Ifouse, including three lllen and three foreig:l women and a

Sinhalese woman, the person who came in diplomatic vehicle and his

3

I ______ .J

-= --. !:------ -

dr~ver were brought to PNB office at about 2.30 a.m. In the following

mornIng.

Whilst at the PNB office, the ambassador of the country of which the

0t ~ l~r suspect who was aI-tested with the accustd-appellant is a citizen, too

has arrived ~here. With his intervention and by clairrling diplomatic

ilnmunity, the person who caIne in the embassy vehicle and its driver were

released by the hierarchy of the PNB. The productions recovered from the

possession of the accused-appellant was thereafter were sealed in the

presence of the accused-~lppellant and was handed over to the reservist

under PR No. 188/2012.

~ Further investigations conducted. In the morning resulted in the

discovery of another house in Inguru Kade Junction. The search of this

house led to the discovery of Rs. 199,000.00 belonged to the other suspect

who was arrested &long with the accused-appellant. Both these suspects

were kept in custody under Detention Orders and were later produced

before Mal(~kanda Magistrate's Court.

After the investiGations, the officers who sustained injuries during

the previous night's scuffle with the group of foreigners, have got

themselves admitted to National Hospital for treatment.

At the conclusion of the trial, during which the accused-appeIL1.nt

gave evidence under oath, the trial Court has acquitted him frorn the

charge of trafficking of Heroin but convicted for its possession.

4

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the accused-

. appellant sought his conviction and sentence set aside on the following

grounds of appeal;

L the trial Court has failed to properly evaluate the evidence

presented by the prosecution for its credibility,

11. the trial Court has failed to consider the chain of productions

has not been proved by the prosecution,

iii. the trial Court has failed to properly evaluate the evidence

presented by the accused-appellant before it.

~ In support of his first ground of appeal, the accused-appellant made

lengthy oral and written submissions pointing out several inconsistencies

in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as well as the improbability of

the case presented by the prosecution to impress upon this Court of the

fact that the trial Court has fallen into error in convicting him, on such

unreliable evidence.

These inconsistencies highlighted by the accused-appellant, exists in

the evidence of the prosecution witnesses in relation to a disparity in his

name with the information received, involvement of persons of different

nationalities, hospitalization of officers and the raid conducted in Inguru

Kade Junction.

Improbabilities referred to by the accused-appellant includes that

there is no clear evidence as to what the officers did at the car park of

Suleiman Hospital awaiting for the informant's call, selection of raiding

Maradana house whilst the house in Ingunl. Kade Junction is located closer

5

~---

to the point of arrest, the failure to remerrlber details of hospitalization by

the prosecution witnesses by the driver of the Police vehicle and the

release of other suspects arrested on the same night without prosecution.

lric inconsistency highlighted by the accused -Q ppellant is in relation

to the evidence ;-hat PWl who said thL,t the information received was a

foreign national was dealing in drugs in Grand pass area while the PW2

said that a foreign national called II Amar" was dealing in drugs in

Grand pass area. The absence of the name II Amar" in the evidence of PWl

was highlighted by the accused-appellant as a significant inconsistency

with the evidence of PW2. The accused-appellant alf,o invited to the

instances where the evidence in relation to his name has been presented

;

differently.

In relation to the inconsistency of the different nationalities, the

accused-appellant invited attention of Court that the nationality of the

other foreigner who vvas arrested along with him has been described

inconsistently. The decision to conduct further investigations on Maradana

house, instead of Ingunl Kade house, which located at a closer location to

the plan where where the detection was made, was also highlighted by the

accused- appellant in support of his claim of inlprobability of the

prosecution version.

The record of the proceeding before the High Court is inclusive of

the closing addr2sses made by the prosecution and the accused-ci.ppel1ant.

Perusal of the submissions of the learned Counsel who represented the

accused-appellant at the triat revealed the fact that these inconsistencies

and hnprobabilities were strenuously highlighted.

Learned trial Judge, who convicted the accused-appellant, has had

the benefit of observing the demeanour and deportment of all the

prosecution witnesses and the accused-appellant, except for the initial part

of the examination in chief of the PW1, which he decided to formally adopt

exercising his discretion under Section 48 of the Judicature Act No.2 of

1979 as alnended, before he continued with the trial.

Upon perusal of the judgment of the High Court, it is observed that

the learned trial Judge was mindful of his responsibility of evaluating

credibility of the witnesses, as he reproduced their evidence with the

challenges put to them by the accused-appellant seekinz to attack its

credibility. The specific instances where the suggestions put across by the

I accused-appellant were admitted by the prosecution witnesses as well as

the denials by them and the explanations provided by the prosecution

witnesses are considered in the judgment.

In Attorney General v Mary Theresa (2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292, the

Supreme Court, in spelling out the collective wisdom of several judgments

it considered on this particular point, states thus;

"Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would

ordinarily affect the trustworthiness of the witness I statement,

it is well established that the Court must exercise its judgment

on the nature, tenor of the inconsistency or contradiction and

whether they are material to the facts in issue. Discrepancies

which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the basic

version of the witness cannot be given too lnuch importance.

(Vide, Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat).

7

.-

Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling

discrepancies and omissions (Vide, Dashiraj v. the State)

When contradictions are marked, the judge should direct his

attention to whether they are material or not and the witness

should be given the opportunity of explaining that

matter (Vide, State of UP v. Anthony; A.G. v. liisllvalingam)

It is dangerous to presume or assume that because two

witnesses contradict each other, one of them must be a false

witness and reject the testimony in its entirety. The judge has a

duty to probe into whether the discrepancy occurred due to a

lack of observation or defective rnemory or a dishonest motive.

(Vide,Colin Thome J in Bandaranaike v. Jagathsena)

In State of UP v. Anthony, the Indian Supreme Court stated

that 'while appreciating the evidenre of a witness, the approach

must be whether the evidence ... read as a whole appears to hat'e

a ring of truth'. The Court went on to elaborate further that

'jY1inor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core

of the case, hyper technical approach by taking sentences torn

out of context here or there from the evidence, attaching

importance to some technical error committed by the

investigating officer not going to the root of the matter would

not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole'."

These considerations that could universally be applied to test the

evidence of all witnesses in determining their truthfulness and reliability.

In the appeal before us, the witnesses are truined Police officers who have

expelience in giving evidence and has had the advantage of refreshing

their memories by referring to the notes of investigation. However, in

8

assessing their evidence and the weight to be attached to them, the apex

Court made no distinction as they too are not immune to errors made

owing to their human nature.

It was observed by the dpex Court that;

HPolice officets are not infallible observers and may like any

other witness make honest mistakes. However, they differ from

eye witnesses generally in that their training and experience

encourages them to be more obseruant and to focus on detail

and there is no reason why this shouldn I t be taken into account

when assessing the reliability of their evidence (Vide, R u.

Tyler). It is clear that the contradictions in the prosecution case

I are the product of human error and not due to any dishonest

intent. Such slight discrepancies cannot be deemed to affect the

probability of the Prosecution case in the totality of the

probative value of the evidence presentrd on behalf of the

prosecution. "

It is observed by J ayasuriya J in Wickremasuriya v Dedoleena and

Others (1996) 2 Sri L.R. 95 that "", A judge, in applying the test of Probability

and Improbability, relies heavily on his kno'wledge of men and matters and the

patterns of conduct observed by human beings both ingenious as 'well as those who

are less talented and fortunate,/I

In this instance, the learned trial Judge used his kno\vledge of men

and matters in coming to the correct conclusion that the evidence of the

witnesses relied upon by the prosecution are truthful and reliable, in fpite

of the trifling inconsistencies, It is clearly seen frorn the evidence that the

---.~

officers were confronted with totally an unexpected turn of events when

they arrested the accused-appellant with the three 1/ tablets". The raid

cond ucted in Maradana house, the scuffle with the inmates which resulted

in injuries to some of the officers, calling for reinforcements and then the

intervention by a diplomat to {Fee the two suspects 'would have surprised

the officers. Almost all of the incon~~istencies that were highlighted by the

accused-appellant are on these subsequent events that took place after the

detection. There was no significant inconsistency among any of the

prosecution witnesses as to the events which led to the reception of

information, events which took place just prior to the detection and the

actual detection. This should be expected when the detection deviates

from the anticipated course of events

It is correct that the accused-appellant suggested and claimed in his

evidence that the PNB officers have acted in collusion with another Police

officer of Grandpass Police Station to fabricate this allegation against him at

his estrange wife's initiative. Learned trial Judge was mindful of this

specific claim by the accused-appellant when he undertook the task of

considering the evidence before him. Having considered the version of the

prosecution and the claim of the accused-appellant, learned trial Judge

concluded that the evidence of the prosecution has satisfied the required

standard of proof and therefore found the accused-appellant guilty of

possession of Heroin. The verdict of acquittal that has been entered in

favour of the accused-appellant in respect of the trafficking charge is a

clear indication that the trial Court has not mechanically considered the

evidence placed before it by the prosecution.

10

In the light cf these factors, it is our considered VIew that the

inconsistencies that are highlighted by the accused-appellant in the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses are due to these inherent weaknesses

of human evidence as against the evidence mechanically or electronically

retrieved and produced befofp. Court. There is no dispute that the officers

who were involved with the detection had no prior knowledge of the

existence of the accused-appellant, until the detection. In fact, the accused-

appellant himself in his evidence stated that these officers have first

questioned his foreiLFJ1er friend about hin1 and he interveneJ into their

conversation by introducing himself.

In challenging the prosecution c~se, the accused-appellant relied on

the ilnprobabiliiy of the version it presented when the witnesses stated

that they have spent different time intervals at the car park, awaiting the

infonnant's call. The accused-appellant also relied on the inconsistencies

that exists in the e~lidence of the members of the raiding party in relation

to their hospitalization after the scuffle at !v1aradana house, in support of

his clairn of iillprobability. The accused-appellant strenuously contended

that none of the other persons arrested on the night was prosecuted except

the accused-appellant and that supports his claim of framing him by the

officers of PNB clainling Heroin was found in his possession. The evidence

clearly indicates that the other suspects had no complicity to the charges

leveled against the accused-appel1l..nt and therefore their release has no

significance as to the truthfulness of the evidence.

11

The second ground of appeal relates to the complaint by the

accused- appellant that the trial Court has failed to consider the chain of

productions has not been proved by the prosecution. This complaint is

based on the fact that PWl ha~. admitted that the three 1/ tablets" that were

recovered from the possession of the accused appellant not kept with him

duri~g investigations. t-IoV1E:Ver, when one closely examines the evidence

presented before the trial Court by the prosecution, it could clearly be seen

that PWI has decided to temporary handover the custody of three

1/ tablets" to hi0 junior cfficer PC 63051 J ayawnrdane when the inmates of

the Maradana house turned hostile towards the raiding party. PWI had

thereafter taken charge of the "tabl~ts" when they have reached the safety

of their office and produced them to the reservist having completed the

required procedure in relation to production items. Jayawardane was

calleel as PW6 fuld he supported his senior officer's evidence of handing

over the productions to his temporary custody until it was taken by PWI

at their office. I-Ie asserted that during this lin1ited period he possessed the

three" tablets" recovered from the accused-appellant.

This position advanced by the PWl is a probable one as it was his

intention to ensure safety of the production items recovered from the

accused- appellant. As the situation got tensed due to the scuffle, he had

the presence of n1ind to tempor&ry hannover the three" tablets" to PW6 for

its safekeeping. The accusen-appellant's complaint about the production

/I chain" confines to this segment of custody. He did not challenge the

inward journey of these Horns to the Government Analyst's Department,

where they were scientifically analyzed and weighed.

12

~ ....... :

In this type of situations where the production items were sealed

after the detection, not at the place of detection but at the Police station, the

prosecution r.i1ust rely on the oral testimony of the concerned witnesses to

er,t:.blish proper custody up to that point. Once these items are sealed and

handed over to the reservists, then the prosecution will have documentary

evidence to establish its proper custody. As a result, in establishing proper

custody of the production items from the time of detection to the thne of

handing them over to the reservist, having followed the due procedure,

vvould depend on the truthfulness and reli2.bility of the oral evidence of

the concerned official witnesses.

If the trial Court accepts their ~vidence, then the prosecution has

established proper custody from the time of detection to the time of

handing them over to the reservist. If, on the other hand, the trial Court

decides not to act on that evic1E:nce, then the prosecution has failed to

establish proper custody of the production items taken charge during the

detection.

In relation to the appeal before us, the trial Court has opted to act on

the evidence of the prosecution and therefore, the proper custody of the

productions items froln the time of its detection to handing over to

reservist has been established to the required degree of burden of proof.

Therefore, we are of the view that the second ground of appeal fails as it

has no merit.

The third and the final ground of appeal that the trial Court has

failed to properly evaluate the evidence presented by the accused-

appellant befoI2 it is based clearly on an erroneous footing. The accused-

1J

appe:lallt contended that the trial Court rejected his evidence given under

oath for only two reasons. Firstly it miscalculated the claim of the accused-

appellant that the income he earned whilst in Sri Lanka, acting as a sub

agent for an employment cgency, is Rs. 3.7 Million. Secondly, the trial

Court rejected h1S evidence on the basis that he could not describe the

exact number of men in a platoon, although he claimed that he served as a

captain in the Army of his native country.

In his evidence, the accused-appellant, In addition to his other

clahns, asserted that he placed his signature only once in a doculnent. The

other signatures that were shov'Tn to him in cross-examination, including

the one that appears in his statement to PNB was denied by the accused-

; appellant. The prosecution has called rebuttal evidence of Examiner of

Questioned Documents to challenge this assertion. After the evidence of

rebuttal, the trial Court nuted that the clccused-appellant was lied before it

in his evidence in relation to this issue. The accused-appellant, at the

hearing of this appeal, did not challenge this conclusion. In addition, the

trial Court has noted several other important inconsistencies and

irrlprobabilities in his evidence before it decided to reject them.

With regard to the recovery of Rs. 3.7 Million, the prosecution

witnesses have already given evidence that they recovered Rs. 199,000.00

when they searched Inguru Kade Junction house and the other suspect who

was arrested v'vith the accuf.ed-appellant claimed it. The loss of Rs. 3.7

Million by the accused-appellant was first made after about one year and

that too when the Government Analyst's report was made available. There

was no chullenge to this evidence by the accused-appellant.

14

The Supreme Court had the occasion to revisit the jurisdiction of an

appellate Court on questions of facts in Attorney General v Mary

Theresa(supra) when it observed that;

"Appellate courts are generally slow to interfere with the

decir:ol1s of inferior courts on questions of fact or oral

testimony. The Privy Council has stated that appellate court

should not ordinarily interfere with the trial court's opinion as

to the credibility of a witness as the trial judge alone knows the

del'neanour of the wifne:s; he alone can appreciate the manner

in which the questions are answered, whether with honest

candour or with doubtful plausibility and whether after careful

thought or with reckless glibness and he alone can form a

reliable opinion as to whether the 'witness has emerged with

credit from cross examination (Vide, Valarshak Seth Apcar v.

Standard Coat Company Lhnited). But where the lnatter is one

of inference from evidence, and the evidence is not well

balanced the appellate court will set aside the finding of the

trial court if it is against the weight of evidence."

In view of the grounds of appeal which based on a request of

reappraisal of the credibility of the prosecution wItnesses by this Court,

the apex Court also noted that;

"There is simply no jurisdiction in an appellate ccurt to upset

trial findings of fact that have evidentiary support. A Court of

Appeal in1properly substitutes its view of the facts of a case

when it seeks for whatever reason to replace those made by the

trial judge. It is also to be noted that State is not obliged tc?'

The tril-J Court having had fle advantage of observing denleanour

and deportment of the l~ccused-appellant, decided to reject his evidence in

considering all these factors. Testimonial trustworthiness of witncsf-es is a

finding of fact. A finding of fact could not be substituted by an Appellate

Coure, if such finding of fact has 1/ evidentiary support" and is not perverse.

We are satisfled that the trial CJLrt's finding of :LC t to rely on the

prosecution evidence is vvell supported by evidence placed before it.

Accordingly, this ground of appe~l necessarily fails as it is based on a

totally wrong premise.

In view of the above reasons, we affinn the conviction and sentence:

of the High C:ourt of CoLimbo ciJted 15.06.2016 ll":1d dismiss the appeal cf

the accused-appellant.
