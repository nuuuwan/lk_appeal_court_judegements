The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as,

the "Respondent") instituted an action in the District Court of Galle

bearing case No. 10587/L on the 18th February, 1985, against the

3

Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the "Appellant")

for a declaration of title to the land in question. In the said case the

learned District Judge made order to issue summons on the Appellant.

Having received summons, the Appellant had filed a proxy through his

Attorney-at-Law on 11.05.1988 and the order was made by the District

Judge allowing the Appellant to file his answer after the Commission

was executed.

When this case was called in open Court'on 11.05.1992., an order

was made granting the Appellant to file answer on the next date.

Although the case had been called in open Court thereafter on several

dates, the Appellant had failed to do so. Again on 15.11.1996, when the

case was called in open Court, a final date had been given to file answer

until 17.01.1997, but he had failed to file the same. Therefore, the

learned District Judge delivered an ex-parte judgment in favour of the

Respondent and the decree nisi was served to the Appellant on

30.09.1998.

Thereafter, the Appellant filed a petition together with an affidavit

and moved Court to set aside the ex-parte judgment entered against

him, dated 27.06.1997 and the inquiry in regard to that was fixed for

27.05.1999. The Appellant gave evidence explaining the reasons for his

absence from Court on 17.01.1997.The Appellant stated that he had

been assaulted by one U.G.Sumathipala on or about 04.04.1995 and was

grievously hurt. The Appellant also stated that due to the injuries

sustained by him, he had to take daily treatments from Karapitiya

Hospital and he had attended the hospital on that particular day for

treatments. The Appellant further stated that he was not in good mental

condition due to the said injuries.

4

Having considered the evidence and the documents, the learned

District Judge refused the application of the Appellant and affirmed the

ex-parte judgment and decree by the order dated 27.05.1999.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment the Appellant has lodged this

appeal before this Court. The Appellant had submitted several grounds of

Appeal. The first ground of appeal is that the learned District Judge has

failed to consider the fact that the Appellant had submitted in his answer

on 18.06.1993 (at pg.04) But, according to the journal entry No. 48 the

Appellant did not file the answer but moved for a commission. The

second ground of appeal is that the learned District Judge has failed

to evaluate the evidence elicited by the Appellant. According to the

evidence in chief three documents were marked as PI, P2 and P3. But

the Appellant has failed to prove those documents and call witnesses on

that behalf. Therefore, those documents cannot be considered as proved

documents. The third ground is that the learned District. Judge has

failed to evaluate the oral evidence given by the Appellant regarding his

mental ill health. However, at page 79/80 the Appellant has stated that

after taking treatments for his pain in head on 1 7.01.1997 he didn't go

out for about a month's time. But the Appellant had given evidence in

case bearing NO.49042 at Magistrate's Court of Kottawa on 21.01.1997

and had admitted that also. The fourth ground of appeal is that the

learned District Judge had failed to consider the fact that the Appellant

had been present in Court almost on every occasion, when his presence

was necessary. The journal entries of the case record,. does not show

any such entries are available. Considering the evidence of the

Appellant it is obvious that the Appellant is not a credible witness and

his evidence is not consistent.

5

The issues to be determine in this appeal is:

(1) Whether the Appellant had reasonable grounds for his

default.

In the evidence in chief the Appellant stated that he has filed his

answer on 13.01.1997 but he couldn't come to the Court that day.

The Appellant further stated that he didn't come to Court on 17-

01-1997 due to a metal sickness. (At page 73 of the brief)

In the evidence in chief the Appellant stated that he did not know

what happened to the case since he was unconscious due to an assault

taken place on 04-01.1995. But he had given evidence on 21.01.1997 in

the case bearing No.49042 and he also admitted that fact.

The Appellant had marked documents PI (diagnosis ticket), P2

which was a hand written note in an exercise book but there was no

doctor's signature on it. And although he had undertaken to call the

doctor to prove those documents, he had failed to do so.

For the above reasons, it is clear that the Appellant is not a

credible witness and his evidence is inconsistent. Therefore, it is unsafe

to act upon the evidence of the Appellant.

(2) Applicability

Procedure.

of Sec. 86(2) of the Code of Civil

In the case of Mallika V. Karunaratne (Bar Journal 2012 Vol.

XIX Patt II page 380). It was held that:

a. A party who relies on Sec.86(2) of the Code to vacate an ex-

parte decree should establish a reasonable ground for default.

b. Negligence of lawyer amounts to the negligence of client.

,

- ... ".;.. ,

c. As long as a valid proxy is filed of the record and is in force

there is a duty on the part of Counselor registered Attorney to

look after the interests of his or her client.

In Sanicoch Group of Company by its Attorney Denham

Oswald Dawson V. Kala Traders (Pvt) Ltd. (Bar Journal 2016 Vo.XXII

page 44) it was held;

a. According to case law, inquiry on application to set aside an ex-

pare decree is not regulated by any specific provision of the CPC

but such inquiries must be conducted consistent with rules of

natural justice and the requirement of fairness.

b. Sec. 86(2) of the CPC requires the defendant to satisfy Court

that the defendant had reasonable grounds for such default.

This means that the defendant party needs to satisfy Court the

expectation of desires that are accepted as adequate in the

circumstances. What should or would be adequate needs to be

only reasonable ground.

c. Both Sections 86(2) and 87(3) have set the standard of proof

as reasonable grounds for default.

In SandamaZi V. Sanette Wijesiri C.A. 207/1998 (F) decided on

23.01.2012;

In an inquiry into an application to set aside an ex-parte decree'

the Court should ascertain whether there were reasonable grounds

for default and should be mindful that in proceedings of this

nature, the provisions of chapter XII of the Code are statutorily

enacted proceedings where consequences of default and cure are

enumerated independent of the main case based on rights of

parties.

8

The Appellant has failed to satisfy the Court that he had

reasonable grounds for his default. Therefore, the Appellant's action

fails.

For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the appeal without costs and

uphold the order of the Learned District Judge of Galle dated 27th May

1999.
