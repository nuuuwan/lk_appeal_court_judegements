The plaintiffs-respondent (Plaintiff) filed the above action in the District Court of Kurunegala

seeking to partition the land called Aswadduma Kumbura situated at Madagama in the district of

Kurunegala one paddy am unum sowing in extent.

2

The Plaintiff claimed that one D.R.D. Pina was the original owner of the corpus. Pina sold the

corpus to one D.R.D. Handuna and Kiriya by deed no. 18674 dated 1905.08.29 (OI.2). Handuna's

~ share devolved on Pushpadeva whose rights devolved upon his death on the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants-Respondents (2nd and 3rd Defendants). Kiriya had three children, two boys and one

girl, namely D.B. Rajapakse (1st Defendant-Respondent), D.M. Rajapakse and Sawwani. Although

Sawwani contracted a diga marriage before 1939, she regained her binna rights as she continued

to live in the mulgedera from that day. Upon the death of Kiriya, his rights devolved upon D.B.

Rajapakse (1st Defendant-Respondent), D.M. Rajapakse and the Plaintiff, daughter of Sawwani

who predeceased Kiriya. The Plaintiff further claimed that after the death of Kiriya, the Plaintiff,

D.B. Rajapakse (1st Defendant-Respondent) and D.M. Rajapakse possessed in common the

property of Kiriya and thereby D.B. Rajapakse (1st Defendant-Respondent) and D.M. Rajapakse

waived the forfeiture, if any, arising from Sawwani contracting a diga marriage. That was the

pedigree set up by the Plaintiff.

Accordingly, the Plaintiff claimed that the parties were entitled to the following shares of the

corpus:

Plaintiff undivided 1/6

1st Defendant undivided 1/6

2nd and 3rd Defendants undivided 3/6

4th to 10th Defendants undivided 1/6

The pt Defendant-Respondent (1st Defendant) denied that Sawwani regained her binna rights.

He claimed that the Defendants had acquired prescriptive title to the corpus in addition to their

inherited rights. Accordingly, it was claimed that the parties were entitled to the following shares

of the corpus:

pt Defendant undivided 1/4

2nd and 3rd Defendants undivided 2/4

4th to 10th Defendants undivided 1/4

3

The 2nd, 3rd and 13th to 18th Defendants claimed that the undivided ~ share of the corpus held by

Handuna went to his son Pushpadeva and upon his death to his children 2nd, 3rd and 13th to 18th

Defendants. They also claimed prescriptive title.

The 4th to 13th Defendants-Appellants (Appellants) denied that the Plaintiff owned any share of

the corpus and asserted that her mother Sawwani had contracted a diga marriage and thereby

forfeited any right of succession to paternal property.

After trial, the learned District Judge of Kurunegala held that the mother of the Plaintiff Sawwani

had regained her binna rights and that the parties were entitled to the following shares in the

corpus:

Plaintiff

1st Defendant

undivided 1/6

undivided 1/6

2nd, 3rd and 14th to 19th Defendants undivided 3/6

4th to 13th Defendants undivided 1/6

The Appellants have preferred this appeal against the said judgement of the learned District

Judge of Kurunegala dated 7th July 1997.

The only question that arises for consideration in this case is whether Sawwani regained her

binna rights after having contracted a diga marriage. That question must be answered by

reference to customary Kandyan law as section 9(1) of the Kandyan law (Declaration

Amendment) Ordinance No. 39 does not apply as the parents of the Plaintiff contracted their

marriage on 2nd August 1929 (5.1) prior to the commencement of the said Ordinance. By virtue

of this section, after the commencement of the said Ordinance, for purposes governing

succession, a diga marriage cannot be converted into a binna marriage and vice versa.

4

It is an admitted fact that Sawwani contracted a diga marriage. The word diga from di, root da,

to give, is, according to some scholars, a derivative from dirga, long, the bride being sent away to

a distance, that is to her husband's house. The conducting of a wife to, and the living in the

husband's house or in any family residence of his, or if he does not own a house and lands, the

taking her as his wife and the conducting away from her family to a place of lodging constitutes

a diga marriage. The predominant idea is the departure or removal from the family or ancestral

home.1

The authorities unite in stating that under Kandyan Law when a woman (not being the only child)

marries in diga she forfeits her rights to inherit any portion of her father's estate. 2 This forfeiture

is an incident of the daughter quitting the parental roof to enter another family.

The important issue for this Court to consider is the circumstances in which a diga married

daughter can regain binna rights. The Plaintiff submits that since Sawwani returned to the

mulgedera and lived there until her death and the fact that she was re-admitted to the paternu5

familia is itself proof that Sawwani re-acquired binna rights. However, the Appellants submit

that it must also be shown that there was a waiver of the forfeiture by the family including the

brothers.

The circumstances under which a diga married daughter can regain binna rights is not without

ambiguities. Modder3 states that a diga married daughter will regain binna rights

(a) By being recalled by the father and re-married in binna;

(b) By her father, on her return to his house along with her husband, assigning to them and

putting them in possession of a part of his house and a specific share of his lands;

(c) On her returning home along with her husband and attending on her father, and

rendering him assistance until his death;

(d) On her coming back and attending on and assisting her father during his last illness, and

the father on his deathbed expressing his will that she should have a share of his lands.

Early decisions show that our Courts focused on whether the daughter who had forfeited her

rights had regained such rights by maintaining a connection with the mulgedara. 4 ln Emi Nona et

al v. Sumanapala et als Court held that evidence that a diga married daughter visited her parents

from time to time and stayed for some time with them, that she went to her parent's house for

confinement and attended on her father during his last illness is insufficient to establish a re-

acquisition of binna rights.

However later cases have held that it must also be shown that there was a waiver of the diga

married daughter's forfeiture by the father and brothers.Gln Dingiri Amma v. Ratnatilaka et aJ7it

was held that a diga married daughter cannot re-acquire binna rights unless it is shown that she

was not only received back at the mulgedera by her father and those who were entitled to the

inheritance but also that they acquiesced in her re-acquiring binna rights and agreed to share the

i nherita nce.

In Gunasena et al v. Ukku Menika et aJ8 after an exhaustive analysis of the authorities Tennakoon

c.J. identified the test to be applied as follows:

" .. .it would appear that re-acquisition of binna rights by a daughter who has gone out in

diga can be established by proving the exercise by such diga married daughter of rights

in the mulgedera or in the paternal property as though there had been no forfeiture,

coupled with acquiescence on the part of the father or he being dead of the brothers in

such exercise of rights."9(emphasis added)

I have set out the correct legal position of the circumstances under which a diga married daughter

can regain binna rights. I will now consider whether the learned District Judge was correct in

concluding that the mother of the Plaintiff Sawwani had regained her binna rights on the facts of

this case.

The time at which Sawwani, the mother of the Plaintiff, should have regained her binna rights is

the time of the death of her father Kiriya as it is only then that the question of intestate succession

has actually to be considered.lO

The Plaintiff testified to the following salient facts. The Plaintiffs parents got married in August

1929 (Appeal Brief page 82). The Plaintiff was born on 7th September 1930 (ol.3). She was born

in the mulgedara at Pataliya as Sawwani had come to the parental home for the confinement

(Appeal brief page 87). Sawwani died in January 1931 (Appeal Brief page 78) and the Plaintiff was

looked after by Kiriya, his wife Rathee (mother of Sawwani) and the uncles D.M. Rajapakse and

D.B. Rajapakse, brothers of Sawwani (Appeal brief page 75). Kiriya died somewhere in 1940

(Appeal Brief page 75). The Plaintiff continued to reside in the mulgedara after her marriage to

Gunapala (Appeal brief page 75) (ol.4 to ol.9). D.M. Rajapakse and D.B. Rajapakse later

constructed separate houses and moved out of the mulgedara (Appeal brief page 75). The

Plaintiff was given possession of the paddy land called Pihilianga by D.M. Rajapakse but after his

death his children did not give it to her (Appeal brief page 76). Plaintiff did not possess

Aswadduma Kumbura the corpus in this case (Appeal brief pages 75 and 76).

Under cross examination the Plaintiff admitted that the brothers of her mother Sawwani did not

accept that Sawwani had obtained binna rights (Appeal Brief page 83). Plaintiff also admitted

that she had obtained rights to her father's (Theththuwa) property on the basis of her mother's

diga marriage (Appeal Brief page 84 and 87). She accepted that her father and mother were not

given binna rights (Appeal Brief page 76).

10 A.G. Menika & others v. N.D. William [(1983) Vol. , Part "' B.A.S.L. Law Journa' 113]

The learned District Judge adverted to the admitted fact that the Plaintiff was from birth residing

in the mulgedera and brought up there and held that this by itself was sufficient for Sawwani to

have regained binna rights to her father's property. However, remaining in or returning to the

mulgedera does not necessarily result in a retention or re-acquisition of rights. If a diga married

woman is remarried in binna or readmitted into her father's family by a binna settlement clearly

showing that a binna connection was intended, she regains the rights of a binna married daughter

to inherit her intestate father's properties.ll

The learned District Judge appears to have approached the question of re-acquisition of binna

rights purely from the exercise of rights in the mulgedara. However as pointed out earlier the

Supreme Court in Gunasena et al v. Ukku Menika et al12 held that there was another requirement

namely acquiescence on the part of the father or he being dead of the brothers in such exercise

of rights. Hence the learned District Judge erred in applying the relevant test. However, no

judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect

or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice.13 Therefore, even ifthe learned District Judge erred in applying the correct test,

if it is evident on a close examination of the totality of the evidence that the learned District Judge

was correct in pronouncing judgment in favour of the Plaintiff, there is no prejudice to the

substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice and the judgment of the learned

District Judge should not be disturbed. 14

In deciding whether the brothers of Sawwani acquiesced in her exercising rights in the mu/gedera

the vital evidence is that the Plaintiff having being born in the mulgedera continued to occupy it

at the time of Kiriya's death in 1940 and was still occupying it at the time she testified. Thus, she

continued to occupy the mulgedera for 65 years. Furthermore, it was her unchallenged evidence

that her uncles D.M. Rajapakse and D.B. Rajapakse were also residing in the mulgedera for some

time but later constructed separate houses and moved out leaving the Plaintiff to occupy it.

Plaintiff was given possession of the paddy land called Pihilianga by D.M. Rajapakse which was

part of Kiriya's estate. The above facts in my view clearly indicates that there was acquiescence

on the part of Kiriya and the brothers of Sawwani in Sawwani and through her, the Plaintiff,

exercising rights in the mulgedera. Tennakoon c.J. in Gunasena et al v. Ukku Menika et aIlS held

that Kandyan Law customarily identified the following acts as evidence of readmission of a diga

married daughter into the father's family:

(a) maintaining a close and constant connection with the mulgedera; or

(b) left a child to be brought up at the mulgedera; or

(c) maintained an intimate association with the paterfamilias, or

(d) possessed any of the family lands.16

The evidence in this case establishes all four of these acts as well as acquiescence on the part of

the family in Sawwani and the Plaintiff exercising rights in the mulgedera.

The Appellants submitted that the Plaintiff had in D.C. Kurunegala 5648/T claimed property rights

in her father's property and obtained her mother's diga rights and that there are no authorities

to establish that a person can benefit under both diga and binna rights. The answer to this point

is the following statement by Thamotheram J. in Ranhetidewayalage Rana v. Ranhetidewayalage

Kiribindu17:

"The only consequence of a diga married daughter preserving or subsequently acquiring

binna rights is that the forfeiture of the rights of paternal inheritance does not take place,

but she inherits as though she was married in binna. It does not alter the character of the

marriage itself. The diga marriage remains a diga marriage so far as other results of such

marriage are concerned. The husband does not cease to be a diga married husband and

begin to be a binna married husband."

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgement of the learned District

Judge of Kurunegala dated 7th July 1997.

Hence the appeal is dismissed with costs.
