Before s. Devika de L. Tennekoon,J. &

s. Thurairaja,PC, J.

Counsel Anuradha Weerakkody for the Accused-Appellant

D.S. Soosaithas, SSC for AG

Decided on 08.12.2017

s. Thurairaja,PC. J.

Heard submissions of both counsels and perused written submissions

filed by them. We carefully considered the proceedings and the

evidence led before the High Court.

We found on 12.05.2008 that the trial was taken up before a judge, due

to his elevation and the trial was continued before another judge and

he delivered the judgment.

When the trial taken up before a new Judge the Accused was present but

without a lawyer. The accused was assigned with a counsel on that day

and the trial continued before the new judge. End of the day's

proceedings, we find that the counsel for the Accused made an

-, I

application to get a copy of the indictment. This shows that the

Counsel has defended the accused without even having a copy of the

indictment. We can easily presume that the Accused-Appellant's

Counsel was not armed with the basic document namely the indictment

and other necessary evidential materials.

We have discussed in many cases that the accused has a right to have a

fair trial which is enshrined under article 13 of the constitution of

Sri Lanka. Further United Nation's declaration of human rights,

International Covenant on political rights and other international

documents which Sri Lanka is a signatory as well as some of them were

passed as laws of Sri Lanka. We have dealt with this issue in detail

in C.A. 286/09 decided on 30/11/2017.

Under these circumstances we find that the Accused-Appellant did not

have a fair trial. Therefore we conclude there is not trial held.

Accordingly, we order are-trial.

Registrar is hereby directed to transmit the case record immediately

to the Registrar of High Court of Colombo.

Further, the Registrar of High Court, Colombo is directed to consult

with the Judge concern and to give priority to list this case to take

up for trial because, as per the indictment this incident has alleged

to have occurred on 04/10/2001.

Retrial ordered.
