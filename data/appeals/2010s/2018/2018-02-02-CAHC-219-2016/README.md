The accused appellant was indicted in the High Court of

Embilipitiya for unlawful possession of a fire arm and 28 rounds of

ammunition under section 22 (3) of the Fire Arms Ordinance no. 22 of

1996 (as amended) and section 27 (1) (a) of the Explosives Act no. 21 of

1956.

Before the trial when the indictment was served on the appellant

he was ordered bail by the High Court on the 17th of December 2009.

Thereafter he has not appeared in court and a section 241 inquiry was

held and an open warrant has been issued on him.

Trial in absentia was held on 31/10/2011 and the judgment was

pronounced on the 08th of March 2012. The appellant was convicted in

absentia on both charges and a sentence of life imprisonment was given

for the first charge and for the second charge, five years RI was imposed.

Journal entry on 21/10/2015 shows that the appellant was arrested

and produced before the High Court after three years to implement the

sentence imposed on him. An application was made under section 241

2

(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to hold an inquiry to prove his

bona fide. After inquiry the learned High Court Judge has refused to set

aside the judgment dated 08/03/2012. And the learned High Court Judge

has proceeded to implement the sentence. Being aggrieved by the said

order the appellant has filed the instant application.

The learned Senior State Counsel raised two preliminary

objections namely that,

1. There is no right of appeal in respect of a 241 (3) inquiry order.

2. The appeal against the conviction and sentence is out of time.

The learned Senior State Counsel relied on the judgment in

Padmasiri vs Attorney General 2012 (2) SLR 24 to substantiate the first

preliminary objection.

The said judgment states;

"Section 241 (3) (b) indicates the existence 0/ a conviction

and sentence laWfully passed. There/ore we find that if the

accused appellant was successful in his application under

section 2411 the case would have been re-opened and the

trial would have commenced de novo and the accused

would have all his rights including the right 0/ appeall butl

as his application under section 241 was rejected, he had no

3

.'

right of appeal against the conviction and sentence already

pronounced because, it was out of time."

It was also held in the said judgment that;

"The High Court has rejected the explanation of the

appel/ant and refused to vacate the conviction and

sentence. There had been no application for revision and

the appellant had the opportunity of moving in revision.

Discretionary power of this Court invoking revisionary

jurisdiction as sought as an alternative by the accused

should not be used in a situation of this sort "

The learned counsel for the appellant in his argument cited the

judgment in Dona Padma Priyanthi Sennanayake vs H.G. Chamika

Jayantha and two others (Supreme Court appeal no. 41/2015 dated

04/08/2017). And stated that the Supreme Court has discussed as to

what are the orders that could be considered as final judgments and inter

locutory orders. On perusal of the said judgment we find that leave was

granted by the Supreme Court on four questions of law that deals with

civil actions. Therefore the case cited by the counsel has no bearing on

the instant case.

The learned counsel mentioned section 11 of Act no. 19 of 1990

which provides,

4

11 (1). The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise, subject

to the provisions of this Act or any other law, an appellate

jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law

which shall be committed by any High Court established by

Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of its

jurisdiction under paragraph (3) (a), or (4) of Article 154P

of the Constitution and sole and exclusive cognizance by

way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum of all

causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things of

which such High Court may have taken cognizance:

Provided that, no judgment, decree or order of any such

High Court, shall be reversed or varied on account of any

error, defect, or irregularity which has not prejudiced the

substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of

justice.

This Act was brought into operation to confer appellate jurisdiction

to provincial High Courts. Section 3 of the said Act confers jurisdiction to

High Court to hear appeals from Labour Tribunals within the province and

orders made under section 5 or 9 of the Agrarian Services Act no. 58 of

1979. Section 4 confers appellate jurisdiction to entertain appeals from

the Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts.

5

Under section 11 of the said Act it does not empower the Court of

Appeal to hear appeals filed against the appeal orders given by the High

Court. When an indictment is served and a judgment is given after

recording evidence such judgment becomes a final order. And whatever

the orders given thereafter such as an order made under section 241 are

considered as an incidental order unless otherwise the High Court decide

to record the evidence de novo.

For the afore stated reasons we find that the appeal is out of time.

Further we decide that under section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code

Act the right of appeal has not been specifically granted. We uphold the

preliminary objections raised by the respondent and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal is dismissed.
