17th September,2018

The 1st Accused-Petitioner Jhonston Xavier Fernando (hereinafter

referred to as the "Petitioner"), with his petition, supported by an affidavit

of one Johann Stanislaus Fernando, invokes revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court, seeking to revise inter alia orders made by the High Court of

Kurunegala in case No. 8/2016 on 3rd September 2018.

It is stated that the Petitioner was indicted by the Hon. Attorney

General before the said High Court, with two other accused along with

others unknown to the prosecution, for conspiring to commit criminal

misappropriation of Rs. 3,828,596.50 belonging to Yanthampalawa branch of

2

Lanka Sathosa Limited and committing criminal misappropriation of the

said sum of money, offences that are punishable under Section 5(1) of the

Offences against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 read with Sections

133(b), and 102 of the Penal Code.

The indictment was served on the Petitioner on 28th March 2016 by

the High Court and he was enlarged on bail by the Court after recording

his plea of "not guilty" to the counts against him. He did not violate any

conditions on which he was enlarged on bail. The trial against the

Petitioner and other two accused has commenced on 3rd September 2018

and it is stated that at the" commencement of the trial the Petitioner was

remanded pending the conclusion of the trial". The prosecution, having

commenced the examination in chief of prosecution witness No.1, sought

an early adjournment pending perusal of the documents it relied on which

were in the custody of Court. The trial Court granted an adjournment of

trial until 11th September 2018.

At that stage, learned Counsel for the Petitioner, made an

application for bail and with the delivery of the impugned order, the High

Court had refused his application.

It is stated by the Petitioner that the said order should be revised

upon the following circumstances, which he relied on as exceptional;

i. said order remanding him is palpably wrong,

11. it interferes with the liberty of the Petitioner,

iii. he is deprived of liberty and wrongfully incarcerated,

3

IV. order made by the High Court in refusing bail is palpably

wrong, interferes with liberty and he was wrongfully

incarcera ted,

v. order made remanding the Petitioner has been granted ultra

vires and in excess of jurisdiction,

VI. the remand order and not releasing him on bail violates the

fundamental rights of the Petitioner which include inter alia

personal liberty, the presumption of innocence and the

freedom of movement,

Vll. the order is ex facie an error and/ or error on the face of the

record,

viii. orders dated 3.9.2018, remanding and not granting bail is an

anathema to the rule of law and the fundamental principles

undergirding the Constitution,

IX. the remand order and refusal to grant bail violates the

principles of law governing the citizens of this Country and

the judiciary and is perverse.

When this matter came up for support before us on 12th September

2018, learned President's Counsel, made extensive submissions in support

of the application. Learned Senior State Counsel, in her reply on behalf of

the Respondent, whilst objecting to granting any relief, made submissions

in support of the impugned order of the High Court of Kurunegala.

Thereafter, the parties have agreed to have a final order pronounced on the

application without proceeding to other procedural steps of filing of

objections etc.

4

Learned President's Counsel submitted that the impugned order is

in violation of the rights conferred upon the Petitioner by Article 13(2) of

the Constitution and contrary to the spirit of the legislative provisions

contained in the Bail Act No. 30 of 1997, particularly Section 2 where it is

stated that "grant of bail shall be regarded as the rule and the refusal to grant bail

as the exception."

In support of his claim, that it is the provisions of Bail Act that

applies in relation to the Petitioner and not the provisions of Offences

against Public Property, he contended that when he was refused bail by

the Magistrate's Court on the basis of the provisions contained in the

Offences against Public Property Act, the Petitioner moved the High Court

to revise the said order and considering the fact that he has paid back the

amount involved, he was enlarged on bail by the High Court. Therefore, it

is his contention that it is the provisions of Bail Act that applies to him.

With that submissions, learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner, particularly invited our attention to Section 7, where it's proviso

clearly states " ... where the person has appeared before Court on

summons ... he shall be enlarged on his own recognisance or on him

giving an undertaking to appear when required ... ". Since the Petitioner

had first appeared before the High Court on summons, it was mandatory

for the Court to release him on his mere undertaking that he would appear

in Court, and he was therefore enlarged on bail. He further contended that

Section 7 has no provisions to "remand" a person and the High Court had

not referred to any provision of law in making the cancellation of the

subsisting bail order made by the very Court.

5

Learned President's Counsel further submitted that when the

indictment was served upon the Petitioner, he was not "remanded" as

there was no reason to act under Section 14 of the Bail Act, although the

High Court made a variation of bail conditions upon its initial order

granting bail, whilst acting in revision.

In making submissions on factual matters, learned President's

Counsel stated that the succeeding Judge, at the commencement of trial,

had read over the indictment to the Petitioner for the 2nd time and

recorded his plea again, an incorrect procedure which has no statutory

support. Thereafter, the High Court remanded the three accused when it

patently lacked jurisdiction to do so. The High Court did not comply with

the mandatory provisions of Section 15 of the Bail Act, as it failed to record

its reasons as to why it cancels a subsisting bail order and the Court had no

discretion over the question of bail.

Learned President's Counsel submitted that the Petitioner, since his

enlargement on bail by the High Court twice before the commencement of

trial, had not violated any of the bail conditions which warranted

cancellation of his bail.

It is contended by the Petitioner that when a person comes before

Court, it could act under Section 7 of the Bail Act in granting bail and

could also act under Section 14 if it refuses bail. But in remanding the

Petitioner and refusing to enlarge him on bail by cancellation of the

existing bail order, the High Court did not act under provisions of Section

14 of the Bail Act, in violation of the principles of law enunciated in the

6

judgment of the divisional bench of the Supreme Court in Anuruddha

Ratwatte v The Attorney General (2003) 2 Sri L.R. 39, where it was held

that;

"In terms of the mandatory requirements of Section

14(1) such a cancellation could have been done only on :-

(i) an application being made by a police officer;

(ii) hearing the accused appellant personally

or through his attorney-at-law:

(iii) if the court had reasons to believe that any

one of the grounds as specified in paragraph

(a) (i) to (iii) or paragraph (b) have been made

out.

In addition, the learned President's Counsel, challenging the basis

on which he claims that the bail was cancelled, being "it is the practice of the

Court", relied on several other authorities, including the judgment of

Rupathunga v Attorney General and Another (2009) 1 Sri L.R. 170, where

Silva J observed that;

" . .. these are orders which could be founded as caprzclOus,

arbitrary and unjust ... what shocks the conscience of this Court is

that the High Court Judge has not even cared to provide an

opportunity to the accused, at least to show cause as to why bails

should not be cancelled instead has considered some extraneous

matters which are not even covered by Section 14 and has rushed to

the conclusion that bail should be cancelled which I say is

indecent. "

7

In resisting the application of the Petitioner, learned Senior State

Counsel invited our attention to the judgment of the divisional bench of

the Supreme Court in Attorney General v Gunawardena (1996) 2 Sri L.R.

149, where the scope of the revisionary jurisdiction has been described in

following terms;

"Revision, like an appeal, is directed towards the correction of

errors, but it is supervisory in nature and its object is the due

Administration of Justice and not, primarily or solely, the relieving

of grievances of a party. "

Learned Senior State Counsel also insisted the complained act

should also 1/ occasion a failure of justice" as per the judgment of CA(Rev) No.

931/84 - C.A.M. of 24.07.1991.

It is her contention that it is the provisions of Offences against Public

Property Act that applies to the instant situation as per the judgment of

CA(PHC) APN 35/2016 - C.A.M. of 07.10.2016 and not the Bail Act as

contended by the learned President's Counsel and under proviso to Section

8(1) of the Act No. 12 of 1982, an accused could be kept in remand until

conclusion of his trial, unless he is released on bail in "exceptional

circumstances" .

Referring to the chronology of relevant events, learned Senior State

Counsel referred to the following facts;

1. the Petitioner was indicted on 8th February 2016 for

offences committed under Offences against Public

Property Act,

8

ii. on 2nd May 2016, the matter was fixed for trial by the

High Court on 24th and 25th August 2018 by summoning

witnesses,

iii. upon a motion by the 3rd accused, the said trial dates

were vacated, and the case was called in open Court on

1 st August 2016. Thereafter, the case was fixed for trial

on 28th and 29th September 2016 with summons issued

on PW 1 to PW 10,

IV. On 28th September 2016, the Petitioner sought

postponement and the trial was accordingly vacated. It

was re-fixed for trial on 22nd February 2017,

v. On 22nd February 2017, the trial was re-fixed to 23rd

October 2017 and had to be again put off on the

application of the Petitioner. Thereupon, the High

Court has ordered that the trial to be taken up on day to

day basis from 3rd September 2018 and informs the

parties to be ready.

In replying to the submissions of the learned President's Counsel

that the High Court had taken the plea of the Petitioner for the 2nd time on

the 3rd September 2018 without a legal basis, learned Senior State Counsel

referred to Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979, which contained the applicable statutory provisions.

9

It is her submission that Section 9 of the Offences against the Public

Property Act had imposed a duty on trial Courts to give priority to trials

where the accused are prosecuted under offences recognised by its

provisions and it is at the stage of adjournment, the High Court made

order remanding the Petitioner, acting under provisions of Section 263 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. It also empowered the

High Court to make order remanding an accused after recording its

reasons. She also invited out attention to the provisions of Act No. 14 of

2005 by which a proviso was introduced to Section 263 directing trial

Courts to conduct trials on day to day basis "as far as practicable" .

It is the contention of the learned Senior State Counsel that no

exceptional circumstances were made out by the Petitioner, making him

entitle to the discretionary relief he sought from this Court.

In view of the submissions made by the parties, it is appropriate to

consider the applicable legal principles in relation to the application of the

Petitioner.

The apex Court, in Anuruddha Ratwatte v The Attorney General (supra)

held thus;

"The right to liberty and security of person is basic tenet of our

public law and is universally recognised as a human right

guaranteed to very person (vide Article 9 of the Universal

Declaration of Human Rights and Article 9 of the International

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). Based on this right to

liberty and security of person, Article 13 of the Constitution

guarantees as a fundamental right to every person, the freedom

from arbitrary arrest, detention and punishment. /I

10

Article 13(2) of the 1978 Constitution reads thus;

"Every person held in custody, detained or othenuise deprived of

personal liberty shall be brought before the judge of the nearest

competent Court according to procedure established by law, and

shall not be further held in custody, detained or deprived of

personal liberty except upon and in terms of the order of such judge

made in accordance with procedure established by law."

Therefore, in view of the above quoted judicial pronouncement and

the Constitutional provision, the Petitioner must satisfy this Court that the

impugned order made by the High Court remanding him on 3rd September

2018, is made not in accordance with the procedure established by law.

It is noted at the outset, that there is no agreement by the contesting

parties to this application about the applicable law, at least to the extent

that whether it is the provisions of the Bail Act or the provisions of the

Offences against Public Property Act.

In addressing the issue of applicability of the provisions of Offences

against Public Property Act, learned President's Counsel contended that

this issue was "laid to rest" when the Petitioner was enlarged on bail as per

his revision application filed before the Provincial High Court holden in

Kurunegala. However, the proceedings of the relevant revision

application No. HCR 31/2015 on 28.05.2015, does not support such a

conclusion. It is evident from the proceedings, that the prosecution had no

objection to enlarge the Petitioner on bail since he had taken steps to pay

the full amount as indicated in the documents. It is under these

11

circumstances, the Provincial High Court had tacitly revised the order of

the Magistrate's Court and proceeded to grant bail to the Petitioner.

It is also noted by this Court that the indictment filed by the Hon.

Attorney General contained offences that are punishable under Offences

against Public Property Act. The Petitioner is yet to challenge the validity

of these counts before an appropriate forum and the proceedings on 3rd

September 2018 before the High Court, reveals that the learned

prosecuting Counsel had informed the trial Court that this fact is an

element of the offences the Petitioner was charged with and therefore the

prosecution would present evidence is support of it during the course of

the trial.

In these circumstances, the submissions of the learned President's

Counsel that Lanka Sathosa Limited does not satisfy the definition of "public

corporation" as it is registered under Companies Ordinance should not be

considered by this Court as it would then pre judge a fact in issue before

the trial Court, in the absence of any specific relief prayed from this Court

requesting it to do so by the Petitioner.

In CA 1821/2006 C.A.M. of 02.07.2007, Silva J, having considered

the reasoning for the contrary view to this, as held by Sriskandarajah J in

Gunasekara and Others v Karunanayake (2005) 2 Sri L.R. 18, concluded "

... that the provisions of Bail Act do not apply in a case where a suspect is charged

for an offence under the Offences against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982". A

similar view was adopted by this Court in CA(PHC) APN 35/2016 -

C.A.M. of 07.10.2016, as relied on, in support of their contention by the

Respondents.

12

The Respondent, relied on the provisions of Section 263 of the

Criminal Procedure Code as the provision under which the High Court

has acted upon making the remand order impugned by the Petitioner.

Section 263, after the amendment by Section 9 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act No. 14 of 2005, reads as follows;

1/ (1) If from the absence of a witness or any other reasonable

cause it becomes necessary or advisable to postpone the

commencement of or adjourn any inquiry or trial, the court

may from time to time order a postponement or

adjournment on such terms as it thinks fit for such time as

it considers reasonable and may remand the accused if in

custody or may commit him to custody or take bail in his

own recognizance or with sureties for his appearance

Provided however that every trial in the High Court, with a

jury or without a jury, shall as far as practicable, be held

day to day.

(2) Where the accused has attended the court on summons he

shall be enlarged on his own recognizance or on his simple

undertaking to appear, unless for reasons to be recorded

court orders othenvise."

The impugned order was made by the High Court at the end of the

proceedings for the day on 3rd September 2018 and therefore qualifies to be

treated as an order made under Section 263, since this section carries a

marginal note which reads as "Power to postpone or adjourn

proceedings." Section 263(2) permits the trial Court to make an order

13

"otherwise" to the express options envisaged in the said sub section.

Therefore, it is clear that the order of remand made by the High Court was

in fact based on a statutory provision, contrary to the claim by the

Petitioner.

The failure of the High Court, in making the impugned order, to

refer to a statutory provision, by itself would not invalidate or could be

considered as procedural irregularity which warrants exercise of

revisionary powers of this Court in view of the judgment of the Supreme

Court in Kumaranatunga v Samarasinghe (1983) 2 Sri L.R. 63, where it laid

down the principle that;

"It is well-settled that an exercise of a power will be referable to a

jurisdiction which confers validity upon it and not to a jurisdiction

under which it will be nugatory. This principle has been applied even to

cases where a Statute which confers no power has been quoted as

authority for a particular act, and there was in force another Statute

which conferred that power".

The said sub section (2) of Section 263, confers power to a trial Court,

at the adjournment stage of a trial to "enlarge" an accused "on his own

recognizance or his simple undertaking to appear." This subsection also

reserves the power to the trial Court to order "otherwise" but it must

record its reasons for doing so.

Section 263 is not a totally a new provision of procedure that had

been introduced by the Code of Criminal Procedure Act for the first time.

14

In the Criminal Procedure Code, Section 289 did contain more explicit

provision as it empowered to " ... remand the accused if in custody or may

commit him to custody or take bail in his own recognizance or sureties for

his appearance."

In Section 149(1) of the Administration of Justice Law No. 44 of 1973,

it was stated that the trial Court" ... may remand the accused or take bail

for his appearance."

Section 263(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979

is not explicit in the conferment of power to a trial Court in remanding the

accused at adjournment as its predecessors in the Criminal Procedure

Code and Administration of Justice Law. However, the trial Court could

order "otherwise" by making a remand order. Obviously, there is

discretion on the trial Court to enlarge the accused on bail or to make order

" otherwise" .

It was decided in Dayananda v Weerasinghe and Others (1983) 2 Sri

L.R. 84 by the Supreme Court that;

liThe fact remams that the remand orders were made by the

Magistrate in the exercise of his judicial discretion. Even if such

orders were made on false or misleading reports it does not help

the Petitioner in this case because orders made by a Judge in the

exercise of his judicial discretion do not come within the purview

of the special jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 126

of the Constitution, even though such orders may be the result of

a wrongful exercise of the Judge's judicial discretion. In such an

15

event an aggrieved person I s remedy is to invoke the appellate or

revisionary powers of the Appellate Courts. If

This position was reiterated in Danny v Sirinimal Silva and Others

(2001) 1 Sri L.R. 29 as the apex Court held;

"Remanding a person is a judicial act and as such a Magistrate

should bring his judicial mind to bear on that matter before

depriving a person of his liberty. If

The emphasis of bringing the judicial mind of Court to bear upon the

relevant factors in determining the question of whether to remand an

accused or enlarge him on bail is therefore based on the discretion

conferred upon the relevant Court, to be exercised either way depending of

the circumstances of the case before it.

The important question is the way in which such a discretion should

be exercised by a Court. This aspect had received attention by the apex

Court. In Thamodarampillai v Attorney General (2004) 3 Sri L.R. 180, it

was held that;

"Where a statute vests discretion in a court it is of course unwise

to confine its exercise within narrow limits by rigid and inflexible

rules from which a court is never at liberty to depart. Nor indeed

can there be found any absolutes or formula which would

invariably give an answer to different problems which may be

posed in different cases on different facts. The decision must in

each case depend on its own peculiar fads and circumstances. But

16

in order that like cases may be decided alike and that there will be

ensured some uniformity of decisions it is necessary that some

guidance should be laid down for the exercise of that discretion.

Lord Denning pointed out in Ward v ]ames(1965) 1 AER 563.

II The cases all show that when a statute gives a discretion the

courts must not fetter it by rigid rules from which a Judge is

never at liberty to depart. Nevertheless, the courts can lay down

the considerations which should be borne in mind in exercising

the discretion and point out those considerations which should be

ignored. This would normally determine the way in which the

discretion is exercised, and this ensures some measure of

uniformity of decision. From time to time the considerations may

change as public policy changes and so the pattern of decision

may change. I This is all part of the evolutionary process. II

As such, this Court should now venture to consider the question,

whether the High CQurt exercised its discretion reasonably in the given

situation, now challenged by the Petitioner seeking to revise it.

Lord Denning's recommendation for the Courts to lay down the

considerations which should be borne in mind in exercising any discretion

was carried out in In Re Aturupana 51 N.L.R. 21 by Gratian J, sitting alone,

with reference to Section 289 of the Criminal Procedure Code, in following

terms;

"Under our Criminal Procedure Code bail "shall be fixed with

due regard to the circumstances of the accused and shall not be

excessive "- section 396 of the Code. The fixing of bail calls for the

exercise of judicial discretion and for the most anxious care in

17

each case. As has been pointed out in a series of decisions of the

English Courts, the main consideration that should apply is

whether it is probable that the accused will appear to stand his

trial. The other matters for consideration include the nature of the

accusation, the nature of the evidence in support of the

accusation, and the severity of the punishment which conviction

will entail. Section 289 (4) also lays down that where the accused

has attended the Court on summons he shall be enlarged on his

own recognizance or on his simple undertaking to appear, unless

for reasons to be recorded the Court orders otherwise."

Then, this Court must tum its attention to address the issue

whether the High Court has exercised its discretion reasonably in this

particular instance ?

As reproduced above, the Respondent drew our attention to the

fact that the High Court had to re-fix trial dates several times for the trial

against the Petitioner and his co-accused to commence before it, owing to

applications for postponements by them. The prosecution witnesses had

to be summoned and re-summoned due to the change of the trial date

and it had taken over two years and seven months to commence trial

since the service of the indictment on the accused.

In this regard, it is important to recognise the remedy provided by

the Legislature to make some positive impact on the much publicised and

serious problem of laws delays which dented the confidence reposed to

by the general public on the system of administration of justice. With the

amendment introduced to Section 263(1) by the Act No. 14 of 2005, it is

18

stated that" ... every trial in the High Court, with a jury or without a jury,

shall as far as practicable, be held day to day." The said proviso does not make

a distinction between jury and non- jury trials and imposes a mandatory

duty on the trial Courts with the use of the word" shall" to have the trial

be held day to day basis.

This Court was very critical of the instances that were brought to its

notice of any disregard to this positive legislative provision.

In Gunasiri and two Others v Republic of Sri Lanka(2009) 1 Sri L.R. 39,

de Abrew J states thus;

"I would like to make the following observation in this case. It is

unfortunate that the trial Judge has taken 2 years to hear and

conclude this case although it could have been concluded within 7

days. This kind of sloppy conduct will result in erosion of public

confidence in the judicial system of this country. Criminal Trials

must be heard on a day to day basis. Justice demands the adoption

of the said procedure by the Judges in lower Courts. The adoption

of the said procedure will retain public confidence in the judicial

system and help both the trial judge and counsel in the discharge

of their duties. "

The prosecution is not spared either when it found wanting with

the compliance of the rule to conduct prosecutions expeditiously. A

divisional bench of this Court, in Wickramasinghe v Attorney General

(2010) 1 Sri L.R. 141, had imposed a duty on the prosecution to conclude

criminal prosecutions during a specified time line, in view of Sections 16

and 17 of the Bail Act, as it was held;

~9

1/ it is the duty of the prosecution to have the case concluded

within a period of two years. Contention that in this country it

takes more than two years to conclude a criminal case and

therefore the intention of the legislature was, when enacting the

Bail Act, to keep a suspect/accused on remand for more than two

years is also untenable because no one can say that the Legislature

was unaware of the situation of criminal courts of this country

when the Bail Act was being enacted. "

In view of these considerations it is obvious, that the trial Courts

must make a conscious and genuine effort to have the proceedings in a

criminal trial on day to day basis if any meaningful progress to be

achieved in the problem the amendment sought to address. The

limitation contained in this proviso termed as "as far as practicable", if it

is understood by the trial Courts, in the context of circumstances that are

unavoidable in its strictest sense, would minimise its misuse by all the

stake holders in the criminal justice system.

Then the question arises, whether the High Court, in compliance of

its mandatory duty of conducting the trial expeditiously, had thereby

acted unreasonably in exercising its discretion, conferred on it under

Section 263(1) in remanding the Petitioner?

At the end of the proceedings for the day and in adjournment, the

High Court made order refusing to enlarge the Petitioner on bail. By

doing so, the High Court had effectively rescinded an existing order of

20

bail, given in favour of the Petitioner by the same Court when it served

indictment on him.

Learned President's Counsel, in his submissions complained that

the High Court failed to direct the Petitioner to show cause before it made

order cancelling the existing bail order and more importantly had failed

to give its reasons by remanding him with a short sentence simply

stating that he is remanded. This, according to the learned President's

Counsel is a grave irregularity that vitiates the subsequent order.

Clearly this submission is made in the light of the relevant

provisions contained in the Bail Act. However, it is the collective

reasoning of the line of authorities that were decided in pre Bail Act era,

that when a Court makes an order of cancellation of bail, depriving the

accused of his freedom, should show cause the accused as to why his bail

should not be cancelled.

When the proceedings before the High Court on 17th October 2017

are examined carefully, it is evident that the High Court did give notice to

the Petitioner that the subsisting bail order would be rescinded once the

trial commences. He was advised by the High Court that he could attend

Parliament sessions from the remand. This was the day on which all

parties expressed their acceptance that the trial once commenced on 3rd

September 2018, would proceed on day to day basis.

21

As submitted by the Petitioner, that there are two orders made by

the High Court that deprived his liberty. The 1st order is the one made at

the commencement of the proceedings that the accused are remanded.

Then the 2nd order was made in refusing to grant bail at the point of

adjournment. The Petitioner admits that he was not treated differently

with any other accused in the case by the High Court.

Contrary to the claim, the High Court, under the title "Order"

clearly laid down its reasons for refusing the application for bail made by

the Petitioner.

The reasons that are attributed for the refusal to enlarge the

Petitioner on bail as per the order of High Court dated 3rd September

2018, are as follows;

a. It has been the consistent practice of the trial Court to remand

the accused as all cases are taken up for trial on day to day basis

or at very short intervals,

b. In order to ensure the presence of the accused to their trial,

c. There will be no postponement of trial under any reason for

both parties.

Thus, it seems that this is essentially a question of trial

management by the Court by continuing with the trial on a day to day

basis while the accused are in remand, which is in conflict with the

individual freedom of the Petitioner. However, as already noted the

question that had to be decided by this Court is whether the High Court

22

had exercised its discretion reasonably in making the impugned order

remanding the Petitioner at the adjournment.

In the light of the statutory provisions and the observations

expressed by this Court on delays in taking up trials, the High Court had

acted on a statutory provision which had conferred a discretion on it to

remand the accused at adjournment on the reasons that it had given.

These reasons, when considered in the light of the long delay in the trial

getting off the ground and the Petitioner's contribution to it with his other

concerns could well have impacted negatively on the Petitioner, leading

to a reasonable belief of his continued participation in the trial. In these

circumstances, we are unable to conclude that the High Court had acted

unreasonably when it, in ensuring the uninterrupted continuation of trial,

decided to remand him. Given the history of repeated postponements of

the trial, the concern of the High Court to bring the trial to its conclusion

without undue delay had to be understood in the proper context.

We would venture to observe that the trial Courts must be given

wider latitude in determining the best way to manage the trial, mainly to

ensure effective compliance with the mandatory statutory provisions

concerning the conduct of trials. It is common knowledge in the Criminal

Justice System criminal trials are regularly postponed due to a variety of

reasons, although the genuineness of some of the reasons are obviously

doubtful. As Lord Denning said "when a statute gives a discretion the courts

must not fetter it by rigid rules from which a Judge is never at liberty to depart

... " and therefore, it is not for this Court to identify and classify them. It is

best to leave to assess the situation that had arisen to the discretion to the

trial Judge who is in the best position to decide the issue. But this Court

L3

stresses that when it does exercise its discretion to the detriment of the

accused, it must take all possible steps to ensure strict compliance to the

applicable statutory provisions and its adherence to rules of natural

justice.

The order of the High Court, in remanding the Petitioner, is not

obnoxious to the provisions of the Section 14 of the Bail Act, even if it has

relevance to the instant matter, and to the judgment of Anuruddha

Ratwatte v The Attorney General (supra), in exercising discretion under

Section 263 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

In Section 14(1)(a)(ii) of the Bail Act, it is stated that if the Court has

reason to believe that such a person would" ... otherwise obstruct the

course of justice" it could cancel a subsisting bail order. Some relevant

extracts of the speech of the Hon. Minister of Justice, in presenting the

Bail Act to Parliament are reproduced in the judgment of the divisional

bench of the Supreme Court in Shiyam v Officer in charge, Narcotics

Bureau and Another (2006) 2 Sri L.R.156 in the following manner;

"The intention of the legislature that there should be situations where

bail could be refused is also clear by the statement that stated the

principal reasons for the refusal of bail. Referring to such refusal, the

then Han. Minister of Justice, Prof G. L. Peiris stated that,

II Mr. Speaker, there are only four principal reasons for the refusal

of bail ...... The fact of the reasons, Mr. Speaker, is that the person

concerned will not appear to stand trial. In other words, he will

abscond, he will be a fugitive from justice. In that situation,

24

obviously, you cannot grant bail. The second reason is interference

with witness or obstruction of the course of justice that will frustrate

the objectives of a (air, impartial and objective trial..." (emphasis

added)

It is clear from the said statement as to the intention of the

Legislature in incorporation the phrase 1/ otherwise obstruct the course

of justice" as it meant to negate the adverse effect on the trial by an action

of an accused" that will frustrate the objectives of a fair, impartial and objective

trial. /I

Thus, it is clear that the Bail Act too had provisions, under which a

trial Court could remand an accused at adjournment of a criminal triat in

acting under Section 14(1)(a)(ii) of the Bail Act, it is stated that if the Court

has reason to believe that such an accused would 1/ otherwise obstruct the

course of justice" by absenting himself.

In Cader v Officer in Charge, Narcotics Bureau (2006) 3 Sri L.R. 74,

it was held that;

"Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of

justice has occurred due to a fundamental rule of procedure being

violated, but only when a strong case is made out amounting to a

positive miscarriage of justice. (Vanik Incorporation Ltd v

Jayasekera(1997) 2 Sri L.R. 365)."

25

In view of the above reasoning, we conclude that the Petitioner has

failed to make a case with exceptional circumstances where a positive

miscarriage of justice had occasioned. Accordingly, we make order

refusing the application of the Petitioner seeking to revise the impugned

orders of the High Court dated 3rd September 2018.

We make further order dismissing the petition of the Petitioner.
