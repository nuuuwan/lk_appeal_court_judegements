JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The Petitioner- Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant) had filed an application in the Provincial High Court of the

Central Province holden in Kandy praying for a writ of Certiorari to quash

the decision of the 1st Respondent to register the 4th Respondent as the

owner of the premises bearing No. 203 of 7th Post, Matale Road, Akurana.

.- .

Further, the Appellant had also prayed from the Provincial High Court, a

writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent to insert the name of one

AS Noor Mohammed as the owner thereof.

Perusal of the judgment dated 2005-05-19 pronounced by the learned

Provincial High Court Judge, shows that he has refused the application of

the Appellant on the ground that the Appellant has violated rule 3(1).1

It is because the Appellant had failed to submit the originals or certified

copies of the documents he had relied on, in support of his case that the

learned Provincial High Court Judge had arrived at the said conclusion.

In arriving at the said conclusion learned Provincial High Court Judge had

taken in to consideration

i. the fact that the said application was filed in the Provincial High Court

on 2003-04-02;

ii. that the relevant documents were not available before Courts even

when the said application was taken up for argument for the second

time on 2004-12-06;

1 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

iii. that the court had informed the Appellant to support any application

to admit the said documents with notice to the Respondent;

iv. that the Appellant had sought permission to tender those documents

on 2005-03-10 and the Court had directed the Appellant to support

that application on the next argument date;

v. that when the said application was made on 2005-03-10, learned

counsel for the Respondent had objected to the said application.

It is appropriate at this juncture to turn to the rules relevant to this issue.

Rule 3 (1) (a)2 states as follows;

" .... Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the

powers vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the

Constitution shall be by way of petition, together with an affidavit in

support of the averments therein, and shall be accompanied by the

originals of documents material to such application (or duly certified copies

thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender any

such document, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the

leave of the Court to furnish such documents later. Where a petitioner fails

2Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

6

to comply with the provisions of this rule the Court may, ex mere mortu or

at the instance of any party, dismiss such application.

(b) Every application by way of revision or restitutio in intergrum under

Article 138 of the constitution shall be made in like manner together with

copies of the relevant proceedings (including pleadings and documents

produced), in the Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution to

which such application relates ............. "

While plain reading of the above rules makes it clear that it is mandatory for

a Petitioner to tender originals or duly certified copies of documents material

to his/her application, this Court as well as the Supreme Court has repeatedly

held that it is so. One such example is the case of Shanmugawadivu Vs

Kulathilake3 In that case the Supreme court has held as follows " ....... the

new Rules permit an applicant to file documents later, if he has stated his

inability in filing the relevant documents along with his application, and had

taken steps to seek the leave of the Court to furnish such documents. In

such circumstances, the only kind of discretion that could be exercised by

3 2003 (1) 5 L R 216.

. 7

Court is to see whether and how much time could be permitted for the filing

of papers in due course.

The appellant had made no such statements in her petition and the Court

of Appeal had rightly decided that in the absence of the relevant

documents, the Court is "unable to exercise its revisionary powers in

respect of the order sought to be revised" by the Appellant. ..... "

It is to be observed that the Appellant neither sought leave of Court nor

had undertaken in the petition4 he filed in the Provincial High Court to

tender originals or duly certified copies of the documents he relies on.

The Appellant has neither controverted the position taken up by the

Respondent with regard to non-tendering of certified copies to the

Provincial High Court nor had taken any step to address that issue. It is

also to be noted that despite the undertaking, the Appellant has not filed

written submissions after the argument was concludeds in this Court.

As has been stated in this judgement before, our courts have conSistently

held that the compliance of these rules is mandatory. There is no

acceptable reason as to why the Appellant had not complied with this rule.

As has been done by this Court in several of its judgements (where this

Court had to deal with the question of compliance of rules), it would re-

iterate the importance of the following passage from the judgement in the

case of Brown & Co. Ltd. and another Vs. Ratnayake, Arbitrator and

others.6

".... So the fact that the record was subsequently made available to court

is not an excuse for faIlure to comply with basic requirements of the rule.

To hold otherwise would lead to unfairness. The Rule itself is a

commonsense response to litigants wanting the disturbance of an order or

award It is no more than a normal procedural step deemed necessary to

inform both court and respondents of the matters of complaint It is

consistent with ordinary practice. One cannot claim a right to proceed to

the next step without compliance with a valid invocation of jurisdiction in

the first place. Such would lead to uncertainty, unreasonableness and

oppressive results. In this sense the rule is mandatory . ... If7

The Supreme Court took this view despite the fact that this rule8 did not

specifically provide for dismissal for non-observance of Rule 46.

In these circumstances, this Court sees no reason to interfere with the

findings of the learned Provincial High Court Judge. Thus, this Court

decides to dismiss this appeal with costs.
