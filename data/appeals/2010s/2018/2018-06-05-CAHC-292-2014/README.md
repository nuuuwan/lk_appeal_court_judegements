The appellants were indicted in the High Court of Colombo for the

murder of Magalage Ariyapala punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial they were convicted for the said offence, and sentenced to death.

Witness Dammika who is an eye witness and the daughter of the

deceased had been doing her homework seated in the balcony close to the

deceased around 7.30 p.m., when some people have jumped into their balcony

from the next door roof and kicked the chair the deceased was seated on. After

the deceased fell on the floor he was first stabbed by 'Ata' Chaminda followed

by Suranga the first appellant and Janaka the second appellant had been there

with them. Oammika has gone inside and hidden in a pantry cupboard. Other

2

inmates of the house have come to the balcony after the incident. Dammika

was only ten years old at that time. The assailants were previously known to

her.

Witness Dammika has been consistent in her evidence and categorically

stated that she saw the incident as she was seated by the side of her father. It

was put to her that the appellants did not come to attack her father but she has

denied the said position.

Witness Mangalika the wife of the deceased who had come to the

balcony after hearing a commotion had seen three persons getting onto the

adjoining roof and has identified one of them as 'Ata' Chaminda armed with a

knife and the first appellant. She had only seen the second appellant's shadow

whom her daughter Dammika identified as the second appellant.

These two witnesses have stated that they saw the people who came

from the light of the street lamp and that the first witness did her homework from

this light. According to the prosecution this house had been built on 2.2 perches

of land and one could touch the street lamp from the balcony. The prosecution

witness Mangalika had said that they did not have to switch on the lights in the

house since they got enough light form the street lamp.

Witness Sumanawathi sister of the deceased had been downstairs and

hearing cries she has rushed out to the road in front and seen two persons

stabbing the deceased. This witness has said that the street lamp was not

burning at the time of the incident (vide page 176 and 178 of the brief) and that

she did not identify the persons who attacked the deceased and that she only

saw their shadows. Sumanawathi's evidence has contradicted the evidence of

Dammika's and Mangalika's evidence on the issue of light.

The learned counsels for the appellant argued that there wasn't sufficient

light for witness Dammika to identify the appellants therefore one can not say

that the appellants were properly identified by the witnesses. It was further

argued that the Learned High Court Judge holding that the appellants did not

explain about lighting is a miscarriage of justice. The appellants have stated in

evidence that they were not there hence how can they explain about lighting?

This is a wrong finding on the part of the learned High Court Judge.

The learned counsels for the appellants argued that Sumanawathi's

evidence is beneficial to the appellants and the learned High Court Judge failed

to consider her evidence.

Witness Dammika's and Sumanawathi's evidence contradicts on the

evidence regarding light and the Learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider this item of evidence which amounts to the appellant's being denied

of a fair hearing.

/ ./ "

All the witnesses have testified before the Learned High Court Judge

who delivered the judgment. Therefore she had the opportunity to see the

demeanor and deportment of the witnesses. Vide Bandara vs AG 1999 (3)

SLR 168. Evidence of Sumanawathi is not there in the narration of evidence by

the High Court Judge. The narration of evidence runs into 17 pages out of 21

pages in the judgment. But the learned High Court Judge omitted totally the

evidence of Sumanawathi from her consideration.

Though Dammika's evidence have discrepancies on the availability of

light she can not be disbelieved. But her evidence and the evidence of

Sumanawathi has to be analysed by the trial judge who could see the demeanor

and deportment of the witnesses which this court can not do. Therefore we have

to agree with the learned President's counsel for the appellants that they did

not have a fair trial. Vide Banda vs AG 1999 (3) SLR 168.

Considering the fact that the appellants were in remand custody after

conviction since October 2014, we decide to send this case back to the High

Court for a retrial. We set aside the judgment and conviction dated 23/10/2014.

The Learned High Court Judge is directed to give priority to this case.
