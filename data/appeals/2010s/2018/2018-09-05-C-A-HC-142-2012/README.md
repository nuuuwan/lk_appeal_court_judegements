JUDGMENT

s. Thurairaja, PC. J

The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter called and referred to as "the Appellant") was

indicted under Section 54A (d) and (b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Act for possession and trafficking respectively. After the trial before the High Court

Judge of Colombo he was found guilty on both counts and imposed a life sentence.

Being aggrieved with the said conviction and sentence the Appellant preferred this

appeal and submits following grounds.

I. Section 4(1 )(d) of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights Act

is violated by the trial Judge.

II. The evidence were not properly evaluated by the Learned Trial Judge.

Ill. Section 126(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act was misinterpreted by

the Learned Trial Judge.

Prosecution led the evidence of Assistant Superintendent of Police Priyantha

Liyanage, Police Sergeant Mahagamage Kapila Indrajith Senaratne, Government

Analyst Kokawela Pathirage Chandrani and Inspector of Police Asanga Kumarasiri

Jayamanne.

It will be appropriate to understand the facts of the case before we proceed further.

According to the available evidence the facts reveals as follows.

As per the prosecution, on 30/10/2002 an information was received from an

informant of PC Priyantha 37501 that a person called Niswar would be bringing

heroin near to Rahumaniya Hotel at Wellampitiya area between 10.30 to 11.30 p.m.

(page 69).

CA 142/2012 JUDGMENT Page 2 of9

Accordingly, on receipt of information, it was recorded by the Police Narcotic Bureau

(PNB), a team was assigned, preliminaries were observed and team left the Police

Narcotic Bureau around 09.25 p.m. (page 71). They went near to a Filling Station at

Rosemead Lane to meet the informant there.

Having met the informant, the team arrived to Rahumaniya Hotel. Whilst they

awaited the arrival of the accused-appellant, the informant pointed out a person who

was coming from the round-about towards Rahumaniya Hotel who carried a parcel

on his right hand. ASP Priyantha Liyanage quickly went there and ordered to stop to

that person and informed him of his identity and searched. The search of the parcel

he carried, found a substance of heroin packet, and a box which contained a scale

and a bundle of cellophane bags and his identity was revealed and found that

accused-appellant residing at No.125/1 B, Lansiyawaththa, Wellampitiya. As stated

above, this recovery resulted in his arrest at 11.15 p.m. His house was also searched

soon thereafter but no incriminative substance was found in that house.

The position of the Accused was that on 30/10/2002, he was at home when some

officers came and inquired about heroin. Then the PNB arrested him and assaulted.

In that moment, some officers from the Wellampitiya Police were come and then

they got to know that they are from PNB and left that place. According to the

Accused's version, Wellampitiya Police came to his residence because they had

received a telephone call from a lady nearby his house that someone had come to

the Accused's house and assaulted him.

At the trial, the prosecution led the evidence on the raid, detection and arrest,

scientific evidence on the identification of narcotics and evidence in relation to the

chain of productions of the drugs recovered from the possession of the accused.

When SI Liyanage was giving evidence, learned defence counsel suggested to him

that SI Liyanage assaulted the accused-appellant and arrested the accused-appellant

when he was in his home. But he rejected that and stated that those injuries were

happened when they searched in the upstairs of the house because the stair case

CA 142/2012 JUDGMENT Page 3 of9

was very much slippery. The defence has called Doctor Dhammika Wasanthi

Ariyaratne to give evidence and confirmed the injuries on the Appel/ant.

Considering the nature of the ground of appeal it was decided to consider all three

grounds together.

The 1 st and 3rd ground referred to one issue namely that the Appellant was not given

an opportunity to bring a witness of his choice.

International Covenant on Civil and Political Right Act No.56 of 2007 (hereinafter

referred to as the ICCPR Act). The Section 4(1) of the ICCPR Act stated as;

A person charged of a criminal offence under any written law, shall be entitled

(d) To examine or to have examined the witnesses against him and to obtain the

attendance of witnesses on his behalf, under the same conditions as witnesses

called against him;

Section 126A of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act stated as;

(7) No person shall be entitled during a trial on indictment in the High Court, to

adduce evidence in support of the defence of an alibi, unless he has-

(0) stated such fact to the police at the time of his making his statement during

the investigation; or

(b) stated such fact at any time during the preliminary inquiry; or

(c) raised such defence, after indictment has been served, with notice to the

Attorney-General at any time prior to fourteen days of the date of

commencement of the trial:

Provided however, the Court may, if it is of opinion that the accused has

adduced reasons which are sufficient to show why he delayed to raise the

defence of alibi within the period set out above, permit the accused at any time

thereafter but prior to the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, to raise the

defence of alibi.

CA 142/2012 JUDGMENT Page 4 of9

(2) The original statement should contain all such information as to the time

and place at which such person claims he was and details as to the persons if

any, who may furnish evidence in support of his alibi.

(3) For the purposes of this section "evidence in support of an alibi" means

evidence tending to show that by reason of the presence of the defendant at a

particular place or in particular area at a particular time he was not, or was not

likely to have been, at the place where the offence is alleged to have been

committed at the time of the alleged commission.

On perusing the trial brief, I find that the Appellant had made a detailed dock

statement and called a Judicial Medical Officer to give evidence on his behalf. He

then attempted to call to his wife to adduce evidence regarding the defence of

alibi. As provided in Section 126(a) a defence of alibi should be taken up in a

procedure spelled out in the relevant section. The indictment was forwarded him

on i h October 2004 and the trial commenced in 2009. It was concluded in 2012.

The Appellant was represented by competent Attorney-at-law. The Appellant

never took steps to take a defence of alibi under section 126A. Hence the

decision of the High Court Judge on the basis of the relevant section is

acceptable. Therefore we dismiss these two grounds of appeal.

The Appellant submits that the Learned Trial Judge has not properly considered

the evidence before him. The Judgment of the learned Trial Judge contains in 23

pages. He had gone through the evidence of each and every witness considered

and recorded his findings in his judgment. He carefully analyse the statement

made by the Accused- Appellant from the dock. Further he had considered the

evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer. These two evidence were compared with

the evidence submitted by the prosecution and come to a reasonable finding.

CA 142/2012 JUDGMENT Page 5 of9

Considering the Judgment of the Learned Trial Judge in the light of the available

evidence before the trial court, it is my view that the finding is reasonable and

warranted by the facts of the case. Therefore I have no reason to interfere with

the finding of the Learned Trial Judge.

Accordingly we find all three grounds of the Appellant fails on its own merits.

The Appellant had possessed 210 grams of brown colour powder which was

suspected as Heroin at the time of the arrest. Further he had a weight-scale with

weights. On a chemical examination the Government Analyst had found 51.2 grams

of pure Dicetyl Morphine contended in that brown powder. The facts reveals that the

Appellant had possessed and trafficked the said substance.

According to the section 54 of the of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act

any person who possessed more than 2 grams of Heroin (Dicetyl Morphine) shall be

punished with death or lifetime imprisonment.

In this case he possessed of 51.2 grams which is much higher than the maximum

level. Therefore we invited to both counsels to address the Court.

In Dhananjay Chatterjee vs. State of West Bengal [1994 2 SCC 220] it was held

that,

"the measure of punishment in a given case must depend upon the atrocity of

the crime; the conduct of the criminal and the defenceless and unprotected state

of the victim. Imposition of appropriate punishment is the manner in which the

courts respond to the society's cry for justice against the criminals. Justice

demands that courts should impose punishment befitting the crime so that the

courts reflect public abhorrence of the crime. The courts must not only keep in

CA 142/2012 JUDGMENT Page 6 of9

view the rights of the criminal but also the rights of the victim af crime and the

society at large while considering imposition of appropriate punishment:'

In Sevaka Perumal etc vs. State of Tamil Nadu (AIR 1991 SC 1463)

"Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do harm to the justice

system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society

could not long endure under serious threats. If the courts did not protect the

injured the injured would the resort to private vengeance. It is, therefore, the

duty of every court to awards proper sentence having regard to the nature of the

offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed etc. ..

The legislatures were mindful of the gravity of the offence. That is why they have

provided Capital Punishment for this offence. It is rarely a Capital Punishment is

provided in our legal system. Therefore when a Judge impose a sentence he should

be mindful of the intention of the legislature.

In this case the Learned Trial Judge had considered the gravity of the offence and

conceded that this is a serious offence. But he had stated as follows .

CA 142/2012 JUDGMENT Page 7of9

The translation states as follows: "execution of death penalty is not a duty of

the Judiciary and it is vested with another institution of the government. I have

observed, there is a huge row for death penalty, and it creates a problem in the

prison also. So, neither /' am going to put another person to that huge row nor

to punish a person with a sentence that limited to the case record. So, /' am

going to move to the other sentence, namely lifetime rigorous imprisonment

because, in that situation accused has to wark for his foads provided by the

government.

It is my humble view that the judiciary should not interfere with the duty of the

Executive. It is appropriate for the trial judge to consider the facts before him and to

make considered decision of imposing a sentence. In the present case it is my view

that the reasons given to impose minimum sentence is not appropriate. Therefore

considering the gravity of the offence I vacate the sentence of life imprisonment and

impose death sentences on the 1 sl and 2nd counts.

We direct the Judge of the High Court of Colombo to act under Section 280 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act and to pass the death sentence accordingly.

Appeal Dismissed.

Sentences enhanced.
