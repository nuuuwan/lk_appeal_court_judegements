Samayawardhena, J.

The 3rd defendant-petitioner filed this application for revision

and restitutio in integrum seeking to set aside (a) the

Interlocutory Decree entered dated 27.08.1999 and (b) the order

delivered dated 24.03.2016 by the District Judge of Panadura in

Partition Case No. 129/P.

Let me first consider the (a) above.

The 3rd defendant has filed a Final Appeal against the

Interlocutory Decree dated 27.08.1999 before this Court (CA

1275/1999/F), and this Court by Judgment dated 22.09.2008

has dismissed that appeal.

Once the Final Appeal is dismissed, it is elementary that the 3rd

defendant, 10 years after the said Judgment, cannot come

before this Court again by way of revision seeking the same

reliefsetting to aside the Interlocutory Decree.

If that is allowed, each and every appellant who fails in the Final

Appeal, can have a second bite of the cherry, by filing a Revision

Application before the same Court seeking the same relief.

The first relief cannot be granted.

This leads me to consider the (b) above.

That relates to the order made by the District Judge in terms of

section 36 of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, as amended,

after the Scheme Inquiry. The 3rd defendant, in terms of section

36A of the said Law, has filed a Leave to Appeal application

against the said order of the District Court before the High Court

3

of Civil Appeal of Kalutara (WP/HCCA/LA/18/2016) and the

High Court of Civil Appeal has refused Leave by order dated

16.06.2016.

The 3rd defendant has then sought Special Leave to Appeal

against the said order of the High Court of Civil Appeal from the

Supreme Court (SC/HCCA/LA 372/2016), but later withdrawn.

It is thereafter, the 3rd defendant has filed this Revision

Application before this Court seeking to set aside the same order

of the District Court which was canvassed earlier by way of a

Leave to Appeal Application before the High Court of Civil

Appeal.

Once Leave to Appeal is refused by the High Court, it is

elementary that the 3rd defendant, more than 2 years after the

said order of refusal, cannot come before this Court again by

way of revision seeking the same reliefsetting aside the order

dated 24.03.2016 of the District Court made after the Scheme

Inquiry.

If that is allowed, each and every party who fails in obtaining

Leave to Appeal against an order, can have a second bite of the

cherry, by filing a revision application before the same High

Court which made the order or before this Court seeking the

same relief.

The second relief also cannot be granted.

Notice refused. Application dismissed.
