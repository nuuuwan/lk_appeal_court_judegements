Decided on: 25.05.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The 1st, 3rd and 9th defendants filed this appeal with leave obtained

from the order of the learned District Judge of Kalutara dated

14.05.2002 whereby the Plan No. 648B dated 27.12.2000 of D.R.

Kumarage, L.S., was confirmed as the Final Partition Plan.

However only the 9th defendant prosecuted the appeal.

In the Judgment dated 02.11.1987 delivered after trial, the 9th

defendant was not given any soil rights in the corpus, but declared

entitled to house No. 19 in Lot B of the Preliminary Plan No. 220 of

E.T. Goonawardena, L.S. The appeal filed against the said

Judgment by the 9th defendant was dismissed by this Court in

case No. CA/732/87(F) on 11.01.19961 and leave to appeal sought

against the said Judgment of this Court was refused by the

Supreme Court on 27.06.1996 in case No. SC Special LA No.

62/96.2

According to Plan No. 648B, the said house No. 19 falls into Lot

No. 11 allotted to the plaintiff.

The application of the 9th defendant before this Court in the prayer

to the amended petition is to allot the portion of land where house

No. 19 is situated to the 7th defendant so that he can continue to

occupy the house as he is alleged to have obtained some soil rights

from the 7th defendant and several others by way of Deeds

executed after the Interlocutory Decree was entered. These alleged

Deeds executed after the partition action was duly registered as a

lis pendens are void as being obnoxious to section 66 of the

Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, as amended. (Virasinghe v.

Virasinghe3) The 9th defendant in any event does not make any

claim on those Deeds in the present appeal.

It is significant to note that the 9th defendant made the same

application before the District Judge (i.e. to prepare the final

scheme of partition to include house No. 19 in the allotment of

land to be given either to the 3rd or the 7th defendant), and the

District Judge has refused that application by order dated

20.01.1998.4 Moreover, the appeal preferred against the said order

of the District Judge dated 20.01.19985 has been refused by this

Court by Judgment dated 30.07.1998 in case No. CA/159/98(F).6

Thereafter proposed Final Plan No. 648 dated 28.11.19987 has

been prepared and several parties including the plaintiff have

objected to it.8 Thereupon the District Judge has made the order

dated 18.05.19999 whereby the learned Judge inter alia came to

the strong findings that (a) the surveyor was wrong to have allotted

the Lot to which house No.19 fell to the 7th defendant against the

earlier order dated 20.01.1998 and (b) the 9th defendant is also not

entitled to compensation for house No. 19 in view of the order

dated 26.07.1993 in Case No.3912/L (X5). It is significant to note

that the 9th defendant did not file a leave to appeal application

against this crucial order.

Thereafter proposed Final Plan No. 648A dated 28.08.199910 has

been prepared in terms of the aforesaid order dated 18.05.1999

and the 9th defendant has objected to that Plan11 on the basis that

the Lot into which the house No. 19 fell was not allotted to the 7th

defendant.

The impugned order dated 14.05.2002 has then been made

accepting Plan No 648B as the Final Partition Plan on the simple

ground that the said Plan has been prepared in terms of the earlier

order dated 18.05.1999. The impugned order taken in isolation is

a perfect order as the District Judge had no reason or right to

make a fresh order contrary to the earlier order.

At the argument before this Court, what the Learned Presidents

Counsel for the 9th defendant essentially did was to canvass not

the impugned order dated 14.05.2002 but the earlier order dated

18.05.1999 (made more than three years before the impugned

order) against which no leave to appeal was sought. Learned

counsel for the plaintiff strenuously objected to that line of

argument. I will leave that important question of law to be

considered in an appropriate case as this appeal can be decided

against the 9th defendant even if that question is answered in his

favour.

It has been held in the unreported Judgment of this Court in

Bandara v. Hemalatha Kularatne12 that a party to a partition action

who had no soil rights to the land to be partitioned (in that case a

tenant) has no legal right to intervene in and canvass the scheme of

partition.

In Hamidu v. Gunasekera13 it was held that "A person entitled

merely to an interest in a building on a land which has become the

subject of a partition action can only obtain compensation for the

interest in the building, and cannot get any share of the land in the

partition."

In the instant action, the 9th defendant who does not have soil

rights is not interested in compensation at all. His only plea before

this Court is to allot the portion of land where the house No. 19 is

situated to the 7th defendant. His application is legally untenable.

In any event, the 9th defendant is not entitled to compensation for

improvements made after the Interlocutory Decree. As was held in

Podi Appuhamy v. Danial Appuhamy14 "Where interlocutory decree

has been entered in a partition action, a party to the decree is not

entitled to claim as against the other parties the ownership of, or

compensation for, improvements made on the common property

subsequent to the date of the interlocutory decree." I must add that

when the Interlocutory Decree is entered is irrelevant as the

entering of the decree is a purely ministerial act and the

Interlocutory Decree when entered relates back to the date of

Judgment. (Koralage v. Marikkar Mohomad15)

12 CALA 66/2002 decided on 04.01.2004 13 (1922) 24 NLR 143 at 145 14 (1957) 59 NLR 307 15 [1988] 2 Sri LR 299 at 305

After the Judgment in the partition action was pronounced and the

Interlocutory Decree was entered, upon the 9th defendant making

constructions on the land, the plaintiff has filed a separate case

No. L/3912 against the 9th defendant. In that case, the 9th

defendant has expressly agreed not to claim any compensation for

any constructions made after the partition Judgment.16 In view of

the aforesaid settlement entered in the said case No. L/3912 and

also the proceedings of the District Court in the partition action,17

it is clear that the 9th defendant has made some constructions or

substantial improvements to house No. 19 after the partition

Judgment. The 9th defendant is not entitled to have compensation

for those improvements.

It is true that house No. 19 was there when the preliminary survey

was done as is seen from the Preliminary Plan. However no

evidence has been led by the 9th defendant at the scheme inquiry

to establish that what was in existence at the stage of scheme

inquiry was the same house as depicted in the Preliminary Plan

without any substantial alterations or improvements. There is no

way to distinguish improvements made prior to and after the

Interlocutory Decree. Hence the direction of the District Judge to

the surveyor in the order dated 18.05.1999 not to assess building

No. 19 for the purpose of payment of compensation to the 9th

defendant, in the facts and circumstances of this case, is

justifiable.

Taking all the circumstances into account I see no merit in this

appeal. Appeal is dismissed but without costs.
