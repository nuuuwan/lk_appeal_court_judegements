M.M.A. Gaffoor, 1.

This is an appeal from the District Court of Kuliyapitiya.

The main point of contest in this appeal is the conditions under which a

Muslim could revoke a deed of gift in respect of an immovable property.

The Plaintiff-Respondent originally instituted the instant action in the

District Court of Kuliyapitiya to partition the land called "Bulugahamullahena"

and now "Watte" morefully described in the schedule to the original

plaint dated 06.07.1993 (vide page 70) and subsequently by his

amended plaint dated 06.07.1993 (vide page 75) and setting out the

pedigree with the devolution of title.

It is not in dispute that the original owner was one Seyyadu Fathima

who was the mother of the Plaintiff-Respondent and she became entitled

to the corpus sought to be partitioned in this action in terms of deed

No. 10183 dated 18.03.1943. Thereafter the said Seyyadu Fathima

transferred an undivided Y4 share of the land in the said corpus and V2

share of the house situated in the said corpus by deed No. 5633 dated

09.03.1969 marked PI (vide page 255) to her son Khalid.

Thereafter the said Khalid transferred his rights that he had obtained in

terms of the deed no. 5633 to his father Abusallih by executing a deed

no. 1089 dated 18.08.1974 marked P2 (vide page 259). The father

Abusallih thereafter gifted by deed no: 6253 dated 14.01.1981 marked P3

(vide page 216) his title to his three sons; the Plaintiff the 1st Defendant

and the 2nd Defendant.

The said Seyyadu Fathima died intestate and her husband and the eight

children including the Plaintiff-Respondent and the Defendant-Appellants

succeeded to the remaining 3f4 share of the land and Y2 share of the

house as intestate heirs under Muslim law. This is not in dispute.

The dispute arises in what Abusalih did thereafter which was to revoke

the deed of gift 6253 and gifted all his rights and interests to his son,

the Plaintiff-Respondent by deed no: 9564. The Plaintiff-Respondent

submits that the deed of gift no: 6253 was revocable and the

Defendant-Appellant dispute this.

It is not in dispute between the parties that in respect of deeds of gifts

between the law that ought to be applied is Muslim law (section 3 of

the Muslim Intestate Succession Ordinance No: 10 of 1931). It is also

not in dispute that under classic Muslim law that possession of the

5

subject matter of the gift must be handed over to the donee for the

gift to be complete and upon completion it remain irrevocable. However

in this case the deed of gift 6253 was subject to the life interest of the

donor - the father Abusalih. Reservation of t he life interest does not

complete the gift under Muslim law (Sultan v Peiris 35 NLR 57).

Therefore the gift in the deed of gift no: 6253 is per se in valid.

Furthermore the application of the classic Islamic law is subject to the

proviso to section 3 of the Muslim Intestate Succession Ordinance which

is as follows.

Provided that no deed of donation shall be deemed to be irrevocable

unless it is so stated in the deed and the delivery of the deed to the

donee shall be accepted as evidence of delivery of possession of the

moveable or immovable property donated by the deed.

The deed no: 6253 does not state that it is irrevocable. Words in

statutes must always be given their literal meaning unless they result in

absurdity. There is nothing absurd in interpreting the word 'stated in the

deed' to mean 'expressly stated' and this meaning is in accord with

actual notarial practice of specifically stating whether a deed is revocable

or not and it appears that the intention of Parliament in enacting the

6

Muslim Intestate succession Ordinance was to bring clarity in to that

area of law.

The Defendant -Appellants rely on the words "Sadakalayatama" in the

deed no: 6253 and the judgment in Sinna Marikkar V Thangaratnam

57 NLR 260 does not state that even if it is 'implicitly stated' that it

would be good enough to meet the standared in the proviso to section

3. His observation is that 'I find no words in the deed from which a

renunciation of the right of revocation appears either expressly or by

necessary implication.' It is not an interpretation of section 3 of the

Muslim Intestate Succession Ordinance specifically. In any case the words

'Sadakalayatama' does not necessarily imply that the deed of gift is

irrevocable. The deed could be interpreted as gift granted 'forever' unless

and until revoked. That interpretation also cannot be excluded. Therefore

the 'necessary' implication is not that the deed of gift was irrevocable.

In this appeal 1st & 2nd Defendant Appellant had filed further written submissions

by way of a motion 6th December 2017, in which he had drawn the attention of

this Court to the issues mainly No.1, namely did abusally who has gifted an

undivided l/4th share in the subject matter of this action to the 1st & 2nd

defendants, and the Plaintiff in this action in terms of Deed No.6253( P3) dated

..

7

14th January 1981, revoked the said deed in terms of Deed No.9563 (P4) dated

29th Nov. 1987attested by K.T.Wettwa Notary Public for the said issue the

learned District Judge had answered" No".

However answering the defendant's issue No. 6 vide Page 95 contrarily to the

answer in the affirmative to the staid issue No.1 the Learned District Judge has

stated that ( Deed 6253 ) (P3) has been revoked by Deed No.9563 (P4).

Issue No. 6 framed by the Defendants 1st and 3rd from the D.C. Kuliyapitiya,

namely

Are the said Defendant denying the revocation of Deed No. 9563 dated 29th 11

1987 ( P4) by Abbusally.

The learned District Judge had answered the said issue as, Deed No.3253 had

been revoked by Deed No.9563.

Considering the issues the Learned District Judge had allotted the shares as

given in the judgment.

This Court notes that there is a discrepancy or a conflict in the answers

given by the Learned District Judge. In the light of the above analysis of

8

the Learned District Judge, we see no prejudice had been caused to the

1 st and 2nd defendants.

The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that the learned District

Judge failed to given reasons for her judgment as required by section

187 of the Civil Procedure Code. I am unable to agree the judgment

contains the reasons for the conclusions set out therein. In any event,

the proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution states that no judgment,

decree or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on account of

any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial

rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice. Therefore, even

where there is a failure to comply with Section 187 of the Civil

Procedure Code, if it is evident on a close examination of the totality of

the evidence that the learned District Judge is correct in pronouncing

judgment, there is no prejudice to the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice and the judgment of the learned District

Judge should not be disturbed. The evidence in this case supports the

judgment of the learned District Judge.(Victor and Another V, Cyril de Silva

(1998) 1 Sri LR 41)

Further this court is of the view that issue No.1 should have been answered as \\

Yes". It is also noted that his being an oversight in the light of the Learned

\! f 1

District Judge's comprehensive analyses. Therefore this court rectify and correct

the answer to issue No.1 as \ Yes".

Therefore we see no valid and a justifiable reason to interfere with said

judgment of the Learned District Judge of Kuliyapitiya delivered on 30th July

1999.

Hence for the reasons enumerated above this appeal is dismissed.
