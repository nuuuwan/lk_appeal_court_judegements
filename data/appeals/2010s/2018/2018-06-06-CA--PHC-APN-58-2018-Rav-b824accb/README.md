P Padman Surasena,J. (PI CAl

In this application the petitioner seeks to challenge the four orders

made by the learned trial Judge produced marked X 12( E ), X12(F)

X12(H) and X12(1). In all four orders learned trial Judge has taken the view

that the application made on behalf of the petitioner to expunge from the

record, certain portions of the evidence given by the witness who is under

cross examination, should be considered when evaluating evidence at the

time of preparation of the final judgment.

In that sense, it is the observation of this Court that there is no

pronouncement by the learned trial Judge which would affect any interest of

the petitioner. This Court has to be mindful that this is an application for

revision. The petitioner in this application seeks the intervention of this

Court to set aside the above four orders made by the learned High Court

Judge and to direct the learned High Court Judge to expunge the impugned

evidence from the record in the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction of this

court. As has been mentioned above, the learned High Court Judge has not

either refused or allowed the said application. Since the trial is still

proceeding, this Court cannot see any illegality or inappropriacy in the

impugned orders of the learned High Court Judge.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that this is not a fit

case in which it should exercise it's revisionary jurisdiction. Therefore this

Court decides to refuse to issue notices on the respondents. Application

must stand dismissed without costs.
