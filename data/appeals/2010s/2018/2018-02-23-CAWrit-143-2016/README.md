" 3

(Administrative Officer, Department of Agriculture, Peradeniya) dated 13/1/2016,

marked PII, and for an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus on the 4th

Respondent to re-instate the Petitioner, to the office of the, Deputy Director of

Agriculture, Hambantota.

In the performance appraisal for the period 2014- 2015, marked P4, it was

found that, the Petitioners inter-personal relations were weak and unsatisfactory.

The Petitioner has appealed against the said findings stating that the reasons for

such appraisal was due to personnel prejudice against the Petitioner and

irregularities within the Department of Agriculture. An inquiry into the Petitioners

appeal was conducted by a Board of Inquiry appointed by the Director of the

Department of Agriculture. At the conclusion of the said inquiry, the Board of

Inquiry recommended that, the Petitioner be transferred to the Service Training

Institute of Angunakolapallassa. The formal approval of the said transfer was

made by the 3 rd Respondent (Director General of Agriculture) by letter dated

13/1/2016, marked "R6".

The Respondents state, that due to the Petitioners failure to act as directed

by the said order, the payment of salary of the Petitioner was stopped temporarily,

until the Petitioner assumed duties at the transferred place of employment. The

decision taken to temporary suspend the salary was informed to the Petitioner by

letter dated 05/03/2016, marked P14. However, the said suspension of the salary

was withdrawn when the Petitioner reported for duty at the new service center,

where he was transferred and has continued his service at the, said service centre.

On or about 3/3/2017, the Petitioner was accused of an attempted assault of an

Agriculture Monitory Officer attached to the Department of Agriculture. This is

confirmed by letter dated 25/5/2017, by the Officer in Charge of the

AngunakoIlapaIlassa Police Station marked P7. Due to the said compliant the

Petitioner was re-transferred to the Head Office of the Department of Agriculture

to meet the required disciplinary procedure in terms of the Public Service

Commission Procedure Rules. Therefore it is submitted that the transfer letter by

the 4th Respondent dated 13/01116, marked P 11 is no longer in operation. The

above change in circumstances, relevant to this application was within the

knowledge of the Petitioner.

The 1 st paragraph of document marked P9, tended by the Petitioner with the

Counter Objections reads as follows,

It is observed that, the Petitioner as directed by letter dated 13/1 /2016,

marked "R6", assumed duties at the Service Training Institute at

Angunakollapallassa. However due to disciplinary reasons and as required by

clause 195 (4) of the Public Service Commission Procedural Rules, the Petitioner

was re-transferred to the Head Office of the Department of Agriculture. The

Petitioner has conceded to the said change in circumstances. Therefore, I am of the

view that quashing transfer letter marked P 11, and to re-instate the Petitioner as

prayed for, is futile.

In the circumstances, the Petition is dismissed without costs.
