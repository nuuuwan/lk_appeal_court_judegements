Judgment

S. Thurairaja PC J

The Accused appellant above mentioned had preferred an appeal against the

conviction of Murder and Death sentence by the learned High Court Judge of

Embilipitiya, and they submitted following grounds of appeal.

i) The learned trial judge applied an erroneous principle of law which deprived

a fair trial.

ii) The evidence of the third accused was not evaluated.

iii) Failure to compartmentalise evidence against each accused.

iv) Circumstantial evidence is insufficient to convict the accused persons.

It will be appropriate to familiarise with the facts of this case. Hon. Attorney General

had preferred an indictment against 4 persons namely Samarapuli Baala Archchige

Piyadasa, Samarapuli Baala Arachchige Namal, Samarapuli Baala Arachchige

Dharmasiri and Rajasinghe Mudiyanselage Ajith Bandara.

The first count was under section 113B, 102 and 296 of the Penal Code against all

four accused persons, the second count was against the 1st and the 3rd Accused

persons under section 296 to be read with section 32 of the Penal Code, the third

count was against the 2nd Accused under section 296 to be read with section 102 of

the Penal code and the fourth count was against the 4th accused under section 296 to

be read with section 102 of the Penal code.

CA 211/2010 JUDGMENT Page 2 of

After the trial, the learned High Court Judge had acquitted the 2nd and the 4th Accused

for want of evidence. 1st and the 3rd accused-appellants were acquitted on the 1st

count and convicted on the 2nd count, accordingly, both were sentenced to death.

Available evidence reveals that these four accused persons were inter-related;

i) The 1st accused is married to the sister of the 3rd accused.

ii) 2nd accused is the son of the 1st accused.

iii) 4th accused is the Son in Law of the 1st accused.

According to the Prosecution Witness Patty on the 17/06/2002, he was working at the

Brickmaking place, at around 10.55am he heard the sound of lighting of crackers.

After about 45 minutes, he had witnessed the 1st accused appellant Piyadasa and the

2nd appellant Dharmasiri (3rd accused) were coming there. The 1st accused-appellant

had shouted at them saying "Dogs don't make bricks go away" CID@G mGC1>@ l5)omi!D

~o) o@C!m ~C!@ The witness had seen that the 3rd accused Piyadasa was carrying a

head of a human in his hand. The witness was shocked and fled away from that place.

Prosecution witness Karunaratne also says, that at around 11 to 11.30 am he heard

several sounds like firing of crackers. Thereafter he had seen the 1st accused-appellant

was walking away with a tea pruning knife. Further, he had also noticed that the said

1st appellant was clad in a red colour tee shirt. After a while, the 1st accused had told

this witness "now eat lokka". (G~) I5>mi!D 15)@ Further, he also observed a trail

blood on the way.

Prosecution witness Chandraratne gave evidence and said that he saw deceased was

working in the paddy field on that fateful day, and saw a person running away dressed

in red tee shirt at that time.

The 1st accused-appellant was arrested and a statement was recorded by the Police

investigator. The 1st accused appellant had guided the Police and they had recovered

a T56 gun and unspent cartridges under the cemented floor. It was revealed those

gun and cartridges were hidden under the floor in a deep hole covered with soil and

cement. According to the police officers, no one can find those productions if the

accused had not helped them.

CA 211/2010 JUDGMENT Page 3 of 1n

The Prosecution called officials from Sri Lankan Army and established that this weapon

and the bullets were belong to them and those went misSing from a soldier few weeks

before this incident. It is worthy to note that the 4th accused was a soldier serving in

the same camp and he was on duty at the time of disappearance of the weapon. The

officers of Army had identified the T56 gun by the serial number in the registration.

Anyhow there was no direct evidence to link the 4th accused to the weapon and the

incident.

The learned trial judge had considered all available evidence before him and found 2nd

and 4th accused not gUilty and convicted the 1st and 3rd accused appellants for murder

of Wijendrage Chandrasri.

Analysing the reasons given in the judgment, we have to consider whether the trial

judge was satisfied with the following factors among others;

a) Death of the deceased Wijendrage Chandrasri

b) Identity of the accused

c) Actus-reus

d) Mens-rea

e) Motive, if available

It is the duty of the Prosecution to submit evidence before the trial court that the

deceased Wijendrage Chandrasri was died of the action of the accused appellants. It

can be through direct or Circumstantial evidence.

In the present case there is no eye witness to the inCident, therefore the Prosecution

was relying on Circumstantial evidence. It will be appropriate to consider the concept

of circumstantial evidence developed by our courts.

I wish to quote the citations from SIGERA VS. ATTORNEY GENERAL 2011 (1)

201;

CA211/2010 10

JUDGMENT Page 4 of

In THE KING v. ABEYWICKREMA et al 44 NLR 254 SOERTSZ S.P.] held that,

...... in order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence they must be

satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused and

inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of his innocence.

Don Sunny Vs Attorney General 1998 - 2 Sri LR at 1 it was held that proved

items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point

towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence and that if

an inference can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the

accused the accused cannot be convicted.

Bassanayake 0 held THE QUEEN v. K. A. SANTIN SINGHO 65 NLR 445

The rule regarding circumstantial evidence and its effect, if not explained by

the accused, is admirably stated in the judgment of Chief Justice Shaw in an

American case-Commonwealth v. Webster- quoted in Ameer Ali's ' Law of

Evidence ~ 'Where probable proof is brought of a statement of facts tending

to criminate the accused, the absence of evidence tending to a contrary

conclusion is to be considered though not alone entitled to much weight,

because the. burden of proof lies on the accuser to make out the whole case

by substantive evidence. But when pretty stringent proof of circumstance is

produced, tending to support the charge/ and it is apparent that the accused is

so situated that he could offer evidence of all the facts and circumstances as

they exist, and show, if such was the truth, that the suspicious circumstance

can be accounted for conSistently with his innocence and he fails to offer such

proof, the natural conclusion is such that the proof, if produced, instead of

rebutting/ would tend to sustain the charge .....

Another passage in Willis on Circumstantial Evidence a/so has been quoted

here. Lord Chief Justice Abbott said this: ' It follows from the very nature of

circumstantial eVldence/ that in drawing an inference or conclusion as to the

existence of a particular fact from other facts that are proved, regard must

CA 211/2010 JUDGMENT Page 5 of

always be had to the nature of the particular case/ and the facility that appears

to be afforded either of explanation or contradiction.

In King vs Appuhamy 46 NLR 128 KEUNEMAN J. held that "In order to justify

the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial evidence/ the inculpatory facts

must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and incapable of

explanation upon any other reasonable-hypothesis the that of his guilt. //

In Udagedara Hewaga Justin alias Kumarasinghe Accused-Appellant vs

Attorney General, CA 122/2015 Decided on 15th November 2017, this court

discussed the concept of circumstantial evidence in detail and we wish re affirm

the citations and our view expressed in the said decision.

In the present case it becomes necessary to discuss about section 27 (1) of the

Evidence Ordinance, Prosecution relied on recoveries made on the information and

guidance of the 1st accused appellant.

Section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance states as follows;

Provided thaC when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of

information received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police

officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to a confession or noC as

relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered may be proved.

In SIGERA VS. ATTORNEY GENERAL 2011 (1) 201 at 217

Another important item of circumstantial evidence is the recovery of a firearm

from the hideout of the Accused Appellant consequent to a statement made by

the accused which is admissible under section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Under the guidance of the accused a pistol was recovered by the investigation

officers concealed in a box of clothes where the Appellant was found. The police

recovered four spent cartridges from the scene of the crime shortly after the

commission of the offence. The said cartridges with the firearm recovered

consequent to the statement of the Accused Appellant were sent for

examination and report by the Government Analyst. As per the report of the

Government Analyst which is marked as P9/ the opinion of the Government

Analyst was to the effect that all ammunition found at the scene had been fired

CA 211/2010 10

JUDGMENT Page 6 of

from one weapon. On a scientific analysis (ballistics) the Government Analysts

has also concluded that these Bullets had been fired from the firearm recovered

consequent to the section 27 statement of the Accused Appellant. Furthermore,

on the day the prosecution led the evidence of the Government Analyst the

defence had admitted the entire chain of productions right up to the handing

over of the same to the Government Analyst

ARIYASINGHE AND OTHERS V ATTORNEY GENERAL (G. C. Wickremasinghe

Abduction Case) 2004 (2) Sri L.R 357 at 386 Amaratunga J held that;

According to the analysis, there were three ways in which the accused persons

could have acquired their knowledge about the places where G/66 notes were

found. The following are the three ways.

i. The accused himself concealed those G/66 notes found in the place where

they were found.

ii. The accused saw another person concealing the notes in that place.

iii. A person who had seen another person concealing those notes in that place

has told the accused about it

Both accused appellants had not raised any objections regarding the recoveries

made under Section 27(1) of the Evidence. Anyhow we consider the acceptability of

the said process in our determination.

When analysing the law and the decided cases it is clear that if the accused had a

knowledge of the production (fact), depending on the production, place it is recovered

the Court can presume the link between the accused and the production. Which will

make the accused to offer an acceptable explanation for the link or the knowledge.

In the present case it is revealed that the productions (fact) recovered were a T56

automatic weapon bearing serial number 1440576 which belongs to the Sri Lankan

Army. This weapon had gone missing from a soldier who was on duty on the 28th April

2004. After about one and half months namely on the 17th June 2004 this same gun

was used to fire the deceased. Ballistics experts from Government Analyst Department

CA 211/2010 10

JUDGMENT Page 7 of

confirms that the cartridges found at the scene were fired from this weapon. Police

investigators had recovered this Gun and a magazine contained 14 live cartridges

wrapped in a fertiliser bag, concealed in a pit under a newly cemented floor. The 1st

accused not only gave the information but also guided the police to find these items.

Considering the Law, decided cases and facts of this case it is clear that the 1 st accused

appellants owes an explanation to the court. The first accused, exercising his statutory

rights and made a statement from the dock and stated that 'he is not involved in this

murder and he is not guilty.' (m6t e~8>aJ~. @)() 8mmm ~6i)mom 08 ~ @)tl5@)() M

m8ilmID mtcm 8m. @)@ ~t6~J:D6t ~. t!)O@)d.) Other than a flat denial there is no

explanation offered by the 1st accused. It should be noted that the incident occurred

on the 17th June 2002, arrest and recovery was done on the 18th June 2002. It was

on the following day of the incident. There is no specific denial nor explanation for the

recovery of the said weapon by the 1st accused appellant.

It is the submission of both appellants that the trial judge has considered the Lucas

principle. The learned trial judge has considered all ingredients of the charges, It

appears that the Lucas principle also mentioned there

As indicated in R v Lucas (1981) 1 QB 720 at 724, 73 Cr App R 159 at 162, that the

lie must be deliberate and must relate to a material issue, that they had to be satisfied

that there was no innocent motive for the lie, and they should remember that people

sometimes lied, for example, to bolster up a just cause, or out of shame, or a wish to

conceal disgraceful behaviour.

Considering the facts and the ratio decidendi of the said case we are of the view

that the said Lucas principle is not applicable to this case. When reading the

entire Judgment, we find that the trial judge had referred to many legal theories

and principles. On a careful Scrutinisation, we observed that the trial judge has

just mentioned the Lucas principle but he had not relied on the said principle.

Which could have been avoided but mentioning makes no prejudice to the

appellants. Therefore, we find that there is no merit in this ground of appeal.

The next ground of appeal is the evidence of the 3rd accused appellant was not

considered. The learned trial judge had reasonably considered the evidence of

CA 211/2010 10

JUDGMENT Page 8 of

r I

the 3rd accused appellant at page no 47 of the judgment. We carefully read the

evidence of the 3rd accused appellant, there we found that the appellant had

taken certain position, of which never taken up or even suggested to the

prosecution at any time. Considering the evidence of the 3rd accused appellant

we are of the view that none of those facts had created any reasonable doubt

in the prosecution case, hence this ground of appeal also fails on its own merits.

The next ground of appeal is the learned trial judge had not compartmentalised

the evidence. Both appellants were convicted under section 296 to be read with

section 32 of the Penal code. Further to our reference above, the law itself

requires the judge to consider and evaluate all the evidence together. In a case

of circumstantial evidence if the Judge evaluate every fact separately there

won't be any case be proved against the culprits.

There is no fair trial offered to the accused appellants is the next ground of

appeal. There were four accused persons before the trial court, even though all

four were closely related and some other materials were available against them

the trial judge found there is no sufficient evidence against the 2nd and 41h

accused persons and acquitted them. Perusing the proceedings, we find that

the accused appellants were given all the rights and privileges enshrined in the

Constitution and other laws. There is no specific allegation made by the Counsel

and it appears to a general, ground of appeal. After considering all we find there

is no merit in this ground of appeal.

The last ground of appeal is that the Circumstantial evidence is insufficient to

convict both accused appellants. We have already discussed the evidence and

the concepts earlier, briefly recalling the evidence it reveals as follows.

Prosecution witness Patty had heard sounds of lighting crackers, after about 45

minutes the 151 and the 3rd accused appellants were seen walking together, the

3rd accused appellant was carrying a human head (beheaded head of the

deceased) in his hand, the 151 accused appellant had threatened the witnesses

to run away from the place. A weapon was recovered with help of the 151

accused appellant. The headless corpse of the deceased Wijendrage

CA 211/2010 10

JUDGMENT Page 9 of

Chandrasiri had gunshot injuries on the body, spent cartridges were found were

sent to ballistics experts at the Government analysts department and it is

confirmed those bullets were dispensed from this gun. The 3rd accused had a

dispute with the deceased. Although there are many other matters that may be

mentioned, anyhow we find the Prosecution had submitted sufficient evidence

to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, this ground of appeal

also fails on its own merit.

After careful consideration we find there is no merit in the appeal hence we

dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction and the sentence.
