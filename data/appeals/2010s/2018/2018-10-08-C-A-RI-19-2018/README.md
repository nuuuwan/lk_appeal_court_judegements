Samayawardhena, J.

This is a divorce action filed by the plaintiff-respondent against the

defendant-petitioner in the District Court of Kaduwela.

The petitioner filed this application before this Court for restitutio

in integrum seeking to set aside: (a) the ex parte order made on

04.08.2015 allowing service of summons on the petitioner by

courier service; (b) the ex parte order made on 19.02.2016 fixing

the case for ex parte trial against her on the basis that summons

was served; and (c) the ex parte Judgment dated 24.03.2016

entered against her.

Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the ex parte order

to serve summons by private courier service is bad in law; and in

any event, the petitioner was never served with summons by

courier service or otherwise; and therefore the ex parte Judgment

entered against the petitioner shall be vacated.

Whether or not summons was in fact served is a question of fact

and not of law, which has to be decided after an inquiry at which

evidence would ordinarily be led. Therefore, the appropriate forum

to hold such an inquiry is not this Court, but the District Court.

That is the settled law.

In Andradie v. Jayasekera Perera1, like in the instant case, a

decree entered in a divorce suit was sought to be set aside by way

of an application for revision and/or restitutio in integrum on the

ground that summons was never served on the petitioner.

Upholding the preliminary objection taken on behalf of the

respondent and dismissing the application in limine Justice Siva

Selliah citing a spate of earlier authorities held:

The practice has grown and almost hardened into a rule that

where a decree has been entered ex parte in a District Court

and is sought to be set aside on any ground, application must

in the first instance be made to that very Court and that it is

only where the finding of the District Court on such application

is not consistent with reason or the proper exercise of the

Judge's discretion or where he has misdirected himself on the

facts or law that the Court of Appeal will grant the

extraordinary relief by way of Revision or Restitutio in

Integrum.

This is good law and stands to reason.

This law is not only applicable to ex parte divorce judgments, but

also to any ex parte judgment or ex parte order of the District

Court.

In Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd v. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd2, the

Supreme Court citing Loku Menika v. Selenduhamy3, Habibu Lebbe

v. Punchi Etana4, Caldera v. Santiagopulle5, Weeratne v. Secretary,

D.C. Badulla6, Dingirihamy v. Don Bastian7, Bank of Ceylon v.

Liverpool Marine & General Insurance Co Ltd8, Nagappan v.

Lankabarana Estates Ltd held that:

A party seeking to canvass an order entered ex-parte against

him must apply in the first instance to the court which made

it. This is a rule of practice which has become deeply

ingrained in our legal system.

If I may cite a few more recent cases, in Jana Shakthi Insurance v.

Dasanayake9 Justice Wimalachandra stated:

It is settled law that a party affected by an order of which he

had no notice must apply in the first instance to the Court

which made the order. The petitioner must first file the

necessary papers in the original Court and initiate an inquiry

into the allegations made by him. After such inquiry, if the

petitioner is dissatisfied with the order made by the District

Court, he can thereafter raise the matter before the Court of

Appeal. The Court of Appeal then would be in a position to

make an order on the issues after taking into consideration

the order made by the District Court.

In Penchi v. Sirisena10 also Justice Wimalachandra took the same

view.

Then it is quite clear that the petitioner cannot straightaway come

before this Court against the ex parte orders and ex parte

Judgment made against her by the District Court.

The ex parte Decree Nisi has not been made absolute yet. The

petitioner states that the District Court has now ordered ex parte

Decree Nisi to be served on her through the Foreign Ministry on

the basis that she is living abroad, but she is presently in Sri

Lanka. There is no purpose in informing those matters to this

Court.

In the above circumstances, I refuse to issue notice on the

respondent.

Notice refused.
