The Petitioners have filed this application seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st - 12th Respondents

not to admit the 1st Petitioner to Grade 1 of Richmond College, Galle;

b) A Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st - 1ih Respondents to

admit the 14A Respondent to Grade 1 of Richmond College, Galle;

c) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st - 13th Respondents to admit the 1st

Petitioner to Richmond College, Galle.

The 1st Petitioner was born on 21st August 2011 to the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners.

Upon completion of 5 years of age, he became eligible for admission to Grade

1 of a government school in 2017.

Admission of students to Grade 1 of Government Schools for the year 2017

was governed by Circular No: 17/2016 issued by the Ministry of Education. The

said Circular has been annexed to the petition marked 'P13'. According to

'P13', for the year 2017 the maximum number of students that can be

admitted to a single class was limited to 39. Of this 39, a maximum of 5 slots

are reserved for the children of those serving in the Armed Forces and the

Police Force. Thus, after making provision for the said reservation, 50% of the

vacancies are allocated to those coming under the category of 'Children of

residents in close proximity to the school.'l To be eligible to apply under this

lO)Q@C> (f~ ~o~~~m ~Ol:OeS5. The balance vacancies are distributed among five other categories specified in 'P13'.

A

category, the parents must be resident within the administrative district where

the school is situated.2

The 2nd Petitioner states that he has been living at No. 65/2, Sapumal Place

Road, Paragodawatte, Bope, Galle from the time he was born in 1978. He

claims that his house is situated approximately 500 metres away from

Richmond College, Galle. In his birth certificate annexed to the petition marked

'P2', his father's address is given as 'Paragodawatte, Bope, Galle'. The letter of

appointment issued by the Southern Provincial Council to the' 2nd Petitioner in

August 20003 gives the address as '65/2, Sapumal Place Road, Paragodawatte,

Bope, Galle.' The marriage certificate of the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners dated 20th

May 20024 gives the above address as the address of the 2nd Petitioner. The

birth certificate of the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners' eldest childs gives the 2nd

Petitioner's address as '65/2, Sapumal Place Road, Paragodawatte, Bope,

Galle.' In addition, the 2nd Petitioner has produced electricity bills issued in his

name in 2004 for the said premises. All these documents prove that the

Petitioner has been resident at '65/2, Sapumal Place Road, Paragodawatte,

Bope, Galle' and was thus eligible to apply under the above category.

The 2nd Petitioner had accordingly submitted an application seeking admission

of the 1st Petitioner to Grade 1 of Richmond College, Galle under the

aforementioned category of 'Children of residents in close proximity to the

school'.

The Circular 'P13' requires an interview to be held where the number of

applications exceeds the number of vacancies. Each applicant is allotted marks

at the interview, with the maximum marks that could be allotted being 100.

Under the said category of 'Children of residents in close proximity to the

school', marks are allotted under four sub-categories.

It is admitted between the parties that the Petitioner was allotted a total of

92.5 marks at the interview, allotted under each of the four sub-categories, as

follows.

The fact that 50% of the vacancies available in Grade 1 of a government school

are allocated to those living close to the school demonstrates the policy of the

Government in providing a child with a school that is close to his place of

residence. The above marks structure is weighed in favour of those who have

been living close to a particular school, for a period of over five years. While

recognizing residence as the primary criterion under this category, the marks

structure gives special recognition to those who own their place of residence

by allotting an additional 10 marks for ownership of the place of residence.

There is no dispute among the parties with regard to the marks allotted under

sub-categories 6.1{1}, 6.1{II)(b} and 6.1{1I1} . Thus, the Petitioners' long period of

residence at the aforementioned address, as set out earlier in this judgment,

has been recognised and rewarded by the Interview Board as well as by the

Appeals Board.

The dispute in this case relates to the marks allotted to the 2nd Petitioner under

Sub-category 6.1{II)(a} under which a maximum of 10 marks are allotted for

'documents in proof of ownership of residence'.

Section 6.1{II)(a} of Circular 'P13' sets out three requirements that must be

satisfied by an applicant if he/she is to receive the maximum number of ten

marks allotted under this category. They are:

1} The applicant or his spouse must possesses one of the documents of title

in proof of ownership listed in Section 6.1{II)(a}, such as a deed of

transfer, a deed of gift, grants and permits by the Government, etc.

1 j

~ , ! I

2) The said document of title must be in the name of the applicant or his

spouse.

3) A period of five years calculated as at the date of closing of applications

should have lapsed after the execution of the said document of title.

Thus, it is clear that the authorities indeed evaluate the quality of the

ownership of residence and does not merely look for the establishment of

ownership of residence.

The Petitioners claim that the property, on which they are resident, had been

owned by the paternal grandfather of the 2nd Petitioner and had devolved on

his paternal uncle, Wathudura Bandhanage Reginald. On 5th November 2011,

Reginald had executed Deed of Transfer No. 94 annexed to the petition

marked 'P18', by which the 2nd Petitioner had purchased an extent of 10

perches out of the said land. There is no dispute between the parties that the

2nd Petitioner is the owner of the property where the Petitioners reside. The

Petitioner is therefore in possession of a deed of transfer in respect of the

property at which he is resident, thereby fulfilling the first two the

requirements of Section 6.1(II)(a).

The deed of transfer in favour of the Petitioner has been executed on 5th

November 2011. The closing date of applications was 30th June 2016.10 Thus, as

at the closing date of applications, the Petitioner had not owned the said place

of residence for a period of five years.

10 Vide Section 16 of Circular 'P13'.

o

Section 6.1(II)(a) contains specific provisions with regard to reduction of marks

where the applicant has not owned the property for five years. The manner of

calculating the marks in this regard which have been set out in detail in Section

6.1(II)(a) is re-produced below:

"(ft;)~ ~~~csS en0 ~o&.o ~l: tDOm e@~ Ol:e>B, Il@~od f5>)Q

C)rmc.od ~ @tD~Q g~ Q. (~o~ ~~ ~Imc) (5 (feedlm e@Q)m ~(5

ec.o (ft;)~ tDO ('S)Q) g~ Q.)"

Since the 2nd Petitioner's deed of transfer had not been executed five years

prior to the closing date of applications, it was inevitable that the 2nd Petitioner

would lose marks. This is because he did not have the requisite quality in the

ownership he held relating to that property. Therefore, the mere

establishment of the 2nd Petitioner's long standing residence in that property

cannot earn him the full marks as that cannot be a substitute for the criterion

set out in the relevant Circular 'P13'.

The Interview Board comprising of the 2nd - 6th Respondents had applied the

above provision of Circular 'P13' and decided that the 1st Petitioner was not

eligible to receive the maximum number of marks. Accordingly, the 1st

Petitioner had only been allotted 7.5 marks under Section 6.1(II)(a) of 'P13'.

The 2nd Petitioner, being dissatisfied with the said mark, had submitted an

appeal. The Appeals Board had agreed with the marks allotted by the Interview

n

Board. Thus, the total marks allotted to the Petitioner remained at 92.5. The

cut-off mark for admission to Grade 1 of Richmond College, Galle for the year

2017 was 92.8 and therefore, the 1st Petitioner was not eligible for admission

to Grade 1 of Richmond College, Galle for the year 2017.

Being dissatisfied with the decision of the Interview Board as well as the

Appeals Board to allocate only 7.5 marks under Section 6.1(II)(a} of Circular

'P13', the Petitioners have filed this application seeking inter alia the

aforementioned relief.

Having closely examined the aforementioned provisions in Section 6.1(II}{a},

this Court is of the view that where an applicant has been the owner of a

property for a period of less than five years but more than three years as at the

closing date of applications, the maximum number of marks that could be

allotted is 7.5. In this instance, the 2nd Petitioner became the owner of the

property on which he resides only on 5th November 2011. The last date for the

submission of applicati.ons was 30th June 2016.11 Thus, it is clear that the 2nd

Petitioner has not been the owner of the said property for a period of 5 years

and is only eligible to receive 7.5 marks in accordance with the provisions of

the said Circular.

However, the Petitioners contend that the Interview Board had a discretion to

allot more than 7.5 marks to the 1st Petitioner, taking into consideration the

fact that he had had ownership for 'almost' 5 years and that the refusal by the

Interview Board and the Appeals Board to exercise that discretion is arbitrary,

irrational and illegal. Thus, the question that needs to be decided by this Court

11 Vide Section 16 of Circular 'P13'.

is whether the Interview Board and the Appeals Board have been vested with

discretion and if so, whether the refusal to exercise that discretion is arbitrary,

irrational and illegal.

It would be appropriate to bear in mind the following passage of Lord Diplock

in Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service12, when

considering the argument of the Petitioner:

"Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without

reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come

about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds upon

which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first

ground I would call 'illegality', the second 'irrationality' and the third

'procedural impropriety'.

"By 'irrationality' I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as

'Wednesbury unreasonableness,13. It applies to a decision which is so

outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no

sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided

could have arrived at it."

In support of his argument that the Interview Board has discretion, the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner has relied on Section 5.8 of Circular 'P13', which

reads as follows:

12 1985 AC 374 .

13 Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation 1948(1)KB 223.

This Court is of the view that Section 5.8 does not give the interview board the

power to take whatever decision they think is right. On the contrary, Section

5.8 specifically requires the interview board to act in accordance with the

provisions of the Circular. This Court observes that admission of children to

Grade 1 of all government schools is carried out in accordance with 'P13' by

multiple interview boards and hence, it is important that uniformity is

maintained by such boards and the provisions of the Circular are strictly

adhered to, unless the discretion is apparent and obvious. This entire exercise

of admitting children to schools can end up in chaos and confusion, if each

interview board can decide for itself. In fact, the Petitioner has adverted to the

fact that he was allotted 10 marks by the interview board dealing with

admission of children to Mahinda College, Galle, thus showing the need for the

interview board to act strictly in accordance with the circular and thereby

maintain consistency.

This Court has examined the Circular marked 'P13' and notes that the

Interview Board has in fact been vested with limited discretion with regard to

allocation of marks under certain categories. For example, under Section

6.1{II)(b) of 'P13,14, only five marks can be allotted, with one mark' being

allotted for each document produced by an applicant to prove residence.

14 Section 6.1(II)(b) - Titled "Additional documents to prove residence".

1..,

However the type of documents that can be produced under this category can

vary and thus, the Interview Board has a discretion with regard to the type of

documents that can be submitted under this Section, as long as the said

documents establish residence. Similarly, under the Old boy/ Old girl

category,lS 25 marks are allotted for Sports and Extra-curricular achievements

of the parent during his/her school career. The Interview Board has discretion

with regard to the kind of achievements for which marks can be allotted and

the mark that can be allotted for such achievement.

However, this Court does not find any such discretion being vested in the

Interview Board under Section 6.1{II)(a). This Court is of the view that if the

ownership of the property in question has been for less than five years but for

more than three years, the Interview Board can only allot 7.5 marks.

The argument advanced by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, that by the

time the appeal hearing took place, the Petitioner had complied with the five

year requirement is not tenable in view of the specific wording of Section

6.1{II)(a) of 'P13' that the requirement must be satisfied as at the closing date

of applications. There is no room within Section 6.1{II)(a) that permits the

Interview Board to take into consideration matters such as the five year

requirement being fulfilled at the time of the hearing of the appeal as the

Section very clearly lays down the date as at which the five years must be

completed. The position however may have been different if the relevant

paragraph did not contain the words, '@~ CS>>O ~) ~ ~enD', in

which event the Petitioners' argument may have carried more weight.

15 Section 6.2 of 'P13'.

1':1

Unfortunately for the Petitioner, this clause is clear in its application and does

not leave room for the Interview Board to exercise any discretion.

That said, can it then be argued that the Interview Board acted irrationally?

This Court does not think so. There is nothing outrageous in the decision to

only allocate 7.S marks under Section 6.1{II)(a) nor does the said decision defy

logic. Is the decision to allot only 7.S marks unreasonable? Again, this Court

does not think so. As noted by Wade and Forsyth/6 'Decisions which are

extravagant or capricious cannot be legitimate. But if the decision is within the

confines of reasonableness, it is no part of the courts function to look further

into its merits'.

In these circumstances, this Court cannot agree with the submission of the

learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the Interview Board had discretion or

that the decision of the interview board is irrational or unreasonable.

The Petitioner has also argued that the admission of the 14A Respondent is

suspicious as the details pertaining to the 14A Respondent in the Interim

Marks List and the Final Marks List does not tally. The Respondents have

produced with their Statement of Objections, the Certificate of residence

relating to the 14B Respondent issued by the Grama Niladhari marked 'R2'

which gives the address of the 14B Respondent as '160/A, Sri Piyarathana

Mawatha, Bope, Galle'. While this Court notes that there are discrepancies

between the two lists in respect of the 14A Respondent, this Court is of the

view that no material has been presented to this Court to establish t~at the

16 Administrative Law, 11th Ed, page 302.

1.11

admission of the 14A Respondent is illegal or contrary to the provisions of the

Circular 'p13'.

This Court also observes that the Petitioners have not established the manner

in which the admission of Christian students over and above the minimum

percentage has prejudiced the rights of the Petitioners.

In these circumstances, this Court refuses to issue the Writs of Certiorari and

Mandamus prayed for. This application is dismissed, without costs.
