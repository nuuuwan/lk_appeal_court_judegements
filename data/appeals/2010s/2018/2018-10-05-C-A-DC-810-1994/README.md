Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action against the two defendants

seeking declaration of title to the land described in the schedule

to the plaint, ejectment of the defendants therefrom and

damages. The defendants sought for the dismissal of the action.

After trial, the learned District Judge entered Judgment for the

plaintiff. Hence this appeal by the defendants.

At the argument, the plaintiff-respondent was absent and

unrepresented, and learned junior counsel for the defendant-

appellants invited the Court to deliver the Judgment on the

written submissions already filed of record.

In the said one-page brief written submissions, learned counsel

for the appellants seeks to impugn the Judgment of the District

Court on two grounds:

(a) Learned District Judge has not considered the two

Deeds produced by the appellants marked 1V1 and

1V2.

(b) The appellants have prescribed to the land before the

Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance came into operation.

The position taken up by the appellants in the District Court is

as follows:

The plaintiff who is the Viharadhipathi of Hunapahure

Temple is claiming the paddy field belonging to the temple

upon documents marked P2, P3, P5 and P7. There is no

dispute that the temple is entitled to the paddy field

referred to in those documents. But the question is as to

whether the paddy filed referred to in P2, P3, P5 and P7 is

3

the very same paddy filed which is in the possession of the

defendants and depicted as Lot 1 in Plan marked P4.1

Accordingly, the appellants have admitted the ownership of the

land in suit residing with the respondent by virtue of the

documents marked P2, P3, P5 and P7; but state that the said

land has not been properly identified or not depicted in the Plan

prepared for this case marked P4.

I must state that there was no issue raised at the trial regarding

identification of the corpus, and therefore the said submission

(made before the District Court) on that matter is irrelevant and

beside the point.

Having accepted that the respondent is the owner of the land in

suit by virtue of the documents marked P2, P3, P5 and P7, the

appellants now before this Court state that the learned District

Judge has failed to consider the appellants Deeds marked 1V1

and 1V2.

In the first place, the appellants cannot take up contradictory

positions at various stages of the case. They cannot approbate

and reprobate, affirm and disaffirm, and blow hot and cold

simultaneously. (Ranasinghe v. Premadharma [1985] 1 Sri LR 63)

In any event, Deed 1V1 has been executed in 1904 and 1V2 in

1958. But the respondents said title documents are anterior to

the year 1904 and 1958. P2 is dated 15.05.1857. P3 is dated

11.12.1861. P5 is dated 18.07.1860. P7 Deed has been

executed in 1928.

Therefore, the first argument of the appellants fails.

The next argument is on prescription. Section 34 of the

Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance, No. 19 of 1931, as amended,

reads as follows:

The case of any claim for the recovery of any property,

movable or immovable, belonging or alleged to belong to

any temple, or for the assertion of title to any such property,

the claim shall not be held to be barred or prejudiced by

any provision of the Prescription Ordinance.

Provided that this section shall not affect rights acquired

prior to the commencement of this Ordinance.

The fact that the Prescription Ordinance has no application to

any property belonging to any temple has been emphasized in

many decisions including Sri Pannaloka Thero v. Jinorasa Thero

(1957) 60 NLR 256, Waharaka alias Moratota Sobhita Thero v.

Amunugama Ratnapala Thero [1981] 1 Sri LR 201.

There is absolutely no evidence to conclude that the appellants

acquired prescriptive rights to the land prior to the year 1931.

Hence the second argument of the appellants also cannot

succeed.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.

To avoid any future uncertainty, I must place on record that the

respondent is not entitled to the whole land depicted in Plan

marked P4, but only to the superimposed portion marked in red

lines in the said Plan in extent of 1 Rood and 3 Perches.2
