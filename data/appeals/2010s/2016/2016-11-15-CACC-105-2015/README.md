I JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Petitioner had filed a writ application in the High Court of North Central

Province holden in Anuradhapura, upon which, learned High Court Judge of

Anuradhapura in his judgment dated 1998-03-10, held that the house

which is the subject matter of the dispute is not a house which has been

given to the Petitioner as an official quarters. Learned High Court Judge

appears to have held that this house had been given to the Petitioner on

rent. Upon an appeal preferred by the Urban Council, Anuradhapura, this

court by its judgment dated 2010.03.18 [marked as P 7(a)], has affirmed

the judgment of the learned High Court Judge and dismissed the said

appeal.

It is the complaint made to this court by the Petitioner that the decision

made by the 1st Respondent in P 13 and the report made by the 2nd

Respondent dated 2014-11-11 disclosed a deliberate disdain of the court or

a disregard, or defiance of the court. 1 Petitioner has on this basis prayed in

his petition that the 1st and 2nd Respondents be punished for the offence of

contempt of court.

It is now appropriate to turn to the portion relevant from the charge served

on the 1st and 2nd Respondents. It is reproduced below;

" ....... for the offence of Contempt of Court committed against the

Honourable Court of Appeal, and in disrespect of the authority of the

Honourable Court of Appeal, and of the Honourable High Court of the

North Central Province, by

(a) deliberately and willfully refusing to accept and give effect to

the said Judgment of their Lordships of the Court of Appeal in C A/

(PHC)/ 10B/ 9.B and of the attendant Judgment of the Honourable

High Court of the North Central Province in (Writ) Certiorari

Application No. 19/1996, and deliberately and willfully acted contrary

to the letter and spirit of the said Judgments; and,

(b) willfully disobeying the said Judgment of their Lordships of the

Court of Appeal in C A/(PHC)/108/98 and of the attendant Judgment

of the Honourable High Court of the North Central Province in (Writ)

Certiorari Application No. 19/1996, and deliberately and willfully

acted contrary to the letter and spirit of the said Judgments ........... "

Issue before this court in this proceeding at this moment is whether the 1st

and 2nd Respondents are responsible for whatever the actions alleged to

have been committed by them as set out in the charge.It would also be

necessary to ascertain in this exercise, whether any actions or omissions

on the part of either the 1 st Respondent or the 2nd Respondent as disclosed

by the document marked P 13 and the report dated 2014-11-11 amount to

contempt of court. It has to be noted that the letter marked P 13 has

been sent by the 1st Respondent to the Petitioner replying his letter dated

2014-11-03. The 1st Respondent has also annexed to that reply, the report

( P 13 ) dated 2014-11-11 made by the 2nd Respondent.

What the letter P 13 has stated is that it is not possible to transfer to the

Petitioner, the house in which the Petitioner resides on rent. It must be

noted that neither the High Court nor the Court of Appeal had directed

that this house be handed over to the Petitioner. All what the High Court

has done is to have the quit notice quashed by a writ of Certiorari. There is

no direction by Court on either of the Respondents that they should take

steps to hand over this house to the Petitioner.

Indeed, as pOinted out by the learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd

respondents, learned High Court Judge has refused to issue a writ of

Mandamus to compel the Urban Council of Anuradhapura and the secretary

of the Urban Council, Anuradhapura to transfer this house to the Petitioner.

That was on the basis that the available material in that case had not

warranted an issuance of a writ of Mandamus for that purpose. It is

therefore clear that the prayer by the Petitioner to compel the owners of

this house to transfer the said house in the name of the Petitioner, has

been refused by the learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura. It is

therefore abundantly clear that the Respondents of this application are not

under direction of Court to effect a transfer of this house to the Petitioner.

In these circumstances, the attempt by the Petitioner to get this Court to

1

hold that the Respondents are guilty of contempt for violation of the

judgment delivered by the High Court could only be viewed as an attempt

to have the once refused Writ of Mandamus activated through unlawful

means.

Indeed, the 2nd Respondent in his report dated 2014-11-11 has referred to

the High Court case and its decision. The 2nd Respondent has merely set

out in that report the present state of affairs with regard to this house. In

any case it is a report addressed to the 1st Respondent made by the 2nd

Respondent in the course of his official duties.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that he has also filed a

Fundamental Rights application in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to

have this house transferred in the name of the Petitioner on the basis that

the Petitioner has been discriminated against some others.

It is the view of this court that for a person to be held liable for an offence

of contempt of court, there must be a deliberate defiance or disobedience

of a Court order and that defiance or disobedience must be capable of

being attributed to that person.

The defiance on the part of the 1st and 2nd Respondents complained of by

the Petitioner is their failure to transfer this house to the Petitioner. For this

court to hold that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have defied a court order,

firstly there must exist a court order to that effect. When there is no Court

order to that effect, there can't be a question of defiance or disobedience.

For the reasons set out above we hold that the 1st and 2nd Respondents are

not liable to be dealt with for an offence of contempt of court and hence

we discharge the rule made against the 1st and 2nd Respondents and

dismiss this application with costs.

Application is dismissed with costs.
