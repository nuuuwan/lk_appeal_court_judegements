ARGUED ON: 14.01.2016

DECIDED ON 29.04.2016

M.M.A.Gaffoor J.,

This appeal has been made by he ih and 8th Defendant-Appellants against

an Order of the learned District Judge of Kegalle, made on 13.12.1997 dismissing

their application to set aside the awarding of the unallotted 1/3 share of the

corpus to the 5th and 6th Defendants.

The Plaintiff Respondent (hereinafter referred to as lIthe Plaintiff") has

filed this action bearing No. 23404/P in the District Court of Kegalle on 16th

February 1982, to partition the land called "Butahgamayawatte" depicted In

Plan No. 5129 date 24.01.1986 made by l.K Baddewela, licensed Surveyor,

which is marked as "x" and its Report as "X1" and filed of record in the case.

On 07.09.1992, when the trial commenced, the substituted Plaintiff has

given evidence and thereafter judgment had been entered on the same day and

interlocutory decree was entered accordingly. According to the Judgment the 5th

and 6th Defendants were not allotted their respective shares 9/36 (12/36 i.e.

1/3) share were left unallotted and left in common in the said judgment.

According to the Plaintiff's evidence, the 5th and 6th Defendants are

entitled to an undivided 9/36 and 3/36 shares, but the 5th and 6th Defendants,

neither filed their statement of claim nor did they give evidence to prove that

they are entitled to the said shares. In terms of Section 26(2)(g) of the Partition

law, the learned District Judge had not allotted this undivided 1/3 share to the

5th and 6th Defendants. Interlocutory decree was entered excluding this 1/3

share as unallotted to anyone.

On 3.6.1993 the 5th Defendant had made an application to allot this 1/3

share to 5th and 6th Defendants. On this application , on 20.10.1993 . the

Plaintiff had been called to give evidence. Although the 5th Defendant was

present in Court on this date, she was not called to give evidence, but the

Plaintiff had given evidence in support of the 5th and 6th Defendants' right to the

unallotted 1/3rd share. Nor their parties were present in court. No reason was

given why the Plaintiff's evidence was called for to prove 1/3 share which was

allotted 5th and 6th Defendants. 5 V1 and 5V2 were produced on behalf of the

5th Defendant by the Plaintiff.

After the Plaintiff gave evidence, and upon this evidence only the court

made an order granting this 1/3rd share to the 5th and 6th Defendants and to

amend the interlocutory decree accordingly. Interlocutory Decree was mended

and final partition is effected as shown in Plan No. 5927 dated 19.08.1996 made

by l. B. Baddewela, licensed Surveyor.

On 23.09.2996, the ih and 8th Defendants filed their Petition and Affidavit

in the District Court stating that they are in possession of the unallotted 1/3rd

share which has now been allotted to 5th and 6th Defendants, and this allotment

had been done without notice to them and therefore to vacate the Order and

they may be heard. After both parties filed their written submissions, the

learned District Judge dismissed their application on the ground that the court

has no jurisdiction to grant the relief prayed for. This position is wrong in terms

of the law.

The ih and the 8th Defendants have now filed this appeal before this

court seeking the following relief:

i) That the awarding of the unallotted share to the 5th and 6th

Defendants be set aside;

ii) To order the 5th Respondent to issue notice on all the parties on his

application to obtain the unallotted share;

iii) That a de novo inquiry be held to ascertain which party is entitled

to the unallotted share;

The question before this court is whether the order made by the learned

District Judge on 20.10.1993 granting the unallotted 1/3 share to the 5th and 6th

Defendants is a correct order in terms of the law.

5

Section 26(2)(g) permit the court to unallot certain shares if no evidence is

given, to allot it to anyone. Once, the portion of the land is unallotted, it

remains as a portion in common use, for example a roadway.

In Yoosoof vs Mustapha 13 Ceylon Law Recorder p. 171, a land had been

partitioned, but certain portion consisting of a road and two latrines had been

left unallotted, the decree containing no reference to them. A party who was

the successor in title to one of the persons in whose favour the partition decree

had been entered, claimed the right to user of the unallotted portion as being a

right appurtenant to the allotted portions. It was held that lithe claim was not

admissible and that the unallotted portion continued to remain the common

property of the original owners, the use of which was referable to the

unextinguished common ownership and to that alone."

In the instant case, the unallotted 1/3rd share was not claimed by anyone

other than the ih and 8th Defendants, when the unallotted 1/3rd share is

claimed by same party (the 5th Defendant in this case), it is the duty of the court

to notice all the parties to the case and hold an inquiry into the claim. A fair

opportunity must be given to any party who objects to the claim.

The procedure adopted by the lower court in holding the trial and

subsequent inquiry is utterly wrong and unsatisfactory. According to Section 25

of the Partition Law it is the bounden duty of the court to investigate the title of

the parties. Even if a party is in default to participate at the trial, the Court must

allow such party to file a statement of claim to prove his rights.

In this case, only the Plaintiff have given evidence and that evidence also

was not cross examined. An examination-in-chief, lose much of their credibility

6

and weight unless they are put into the crucible of cross examination emerge

unscathed from the test. The testimony of a witness is not legal evidence unless

it is subject to cross examination. In this case, immediately after the

examination in chief of the Plaintiff, though the Plaintiff's case was not closed,

the learned Judge had entered judgment on the same day without calling for

any other evidence. This clearly shows that the court has not gone into an

investigation of the title of the parties. Subsequently, when the ih and 8th

defendants had filed an application, they were not granted an opportunity to

establish their right to possession or to prove their title to the unallotted 1/3rd

share.

In Tissera and another vs leelawathie and others 2005 (2) Sri L.R 127, it

was held inter alia, that the language of Section 25 is wide enough to provide

court with wide powers to examine the right. title and interest of each party

and hear evidence in support thereof. The court may permit, under section

25(3), a party in default to file a statement of claim and if that party establishes

the bonafide of his claim, upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as the court

shall seem fit.

In these circumstances, I am of the view that the learned Judge should

have allowed the ih and 8th Defendants to file their statement of claim to

establish their right, title and interest in the corpus and to establish their

prescriptive right to the unallotted 1/3rd share.

For the reasons stated above, I set aside the order of the learned District

Judge dated 20.10.1993 awarding the unallotted share to the 5th and 6th

Defendants and to issue notice of the 5th Defendant's application to all the

1

7

parties and to hold a de novo inquiry. The ih and 8th Defendants are permitted

to file their statement of claim.

Appeal allowed.
