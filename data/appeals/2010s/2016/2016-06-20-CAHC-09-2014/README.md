W.M.M. Malinie Gunaratne,l.

At the out set learned Counsel for the Accused-

Appellant submitted that he is not pursuing the appeal against the

conviction. In the circumstances, the appeal is being considered only

in respect of the sentence imposed on the Accused-Appellant.

The Counsel submitted that the accused-appellant

has no prevIOUS convictions and at the time of committing the offence

he was 46 years of age, married and has two children 15 and 13

2

years of age. He further submitted that the accused-appellant had

been working as a home guard in the Rural Security Unit and after

this incident he has been dismissed. He urged to vary the sentence

and to consider imposing the minimum sentence on the accused-

appellant.

The learned Senior State Counsel does not object to

the imposition of minimum sentence.

The accused-appellant was indicted for committing

an offence punishable under Section 365 (b) 2 (a) of the Penal Code.

In deciding what sentence is to be imposed, the Court must necessarily

considered the nature of the offence committed, the gravity of the

offence, the manner in which it has been committed, the persons who are

affected by such crime and the ingenuity in which it has been committed

(Attorney General Vs. Mendis 1995 1 SLR 138).

Accordingly, the learned Trial Judge has addressed his

mind to those issues and has imposed a sentence of 8 years Rigorous

Imprisonment and a fine of Rs.1 0,0001= with a default sentence of one year.

Further compensation ofRs.25,0001= with a default term of one year.

However having taken into consideration the submissions

made by Counsel, and the time period he has been in remand we set

aside the sentence of 8 years Rigorous Imprisonment and sentence the

Accused Appellant to a term of 7 years Rigorous Imprisonment. The

compensation and the fine ordered by the learned Trial Judge is affirmed.

The sentence imposed on the Accused-Appellant

shall be implemented from today.

Subject to the above variation of the sentence the appeal

is dismissed and the conviction is affirmed.

The Registrar is directed to forward the case record

with the copy of this order to the High Court of Ampara for the

implementation of the said sentence.

Appeal dismissed subject to the above variation.
