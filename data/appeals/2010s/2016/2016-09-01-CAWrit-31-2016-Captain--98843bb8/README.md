Petitioner to the present application Channa D.L. Abeygunewaradena had filed the present application

before this court inter alia, grant and issue

a) A Mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 3rd Respondent

to suspend the services as per letter dated 18.12.2015.

b) A mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 4th to the 1ih

Respondents terminating the service of the Petitioner as per letter dated 20.01.2016 (P27)

c) A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus compelling the 15t to the 1ih Respondents

to re-instate/restore the Petitioner in the post of Deputy General Manager

Petitioner who was appointed as "Bunkering Consultant" and subsequently as "Deputy General

Manager" (Bunkering) of the 4th Respondent Magampura Port Management Company (Pvt) Limited

(here in after referred to as MPMC) with effect from 03.12.2014 was subsequently suspended from his

services by a show cause letter dated 18.12.2015 issued by the 3rd Respondent. Thereafter his services

were terminated by letter dated 20.01.2016 issued by the 12th Respondent.

When the present application was supported before me seeking the relief referred to above, the

Respondents referred to above had raised a preliminary objection for the maintainability of the present

application on the following grounds,

a) Whether a Writ of Certiorari and Mandamus would lie in the present circumstances of the

case

4

b) whether any alternative remedy is available to the Petitioner

c) Whether the 4th Respondent owe a statutory duty as alleged by the Petitioner

As revealed before this court the 4th Respondent is a company which is duly incorporated under the

Companies Act No 7 of 2007 and the Petitioner was first appointed as "Bunkering Consultant" but

later appointed as the Deputy General Manager-Bunkering with effect from 3rd December 2014 as per

the terms and conditions specified in the letter of appointment produced marked P-4.

The said letter of appointment had been issued by the Chairman of MPMC (Private Limited) which is

the 4th Respondent and nowhere in the said letter there is reference to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority the

1 st Respondent to the present application.

The Petitioner had submitted that the MPMC Private Limited is a body owned, financed, operated and

answerable solely to the Government of Sri Lanka through Sri Lanka Ports Authority and therefore the

decisions taken by the 4th Respondent had a statutory flavour.

Whilst referring to the powers of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority the Petitioner had referred to the

following provisions of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act,

7 [1] (e) to make rules in relation to the officers and servants of the Authority, including the

appointment, promotion, remuneration, discipline, conduct, leave, working times,

holidays and grant of loans and advances of salary to them

(i) To acquire any under taking affording facilities for the loading and discharging or ware

housing of goods in any specified port or bunkering of vessels in such port

(m) To enter into and perform directly or through any other or agent authorized in that

behalf by the Authority. All such contracts as may be necessary for the performance of

the functions and the exercise of the powers of the Authority

5

and had argued that the MPMC is designed to perform the duties entrusted with the Sri Lanka

Ports Authority and therefore the MPMC is no more than an adjunct or agent of a statutory body, the

Sri Lanka Ports Authority.

However in the statutory provisions referred to above we see no reference what so ever to the MPMC

Private Limited and this court is of the view that the MPMC Private Limited is not established under

the provisions of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act but it is a duly incorporated company under the

Companies Act.

Therefore this court is not inclined to accept the above argument for the reason that,

a) the 4th Respondent is a duly incorporated company under the Companies Act No 7 of 2007

b) the employment of the petitioner was based on an employment contract between the

Petitioner and the 4th Respondent and not with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.

In this regard this court is mindful of the decision in Vidyodaya University V. Linus Silva 1 WLR 77

where the Privy Council dismissed the application for a Writ of Certiorari of an University Teacher

for the reason that, his position was merely that of an employee under an ordinary contract of Master

and Servants.

Professor Wade whilst commenting on the said decision submitted that "the mere fact that the

University is established by a statute does not necessarily make its powers statutory; it may engage its

jI

Iemployees under ordinary contract of service" (Administrative Law H W R Wade and C F Forsuth 10th

Edition pages 538,539) t

However the Petitioner whilst relying on the following observation made by Marsoof J in Harjani and

Another V. Indian Overseas Bank (2005) 1 Sri LR 167 at 176 to the effect, that "this court is bound

to exercise supervising jurisdiction over the exercise of such powers despite the fact that some at least

of these banks are local foreign banking companies," submitted that, the Supreme Court in the said

case had rejected the argument that writ would not lie against a company which is not a statutory body

I

on the grounds that the bank was attempting to take advantage of certain provisions relating to parate

executions which had been conferred on the bank by statute.

However I see no relevance of the said decision of the Supreme Court to the case in hand for the

reasons that,

a) The said case does not refer to a contractual relationship between an employee and the

employer.

b) The circumstances under which the said observations were made by the Supreme Court are

quite different to the circumstances of the present case.

As observed by me the Supreme Court had given its reasons for overruling the preliminary objection

by the bank that a writ would not lie against a Company, for the following reasons.

"In the light of those decisions it is necessary to consider whether the Writ of Certiorari is

available against a private banking company such as the lSI Respondent. The gist of the lSI

respondent's submission is that writ would not lie against a company which is not a statutory body.

The said Respondents have sought to take advantage of the provisions of the recovery of loans by

Banks (special Provisions) Act relating to parate execution. In fact in terms of the said Act the lSI

Respondent had the option of either adopting a resolution under section 4 to sell by public auction the

property mortgaged to it or authorize a person by resolution in terms of section 5 of the Act to take

over possession to manage the said property and to utilize its produce or profits for the settlement of

the loan. These powers have been conferred by the statue on any "bank" as defined in section 22 of the

Act. The Act lays down special procedures for the exercise of the owners conferred on such Banks,

and I am of the opinion that this court is bound to exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of

such powers despite the fact that some at least of these Banks are local or foreign Banking companies.

For the foregoing reasons, the preliminary objection taken on behalf of the Respondent Bank is

overruled .... "

As observed by this court earlier the circumstances under which the said decision in the Hirjani's case

was decided are different to the facts of the present case and therefore I see no relevance of the

decision in Hirjani's case to the case in hand.

In the case of Jay awe era V. Wijerathne (1985) 2 Sri LR 413 the question whether a Writ of Certiorari

and Mandamus would lie for breach of contract of commercial nature was discussed by the Court of

Appeal as follows; "where the relationship between the parties is purely a contractual one of a

commercial nature neither Certiorari nor Mandamus will lie to remedy grievances arising from an

alleged breach of contract of failure to observe the principle of natural justice even if one of the parties

is a Public Authority."

Petitioner to the present application is also seeking a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus to

compel the 1st to 1ih Respondents to reinstate/ restore the Petitioner in the post of Deputy General

Manager, and it is important to consider whether the said Respondents have a public duty to reinstate!

restore the Petitioner for this court to grant such relief to the Petition.

As observed earlier in this order 4th Respondent is duly incorporated companies under the Companies

Act No 7 of 2007 and 5th to 11th Respondents are Directors of the 4th Respondent MPMC (Private

Limited). The said Respondent does not have a public duty to perform. As further observed by me in

this order, Sri Lanka Ports Authority does not have a role to play under the provisions of the Sri Lanka

Ports Authority Act, with regard to the functions of the MPMC (Private Limited). Under these

circumstances I see no merit in the argument raised by the Petitioner, that the said Respondent has a

public duty to preform with regard to the functions of the 4th Respondent. In the case of Hakmana

Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd V. Fernando (1985) 2 Sri LR 272 the Supreme Court held,

that "The Petitioner before this court is seeking Mandamus to enforce a mere private duty arising from

a contract. This clearly is outside the scope of Mandamus."

As observed in the case of Vidyodaya University V. Linas Silva the Petitioner has an alternative

remedy to seek damages for wrongful termination and in addition he has a legal right to go before the

Labour Tribunal to challenge the termination if it was an unlawful termination under the Industrial

Disputed Act, but the Petitioner had invoked the jurisdiction of this court without seeking alternative

remedies available to him.

In the case of Mahanayake V. Chairman Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Others 2005 2 Sri LR

193 Sri Skandarajah J held that,

"The petitioner in this application is seeking to quash the aforesaid order of termination of her

employment P4. The order is arising out of a contract of employment and the termination complained

of based upon a breach of her contract of employment. In layaweera V. Wijetathne, G.P.S. de Silva J

held where the relationship between the parties is a purely contractual one of a commercial nature

neither Certiorari nor Mandamus will lie. On the other hand the Petitioner had effective alternate

remedies such as seeking redress before a Labour Tribunal under the Industrial Dispute Act. In

Hendrie Appuhamy V. lohan Appuhamy the court held where 2 specific remedy is given by a statute

there by deprives the person who insists upon a remedy of any other form of remedy than that given by It the statute. Under these circumstances a Writ of Certiorari will not be available to quash the order of

termination dated 29.08.2000 or a Writ of Mandamus to compel the 0151 02od: Respondents to reinstate

the Petitioner with back wages."

When considering the material already discussed above in this order I upheld the preliminary

objections raised by the Respondents before me and dismiss this application in limine.
