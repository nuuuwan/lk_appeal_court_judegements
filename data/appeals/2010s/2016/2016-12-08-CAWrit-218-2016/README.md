ORDER

P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner is a class 2 - 1 graduate teacher of Sri Lanka Teacher

Education Service who is serving at the Wayamba National college of

Education-Bingiriya.

The Petitioner in this application seeks to challenge the decision of the 1st

Respondent transferring her to the National College of Education

Peradeniya, and thereafter to the Teacher Center in Bibile, as reflected in

the document produced marked and P 9 and P 10.

When this case was supported by the learned counsel for the Petitioner on

2016-07-20 this court issued an interim relief as prayed for by the

\ { I .

I I

4

Petitioner in prayer IV of her petition, suspending the decision to transfer

the Petitioner. This Court, since the Respondents were absent on the date

of supporting this case only made this order valid for two weeks, as

required by the Supreme Court Rules 1990.

On the notice returnable date ( i.e on 2016-08-01) learned Deputy Solicitor

General appearing for the Respondents informed court that he would be

taking up a preliminary objection to the maintainability of this case.

Learned Deputy solicitor general has thereafter filed limited objections for

that purpose.

Learned counsel for both parties, when this case was taken up before this

court for inquiry into the said objection, agreed to file written submissions

on the said preliminary objection raised by the Respondents and requested

court to decide on the said preliminary objection on the written

submissions intended to be so filed by the parties. Learned Deputy Solicitor

General has pursuant to that, has filed written submissions. However the

Petitioners have not filed any written submissions.

It is the position of the Respondents that this application cannot be

maintained in view of Article 61 A of the Constitution which is as follows,

I

5

, " .......... subject to the provisions of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of

Article 126, no court or tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire

into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call in question any order or

decision made by the Commission, a committee, or any public officer, in

pursuance of any power or duty conferred or imposed on such

Commission, or delegated to a Committee or public officer, under this

chapter or under any other law ..... "

The judgments relied upon by the learned Deputy Solicitor General namely

Katugampola Vs. Commissioner General of Exercise and others (2003(3) S

L R 207) which was decided in 2003, Rathnasiri and others Vs. Ellawala

and others (2004 (2) S LR 180) which was decided in 2004 and

Dissanayake Vs. Salahudeen and others. C A 250/ 2013 and 251/ 2013

(decided on 2014-02-12) which was decided in 2014 show that this Court

has conSistently held that the provisions in Article 61 A ousts the writ

jurisdiction of this Court and grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Supreme

Court to hear and determine all such matters coming under the scope and

ambit of that Article. This court in al! the above cases without any

hesitation has upheld the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the

Respondents in those cases that the ouster clause in Article 61 A would,

6

beg bar to entertain those writ applications. The preliminary objection

taken up on behalf of the Respondents in this case is also the same.

Petitioner has not adduced any material with regard to this preliminary

objection for the consideration of this Court.

We see no reason to deviate from that line of jUdgments. We therefore

uphold the preliminary objection raised by the learned Deputy Solicitor

General on behalf of the Respondents and dismiss this application in limine.

Application dismissed in limine.
