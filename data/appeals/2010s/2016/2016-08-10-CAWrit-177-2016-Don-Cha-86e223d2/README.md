Heard Senior Counsel for the petitioner. The learned Additional Solicitor

General representing the 1st -3rd respondents and the learned President Counsel for

the 4th respondent. During the submissions before us the petitioner drew our

attention to the document which was produced marked P9A where the petitioner has

complained to the head of operation Sri Lanka Civil Aviation Authority Colombo of

certain incidents taken place on 25th August 2015 and 29th August 2015. The

petitioner complains the failure by the 2nd and 3rd respondents to investigate the said

complaints and seeks a writ of mandamus directing the authorities to investigate the

said complaints in addition to the other relief prayed for. However, it was further

revealed before us that subsequent to the incident on 29th August 2015, the

1

"

petitioner's services had been terminated by the 4th respondent and it is admitted

that the petitioner had filed a fundamental rights application before the Supreme

Court and failing the said application he had now gone before the Labour Tribunal.

He is now come before this Court after eight months to the original complaint

complaining of the inaction by the 1st to 3rd respondents.

The learned Additional Solicitor General who represents the 3rd respondent

before this Court had submitted a letter sent by the 3rd respondent to the petitioner

dated 23rd May 2016 requesting the petitioner to submit further information with

regard to a complaint he said to have lodged by a letter dated 16th May 2016.

Petitioner admits the receipt of this document but submits that he has received this

document subsequent to filing this application. As observed by us the papers were

submitted before this Court on 31 st May 2016. However, the learned Additional

Solicitor General appearing for the 1 st to 3rd respondents by producing the said

document informs Court that the petitioner is free to submit all the complaints he

has to make before the 3rd respondent for the 3rd respondent to inquire into.

When looking at the prayer before us, we observe that the petitioner's

complaint before this Court is the inaction by the 1 st to 3rd respondents to look into

the complains made by him but from the document the 3rd respondent has now

produced before this Court, we are satisfied that the 3rd respondent is now prepared

to look into the complaints made by the petitioner. The 3rd respondent being the

regulator he has a statutory duty to take action with regard to the outcome of the

inquiry that he is going to conduct. If the petitioner is not satisfied with the inquiry

he is now conducting the petitioner is free to complaint against his conduct at a

2

proper stage but we see that this is not the proper stage for the petitioner to comment

about the conduct of the 3rd respondent since he is now in the process of conducting

an inquiry into the complaints made by the petitioner. The petitioner further submits

that he has fIled this application in public interest litigation but we see no merit in

this submissions as we observe that he is a person who had been dismissed by the

4th respondent.

For the reasons set out above, we see no merit in this application and we

therefore not inclined to issue notices on the respondents. Application is accordingly

dismissed. No cost is ordered.

Application dismissed.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.

P. Padman Surasena, J.

I agree.
