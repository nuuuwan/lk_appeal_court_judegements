Decided on 141 10/2016

H. C. J. Madawala, J

This appeal dated 14112/2006 is preferred by the Appellant to set aside and dismiss

the orders of the Learned High Court Judge of the Central Province bounden in

Kandy in the Revision Application No 113/05. When this matter came up for

argument on 30/6/2016 the Appellant represented by Counsel made oral submissions

and forwarded a photo copy of the Case Dias v. Wanigaratne reported in 2005 SLR

Vol I p 225.

The Petitioner has filed a Revision Application in the Provincial High Court of Uva

Province to revise the order dated on 9/12/2003 of the Judge of the Primary Court of

Nuwara Eliya in case No 22785. Under Article 154(P) sub section (2)(b) of the

)

Constitution, the High Court of Uva Province did not have jurisdiction and the said

case record was transferred to the Central Province Provincial High Court since

Nuwara Eliya falls within the Central Province that has the revisionary jurisdiction

over an order made by the Nuwara Eliya Primary Court.

It was contended that there is no provision in law to transfer an application for

revision filed in one Provincial High Court to another Provincial High Court.

The Learned High Court Judge of the Central Province holden in Kandy by his order

dated 22/8/2006 had decided that the Provincial High Court of Uva did not have

jurisdiction to here and determine this revision application which has been

transferred to the Provincial High Court of Central Province and it is the Provincial

High Court of Central Province that has jurisdiction to here and determine same.

The officer-in-charge of Nuwara Eliya police filed a complaint under Section 66 of

the Primary Court Procedure Act stating that a dispute relating to possession in

respect of premises bearing No 21, Lady McCullums Drive Nuwara eliya had arisen

between the two parties and requested court to adjudicate relating to the same under

the provisions of the said Act. The Primary Court, after inquiry, made order on

31/8/2000 that the 1 st Petitioner S. Sithasivam and his party are entitled to possession

of the said premises and made further order prohibiting all disturbance of such

possession otherwise than under the authority of an order or decree of a competent

Court. While the 1 st Petitioner and his party were thus in exclusive possession of the

said premises on 4/6/2003 he has been forcibly dispossessed in contravention of the

order made by the Primary Court on 31/8/2000. The Petitioners state that the Ceylon

Workers Congress prior to that dispossession complained of now, has filed an action

in the District Court of Colombo bearing Case No. 61841 Spl against the 1 st Petitioner

and his Ceylon Workers Alliance and had obtain an interim injunction against the 1 st

Petitioner and Ceylon Workers alliance from carrying on Trade Union activities at

the said premises 21, Lady McCullums Drive.

5

The said order of the District Court of Colombo was challenged by way of Leave to

Appeal in CALA application No. 182/2003 by the 1 st Petitioner and the Court of

Appeal finally made a determination suspending the operation of the interim

injunction granted by the District Court in the said case until any contrary order is

made by the Court of Appeal. The Petitioner by way of petition and affidavit dated

2110112004 filed an application for restoration of the said Premises. Petitioners

moved court that the Respondents had acted in violation of its order and have

forcibly ejected the Petitioners from there lawful possession and moved that court

be pleased to punish the Respondents for contempt of Court under Section 73 of the

said Act. The Respondents without filing any objections or without showing any

cause against the contempt of court charge raised a preliminary objection against the

court proceedings any further with the said matters.

Further the Learned Primary Court Judge made order on 9/12/2003 had stated that

since 2 years and 11 months had passed since the date of the original order and the

Respondent according to the said order have originally handed over possession to

the Petitioners and a long period of time has passed since then and in the

Circumstances the court cannot grant the relief prayed for to restore possession or

act under section 73 of the said act and dismissed the Petitioners application.

Being aggrieved by the said determination of the Learned Magistrate dated

911212003 the Petitioners appeal against the said order by way of revision on the

following grounds of appeal;

(a) The said order is contrary to law and against the weight of evidence

adduced in this case.

(b) The Learned Judge totally misdirected himself in not making a

determination commanded by the law for him to do i. e on the I)I

f , 1 t

application made to restore the Petitioners to possession and punish

the Accused who have by violence dispossessed the Petitioners by

unlawful means specifically for the reason that in the original order

dated 311812000 the Primary Court has prohibited all disturbance of

possession of the Petitioner otherwise than under the authority of and

order or decree of a competent court under 68(3) of the said act.

(c) Instead the Learned Magistrate has misdirected himself in not

administering justice according to law and has legitimized the

unlawful and illegal dispossession of the premises by the

Respondents which was original given to the Petitioners by the

Primary Court which possession is S) 'I1onymous with possession

under the authority and supervision by the Primary Court and

therefore contempt of its authority and those who had violated should

have been punished and the Petitioners should have been restored to

possession forthwith especially when the Respondents have not

justified their possession with any court authority to evict the

Petitioners by lawful means.

(d)It is respectfully and humbly submitted that the law relating to this

dispute is very clear and the Supreme Court has held in the case No

4912002 Kayas Vs. Nazeer and two others that the Primary Court

activities the fiscal under Sec 76 to eject a person who was placed in

possession by Primary Court and who has been dispossessed while

such order is in force under 68(3) and 68(4) by using the inherent

powers of court arising from a conviction for violating the orders

made under Sec 68(1) and (2) independent of any discretion to

restore possession of that person. The said judgment of the Supreme

Court is binding on the Primary Court and has been not followed

and disregarded in utter contempt of the Supreme Court authority.

It was submitted by the Petitioners that as there was sufficient material available on

the record to have made a determination in favour of the Petitioners restoring them

to the possession they held however the Learned Judge has misdirected himself and

when he should have convicted those who have committed contempt and acted in

violation of the Primary Court order made originally on 3118/2000 he has failed to

do so.

Further it was submitted that the erroneous order made by the Learned Judge has;

(a) Resulted in miscarriage of justice to the Petitioner,

(b ) Irreparable damage and irremediable mischief would be caused

to the Petitioners unless they are restored to possession they held

previously.

(c) In the aforementioned premises the Petitioners humbly submit

that they have been denied a fair and impartial inquiry

occasioning failure of justice entitling to humbly request the

intervention of your Lordships court acting in revision to

forthwith order the Learned Primary Court Judge to proceed with

the trial of contempt proceedings as well as order that the

Petitioners be restored to possession.

Accordingly moved court to act in revision and set aside the order of the Learned

Judge dated 9/12/2003 and to make a determination that the Petitioners be ordered

to be restored to possession of the premises which is situated at No 21, Lady

McCullum Drive Nuwara Eliya and make order to the Primary Court Judge to

proceed to hear the contempt charge filed against the Respondents and for cost.

When considering the appeal that has been tendered to court, we find in the caption

of the petition for the Appellant that he had not indicated the Article and section that

he is invoking the jurisdiction of this court. In the petition it is stated as follows,

"1990 qot:.J) 19 ~6@6) OS)oSQ)~ ~)at:.J)6@6) (a@~) aaaG))~ o~@oS

Further in the prayer of the petition he had only prayed for the dismissal of the

Revision Application and has failed to indicate the date of the order of the Learned

High Court Judge that he wants court to set aside. However on a perusal of the record

in this case we find that there are two orders made by the Learned High Court Judge

namely, order dated 22/8/2008 and order dated 2411112006.

On a perusal of the petition we find that,

( a) the Appellant had contended the jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court

of Badulla and had stated that it had no power to transfer the Revision

Application to the Provincial High Court ofKandy and accordingly,

(b) it was contended that the Learned High Court Judge had no power to

hold an inquiry and make an order and,

(c) the final order made in this Revision Application is contrary to the facts

and law made in this application.

The Learned High Court Judge of Central Province of Kandy in his order dated

2411112006 has ordered the Primary Court Judge of Nuwara Eliya to re hear and

determine this case a fresh.

On a perusal of the record it is observed that the Learned High Court Judge of the

Central Province Provincial High Court of Kandy has made his order dated

24/1112006. The Learned High Court Judge of Central Province in Kandy has

ordered to re hear and determine this case a fresh. According to journal entry on the

14th of the December 2006 the Appellant has filed this appeal against the order of

the Learned High Court Judge. We find that the petition of appeal has been tendered

to court after 14 days has lapsed.

According to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979

Section 331 read as follows,

331. (1) "An appeal under this chapter may be lodged by presenting a

petition of appeal or application for leave to appeal to the registrar

of the High Court within fourteen days from the date when the

conviction, sentence or order sought to be appealed against was

pronounced. "

Section 331 sub section 2 read as follows,

331. (2) "In computing the time within which an appeal may be

preferred, the day on which the judgment or final order appealed

against was pronounced shall be included, but all Sundays and public

holidays shall be excluded. "

In the present case the order of the High Court Judge has been delivered on 24th of

November 2006 on a Friday and the petition of appeal has been tendered to court on

14th of December 2006 on a Thursday. When applying the above Section 331(2) of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, it is seen that the 14 days ends

on the 12th of December 2006. As such 14 days has lapsed and there is a delay of2

days. Hence we hold that the petition of appeal is out of time and therefore we

dismiss this appeal without cost.

Accordingly as the petition of appeal is out of time, we do not intend to make any

order as to the merit of this case.

Hence we dismiss this appeal without cost.
