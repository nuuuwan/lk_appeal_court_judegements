This is an appeal from the High Court of Rathnapura. The facts of

the case are briefly as follows.

The State has acquired an extent of land to expand the University

of Sabaragamuwa under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. The

portion of land claimed by the Respondent Petitioner Appellant (the

2

Appellant) was also a land so acquired. After the acquisition, the

Applicant Respondent Respondent (the Respondent) the Divisional

Secretary of Imbulpe, filed an application under the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act to recover the possession of the land. The

learned Magistrate dismissed the application on the technical ground that

the Respondent (the applicant in that case) has failed to tender an

application in the prescribed form with the affidavit. Thereafter, the

Respondent filed the present application in the Magistrate Court of

Balangoda under section 42(2) of the Land Acquisition Act no. 09 of

1950 (as amended) seeking for an order to evict the Appellant. The

Applicant filed objection to this application mainly on two grounds,

firstly that the acquisition was done under proviso of section 38 of the

Act for an urgent requirement but the action was instituted after eleven

years and therefore the urgent requirement cannot exist and secondly

pleaded res judicata. The learned Magistrate rejected the objections and

allowed the application to evict the Applicant. Being aggrieved by the

said order the Appellant moved the matter in revision in the High Court

of Rathnapura. The learned High Court Judge dismissed the revision

application. This appeal is from that order.

The acquisition was not challenged. It has been published in the

Gazette. The Appellant's contention is that the delay in obtaining

possession of the land acquired under the proviso of section 38 of the Act

by the Government does vitiate the acquisition. In the present case the

Respondent has taken steps to recover possession under a different Act,

i.e., State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, but failed on a technical

ground. Even otherwise that attempt would have failed because it has

been held in the case of [2001] 3 Sri L R 34 EDWIN v.

TILLAKARA TNE that when the statutory scheme embodied in the Land

3

Acquisition Act itself provides a procedure for ejectment or remedy it

must in the generality of cases, be taken to exclude any other procedure

or remedy. Further held that the application that had been made to the

Magistrates Court in pursuance of S. 5 of the State Lands Recovery of

Possession Act cannot be proceeded with.

After the dismissal of that action, the Appellant negotiated with the

Respondent to obtain time to vacate the premises. The Respondent states

that on "humanitarian and compassionate grounds" he has postponed the

taking of steps to evict the Appellant.

Ones the land is acquired by the State, it does not become a private

land unless the State divest it. The delay in taking steps to recover

possession does not divest the land on the Respondent. There was no

inordinate delay because the state has given time to the Appellant to

vacate the land.

The second argument is the plea of res judicata. The first action

was on State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act and the second action is

under Land Acquisition Act. The first action was dismissed on a technical

reason. Unless the previous action is decided on merits, the doctrine of

res judicata does not apply.

Ranjith vs. Piyaseeli [2006J 2 Sri L R 325

Per Wimalachandra, J:

"To constitute a judicial decision a res judicata, the decision must

be on merits, it must be a final decision on the merits. It appears

that a decision on issues in a case rather than on procedural

grounds is a decision on the merits."

The two main grounds that the Appellant relied on in the revision

application in the High Court are legally unacceptable.

4

Revision is an extra ordinary jurisdiction exercise by the Appellate

Court to remedy the miscarriage of justice. To invoke this extra ordinary

jurisdiction, the party seeking the relief must plead and establish the

exceptional circumstances.

Dharmaratne and another V Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd and

others [2003] 3 Sri L R 24

Per Amaratunga, J.

"Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which

the court selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary

method of rectification should be adopted, if such a selection

process is not there revisionary jurisdiction of this court will

become a gateway of every litigant to make a second appeal in the

garb of a Revision Application or to make an appeal in situations

where the legislature has not given a right of appeal."

2. The practice of Court is to insist in the exercise of exceptional

circum stances for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken

deep root in our law and has got hardened into a rule which should

not be lightly disturbed.

3. The petitioner has not pleaded or established exceptional

circumstances warranting the exercise of revisionary powers.

In the present case the Appellant has failed to establish the

existences of exceptional circumstances.

In the instant case the State has acquired the land under Land

Acquisition Act. The acquisition was not challenged. Under section 42(2)

the State can recover the possession of the acquired land. The section

reads thus;

III!

I

t

I! II

I

42. (1) No officer Shall, under section 40, take possession of any

occupied building or any part of an occupied building without

giving the occupier of the building at least forty-eight hours' notice

of the intention to do so.

(2) Where any officer directed by an Order under section 38 to take

possession of any land is unable or apprehends that he will be

unable to take possession of that land because of any obstruction

or resistance which has been or is likely to be offered, such officer

shall, on his making an application in that behalf to the

Magistrate's Court having jurisdiction over the place where that

land is situated, be entitled to an order of that court directing the

Fiscal to deliver possession of that land to him for and on behalf of

the State.

(3) Where an order under subsection (2) is issued to the Fiscal by a

Magistrate's Court, he shall forthwith execute that order and shall

in writing report to that court the manner in which that order was

executed.

(4) For the purpose of executing an order issued by a Magistrate's

Court under subsection (2), the Fiscal or any person acting under

his direction may use such force as may be necessary to enter the

land to which that order relates and to eject any person in

occupation of that land and to deliver possession of that land to the

officer who is authorized to take possession of that land for and on

behalf of the State.

The Respondent acting under section 42(2) presented the

application to the relevant Magistrate Court. It has been held in the case

of Gunawardene vs. D.R.O. Weligam Korale that it is not necessary to

hear the occupier before issuing the order to the fiscal to deliver the

6

posseSSIOn. Further held that the application must be supported by an

affidavit to establish the fats stated therein.

H. S. H. P. Gunawardene vs. D. R. O. Weligam Korale, 69 NLR

166 at 167,

The wording of section 42 (2) seems to contemplate that before an

officer could obtain an order under that section he must satisfy the

Court that he is unable or apprehends that he will be unable to

take possession of the land because of any obstruction or

resistance which has been or is likely to be offered. ................. .

While I agree with the observations of my brother Sirimane, J. in

Mohamed Lebbe v. Madana 1[(1964) 66 N. L. R. 239.], that when

an order under section 42 (2) directing the Fiscal to deliver

possession of the land is made, any person in occupation of the

land is not entitled to be heard in opposition to the application, I

think it desirable, even though these proceedings are in the nature

of execution proceedings, that there should be evidence either

orally or on affidavit led before the Magistrate in support of the

averments in the application before an ejectment order is made,

particularly when a request is made for the use of force, if

necessary, to take possession of the land. This evidence may be led

ex parte and if the Magistrate is satisfied with the material placed

before him, an ejectment order under section 42 (2) may be issued.

In the present case the Divisional Secretary of Imbulpe, the officer

directed to take possession, has sworn an affidavit and stated that he is the

officer directed to take possession of the land and that he apprehends that

he will be unable to take possession of that land because of obstruction or

resistance which is likely to be offered. The affidavit was tendered to

Court with the application.

The learned Magistrate considering the application with the

documents, correctly issued the order to the fiscal to evict the appellant

and the learned High Court Judge affirmed the said order of the learned

Magistrate and dismissed the revision application. We see no reason to

interfere with those findings.

I dismiss the appeal without costs.
