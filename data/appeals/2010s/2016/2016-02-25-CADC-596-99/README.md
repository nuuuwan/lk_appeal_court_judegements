Argued On:-03.06.2014

Decided On:-18.02.2016

H.N.J.Perera, J.

The plaintiff-appellant instituted action seeking among substantive

reliefs that she is not liable to pay a sum of Rs. 400,000/- to the pt

defendant-respondent but only a sum of Rs.109,083.85. As an interim

relief she prayed for an interim injunction to restrain the 3rd defendant-

respondent from paying the full sum of the bank guarantee (Rs. 400,000/-) to the pt defendant-respondent who claimed the said

amount as the sum due to it from the plaintiff-appellant.

The plaintiff-appellant was acting as an agent of the pt defendant-

respondent for the purpose of sale of Sun flower oil, Soya oil, and other

food items in Sri Lanka and received a commission from the pt

defendant-respondent from the said sales. The agents called and known

as stockist had to purchase goods on credit facilities provided to them

and they were paid commissions. The plaintiff-appellant being one of the

pt defendant-respondent's agent stockist purchased goods on the terms

and conditions set out in Pl. The plaintiff-appellant also had to furnish a bank guarantee for a sum of Rs.400,OOO/- as security for the pt

defendant-respondent to recover any outstanding amount due to the pt

defendant-respondent from the plaintiff-appellant. It is the position of

the plaintiff-appellant that in pursuant to the furnishing of the said bank guarantee the pt defendant-respondent stocked goods with the plaintiff-appellant and she sold the same to the customers with the assistance of the pt defendant-respondent's sales representatives

t t , ! ,

without any dispute until 31.03.1994 and made payments to the pt

defendant-respondent as per document marked P4a and P4b. Thereafter a dispute arose between them with regard to the damaged goods which were returned by the plaintiff-appellant to the pt defendant-respondent

and as a result of the said dispute the plaintiff-appellant was compelled to request the pt defendant-respondent to inform her the actual amount

due from her as according to her calculations It was only a sum of Rs. 109,083.85, but the 1st defendant-respondent failed to reply the said letter and insisted that the 3rd defendant-respondent should pay the entire sum of Rs.400,000/- in the bank guarantee as the sum due to the

pt defendant-respondent. The plaintiff-appellant thereafter made

representation to the 3rd defendant-respondent and attempted to

prevent the 3rd defendant-respondent from releasing the said sum of Rs.400,000/- to the pt defendant -respondent as all her attempts failed

she instituted this action and obtained an interim injunction against the 3rd defendant-respondent from releasing the said money to the pt

defendant-respondent.After trial the learned Additional District Judge delivered judgment on 13.07.1999 holding that the plaintiff-appellant is

liable to pay a sum of Rs.192,654.51 together with legal interest to the

pt defendant-respondent. Aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned trial Judge the plaintiff-appellant has preferred this appeal to this court.

When this matter was taken up for argument before this court the pt

respondent was absent and unrepresented. After the conclusion of the oral submissions of the Counsel for the plaintiff-appellant, as the dispute was between the plaintiff-appellant and the pt defendant-respondent the Counsel appearing for the 2nd and 3rd defendant-respondents informed court that they will not be making submissions before this

court.

The main contention of the Counsel for the plaintiff-appellant was that the learned trial Judge has failed to consider the statement of accounts

3

submitted by the plaintiff-appellant in proof of a sum of Rs.14S,20S.80

and the return of goods worth Rs.S4,372.80. The learned trial Judge also

has rejected the evidence of the witness Priyantha Galappaththi who was an ex-employee of the pt defendant-respondent erroneously.

On perusal of the judgment of the learned trial Judge it is clearly seen

that the learned trial Judge after considering the overall evidence that was led in this case has accepted the correctness of the documents submitted by the pt defendant-respondent and more particularly the

statements marked 1 V1 to 1 V3. Furthermore has given cogent reasons

for not believing the evidence given by the said witness Galappaththi. It

was the pt defendant-respondent's position that he never received any

money from the said witness, and if any money had been received by the said witness, he would have invariably issued a receipt for the same. It is very clear that the learned trial Judge has considered the said

suggestions put forward by the parties and has opted to believe the pt defendant-respondent.

The plaintiff-appellant's position in this case was that after deducting the

value of the goods that she has returned to the defendant-respondent,

and the value of the goods that are in her custody at the moment and after deducting the commissions and the other payments which are payable to her by the pt defendant-respondent she only had to pay Rs.109,083.8S to the pt defendant-respondent. The plaintiff-appellant

has stated that by 31.12.1993 the plaintiff-appellant has paid the pt defendant-respondent a sum of Rs.14S,20S.80 for the goods sold. By

18.03.1994 she has returned to the pt defendant-respondent goods to the value of Rs.S4,372.80 which was found unsuitable for sale. And she further had with her goods to the value of Rs. 42,834/- as stock in hand. Therefore the Plaintiff-appellant claimed that she owes only a sum of

Rs.109,083.8S as shown in her statement of account marked P7 to the pt defendant-respondent.

The pt defendant-respondent denied the payment of Rs.145,285.80 by

the plaintiff-appellant. The defendant-respondent claimed that the plaintiff-appellant had paid only Rs.75,OOO/-by 31.12.1983. It was the

position of the defendant-respondent that even if you add the amount of Rs. 45,285.80 shown in the bank statement for the month of January 1984 of the plaintiff-appellant marked P4a, the plaintiff-appellant has paid only a sum of Rs.120,285.80. And even after adding the value of cheques the pt defendant-respondent has received from the other

agents amounting to Rs.18,086.13 , the plaintiff-appellant has paid only

Rs. 138,371.93 to the pt defendant-respondent. It was also the pt

defendant-respondent's position that the plaintiff-appellant has also

deducted commission even for goods she has not sold at that time and that she further has goods worth of Rs.42,834/-in her possession and that she has failed to return or deliver the said goods back to the pt defendant-respondent. Therefore the pt defendant-respondent has

stated that the statement of accounts marked P7 does not disclose the true position and claimed a sum of Rs.192,654.55 and the interest

thereto totaling Rs.395,672.73 as shown in the statement of accounts

marked 1 Vi by the pt defendant-respondent.

The learned trial Judge has very clearly considered the statements of

accounts tendered by both parties and has come to a clear conclusion that the statement of accounts marked and tendered by the plaintiff-appellant as P7 is inaccurate. According to the plaintiff-appellant she has received goods to the value of RS.424,716.25 between 24.11.1983 and 18.03.1984 from the pt defendant-respondent. And in the statement of accounts marked P7 she has deducted a sum of Rs.21,235.83 as commissions. After deducting the said commission the plaintiff-appellant still owes the defendant-respondent a sum of Rs.403,480.67. Although the plaintiff-appellant has returned goods worth of Rs.54,372.87, the plaintiff has failed to take into account the said sum of

5

I

Rs.2718.64 which she has already deducted as commission for the said amount. In 1V1 the defendant-respondent has accordingly has shown

the said sum of Rs.2718.64 as a sum owing to him by the plaintiff-appellant.

The learned trial Judge after perusing the said statements of accounts

tendered by the parties had stated that it is clearly seen that the

payments of Rs.50,000/-, Rs25,000/-and 45,285.80 the plaintiff-appellant has made to the defendant-respondent are properly been given credit to in the statement of account marked 1V1. Further the

learned trial Judge has stated that although the plaintiff-appellant has

claimed that she has paid a sum of Rs.120,285.80 to the pt defendant-respondent even the documents tendered by the plaintiff-appellant marked as P4a, P4b or by the bank statements do not support the said position. The pt defendant-respondent has clearly denied that he received the said sum from the plaintiff-appellant.

The learned trial Judge has further held that the plaintiff-appellant has failed to prove that she has paid a sum of Rs.19,911.15 to the pt

defendant-respondent and further the amount claimed by the plaintiff-

appellant in her statement P7 cannot be accepted and is incorrect and that the court cannot act on the said statement P7. The learned trial Judge has also stated that the plaintiff-appellant also has failed to explain and prove how she became entitled to receive a sum of Rs.30,550/- as

shown in the statement P7.

The plaintiff-appellant has stated that she has in her custody goods to the value of Rs.40834/- and that the pt defendant-respondent has failed to send its agents to collect the same. The learned trial judge has held that the plaintiff-appellant should have returned the said goods to the

pt defendant-respondent and as she has failed to do so and as the goods

6

are still in her custody she has to pay the pt defendant-respondent the said amount.

As regard the Rs.25,OOO/- , the amount the plaintiff-appellant claimed

that she has paid through an agent named Priyantha Galappaththi, after considering the evidence of the said witness and the plaintiff the learned trial Judge has held with the pt defendant-respondent. The pt

defendant-respondent has denied receiving any money from the said witness and also has clearly stated that if the money has been paid by the plaintiff-appellant through the said witness there should have been a receipt issued for the said amount.

In this case the learned trial Judge after having considered the documents and the evidence placed before court by both parties have clearly held that the plaintiff-appellant has failed to prove that the

defendant.-respondent owes her the said amount stated in P7 and also

that the plaintiff has failed to substantiate the same with any documentary evidence. The learned trial Judge has accepted the statement of account marked lVl by the defendant-respondent to be

accurate and true and has held that the plaintiff-appellant owes the defendant-respondent a sum of Rs. 192,654.51 with interest.

The learned trial Judge has also held that as per the agreement marked

Pi the defendant-respondent is not entitled to claim an interest of 15%.

The defendant-respondent too has conceded the said fact. Therefore the

learned trial Judge has held that the defendant-respondent is entitled to

legal interest on the said sum.

This court finds that the learned Additional District Judge has evaluated and considered in detail all the evidence that has been led by parties in arriving at the conclusion she did in this case. The learned trial Judge had dealt with all the points in issue in the case and pronounced definite findings on the issues. The learned trial Judge in her judgment has held

I! II

I

,

that the plaintiff-appellant has failed to prove by documentary evidence or otherwise, her statement of accounts marked P7 and prove that she owed the defendant-respondent only the amount as pleaded in the

plaint. The learned trial Judge has clearly held that the plaintiff-respondent owes the defendant-respondent the sum stated in the statement of accounts marked as IVI by the defendant-respondent. On

a balance of probability the learned trial Judge accepted the evidence of the pt defendant-respondent. I have considered the entire judgment,

and see no reason to interfere and the trial Judge has given cogent reasons. Primary facts have been considered and this court has no reason to interfere with primary facts.

In M.P.Munasinghe V. C.P.Liyanage 69 N.L.R 97 it was held that:-

({If there is no evidence to support a particular conclusion (and this is

really a question of law) the Appellate Court will not hesitate so to decide. But if the evidence as a whole can reasonably be regarded as

justifying the conclusion arrived at the trial, and especially if that conclusion has been arrived at on conflicting testimony by a tribunal

which saw and heard the witnesses, the Appellate Court will bear in mind that it has not enjoyed this opportunity and that the view of the trial

Judge as to where credibility lies is entitled to great weight."

For the above reasons I see no reason to disturb the judgment of the

learned Additional District Judge. Accordingly the appeal of the plaintiff-

appellant is dismissed with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
