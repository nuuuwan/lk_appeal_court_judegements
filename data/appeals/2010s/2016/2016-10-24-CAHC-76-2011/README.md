M.M.A.Gaffoor,J.

Heard both counsel.

In this case the accused had been indicted for committing the murder

of one Abdul Raheem Rameez on or about 30th March 2008. According to

the prosecution the deceased was engaged and was ready to get married to a

Muslim girl who happened to be the sister- in- law of the accused. On the

day in question the deceased visited the house of the intended bride, at that

time the intended bride and her mother were in the rear part of the house, in

the kitchen. The intended father- in- law and the brother- in- law were with

the deceased in the verandah of the house.

It is alleged that the accused assaulted the deceased with a wooden

plank. The injured deceased was taken to the central camp hospital from

where he was transferred to Ampara Hospital and finally transferred to

Kandy hospital where he had succumbed to injuries and died.

The prosecution heavily relied on the Judicial Medical Offices Post-

mortem Report which described seven injuries in the region of the head of

the deceased. Among the injuries were a fracture to the head and a

laceration to the brain. According to the evidence of the Judicial Medical

Officer even one injury of this nature would have cause death due to

hemorrhage and damage to the brain.

The accused did not call witnesses but gave evidence. The evidence

for the prosecution was that the father- in -law, eye witness to the case and

also the brother- in- law who also corroborated the above evidence. The

father- in- law had made a prompt complaint to the police. It is to be noted

that no contradictions or omissions were marked in the evidence of the two

witnesses. It was not even suggested by the defence that the witnesses were

fabricating evidence against the accused. The defence had not challenged

the position of the witnesses at the time they gave evidence before High

Court. In the Indian case of Himal Chandh Pradesh V. Thakur Das (1983)

2 Cri.LJ.1694 AT page I071it had been held that whenever a statement

made by a witness is not challenged in cross examination it has to be

concluded that the fact in question is not disputed.

In the light of the above background it is paramount duty of this court

in the exercise of its appellate power to be mind full of Article 137 of the

Constitution in determining whether the substantial rights have been

1 !

4 prejudiced or a failure of the justice has been occasioned in contemplating

in reversing or vary of the judgment.

With this guideline in mind I have perused the entirety of the

evidence, the judgment, the written submissions an the case law authorities

submitted by both parties. I have also considered the submissions made by

the defence counsel regarding Section 2 of Section 294 of the Penal Code

which amounts to exceeding the private defence and whereby an accused

could be convicted for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. It will

be seen that this argument does not bear strength to the fact that there had

been no instance of private defence as urged by the defence. The learned

trial judge in a lengthy judgment has rejected the defence of plea of grave

and sudden provocation convicted the appellant for an offence under

Section 296 for murder and imposed the death sentence.

The "burden of proving" a special Exception in Section 294 of

the Penal Code was discussed by the Privy Council in the case of

Jayasena V. The Queen 72 New law Reports 313. In this

case the accused was charged with murder and he admitted at the

trial that the deceased died of wounds deliberately inflected

5

by him with intention to kill and his defence was that he was acting in self-

defence.

Lord Devlin in his judgment said: " The right of private defence to a

charge of murder is permitted not only as a general exception by Section 93

( of the Penal Code) but also as a special exception in section 294 itself'.

Then he mentioned about section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance and

said" that the burden of proof is settled by that section (105 of the Evidence

Ordinance)". He referred to section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance. The said

section (3) is as follows:-

A fact is said to be proved when, after considering the matters before

it, the court either believes it to exist or considers it existence so probable

that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to

act upon the supposition that it exists".

Having referred to the above two sections of the Evidence Ordinance

Lord Devlin Observed: ""Section 1 05 read with section 3 of the Evidence

Ordinance imposes upon the accused the burden of proof on the issue of

private defence. "When the accused admitted that he deliberately inflicted

6

the fatal injuries on the deceased with the intention to kill him and that he

was acting in self-defence it cannot be contended on behalf of the accused

that he has not got to provide any sort of proof that he was acting in private

defence . It is not sufficient for the accused to raise a doubt as to whether he

is entitled to benefit of right of private defence." This was held by the

Private defence". This was held by the Privy Council in the said case

(Jayasena V. The Queen).

In relation to the above mitigatory circumstances it is opportune to

reiterate the undernoted observations.

1. The accused in order to succeed in the mitigatory defence must

prove by way of an objective test that such provocation was likely to

destroy the self control of a man of the class of society to which the

accused belonged. Vide Gratiaen J. in Jamis V.Queen - (1952) 53

NLR 401.

2. The word "sudden" implies that the reaction of the accused should

be almost instinctive without any element of scheming or contriving.

7

3, The test of grave provocation contains the subjective as well as a

objective element Rose, C.l. in Muthubanda ( 1954) 56 NLR 217.

4. The words 'grave" and "sudden" are both of the relative terms.

And must at least to a great extent be decided in comparing the nature

of provocation with that of the retaliatory act. Vide Lord Goddard

( Privy Council) in K.D.l Perera - 54 NLR 266.

5. It is to be noted that the Appellant Court is reluctant to interfere

with a judgment pronounced by the High Court on the facts of the

case where the judge of the original Court had the opportunity to

observe the demeanor of the witness in Court. This has been decided

in the case of King v. Gunarathna 14 CLR at 174 Mcdonald C.J,

observed that the function of an Appellate Court in dealing with a

judgment mainly on the facts from a Court which had been heard the

facts as follows:-

i) Was the judgment of the Court unreasonably against the

Weight of the evidence.

ii) Was there misdirection either on the law or the evidence.

8

iii) Has the trial court drawn the wrong inferences form the

matters in evidence.

The learned Counsel for the defence has reiterated the position

that considering the circumstances of the case that the conviction is

too harsh and it should be brought down to culpable homicide not

amounting to murder.

It is to be noted that as to matters of assessing the sentence in

the case of A.G. v. HN de Silva - 57 NLR 124, Basnayake Acting

c.J. observed that a Judge should in determining the proper sentence.

First consider the gravity of the offence as at appears from the

nature of the act itself.

And should have regard for the punishment provided in

the Penal Code.

In the case of A.G. V. Mendis 1995 1SLR 138 to decide what

sentence to be imposed on an accused the judge has to consider the

I

1 I 1 I

9

point of view of the accused on the one hand and the interest of the

society on the other.

Having referred to the above authorities it is clear that the High

Court had been guided by the above principles and had taken into the

consideration the fact that should be considered in deciding the

sentence.

Taking into consideration the above facts this Court sees no

reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court.

In the circumstances, the appeal ~tands dismissed.
