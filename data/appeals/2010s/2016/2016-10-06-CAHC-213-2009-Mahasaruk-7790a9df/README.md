Before considering the grounds of appeal raised by the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant

referred to above, this court will now proceed to analyze the case for the prosecution as revealed

before the High Court from the prosecution witnesses.

As revealed by the evidence placed before the High Court, this incident referred to a detection

conducted by the officers attached to the Uppuweli Police Station on a tip off received by an

informant. The said detection has been conducted by Inspector of Police Wijerathne of Uppuweli

Police Station.

According to the evidence of IP Wijerathne, after receiving an information to the effect that a woman

is selling heroin, he had left the police station with a police party consist of four police officers in a

Police Jeep accompanied by the informant. When the police party reached the area called Palai Yootu

near the rail track, the informant showed a woman on the rail track and after showing her, he got

down from the Jeep. After moving few meters ahead, the Jeep was stopped and witness Wijerathne

who got down from the Jeep had walked up to the woman and asked her to give heroin if she

possessed. At that stage she gave him a long envelop canceled in her blouse. When opened the said

envelop he observed six small Polythene Packets and inside those packets a substance which was

suspected as heroin was found. After the said recovery the woman was arrested and taken her to the

Jeep.

According to witness Wijerathne on seeing him reaching towards her, he observed that the accused

was shaken and shocked and therefore did not try to do anything. After the arrest of the suspect the

party went direct to the nearby Government Dispensary in order to weigh the productions, but the

dispensary was closed since it was around 5.00 pm. Thereafter they went to Modern Jewellers at N.C.

Road and the production was weighed in the presence of the suspect. The brown powder recovered

was five grams and it was sealed at the same time.

4

When they returned to the police station the suspect was further searched through WPC Lalini but

nothing discriminatory was found from her.

The production which was in the custody of IP Wijerathne was handed over to PC Karunarathne who

was on reserve after entering it under PR 47/99 at 18.30 hours.

PS 20009 Piyasena who accompanied the previous witness had corroborated the evidence given by

him with regard to the recovery of the production, he took up the position that, the recovery was

made by witness Wijerathne and he could remember accompanying IP Wijerathne with another

officer.

It is this witness who had handed over the productions to the Magistrate's Court Trincomalee on

07.09.1999 after receiving the productions from PC 32170 Wijerathne. He has taken charge of the

production around 9-30 am from the police station and handed over to the courts around 14.45 hours.

In order to corroborate the above detection witnesses L. Sumathipala, and K.M Karunadasa were also

called by the prosecution and they too had corroborated the prosecution version.With regard to the

evidence of the above witnesses it is observed that no contradictions were marked in their evidence

during the High Court trial.

In addition to the above witnesses, the prosecution had called witnesses PS. 56199 Podinilame, PS

32216 Dayarathne, PS 32170 Wijerathne in order to establish the production chain but one important

witness in the production chain PC 19753 Karunarathne was not called as a witness since he was

dead at that time.

The next witness the prosecution had relied was Mrs. Sriyani Sakunthala Tennakoon the Deputy

Government Analyst.

According to her evidence the production was received by M. Sivarajah on 01.10.1999 through Police

Constable Lanthewela of Uppuweli Police. She speaks of some alterations in the original receipt

5

issued by Mr. M. Sivarajah with regard to Reference Number and the Case Number referred to in the

said receipt but confirms that the copy of the same receipt is found in the Magistrate's Court Record

of the present case. She further confirms the fact that Magistrate's seal found on the receipt was

available on the parcel received and the said seal was intact. Witness had further referred to another

seal found on the envelop marked P-1A.

According to the evidence of the Government Analyst Ms. Tennakoon 2.22 grams of Diacetyl-

Morphine (Heroin) was identified from the said production.

As observed above, in addition to other witnesses, the prosecution had called four witnesses to

confirm the detection which took place on 23.08.1999 and no contradiction were marked between

their evidence. The only contradiction marked during the High Court trial was the contradiction

which was marked as A-1 from the evidence of witness Wijerathne per say.

In his evidence before the High Court he had said that, when he went up to the woman, the others

were waiting at the jeep but in cross examination he took up the position that three others came with

him. This fact was later corroborated by the other police officers who accompanied him for the

detection and no contradictions were marked from their evidence.

II

~

As observed by this court the Learned Trial Judge was mindful of this contradiction and had analyzed

it in his judgment and correctly concluded that the said contradiction does not go to the root of the

case and decide to ignore the said contradiction.

When considering the four grounds of appeal raised by the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant

it is observed that the said grounds are based on two main factors, namely the probability factor and

the inward journey of the production chain.

Out of these two main factors on which the Learned Counsel had based his grounds of appeal. I

would first like to consider the second factor i.e. the inward journey of the production chain.

The importance of the inward journey of the production chain was discussed in the case of Perera V.

IAttorney General 1998 (1) Sri LR 378 by J.A.N. de Silva J (as he was then) as follows, " it is a

recognized principle that in a case of this nature, the prosecution must prove that the productions had

been forwarded to the analyst from proper custody, without allowing room for any suspicion that .:

there had been no opportunity for tampering or interfering with the production till they reach the

analyst. Therefore it is correct to state that the most important journey is the inward journey because

the final analyst report will be depends on that. The out ward journey does not attract the same

importance.

As observed above, that Government Analyst Report which is the principle evidence in a drug

offence is entirely depend on the inward journey of the production chain and therefore, there is a duty

cast on the prosecution to establish the inward journey of the production with reliable evidence. In

this regard it is important to note that, calling a witness who was at a police reserve to establish that

he was functioning as reserve officer during a particular time is not sufficient to establish a

production chain but, he has to give evidence confirming that the productions referred to the said case

was properly received by him and properly handed over by him in good condition. In this regard it is

also important to establish the seal used when sealing the productions and the condition of the said

seals at the time the seals were opened.

It is revealed from the evidence of IP Wijerathne who sealed the productions after weighing them at

the Gold Jeweller that he separated the brown powder and the six bags in which the brown powder

contained and sealed them separately. He had used the official stamp of the police station, left hand

thumb impression of the suspect and his short signature to seal them. This method of sealing he used

twice with regard to brown powder, first on the paper packet and thereafter on the envelop. His

evidence in this regard read as follows,

7

Page 46,

Q: how did you weigh the substance?

A: "I weighed the substance by using the scale for weighting gold Jewellery. That scale was

inside a glass cubical placed on the table. First I weighed a piece of paper and then I put the

Heroin on it and weighed. The weight of the Heroin was five grams.

After that at the same place I obtained the left hand finger print of the suspect. Then placing

the official stamp of the police station, my usual short signature with the date and then putting

it inside another envelop and again placing the official stamp of the police station and left

hand finger print of the suspect I sealed it. After that the drug that was wrapped in a polythene

bag was put inside another envelop. Then getting the fingerprint of the suspect I placed the

official stamp of the police station."

As observed by this court the officer who sealed the production had done it properly and thereafter

handed over the said two parcels under PR 47/99 to PC 19753 Karunarathne the reserve officer.

It was further transpired that the production was with the reserve until 07.09.1999 nearly 15 days

until it was sent to the Magistrate's Court Trincomalee. In this regard the Prosecution has led the

evidence of,

PC 5199 Denagama Vithanalage Podinilame

PS 32216 Dayarathne

PS 32170 Wijerathne

PS 20009 Piyasena,

who were responsible for the reserve duty during this period but, it is further revealed that

one of the important reserve officer, PS 19753 Karunarathne was not available to give evidence since

he was dead at the time this case was taken up for trial.

As revealed from the evidence of IP Wijerathne the investigating officer, the two sealed parcels were I

IIIr l

handed over to the reserve for the first time on 23.08.1999 at 18.30 hours to PS Karunarathne.

The productions were finally handed over to the Trincomalee Magistrate's Court on 07.09.1999 by

PS 20009 Piyasena and according to him, he received the parcels from PS Wijerathne. However

according to the evidence of PS 32216 Dayarathne it is he who handed over the parcel to PS

Piyasena. PS Wijerathne does not speak to this fact.

With all these discrepancies we further observe that none of the officers attached to reserve duty I

III

refers to the condition of the parcels when they received the parcel and handed over the parcel to the

next officer.

PS 20009 Piyasena has removed the productions to Magistrate's Court on 07.09.2009 and even at that

time he has not observed the condition of the parcel before handing it over to the Magistrate's Court.

Except for IP Wijerathne who sealed the production, none of the officers who had the custody of the

production until it was removed to the Magistrate's Court had observed the seals placed on the two

parcels and referred to them in their evidence.

As observed by this court it is important for the reserve officer to make this observation and at least

the officer who initially received the production and the officer who finally dispatched the production

should check the production and make his observations when they are giving evidence before the trial

court. In the absence of the receiving officer the prosecution has failed at least to establish this fact

with the officer who finally dispatched the production to the Magistrate's Court.

When the productions leave the Magistrate's Court to be handed over to the Government Analyst, it

is again put into another cover and sealed with the Magistrate's Court seal. This fact was revealed

from the evidence of the Government Anal yst and according to her evidence, the seals of the parcel

received from the Magistrate's Court were intact and tallied with the specimen seal of the I

Magistrate's Court but, she has failed to refer to any seals on the parcel submitted by the police. With

regard to this parcel the Government Analyst had said,

Page 209,

A: I have stated that in the second envelop as I mentioned before there was another envelop. This

envelop has been sealed. When it was opened a brown colour powder was in it, mentioned as

D 1465/99. I find my short signature and the date on it.

The seals referred to above were not revealed during the evidence of the Government Analyst.

However when the same envelop was shown to IP Wijerathne at the trial he too had a difficulty to

identify the said envelop. When the envelop was shown to him, his response was as follows,

Page 52,

Q: While witness, you stated that you sealed the envelop that contained Heroin?

A: Yes

Q: Can you show that seal now?

A: It is hard to search?

Q: Can you state, what seal is there on the rear side of the envelop?

A: I am unable to state

The following discrepancy was also observed with regard to handing over the production to the

Government Analyst. Even though this discrepancy can be ignored by this court since the seals found

on the Magistrate's Court letter and the parcel were intact, it is our duty to refer to them, since it

shows the negligent manner the prosecution has placed the evidence before the trial court.

According to the evidence of PS 20009 Piyasena it is sub police constable 185 Perera who took and

brought back the production from the Government Analyst.

However according to the evidence of the Government Analyst Ms. Tennakoon, PC 1725 Lanthewela

attached to Uppuweli Police Station had handed over the production to the Government Analyst.

When PC 1725 Lathewela gave evidence with regard to the detection, he was questioned by the

prosecution as follows,

Q: Apart from the particular round up activity, were you engaged yourself in any other duty

regarding this incident?

A: Not on the same day

Q: After that did you perform in any duty?

A: No I did not

As observed by this court the inward journey of a production in a case where the charges are mainly

based on the identity and the quantity of productions recovered from the custody of the suspect, the

prosecution has a responsibility to establish this aspect of the case without leaving any gaps before

the trial court. In this regard the seals said to have been placed on the production at the time the

production was handed over to the reserve has a significance. The said seals have to be intact at the

every point of time the custody is charged and finally it should be observed by the person who breaks

such seals in order to commence his investigation. If it can be established at least, that the said seals

were observed by the receiving officer and the removing officer who removed the production from

the police station as intact and by the Government Analyst that he observed the same seal intact,

when parcel was opened, that could have been considered as sufficient for this court to conclude that

the prosecution has established the inward journey to the satisfaction of court.

However as observed above, the prosecution in the case in hand had failed to establish the inward

journey of the production on to the above minimum standard expected by this court.

Since this court is not inclined to act on the evidence placed by the prosecution in establishing the

inward journey as safe, it is not necessary for this court to consider the other grounds of appeal raised

by the Learned Counsel during the arguments before us.
