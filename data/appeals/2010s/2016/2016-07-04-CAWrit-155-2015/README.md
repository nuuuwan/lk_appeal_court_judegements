ORDER

P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner had imported 6 Mitsubishi Outlander Plug-in Hybrid Electric

Vehicles (PHEV) during the period September 2014 - January 2015. He

submitted bills of entry (commonly referred to as "cus decs") with regard

to these vehicles under SHS classification of HS 8703.90.30 which is the

code under which electric vehicles have been classified. After examining

the vehicles Sri Lanka Customs took the view that the proper HS

classification code for this vehicle should be HS 8703.23.53 which is the HS

classification for Hybrid Vehicles.

It is to be noted that the duty payable for this vehicle if it is classified as a

Hybrid Vehicle is approximately Rs. 3.4 Million higher than the duty payable,

if it was classified as an electric vehicle and that was the reason why the

Petitioner had insisted that this vehicle should be classified as an Electric

Vehicle. Due to this"dlspUte and at the written request of the Petitioner, Sri

Lanka Customs referred this matter to "Nomenclature Committee". Pending

its decision, Sri Lanka Customs released these vehicles to the Petitioner in

7

January 2015 on a bank g~arantee to cover the duty difference between a

hybrid vehicle and an electric vehicle.

On 2015-07-15, the Nomenclature Committee by majority view came to the

conclusion that the said vehicles should be classified as an electric vehicle.

The said decision was thereafter submitted by this committee to the 1st

Respondent who is the Director General of Customs (DGC).

Upon receipt of that deciSion, the 1st Respondent decided to seek a

clarification on this matter .by referring this issue of classification to the

world customs organization (hereinafter referred to as WCO) by a request

letter dated 2015-07-23.

The WCO advised the 1st Respondent by i~ report dated 2015-10-01 that

this vehicle should be classified under HS 8703.23 for following reasons:

a) the vehicle in question is fitted with a gasoline 2.0 litre (1,998 cc)

engine, a generator, a drive battery and two electric motors;

b) the gasoline engine has been adapted to drive the generatpr and

assist the electriC front motor.

c) the vehicle has three modes of driving, namely:

i. the EV drive mode which is an all electric mode in which

the electric front and rear motors drive the vehicles using

I I ! .

II <. I 8 I

only electricity from the Drive Battery. In this mode, the

gasoline engine does not run. I

ii. Series Hybrid Mode where the gasoline engine operates

! I I

as a generator Supplying electricity to the electric motors.

I

i i

The system sWitches to this mode when the charge in

I I

i ,

the EV mode falls below a pre-determined level or where

I I I

greater performance is required, for example where I

accelerating is required to overtake a vehicle or climbing

I I I I I a steep hill.

iii. Parallel Hybrid Mode where the gasoline engine provides

most of the motive power, assisted by the electric motors

and the vehicle is 'run' on gasoline.

d) The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV should be classified in subheading

HS 8703.23 by application of the General Rules of Interpretation

(GIR) 3(b) and 6.

Upon receipt of the opinion expressed by the WCO, the Nomenclature

Committee re-considered its view on 2015-11-05 and decided to adopt and

implement the weo decision.

9

Learned counsel for the Petitioner in the course of his submission in

supporting these applications before this court advanced 3 main arguments.

They are as follows:

1. The Director General of Customs must accept the decision of the

Nomenclature Committee and has no power to refer the matter to

the World Customs Organization;

2. The vehicles in question falls within HS classification 8703.90.33

given in 'X 15' and the rate of duty given therein must be applied to

the said vehicles.

3. The subsequent amendments made to 'X 15' by way of 'X 17' are

, ultra vires the powers of the Deputy Secretary to the Treasury.

It is appropriate at this stage to look at section 2 of the Customs Ordinance.

According to section 2 of the Customs Ordinance, the Director General of

customs shall throughout Sri Lanka have the general superintendents of all

matters relating to the Customs. It is understandable, that it is practically

difficult for the Director General being a single person, to attend to every

transaction dealt with by Sri Lanka Customs personally. It is for that

purpose that he has set up a Nomenclature Committee comprising of some

10

issues of classification of goods whenever a dispute arises. It cannot be

seen as a delegation of the Director General's functions as the

Nomenclature Committee only makes recommendations to the Director

General. Further, as per section 2 of the Customs Ordinance as has been

mentioned above, it is the Director General who has the power of general

superintendence of all matters relating to customs throughout Sri Lanka.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the 1st

Respondent drew our attention to a judgment of this court in Navarathne

Vs Director General of Customs and others 2003 (3) SLR 310. This court in

that case held as follows:

"The provisions of section 2 of the Customs Ordinance vested the Director

General of Customs with the power of superintendence . To

'superintendent' means to 'regulate with authority' and to regulate means,

'to adjust by rule, method or established mode, subject to governing

1

principles of law (Black's Law Dictionary)'.

In that case this court has held that when the Director General revises an

order by one of his subordinates which is not validly made, the Director

_

t

11

General is acting within his powers of superintendence vested in him under

section 2 of the Customs Ordinance.

In these circumstances this court is of the view that there is no merit in the

submission that the Director General of Customs must accept the decision

of the Nomenclature Committee.

It is the pOSition of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General,

I. that the WCD is a body consisting of customs departments from all

countries including Sri Lanka

II. its primary focus is to promote security and facilitate international

trade

III. for this purpose it has a duty to harmonize customs procedure

IV. towards achieving this it takes steps to harmonize the classification of

all items

V. therefore, the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV vehicle must have one

classification all over the world.

VI. it is by adopting a set of rules known as the General Interpretation

Rules known as the GIR that the WCD determines the classification

of a given item.

Although learned counsel argues that the 1st Respondent should not have

corresponded with WeD, in view of the above positions taken up by the

learned Senior DSG we are unable to see anything wrong, irregular, illegal

or unacceptable in the action by the 1st Respondent. Further, the WeD has

given reasons as to why it should be classified under HS 8703.23.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner was unable to submit any acceptable

basis for this court to form an opinion that the reasoning by the WeD is

incorrect or arbitrary.

Therefore there is no basis for this Court to agree with the submission of

the learned counsel for the Petitioner that either the WeD or the 1st

Respondent has arbitrarily classified this vehicle under subheading HS

8703.23

The Petitioner by the amended petition dated 2016-03-15 has prayed for:

A. writs of Certiorari to quash:

i. 'X 9', which was the decision taken at the meeting of the

Additional Directors General held on 2015-03-09. 'X 9' had

been annexed as 'X 11' to the original petition;

IIIi

ii. 'X 17' - a letter dated 2015-12-03 written by the Deputy

Secretary to the Treasury;

iii. 'X 18' - the Revenue Protection Order published in Gazette

Notification No. 1941/42 dated 2015-11-20;

iv. 'X 19' - the Order made under the Excise (Special Provisions)

Act and published in Gazette Notification No. 1941/29 dated

2015-11-21;

v. 'X 20' - the letter dated 2016-02-09 sent by the DGC informing

the Petitioner the reasons for classifying the said vehicle as a

Hybrid.

B. Writs of Prohibition consequential to the above Writs of Certiorari;

C. Writ of Mandamus compelling the DGC to make a determination with

regard to the classification of the said vehicle.

The order of the minister marked X 15 is dated 2015-11-20. The order

marked X 15 has thereafter been amended by the document marked X 17

dates 2015-12-03.

Order of the Minister marked X 15 has no application to the importation of

these vehicles which arrived well before the order marked X 15 was made.

Section 3 of the Revenue Protection (Special Provisions) Act No.1 of 2006

reads as follows:

"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other law specified in part

II of the schedule hereto, for the purpose of levying or charging any tax,

duty, surcharge, levy or other charge on the importation or exportation of

goods into or out of Sri Lanka, the date of importation or ~xportation as

the case may be, shall be the date of deliverY to the DGC, of the Bill of

Entry relating to the goods on which such ta>.<, duty, surcharge, levy or

other charge is charged."

X 09 is an official internal document of Sri Lanka Customs. It is not a

communication sent to the Petitioner. Petitioner is silent as to how he was

able to lay his hands on this document. These importations have been

made between the period 2014 - 2015. By the actions of the Petitioners

who filed various kinds of litigations in court on grounds which have now

turned out to be baseless, a huge amount of revenue has been lost to the

state. Benefits of non-payment of that amount is accrued to the petitions.

In these circumstances we see no merit in this case. Hence, we decide to

refuse issuing notices on the Respondents.

At the commencement of the submission, learned counsel for both parties

agreed that, the applications bearing numbers C A (writ) Application No.

155 / 2015. C A 156 / 2015, C A 454 / 2015, C A 37 / 2016, C A 40 / 2016,

C A 41 / 2016 and C A 68 / 2016 are all on the same issue. There are 22

vehicles which are the subject matter of these applications. The "cus decs"

in respect of all these vehicles have been submitted to Sri Lanka customs

prior to the publication of document marked X 15. 2015-09

It is the same counsel who appeared for parties in all these applications.

They agreed at the commencement of their submissions and during their

submissions that the issues to be contested are the same in all these cases.

Therefore they agreed it would suffice for this court to pronounce one

judgment namely the order in this case. They also agreed that the findings

in this judgment must apply to the other cases as well because the issues

to be decided in the other cases are identical.

Therefore in above numbered cases, namely C A (writ) Application No. 155

/ 2015. C A 156 / 2015, C A 454 / 2015, C A 37 / 2016, C A 40 / 2016, C A

41 / 2016 and C A 68 / 2016, also we decide not to issue notices on the

Respondents as there is no merit in the arguments. Those applications C A

(writ) Application No. 155 / 2015. C A 156 / 2015, C A 454 / 2015, C A 37 /

16

2016, C A 40 / 2016, C A 41 / 2016 and C A 68 / 2016, should also stand

dismissed.
