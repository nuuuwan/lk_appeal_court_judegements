This appeal has been filed against the said judgment dated 20.08.2010

and at the trial there were no eye witnesses and the conviction has been

given based on the statement given by the accused-appellant to a police

officer. The High Court Judge has mentioned it in his judgment as follows

It was held in Kamal Kishore vs. State Delhi Administration 1997(2)

Crimes 169. "the confession made while in custody is not to be proved

against the accused on the provision of the Evidence Ordinance. Section

25 and 26 of the Evidence Ordinance, do not permit it unless it is made

before a Magistrate.

In Queen vs. Dvis Appuhamy 54 NLR page 32 it has been held that the

statement made to a police officer before he was taken into custody should

not be considered as a voluntary confession made by the accused-

appellant.

Section 25 of Evidence Ordinance states that the confession made to a

police officer should not be considered as a voluntary confession and

should not be proved against the accused.

, .

The accused-appellant has been convicted only on the statement made by

him to a police officer, therefore based on the Evidence Ordinance and the

judgment cited above we decided that the conviction cannot stand.

The judgment dated 20.08.2010 is set aside, the appeal is allowed.

We direct the Prison Authorities to release the accused-appellant

forthwith.
