of the agreement marked P2 with the plaint and also to eject the respondent

from the premises is suit. The appellant had filed answer the second defendant

has not filed answer and the case had proceeded to trial on the issues framed.

admitted the said agreement and the terms contained in it and also admitted

his failure to pay the balance purchase price of Rs. 300,000/=. The learned

Being aggrieved by the said judgment the appellant has filed this appeal.

The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there isn't a single

clause in the said agreement which gives right to the respondent to sue the

appellant for ejectment, if it is so by implication and not by expressly. The

appellant stated that if one is to come to court to enforce specific performance

of an agreement and if the court is to grant such specific performance then the

terms and conditions of the agreement must be certain in its terms.

The appellant submitted that the learned District Judge did not answer

any of the issues raised at the trial and that the District Judge is under legal

duty to answer the issues based on his findings in his judgment.

The appellant also stated that the concept of leave and licence can not

be applied in respect of an occupier of immovable property who is occupying

the same based on an agreement to buy the property within a stipulated period

of time.

The appellants further submitted that Sec. 146 of the Civil Procedure

Code specifically sets out the duty of the court to determine the issues and that

it is settled law that the judge must answer every issue framed in the case. He

further stated that Sec. 187 of the Civil Procedure Code states that a decision

has to be given on the points for determination and that court has to answer the

issues and give reasons for coming to that answer. The appellant cited the

judgment in Sobanahamy vs Somadasa 2005 vol III page 201 and said

failure to answer the issues is considered a fatal error.

The learned counsel for the respondents argued that under clause 4, 6

and 7 of the agreement marked P2 no specific provision is needed for filing

action for ejectment and that on the termination of the agreement and

withdrawal of the leave and licence the defendant appellant is in the position of

a trespasses and an action has to be filed for ejectment.

Citing the judgment in Perera vs Lewis Abeysekera 58 NLR 506 the

respondent stated that where under a non-notarial agreement to sell immovable

property an advance is paid but the sale fails the agreement regarding the

money paid in advance is severable from the agreement for sale, the plaintiff

respondent has the right to demand that the defendant appellant should vacate

the premises in exchange for the return of the advance.

The respondents submitted that although all the issues were not

answered by the District Judge by way of findings from the evidence given the

matters in issue have been referred to. The respondents stated that regarding

issue no. 1 the defendant had admitted his failure to pay the balance sum,

issues no. 2 refers to plaintiff respondent's evidence which the District Judge

has accepted. Issue 3, 4, and 5 of the respondents all have been answered

while making his findings. Referring to the defendant appellant's issue the

respondents submitted the first had been answered as a preliminary issue in

the affirmative, the other two issues the court has referred to in the findings.

The respondents further submitted that the action in the District Court was filed

over 23 years ago in 1992 and judgment was delivered on 22/05/1997 and the

5 II I II

plaintiff had died on 20/1212005 and his heirs have been substituted as

respondents and cited the judgment in Jayasena vs Oayasena (2002) 3 SLR

261 where it was held that to remit the case back to the District Court after

nearly 15 years to answer the issue will be a unfruitful exercise when the

defendant appellant can not succeed in the original court.

The learned District Judge in his judgment delivered on 22108/1997 has

not specifically answered the issues one by one in the order they were raised

but has referred to all the matters raised as issues in his judgment.

Section 147 of the Civil Procedure Code refers to framing of issues and

states that issues on law may be taken up first and disposed of in the instant

case the issue on law had been taken up first and proceeded to trial on the rest

of the issues.

Sec. 187 of the Civil Procedure Code states the requisites of a

judgment.

liThe Judgment shall contain a concise statement of the case,

the points for determination, the decision thereon, and the

reasons for such decision; and the opinions of the assessors

(if any) shall be prefixed to the judgment and signed by such

assessors respectively".

No where does it say that the issues have to be answered by saying

"yes" or "no" or in the numbered form they have been framed.

In Warnakula vs Ramani Jayawardena 1990 (1) SLR 206 it was held.

"Bare answers to issues without reasons are not in

compliance with the requirements 0/ section 187 o/the Civil

Procedure Code. The evidence germane to each issue must

be reviewed or examined. The judge must evaluate and

consider the totality 0/ the evidence".

Therefore failure to answer the issues in the numbered order does not

make it an error on the part of the District Judge.

The learned District Judge has analysed the evidence given before him

by the plaintiff and the defendant and come to his findings on the issues framed

before him. He has analysed the agreement entered into by the parties. The

defendant has admitted the agreement in evidence and also the terms

contained in it but he had failed to prove in the District Court that he paid any

money other than the initial payment to the plaintiff. The learned District Judge

has carefully analysed all these facts and evidence placed before him.

The instant case had been filed 24 years ago and as stated in Jayasena

vs Oayasena 2002 3 SLR 261 to remit this case to the District Court after 24

years to answer the issues will be an unfruitful exercise when the appellants

can not succeed in the original court. The plaintiff in the District Court who had

given evidence is no more in the living.

For the afore stated reasons I dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at

RS.25,000/=
