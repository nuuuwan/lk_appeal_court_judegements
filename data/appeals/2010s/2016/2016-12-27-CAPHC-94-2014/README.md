The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent this action case No 77534/12 in the

Magistrate's Court of Embilipitiya on 17/09/2012 under the Maintenance Act No.

37 of 1999 against her husband the Petitioner Appellant seeking an order for

maintenance for herself and for the child known as Visul Uthara born as a result of

the wedlock between the Petitioner-Appellant and the Respondent. Since the

Respondent was 6 months pregnant at the time of this application she also requested

a maternity allowance from the Petitioner.

The Petitioner-Appellant consented to pay maintenance only to the child and

declined to pay maintenance or maternity allowance to the Respondent as he denied

the paternity of the fetus. The Learned Magistrates ordered interim monthly payment

ofRs.50001- to the child and Rs.20001- to the Respondent respectively.

The Respondent thereafter by her application dated 18/02/2013 stated that she gave

birth to a baby girl on 13/0112013, named her as Vihanga Uthare and requested an

order to pay Rs.200001- monthly for the maintenance of newly born daughter and

for enhancement of interim payments of maintenance for the elder son and herself.

The Petitioner- Appellant again denied the paternity of the newly born child. As both

parties were ready for a DNA test, the court ordered a DNA test on 19/06/2013. The

Report of the paternity test carried out by GENETECH received on 30/10/2013 was

pronounced by the Learned Magistrate on 20/1112013. The Petitioner-Appellant

vehemently objected to the findings of the report and requested the court for afresh

DNA test. The Learned Magistrate declined this request, accepted the report and

made a ruling that the Petitioner- Appellant is the biological father of the newly born

child and ordered to pay interim payment of Rs.50001- from the month of birth -

January 2013.

Being aggrieved by the orders the Petitioner-Appellant preferred a reVISIOn

application RA 06/2014 in the Provincial High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province

Holden in Embilipitiya. The Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court

having heard the said application made order dated 21108/2014 and dismiss the

revision application of the Petitioner.

Being aggrieved by the order the Petitioner- Appellant preferred the present petition

of appeal bearing No CA (PHC) 94/2014 against the order of the Hon. Judge of the

Provincial High Court. Subsequently he has preferred an application for revision

bearing No. CA (PHC) APN 120/2014. When the revision application was taken up

for argument court decided to take both the appeal and the revision application

together.

On the date of the argument the counsel for the Respondent raised a preliminary

objection that the Petitioner Appellant filled both applications in a wrong forum and

the Petitioner-Appellant should have preferred this applications before the Supreme

Court. He further pleaded that this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain both

applications and that they should be dismiss in limine.

Both parties were directed to file written submissions which has been done. We have

considered submissions made by both parties.

Sec. 14 of the Maintenance Act No 37 of 1999 read as follows,

14 . (1) " Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any order made by a

Magistrate under section 2 or section 11 may prefer an appeal to

the relevant High Court established by Article 154 P of the

constitution in like manner as if the order was a final order

pronounced by Magistrate's Court in a Criminal case or matter, and

sections 320 to 330 (both inclusive) and sections 357 and 358 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 shall, mutatis

mutandis, apply to such appeal:

Provided however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in

section 323 of the Criminal Procedure Code Act No 15 of 1979 such

order under section 2 shall not be stayed by reason of such appeal,

unless the High Court directs otherwise for reasons to be recorded

Provided further that the Magistrate in forwarding the record to the

High Court shall retain a copy of his order for purposes of

enforcement.

(2) Any person dissatisfied with an order made by a High Court in the

exercise of its appellate jurisdiction under this section, may prefer

an appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court, on a question of law,

with the leave of the High Court, and where such leave is refused,

with the special leave of the Supreme Court, first had an obtained."

It was contended by the defendant Petitioner Appellant that he preferred a revision

application and not an appeal to the Provincial High Court against the order of the

Learned Magistrate. The impugned order is not in respect of maintenance ordered

but the acceptance of the DNA report as conclusive proof of the paternity and

6

thereby shutting down any opportunity of challenging the findings of the DNA test

at the fonnal inquiry. Order of the Provincial High Court is against the Appellant.

This is an appeal CA(PHC) 94/14 and according to Section 14 (1) and (2) of the

Maintenance Act No 37 of 1999 we hold that this court have no jurisdiction to

entertain this appeal CA(PHC) 94114, it is the Supreme Court that has jurisdiction.

As regards Section 9 of Act No 19 of 1990 provides for an appeal to the Supreme

Court from any order, Judgment, decree or sentence of a Provincial High Court

established by Article 154 P of the Constitution in the exercise of the Appellate

Jurisdiction vested in it by Article 154 P (3 )(b) or section 3 of the Act or any other

law.

Section 9 is read as follows,

Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law, any person aggrieved by

(a) a final order, judgment, decree or sentence of a High Court established by

Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction

vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of Article 154P of the Constitution or section 3

of this Act or any other law, in any matter or proceeding whether civil or

criminal which involves a substantial question of law, may appeal therefrom to

the Supreme Court if the High Court grants leave to appeal to the Supreme Court

ex mero motu or at the instance of any aggrieved party to such matter or

proceedings:

In the case of The Bank of Ceylon Vs. Kaleel 2004 (1) SLR 284, read as follows,

The Court of Appeal held :

1

7

(i) The court will not interfere by way of revision when the law has given the Plaintiff an alternative remedy S.754(2) and when the Plaintiff has not shown the existence of exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction. " In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must be occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it- the order complained of is of such a nature which would have shocked the conscience of court."

In the case of Abeywardene V. Ajith De Silva 1998 1 SLR 134 was held that a

direct appeal does not lie to the Supreme Court from the order of the High Court in

the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. An appeal of such order should be made

to the Court of Appeal. This case is not applicable to present case on it is ajudgment

delivered prior to Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999.

In the judgment of W. M. A. Janakasiri Fernando Vs. M. M. Deepthi Lakmali

decided on 16/06/2012 by Ratnayake PC J, Suresh Chandra J, Dep PC J read as

follows,

"Subject to the provisions ofthis Act or any other law, any person aggrieved by-

(a) A final order, judgment, decree or sentence of a High Court established by

Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction

vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of Article 154P of the Constitution or section 3

of this Act or any other law, in any matter or proceeding whether civil or

criminal which involved a substantial question of law, may appeal therefrom to

the Supreme Court if the High Court grants leave to appeal to the Supreme Court

ex mero motu or at the instance of any aggrieved party to such matter or

proceedings :

\

Provided that the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to

appeal to the Supreme Court from any final or interlocutory order, judgment,

decree or sentence made by such High court, in the exercise of the appellate

jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of the Article 154 p of the

Constitution or section 3 of this Act, or any other law where such High Court

has refused to grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, or where in the

opinion ofthe Supreme Court, the case or matter is fit for review by the Supreme

Court:

Provided further that the Supreme Court shall grant leave to appeal in every matter or proceeding in which it is satisfied that the question to be decided is of public or general importance: .. "

Hence we uphold the preliminary objections of the Respondent and dismiss this

appeal CA(PHC) 94/14 and the connected revision application bearing No CA(PHC)

APN 120114 without cost.
