L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

The 2nd Accused Petitioner (hereinafter called and referred to as the

Petitioner) was arrested for trafficking and possession of 62.847 grams of

2

cocaine and was remanded on 20.10.2013. The Petitioner, with another

person, were indicted before the High Court of Colombo under and in

terms of section 54 A (c) of the Poison Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance as amended by Act no. 13 of 1984. After serving the

indictment, the Petitioner has made an application to release him on bail

has been refused by the Learned High Court Judge on 26.09.2014.

Thereafter, the case was fixed for trial. After several trial dates, on 01-09-

2015 another application was made to grant bail which was also refused

by the Learned High Court Judge on 18-09-2015. The Petitioner

presented this revision application pleading that the said order dated

18.09.2015 be set aside and he be enlarged on bail. The learned State

Counsel objected to this application firstly that there are no exceptional

circumstances to act in revision and secondly no exceptional

circumstances to grant bail under section 83 of the Poison, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act no. 13 of 1984.

I will consider whether the Petitioner can have and maintain this

revision application first.

The order of the Learned High Court Judge refusing bail is a final

order within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Code. It has been

observed by Eric Basnayake J. in the case of Cader (On behalf of

Rasheed Kahan) Officer In Charge Narcotic Bureau [2006] 3Sri L R 74

that "the orders refusing to grant bail are considered as final orders

which appeals lie." The Petitioner, as of a right, would have appealed

against the order of the Learned High Court Judge, but have opted to

petition this Court to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction, but has failed or

neglected to submit any reason as to why he choose to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction, which is a discretionary remedy of Court, instead

of exercising his right of appeal.

3

The revisionary power of this Court is very wide and the Court is

not precluded from exercising revisionary jurisdiction even if the

alternative remedy of appeal is available; if exceptional circumstances

warrant the intervention of Court. Revision is basically a discretionary

remedy. The one, who moves Court to exercise this discretionary remedy,

must aver and establish that there are exceptional circumstances for the

Court to intervene. It has been held in the case of Rustem v. Hapangama

[1978-79-80] Sri L R 352 that;

The trend of authority clearly indicates that where the revisionary

powers of the Court of Appeal are invoked the practice has been

that these powers will be exercised if there is an alternative

remedy available, only if the existence of special circumstances are

urged necessitating the indulgence of this Court to exercise its

powers in revision.

The appellant has not indicated to Court that any special

circumstances exist which would invite this Court to exercise its

powers of revision, particularly since the appellant had not availed

himself of the right of appeal under section 754(2) which was

available to him.

The Petitioner submits several grounds as exceptional grounds to

consider bail. The Petitioner states that he is a married person with two

school going children. A person getting married and having children is

not an exceptional ground. It is the normal day to day life of the people.

The Petitioner further states that his elder child is studding in a private

school and due to his long term incarceration, it has become impossible to

pay the school fees and therefore, the education of the child has come to a

standstill. The Learned High Court Judge did not accept this as an

exceptional ground. I totally agree with the Learned High Court Judge on

4

this issue. The government is providing free education to children of this

country. If a person decides to go for private education, it is his choice.

His inability to pay the fees, for whatever the reason, is not an

exceptional ground because the free education is available in this country

up to the bachelor degree in any stream of study.

The trial has already begun in the High Court. Several trial dates

were adjourned on the application of the Petitioner. On 15.10.2004 the

Counsel moved for a date on personal grounds, 12.12.2014 Counsel was

not well and moved out. The trial commenced on 08.05.2015. Now the

Petitioner cannot complaint that he is in remand for no fault of him.

The quantity of cocaine involved in this case is 62.847 grams,

which is a commercial quantity. If Petitioner is convicted, the punishment

is death or life imprisonment. Under these circumstances, it is prudent to

conclude the trial early while the Petitioner is kept in custody.

I direct the Learned High Court Judge to conclude the trial as early

as possible and to consider the possibilities of hearing the case day to day.

Accordingly, I dismiss the application without costs subject to the

above direction.

I agree.
