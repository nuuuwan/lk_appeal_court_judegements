The plaintiff appellant has filed a partition case in the District Court

of Badulla to partition the land described in the schedule to the plaint.

The plaintiff has claimed 1/3 share of the land and stated that the first

defendant is entitled to 1/3 share of the land. In the District Court a

commission was issued to survey the said land and upon the survey

being done plan no. 3110 was submitted to court. Both parties have

admitted the corpus at the trial. After trial the learned District Judge has

held that the corpus cannot be identified and that the pedigree has not

been proven and dismissed the partition case. The plaintiff has filed the

instant application against the said judgment.

When the instant application was argued the defendant

f !

respondents conceded that the corpus was admitted therefore it could

be said that the land to be partition has been identified and admitted in

the District Court. The learned counsel for the appellant stated once the

parties admitted the corpus there is no need to prove it and on this

ground alone the judgment of the District Judge should be set aside.

The appellants stated that the plan marked X which shows the

land to be partitioned shows the boundaries described in the schedule to

the plaint and that the survey was done according to the boundaries

shown by both parties and in their presence. I

The appellants stated that the plaintiff mentioned the land as

Helawala Mihiriyagastenne and that the first defendant too identified the

land by the same name. The appellants further stated that the plaintiff

established his chain of title in evidence by documents P1 to P3 and that

the first defendant failed to dispute his title in the District Court.

The learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the

defendant in the District Court discharged her burden as required by the

Evidence Ordinance regarding the facts in issue by corroborating the

3

defendant's evidence by the evidence of the two witness called, which

proved that the original owner of the corpus was Danthuwa and Kalu and

not only Kalu as stated by the plaintiff. The defendant respondents

stated that the learned District Judge very correctly held that the plaintiff

appellant failed to prove his title by failing to place evidence on the

relationship between Haramanis and Babi and also by failing to dispute

the defendant's evidence that Danthuwa was a co-owner of the corpus

with Kalu. The respondents submitted in the circumstances the learned

District Judge had no option but to dismiss the plaintiffs case.

In a partition action it is the duty of the trial judge to examine the

title and to draw up the pedigree when the parties fail to agree on the

pedigree, on examination of the documents and evidence placed before

court. In the instant case the plaintiff appellant has stated in the plaint as

well as in evidence that the original owner was Kalu who had three

children Haramanis, Babi and Jamis and that he bought 1/3 share which

belonged to Haramanis by deed marked P1. The plaintiff has claimed

only 1/3 of the land. The first defendant appellant has stated in evidence

that Kalu's property was co-owned by Danthuwa and that the defendant

got the shares from Jamis and Babi who were Kalu's children as well as

the two children of Danthuwa. They have not claimed the share of

Haramanis which the plaintiff claimed. On these facts and documents

the trial judge had a duty to examine the title and prepare a partition

judgment without taking the easy way out and dismissing the case.

Defendant respondents have admitted the corpus therefore to say the l

land was not properly identified is incorrect. The defendants as well as

the plaintiff have accepted the plan marked X which depicted the land to

be partitioned. The corpus had been identified and admitted.

In Somasiri vs Faleela and others 2005 2 SLR 121 it was stated

that the trial judge should make a personal inquiry as to the title of the

land to be partitioned. It is the prime duty of the trial judge to investigate

the title. In the instant case the trial judge has failed to perform a proper

investigation of title and dismissed the plaint. Which fact should be a

ground for appeal and a trial de novo.

For the afore stated reasons I allow the appeal and set aside the

judgment of the learned District Judge of Badulla dated 23/05/1997 and I

order a trial de novo. Appeal allowed.
