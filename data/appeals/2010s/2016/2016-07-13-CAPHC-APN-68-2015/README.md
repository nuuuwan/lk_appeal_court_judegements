L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is a revision application against an order of the Learned High Court

Judge of Negombo. The Petitioner presented an application for on behalf

of the 8th suspect in a case before Magistrate Court ofNeogmbo where he

was remanded for the suspicion of trafficking 30 Kilograms of Heroin.

The Learned High Court Judge first ordered bail but two days after he

reconsidered the order and canceled the bail. The Petitioner being

aggrieved by the said order, this revision application was presented.

The learned State Counsel objected to this application firstly that

there are no exceptional circumstances to act in revision and secondly no

exceptional circumstances to grant bail under section 83 of the Poison,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act no. 13 of

1984. The learned SC further contended that this is a very large quantity

of Heroin, amounting to 30 kilograms.

I will consider whether the Petitioner can have and maintain this

revision application first.

The order of the Learned High Court Judge refusing bail is a final

order within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Code. It has been

observed by Eric Basnayake J. in the case of Cader (On behalf of

Rasheed Kahan) Officer In Charge Narcotic Bureau [2006] 3Sri L R 74

that "the orders refusing to grant bail are considered as final orders

which appeals lie." The Petitioner, as of a right, would have appealed

against the order of the Learned High Court Judge, .but have opted to

petition this Court to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction.

The Petitioner's contention is that the cancellation of bail by the

Learned High Court Judge is bad in law. If it is so, the appeal is available

3

as of a right. The Petitioner has opted to wait until the Learned High

Court Judge who made the order is transferred and attempted to obtain

bail before his successor but has failed. Thereafter, the Petitioner

presented this application that is after one year from the order.

The revisionary power of this Court is very wide and the Court is

not precluded from exercising revisionary jurisdiction even if the

alternative remedy of appeal is available; if exceptional circumstances

warrant the intervention of Court. Revision is basically a discretionary

remedy. The one, who moves Court to exercise this discretionary remedy,

must aver and establish that there are exceptional circumstances for the

Court to intervene. It has been held in the case of Rustem v. Hapangama

[1978-79-80] Sri L R 352 that;

The trend of authority clearly indicates that where the revisionary

powers of the Court of Appeal are invoked the practice has been

that these powers will be exercised if there is an alternative

remedy available, only if the existence of special circumstances are

urged necessitating the indulgence of this Court to exercise its

powers in revision.

The appellant has not indicated to Court that any special

circumstances exist which would invite this Court to exercise its

powers of revision, particularly since the appellant had not availed

himself of the right of appeal under section 754(2) which was

available to him.

The only exceptional ground that the Petitioner .submits is that the

Learned High Court Judge's order is bad in law. After a period of one

year from the impugned order, the Petitioner cannot come before this

Court and submit that the order is bad in law.

As I pointed out, the quantity of the Heroin involved in this case is 30 kg.

The suspect was handling a large amount of money exceeding 120

million rupees within a short period of time and has direct links with the

main suspects of this case. It is reported by the police that the 8th suspect

is also involved in the monitory transactions in relation to the Heroin

deals. Under these circumstances, even if no Heroin is recovered from the

possession of the 8th suspect, charge of trafficking can be maintained

against him. Therefore, non recovery of Heroin from the 8th suspect is not

an exceptional ground to consider bail.

There are no exceptional circumstances established by the Petitioner to

invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court and to consider bail.

The application dismissed. No costs.

I agree.
