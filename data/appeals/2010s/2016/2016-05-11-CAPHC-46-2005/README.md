Malinie Gunaratne, J.

In this application Accused - Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) seek to set aside the Order of the learned High Court Judge of

Ratnapura, dated 16.02.2005.

4

In accordance with the Petition of Appeal filed by the Appellants in

this Court the case for the Appellants briefly is that, the Appellants were first

charged in Magistrate's Court of Pelmadulla, in Case No. 51821 on the 24th

of January 2000, by the Complainant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the Respondent) with committing the offences punishable under Section 140

and 317 of the Penal Code. The Appellants pleaded not guilty to the charges

and the case was fixed for trial.

On the ground that the principle witnesses of the prosecution were not

present on the trial date, the Appellants had been discharged by the learned

Magistrate on the 15th of September 2003.

Thereafter, charges alleging the same offences had been framed

against the Appellants on the 13th of October 2003, in Case No. 5356 of the

same Court. The Appellants pleaded not guilty and the case was fixed for

trial.

The trial was commenced on 21.06.2004 and after conclusion of the

evidence of prosecution witnesses No.1 and No.2, the Counsel for the

Appellants urged a plea of "autrefois acquittaf' on the premise that the case

has been constituted contrary to the Section 188 (2) and (3) (a) of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 as amended by Act No. 15 of

1989, and therefore that the case cannot be maintained.

Having heard the submissions of both parties, the learned Magistrate

dismissed the said application and re-fixed the case for further trial.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned Magistrate made on

18.01.2005, the Appellants invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court of Ratnapura. The learned High Court Judge

5

dismissed the Appellants' petition and affirmed the learned Magistrate's

Order on 16.02.2005.

Thereafter, the Appellants have invoked the appellate jurisdiction of

this Court to intervene by setting aside the Order of the learned High Court

Judge dated 16.02.2005.

When considering the merits of the case the central issue to be

decided is whether the learned Magistrate is lawfully entitled to proceed

with the trial on the 2nd Plaint filed by the Respondent without setting aside

the earlier order of discharge.

However, the Appellants have urged to interpret the word "re-open"

in the Section 188(3 ) (a) and (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.

15 of 1989 (as amended) since the learned High Court Judge had decided

that the meaning of "re-open" is not the previous case to be opened, but

institute a fresh action under a different case number on the same charges.

Section 188 (3) (a) and (b) reads as follows:

(3) The order of discharge referred to in subsection (2) shall operate as

an acquittal where either:-

(a) it is not set aside and the case against the accused is not

reopened within a period of one year from the date of such

order;

(b) the case has been duly re-opened and .....

It is relevant to note, that there is no provision of law set out in the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which prevents the prosecution from

opting to file a fresh action.

6

At this stage it is important to consider the authorities cited before this

Court by Counsel of both sides with regard to the main issue. It is to be

noted, a clear principle emerges from those authorities, that is, in all the

cases a fresh action had been filed by the prosecution to re-open the case.

However, my considered view is if the prosecution wishes to re-open

the previous (same) case by filing a fresh action there is no bar to follow the

said procedure.

Accordingly, the prosecution has two options:

(i) Re-open the previous case;

(ii) File a fresh case.

In the matter in hand the prosecution opted to file a fresh action under

a different number, of course within one year. It is viewed from the case

record, the subsequent action was filed before another Magistrate.

Therefore, it is not practically possible, for the Magistrate to know of an

earlier action filed against the same accused, was discharged. Hence the

question of setting aside the earlier order of discharge will not arise where

the present action is concerned.

In the above setting I am of the view that the Appellants' argument is

devoid of merits and should stand dismissed.
