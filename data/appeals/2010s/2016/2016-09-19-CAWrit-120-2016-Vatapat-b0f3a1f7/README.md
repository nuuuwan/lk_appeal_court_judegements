Petitioners to the present application have come before this court seeking inter alia,

c) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st

Respondent Authority to issue a gemming license to the 6th Respondent in respect of

the land described in schedule B

prohibiting from issuing a gemming license to the 6th Respondent if a license has not

been issued to the 6th Respondent

Petitioners have further prayed from this court III addition to the notice being issued to the

Respondents in the 1 st instance,

b) Issue an Interim Orders'

1. Preventing the 6th Respondent from gemming in the land depicted in the schedule A

and B to the petition until the final determination of this application.

ll. Preventing 6th Respondent his servants and agents from gemming in the lands

described in schedule A and/or B until the final determination of the application

iii. Directing the 1st Respondent to submit to court, the purported gemming license

issued to the 6th Respondent under which authority the 6th Respondent is currently

gemming

This matter was supported before me for notices as well as for interim relief as prayed for, by the

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner and was objected by the counsel for all the Respondents.

Petitioners have referred to two schedules in the petition before this court marked A and B.

Schedule 'A' referred to a land called Minuwanwela Kumbura Ihala Kella and Pahala Kella and the

Petitioners have claimed that the three petitioners own 3/4th of the said land. Scheduled B referred

to a land called Minuwanwela Deniya alias Minuwanwela Kumbura and the Petitioners admit that

they entered in to a settlement and a consent Judgment was entered with regard to the said land on

16.02.1994 which is produced marked P-4. (Case No 7551/L)

As revealed during the submission before me, parties represented by the 6th and i h Respondents

have got 6/8 shares and the petitioners have got only 2/8 shares of the said land according to the

said consent judgment.

However the Petitioners, who agreed to the said consent judgment being entered in the year1994

had challenged the said consent judgment before this court, on the basis that 62/11ih shares of land

1-b to 1-f and 2nd plaintiffs become entitled upon the consent judgment, was vested in the Land

Reform Commission in terms of section 5 of the Land Reform Law and said Petitioners have

fraudulently suppressed the said position to the District Court.

As observed by this court the Petitioners have taken up two contradictory positions before this court

with regard to the lands referred to above in schedules A and B.

With regard to the land referred to in schedule A, the Petitioners submit that the 1st Petitioner had

obtained a gemming license during the period of 1990-1993 for the land called Minuwanwela

Kumbura as described in schedule A. In 1994 the same Petitioners have agreed for a consent

judgment being entered with regard to the land referred to in scheduled B under which they have

become owners of onl y 2/8 shares.

..

The Petition before this court is silent on the question whether the two lands referred to in

scheduled A and B are the same or not. As observed by me, this has to be resolved, before any

decision is being taken and this court is not competent to resolve this issue since that has to be

decided by a competent court after going through a full trial.

As further observed by this court, the petitioners were objecting to the issuance of a gemming

license to the 6th Respondent with regard to the land referred to in schedule B since 2011 and after

an inquiry conducted, the 1st Respondent has issued the license to the 6th Respondent in the year

2011.

If the Petitioners have taken up the same objection they are now taking before this court at the said

inquiry the Petitioners had ample opportunity to inform the Land Reform Commission of this fact

and get the Land Reform Commission to submit their objections before the 1st Respondent.

We observe that the Petitioners have not taken any steps since 2011 in challenging the decision of

the 1st Respondent. The 1st Petitioner has made an application for a gemming license for the Land

referred to in schedule A in the year 2014 and when the said application was submitted to the 1st

Respondent, the said Respondent has rejected the 1st Petitioner's application on the ground that a

license had already been issued to the 6th Respondent. This had happened in the year 2014.

Therefore it is clear that the Petitioner who objected to a gemming license being issued to the 6th

Respondent to the land referred to in schedule B in the year 2011, and having made an application

for a gemming license to the land referred to in schedule A in 2014 had not taken any steps to come

before this court until 2016 and thereby they are guilty of lashes.

Under these circumstances this court is not inclined to issue notices in this application.

Notices are refused.
