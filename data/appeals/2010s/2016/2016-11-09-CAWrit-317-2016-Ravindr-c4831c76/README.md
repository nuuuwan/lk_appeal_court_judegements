VIJITH K. MALALGODA, PC. J(P / CAl

Heard counsel in support of this application.

The petitioner has come before this Court seeking a writ of certiorari to

quash the conditions laid down by the 1 st respondent when he declared a

particular land as a non-paddy land. In this regard this Court is mindful

of the fact that the Agrarian Services Act has provided the Commissioner

General of Agrarian Services not only to protect the paddy land but also

to protect the agricultural land. This is clear from Section 28 & 29 of the

Agrarian Services Act and the said conditions imposed by the Agrarian

Commissioner, the 1 st respondent have been made to protect the

agricultural land. The position taken up by the counsel was that once

the land is declared as a non-paddy land by the 1st respondent he has no

authority over the said land and therefore he cannot impose any

conditions but this Court cannot agree with the said submissions of the

counsel since the 1 st respondent has authority not only on the paddy

1

land but also on the agricultural land. Considering these issues this

Court is not inclined to issue notices on the respondents.

Notices are refused.
