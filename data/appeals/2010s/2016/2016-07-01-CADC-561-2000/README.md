The plaintiff respondents have instituted a partition action in the

District Court of Kurunegala to partition the land described in the schedule

to the plaint. After trial the District Judge had delivered the judgment on

21/07/2000 in favour of the plaintiff respondents. Being aggrieved by the

said judgment the appellant had filed this appeal.

The learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the learned

District Judge failed to identify the corpus. He stated that the plaintiff

respondents sought to partition the land described in the plaint and the trial

Judge is statutory bound to investigate the title of the parties and identify

the land under Sec. 25 (1) of the Partition Act and Sec. 41 of the Civil

Procedure Code. The appellant citing the judgment in Thirunayake vs

Fernando S.C. Appeal 18 B of 2009 stated that there should not be any

discrepancy as to the identity of the land in dispute. The appellants stated

2

that the boundaries of the land "Aga/apita Gedarawatte" depicted in plan

no. 279 which was surveyed by a commissioner appointed by the District

Court does not correspond to the boundaries of the schedule to the plaint.

The appellant submitted that during the trial in the District Court the plaintiff

respondents failed to identify the boundaries and they could only name the

land, therefore the District Judge erred in law when he decided that the

corpus in dispute had been properly identified and failed to evaluate the

evidence led by the parties.

The counsel for the appellants further submitted that allotment of

land to the fourth respondent is wrong according to Muslim Law. He stated

that the respondents are members of the same family who claimed they

inherited the land from their father, and a female heir inherits as an agnatic

heir Y2 the share allotted to a male heir. He stated that if the respondents

inherited their father's rights to the corpus in terms of the Muslim Law the

share allocation can not be equal to males and females.

The learned counsel for the respondents stated that the boundaries

of the corpus were identified with the boundaries set out in the schedule of

the deed no. 9538 upon which the predecessor of the plaintiff respondents

got his title to the corpus, and that they were identified with reference to

the existing geographical settings. He further stated that the first and third

respondents and first and second and fourth appellants had been present

before the surveyor when the land was surveyed and that the surveyor had

expressed the opinion that the land he surveyed was the land depicted in

the schedule to the plaint.

The respondents stated that the difference in the names of the

boundaries of the land in the schedule to the plaint and that of the

3

preliminary plan is due to the fact that the schedule to the plaint is based

on deed no. 9538 and since then owners of the adjoining lands and

geographical conditions have under gone drastic changes.

The respondents argued that the preliminary plan and the report

were marked in evidence and accepted by the appellants without any

objections at the trial. The respondents stated that the failure to object to

a document being received in evidence would amount to a waiver of the

objection as it thereafter becomes part of the evidence for all intents and

purposes as mentioned in the judgment of Sri Lanka Ports Authority vs

Jugulinja Boat East Co. 1981 1 SLR 18.

The respondents stated that the appellant had the opportunity under

sec. 18 (2) of the Partition Law to make an application to court alleging

omission on the part of the surveyor and in the absence of such an

application the land depicted on plan 279 substantially corresponded to

the land in the schedule to the plaint.

The respondents stated that on the question of application of Muslim

Law to them in devolution of title, since the respondents jOintly claimed %

share of the property even now it could be allotted in terms of the Muslim

Law.

On perusal of the schedule to the plaint and the preliminary plan it

is clear that the boundaries are different and that the land has not been

identified at the trial. The plaintiffs have failed to identify the land in

evidence they have only mentioned the name of the land. A land is

identified by the boundaries.

As stated by the respondents if the boundaries have undergone

changes since their original owners time they should have stated that in a

second schedule to the plaint to correctly identify the land and the surveyor

should have mentioned the names of the earlier boundaries in his report

as well as the plan. The respondents argued that the preliminary plan and

the report was accepted by the appellants without an objection at the trial

which amounts to evidence unchallenged in terms of the judgment in Sri

Lanka Ports Authority vs Jugulinja Boat Co. case, this judgment has

no relevance to a survey plan and report in a partition action where the

corpus has to be properly identified.

The respondents mentioning the proviso to sec. 18 (2) of the

Partition Act had said no application was made on behalf of the appellants

to summon the surveyor to identify the land surveyed and to see whether

it is the same land described in the schedule does not make a good

argument. It is the duty of the trial judge to identify the land to be partition

first. Whether the defendants have made an application or not is totally

irrelevant. If the parties are not in agreement about the identity of the

corpus and boundaries it is the duty of court to identify the correct land.

In the instant case the boundaries of the preliminary plan no. 279

and the title deed of the plaintiff respondents are different in the schedule

the northern boundary is Kiriya and the fence belonging to others in the

plan it is Nandadewa's land, southern boundary in the schedule is Dewata

separating Bandiya's land in the plan it is Agalapitiya Watte owned by

Dingiriya the Western boundary in the schedule is paddy land called

Dawatagaha and in the plan road from the Egodamulla to Panagamuwa

only the Eastern boundary is the same, fence belonging to Bandiya.

5

The main issue to be considered in the instant case is whether the

extents and the limits of the land had been established to identify the

corpus correctly. The land in suit must be described with precision and

there should not be any discrepancy as to the identity of the land Section

44 of the Civil Procedure Code is very clear on this. The learned District

Judge of Kurunegala had erred in law when he decided that the corpus in

dispute had been properly identified. He had also erred in law when he

allocated share to the respondents by not considering the Muslim Law.

For the afore stated reasons I decide to allow the application of the

appellants and set aside the judgment of the District Judge of Kurunegala

dated 21/07/2000.
