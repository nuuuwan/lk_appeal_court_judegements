L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an appeal from an order of the learned High Court Judge of

Kegalla.

The 1 st party Petitioner Respondent (the Respondent) made a

complaint to the Dedigama police on a land dispute stating that he is in

possession of the land called Pittugodellahena and the 2nd Party

Respondent Appellant (the 2nd Appellant) is disturbing his possession.

The 3rd Intervenient Party Respondent Appellant (the 3rd Appellant)

intervened and both 2nd and 3rd Appellants resisted the Respondent's

application. The police filed information in the Magistrate Court under

section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act stating that there is a

likelihood of breach of the peace owing to the land dispute. The learned

Magistrate after receiving the affidavits, documents and the submissions

of the parties; determined that the 2nd and the 3 rd Appellants were in

possession and handed over the possession to them. Being aggrieved by

the said order, the Respondent moved in Revision in the High Court of

Kegalla where the order of the learned Magistrate was set aside and held

that the Respondent was in possession of the land in dispute. 2nd and 3rd

Appellants appealed against that order to this Court.

The Appellants argue that the learned High Court Judge has failed

to identify the land in dispute properly and therefore the order of the

learned High Court Judge is bad in law. The land in dispute is lot nos. 3

and 4 of the final partition plan no. 218/ A made in the partition action no.

18879/P, marked as IP2. Both parties admit that there was a partition

action and the said plan was prepared. It is a common ground that one

Punchi Appuhamy was in possession of the entire land even after the

partition decree. When was Punchi Appuhamy came in to the possession

is not admitted but the fact that he was in possession was admitted. The

3

Respondent states that Pun chi Appuhamy being an elderly person and

being an uncle of him, he lived with Punchi Appuhamy and with

Karunawathi, the 3 rd Respondent, he managed the lands. Later Punchi

Appuhamy gifted a portion of land to him by deed no. 47 dated

30.09.2002 marked IP4. The land described in this deed as an undivided

2 acres of a land out of 13 acres. Thereafter the Respondent executed a

deed of declaration no. 335 dated 30.12.2007 declaring that he became

the owner of lot 4 of plan no. 218/ A by long and uninterrupted

possession. On 3rd May 2008 he gifted the said portion to his daughter by

deed of gift no. 179. The Appellants contention is that there is a

contradiction in identifying the land. In deed no. 47 undivided portion of

the entire land was described. The land described in the schedule of the

deed is the subject matter of the partition action 188791P. In deeds nos.

335 and 179 a divided portion, that is the lot 4 in the partition plan 218/A

is described. The Respondent in his deed of declaration has not relied on

the deed of gift no. 47 to acquire title, but only on the long and

uninterrupted possession. Therefore the difference in the schedules in

those deeds does not contradict the identity of the land. In an action under

section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act the Court is not expected

to decide the title to the land. The title deeds are only supporting

documents to establish the possession.

The police filed the information III the Magistrate Court on

16.09.2008. Under section 68(1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act

Court has to decide who was in possession on the date of filing the

information when dispute is in regard to possession. Section 68( 1) of the

Primary Court Procedure Act reads thus;

68. (1) Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or

part thereof it shall be the duty of the Judge of the Primary Court

4

holding the inquiry to determine as to who was in possession of the

land or the part on the date of the filing of the information under

section 66 and make order as to who is entitled to possession of

such land or part thereof

If there is a forcible dispossession, the Court has to determine

when that dispossession took place and if it was within two months

immediately prior to the institution of the action Court has to place him

back in possession. The relevant section is 68(3). It reads;

68(3) Where at an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right to the

possession of any land or any part of a land the Judge of the

Primary Court is satisfied that any person who had been in

possession of the land or part has been forcibly dispossessed

within a period of two months immediately before the date on

which the information was filed under section 66, he may make a

determination to that effect and make an order directing that the

party dispossessed be restored to possession and prohibiting all

disturbance of such possession otherwise than under the authority

of an order or decree of a competent court.

In the present case the Appellants argue that the dispute is in

possession and there is no dispossession and therefore section 68( 1)

should apply and the learned High Court Judge has applied the wrong

section of law.

The Respondent made a complaint to the police on 03.09.2008

stating that he is in possession of the land in dispute and the Appellants

disturbed his possession. The police filed the information under section

66 on 16.09.2008. Even in his affidavit filed in the said case he has taken

the same stand. The Appellant's case is that the land was in possession of

their father Punchi Appuhamy and on his demise they possessed it.

5

As 1 pointed out earlier, it is an admitted fact that Punchi

Appuhamy was in possession. On his demise who possessed; is the issue.

The Respondent in his complaint to the police has stated that he

possessed. This fact was admitted by the 2nd Appellant in his statement to

the police dated 16.06.2008 marked 1P7. The Appellant's position taken

in that statement is that the Respondent is a rubber tapper and he was

asked not to do tapping because he has stolen latex but then the

Respondent reacted by saying that "I am the owner of the land and 1 will

not allow you to enter in to the land" and threatened with a club. The

Appellant requested the police to get him the land and not to allow the

Respondent to come in to the land called Pittugodalla. This statement

establishes that the Respondent is in possession of the land and the

Appellants were not allowed to enter in to the land at least from

16.06.2008.

It had been held in the case of Ramalingam v. Thangarajah [1992]

2 Sri L R 693 that even a trespasser can claim possession under section

68 of the Primary Court Procedure Act. It had been held that;

Thus, the duty of the Judge in proceedings under section 68 is to

ascertain which party was or deemed to have been in possession on

the relevant date, namely, on the date of the filing of the

information under section 66. Under section 68 the Judge is bound

to maintain the possession of such person even if he be a rank

trespasser as- against any interference even by the'rightful owner.

This section entities even a squatter to the protection of the law,

unless his possession was acquired within two months of the filing

of the information.

The evidence that was tendered by the Appellants to establish their

possession is also not conclusive. Except for the plan and the deed, the

6

other documents were obtained after institution of this action or after the

dispute arose. The learned Counsel heavily relies on the second report

submitted by the Grama Niladhari to establish possession. This report

was submitted to Court on the direction of the learned Primary Court

Judge. The court is expected to determine the case on the affidavits and

the documents tendered to Court. It has been held in the case of

Karunawathi v. Sangakkara [2005] 2 Sri L R 403 that;

(2) There is no pro vis ion for the Judge to call for oral evidence of

witnesses of his own choice. He cannot be permitted to go on a

voyage of discovery on his own to arrive at a decision when the

parties have placed before him the material on which they rely and

it is on this material that, he is expected to arrive at a

determination.

The Court cannot rely on the said second report of the Grama

Niladhari. The documents are prepared after the dispute. Therefore the

second Appellant's own admission that the Respondent is in possession

of the disputed land is strong evidence against the Appellants.

The Respondent has established that he was in possession on the

date of filing of the imformation. The Appellants have failed to establish

that they were disposed within two months prior to the filing of the

information. Therefore, under section 68( 1) of the Primary Court

Procedure Act the only determination that the Court can c?me in to is that

the Respondent was in possession of the disputed land.

Though the learned High Court Judge has referred to section 68(3)

in his order, his determination regarding the possession is correct. He has

held that though there is clear evidence that the Respondent (the

petitioner in the High Court revision application) is in possession the

7

learned Magistrate has wrongly decided that the appellants are entitle to

possession. We see no reason to interfere with that finding.

Accordingly we dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at Rs. 10000/-
