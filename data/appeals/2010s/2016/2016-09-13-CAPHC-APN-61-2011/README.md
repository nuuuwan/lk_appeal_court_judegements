Decided on : 07.09.2016

L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

The Petitioners Appellants (Hereinafter called and referred to as the

Appellants) are the members of the 3rd Respondent - Respondent Society

(Hereinafter called and referred to as the 3rd Respondent) and the 4 to 10

Respondents Respondents were the members of the Board of Directors of the said

Society. The petitioners filed this application in the High Court of Batticoloa

seeking a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the

15t Respondent Respondent (Hereinafter called and referred to as 151 Respondent)

communicated to the Petitioners by letter No. EPIl5IHCB/Writ/5601l0 dated

22.11.2010. The Learned High Court Judge dismissed the application on the basis

that the Petitioners have not disclosed the fact that they have filed an action prior

to this action on the same facts. Further the Learned High Court Judge ordered

each Petitioner to pay Rs. 5,0001- as costs of the action. The appeal is against that

decision.

While the appeal is pending before this Court, the ground situation has

changed. The period of office of the 4 to 10 Respondents has come to an end. A

new Board of Directors was elected.

3

Under this circumstance, the Petitioners submitted to Court that they do not

intend to proceed the appeal on merits but they moved this Court to set aside the

order to pay the costs. The learned SC submitted that the 1 st and the 2nd

Respondents do not insist on costs and consented to set aside the order of cost in

relation to 1 st and 2nd Respondents. 4 to 10 Respondents were absent and

unrepresented at the argument. The 3rd Respondent submitted that the present

Board of Directors has not consented to waive the cost.

The petitioners instituted this action on the basis that the meeting of the

General Body of the yd Respondent, called by the 1 st Respondent on 31.10.2010,

while the 3 rd Respondent was taking steps to convene a General Meeting on

14.11.2010, is bad in law and therefore the communication of the 15t Respondent

is also bad in law. This application was dismissed by the Learned High Court

Judge in the early stages of the case. The Learned High Court Judge has not

ordered the costs as exemplary costs.

Under these circumstances, we are of the view that the costs ordered by the

Learned High Court Judge should be set aside. Accordingly we set aside the order

of the Learned High Court Judge to pay costs and allow the petitioners to

withdraw the appeal.

Appeal dismissed subject to the above variation.

I agree.
