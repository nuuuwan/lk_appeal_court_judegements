Further that an order delivered under Section 66 of the Primary Court's Act is only a provisional or temporary order which does not affect or prejudice a civil rights ofthe parties. That parties affected by the said order can always file a civil action and obtain relief and that in Primary Court's Procedure Act there is no express provision for a judge preventing him from calling a witness.
