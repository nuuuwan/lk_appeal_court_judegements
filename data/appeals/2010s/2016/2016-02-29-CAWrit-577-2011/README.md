The petitioners have filed this application praying for a writ of

certiorari to quash the decision of the first respondent to treat the land

grant KuruIPral24975 date 23108/1990 marked P2 as cancelled in view

of P4 dated 27/09/1997 and also to quash the decision to issue P7 and

P8 both dated 27/09/2000.

The father of the petitioners and third and fourth respondents

W.M. Ranbanda was granted a land in terms of the provisions of the

Land Development Ordinance for the land shown as lot no. 29 in plan

marked as R1 and R2. The said Ranbanda had nominated the third

respondent namely W.M. Seelawathi as the successor to the property.

The third respondent by a letter dated 25/05/1988 has given her consent

for the first petitioner to construct a house and occupy a portion of the

land. By P2 on 23/08/1990 the third respondent was given a grant by

the President. The third respondent in 1997 by a declaration had

renounced all her rights and given the land back to the state. At the

same time she has requested the first respondent to transfer the said

land to the first and second petitioners and the fourth respondent, all her

siblings. The first respondent after registering and accepting the said 3

renunciation by the third respondent after surveying the land had issued

permits to first and second petitioners. The first respondent has also

issued two permits to the fourth respondent marked as P7 and P8.

The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that first

respondent did not have legal authority to accept the surrender of the

grant P2 given to the third respondent. He stated that in terms of section

3 of the State Land Ordinance the grantee has to apply to the President

to accept the surrender of the land and to re grant the land.

The petitioners further submitted that the first respondent has

failed to indicate the manner in which he had decided to accept the

surrender of the grant as per R6 circular. He stated that the first

respondent had acted in excess of authority to hold and inquiry and

issue new permits under the provisions of the Land Development

Ordinance. He said the actions of the first respondent are illegal,

arbitrary and ultra vires.

Learned counsel for the respondents stated that the petitioner's

nomination was never registered under Sec. 58 (1) and Sec. 60 of the

Land Development Ordinance therefore they have no rights from the

4

original permit holder. He cited the judgment in Madurasinghe vs

Madurasinghe 2 SLR 1421988.

The respondents stated that as the land grant was surrendered to

the state, the first respondent being the competent authority to deal with

state land could issue permits on the said land.

The respondents further submitted that all permits and grants

issued under the Land Development Ordinance are subjected to the

provisions of the said ordinance and in the event of any such instrument

is surrendered, cancelled or deemed void ab initio it is the prerogative of

the respective functionary to once again issue permits under the

relevant sections (sec. 19).

The fourth respondent stated that the petitioners are guilty of

laches and that the fourth respondents were given land by the state (Q1

and Q2).

Section 58 (1) of the Land Development Ordinance states

thus;

5

"A document (other than a last will) whereby the nomination 0/ a

successor is effected or cancelled shall not be valid unless and

until it has been registered by the Registrar 0/ Lands 0/ the

district in which the holding or land to which that document

refers is situated".

Sec. 60 of the Land Development Ordinance (as amended)

states thus;

"No nomination or cancellation 0/ the nomination 0/ a successor

shall be valid unless the document (other than a last will)

effecting such nomination or cancellation is duly registered

be/ore the date 0/ the death 0/ the owner 0/ the holding or the

permit holder".

Under the above provisions the petitioners nomination by the third

respondent has not been duly registered therefore they do not get any

rights on the third respondent's nomination.

Document marked P2 which the petitioners are seeking to quash

by way of a writ of certiorari is a State Grant given by the President

which cannot be quashed by way of a writ. Documents P7 and P8 are

permits given by the first respondent in the year 2000. This was given

after an inquiry and also after the third respondent renunciated her

rights which were duly registered. Thereafter the first respondent who

was the competent authority to issue permits has granted P7 and P8.

The petitioners after waiting for almost eleven years after permits were

issued have filed the instant application. As stated by the fourth

respondent it could be said that the petitioners are guilty of laches as

well.

In Madurasinghe vs Madurasinghe Chief Justice Parinda

Ranasinghe has confirmed the mandatory nature of this provisions and

the inability to rectify administrative lapses retrospectively. The

nomination of the petitioners by the third respondent was not registered

as required by the Land Development Ordinance.

For the afore stated reasons this court decide to refuse the

application of the petitioners with costs fixed at RS. 25,000/=
