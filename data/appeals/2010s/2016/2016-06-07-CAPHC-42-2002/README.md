CASE- NO- CA (PHC)- 42- 2002- JUDGMENT- 30.05.2016

P.R.Walgama, J

This appeal lies sequel to the order of the Learned

High Court Judge dated 23.07.2001, by which order

the order of the Learned Magistrate's was up held.

Being aggrieved by the said orders, the 2nd party

~ Respondent has appeab( to this Court to have the

said impugned orders vacated /set aside.

A brief synopsIs of the facts germane to the instant

appeal are as follows;

The officer in charge of Ambalangoda police on 19th

November 1999 filed an information in the Magistrate

Court of Balapitiya In terms of Section 66 of the

Primary

regarding

Court Procedure Act No.44 of 1979,

a land dispute which could have

culminated to a breach of the peace and the

dispute IS such that there IS a likelihood of a

breach of the peace.

The 1 st Party Respondent made a complaint on

13.11.1999 against the 2nd Party -Respondent-

Appellant stating that the Appellant had started

constructing a house on the land belonging to him.

It IS apparent from the statement made by the 2nd

Party - Petitioner - Appellant that she has agreed to

stop the construction if the police so advice. Further

it was her position that she was not aware that

the suit land belongs to the 1st Party - Respondent -

Respondent.

Thus it IS abundantly clear that the 2nd Party-

Respondent - Appellant has no legal right to the land

and by constructing the alleged house on a land

belonging to the 1 st Party - Respondent, she had

forcibly entered the land In Issue and dispossessed

the 1st party - Respondent.

The Learned Magistrate after considering the facts

and documents placed before her has arrived &t the

conclusion that the 2nd Party - Respondent - Petitioner-

Appellant was proceeding with the construction of

the alleged house. Therefore the Learned Magistrate

by the said order has placed the 1 st Party-

Respondent in posseSSIOn of the disputed land.

Being aggrieved by

way of Revision to

set aside.

the said

applied

have the

order, the 2nd Party-

to the High Court by

said impugned order

The Learned High Court Judge considering the facts

under mentioned arrived at the conclUSIOn that the

Learned Magistrate IS correct In arnvIng at the

above determination by placing the 1 st Party-

Respondent in possession of the subject land.

It IS alleged by the Petitioner - Appellant that the

Learned Magistrate has not properly identify the

4

land which IS the subject matter of this action. But

it IS seen that the Learned Magistrate has placed

the 1st Party Respondent on the land claimed by

him. Therefore the Learned Magistrate has ordered

that the 1st Party - Respondent should be

posseSSlOn after avoiding the land reserved

placed in

for the

state. Therefore no difficulty will arIse In restoring

the 1st Party - Respondent in possession.

It IS apparent from the statement by the 2nd Party

- Petitioner - Appellant made to the police that she

built a house with wooden planks on the reserve

land of the State, and after she was warnea by

the Police to remove the structure, she had removed

it and built a house towards the south of the said

land without knowing the said lot belongs to the

1 st Party - Respondent.

/Further

beyond

the Learned High Court Judge had gone

the possesslOn

and was satisfied with

of the 1 st Party - Respondent

the fact that he IS entitled

to disputed

Madampa

Appellant's

land, and the southern boundary is the

flver. The 2nd Respondent -Petitioner -

position was that she constructed the

house towards south, closer to the

apparently In the land belonging to the 1 st Party-

Respondent.

In the above context the Learned High Court Judge

was of the VIew that as per information filed In

5

j I i 1

the case bearing No. 16669 In the Magistrate Court

of Balapitiya, the affidavits and the petitions and

counter affidavits filed by the parties to the action

confirmed the fact that the 2nd Party Respondent-

Petitioner - Appellant has forcibly dispossessed the 1 st

Party -Respondent, two months pnor to the

information was filed

Section 66 of the

Primary

Court

In terms of

Procedure Act

No.44 of 1979.

In the afore said factual and legal matrix I am

persuaded to up hold the impugned orders of the

Learned High Court Judge and Learned Magistrate.

Accordingly appeal is dismissed.
