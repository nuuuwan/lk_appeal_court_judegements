CASE- NO- CA 1488 (A)- 97 I(F)- JUDGMENT- 29.07.2016

P.R. Walgama, J

The Plain tiff - A ppellan t has preferred the instant appeal

against the Judgment of the Learned District Judge,

dated 2nd July 1997, by which judgment the Learned

District Judge has entered the judgment and decree

In favour of the Plain tiff.

In the said judgment the Learned District Judge has

awarded a sum of Rs. 2 million as claimed by the

Plaintiff -Appellant, as damages for malicious

prosecution, in the Magistrate of Mount Lavinia.

Nevertheless In the said judgment the claim against

the 1st Defendant was granted by awarding the said

amount, but the action against the 2nd Defendant

was dismissed accordingly.

It is against the said dismissal of the action against

the 2nd Defendant the Plaintiff has challenged the

impugned judgment as stated above.

The Learned District Judge in the said impugned

judgment has observed the following;

That the caretaker Sandanam made a complaint to

the police at the behest of the 2nd Defendant, but

nevertheless it did not transpired that the 2nd

Defendant instigated to do so for what reason.

3

The Learned District Judge was of the VIew that

there was no ground emanated from the cross

examination of the 2nd Defendant that she instigated,

Sandanam to make a statement to the police.

Therefore the Learned District was of the VIew that

the 2nd Defendant has not made any statement

against the Plaintiff, and it was held that the case

against the 2nd Defendant should necessarily fail.

In the said action the 2nd Defendant had moved for

judgment In her favour for damages In a sum of

Rs. Two million for instituting action against her In

the District Court, but the Learned District Judge

was of the VIew that by mere filing of an action

the 2nd Defendant will not be entitled to claim

damages in the present action.

-It is to be noted that at the time of the incident

the 1st Defendant was out of the country, and

subsequently after he came to Sri Lanka he had

made a statement based on the complaint made by

the 3rd Defendant as to the forceful entry by the

plaintiff to his house.

Further it was revealed that by the testimony of the

plaintiff that 3rd Defendant has made a statement to

the police at the behest of the 2nd Defendant. The

said 3rd Defendant had never come to court.

4

As the witnesses were absent on the trial date the

Learned Magistrate has acquitted the accused - Plaintiff

from the case on 07.05.1992.

The Defendant -Respondents In their written

submissions adverted court to many legal principles

relating to malicious prosecution and the requirements

that should be established to prove the same. In the

said backdrop it IS said the Accused- Plaintiff was

not acquitted but discharged from the proceedings as

the witnesses for the prosecution was absent. It IS

trite law that mere absence of the witness for the

prosecution will not empower the Magistrate to acquit

the Accused.

It IS submitted by the Defendants that there had

been an enmity between the Plaintiff and the 1 st

and the 2nd Defendants.

The Counsel for the Plaintiff - Appellant does not

pursue the appeal against the 2nd Defendant, and

moved for a dismissal of the appeal and affirm the

judgment.

Accordingly appeal IS dismissed without costs.
