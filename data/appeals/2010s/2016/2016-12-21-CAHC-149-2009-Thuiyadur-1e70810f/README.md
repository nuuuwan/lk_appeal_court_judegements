The two accused-appellants were indicted before the High Court of Balapitiya for causing the death

of one Hikkaduwa Withanage Karunasiri along with one Udesiri an offence punishable under section

296 read with section 32 of the Penal Code and for committing the offence of Robbery of Gold

Juwellary worth of Rs.6000/- from Bathagamage Kalyanawathy an offence punishable under section

383 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

The two accused -appellants have elected to be tried before the High Court Judge without a jury and

they were convicted of both counts after trial and imposed death penalty on count one and 20 years

Rigorous Imprisonment for count two. Being dissatisfied with the said conviction and sentence

imposed on the two accused-appellants, they have preferred the present appeal against the said

conviction and sentence. After filing the appeal and while it was pending, the 1 sl accused-appellant

had died inside the prison and it is only the appeal of the 2nd accused-appellant is being argued

before this court.

As revealed before this court the deceased Karunasiri was residing in his house with his wife

Kalyanawathy and six year old son namely Deshapriya when the alleged incident took place on

19.03.1993.

3

The entire case for the prosecution was mainly relied on the evidence of the wife and the son of the

deceased Karunasiri since the incident had taken place at the house of the deceased during night

when the inmates were in sleep.

According to the evidence of Kalyanawathy and Deshapriya they woke up when the front door was

broken by the intruders. The deceased threw acid towards the intruders from the broken door but he

was shot and died almost instantly.

As the intruders were unknown to the prosecution witnesses, identification parade was held to

identify the accused when two out of three suspects involved in this incident were arrested after

several months.

According to the evidence of Asiri Deshapriya son of the deceased, had stated that two persons

entered the house while another was on the door frame. Of the two entered, one was armed with a

gun while the other had a sword. Witness who is 14 years at the time he was giving evidence and

was only 6 years at the time when the incident occurred identified the 151 accused (who is now dead)

on the basis that he had come to their place on one occasion before, in order to borrow a helmet from

the deceased. The witness had identified the 151 accused as the person who was armed with a sword.

The witness had further identified the appellant as the person who was on the door frame.

However with regard to the identity of the 2nd accused-appellant by this witness, this court is mindful

of the following facts,

a) The witness was only 6 years at the time the incident took place

b) The witness did not take part at the identification parade held at the Magistrate Court

after the arrest at the 2nd accused-appellant and therefore the identification of the 2nd will

amount to a dock identification only.

4

Even though it is unsafe to be relied on the dock identification made by witness Deshapriya, this

court has no reason to reject his evidence with regard to the fact that,

a) Three people were involved in the attack and firing took place at his house on 19th March

1993

b) The 1st accused and a third person had entered the house, where as another person was on

the door frame at the time of the incident

c) It is the 3rd person who fired at his father at that time

As observed by this court, the entire case with regard to the identity of the 2nd accused-appellant is

based on the testimony of witness Kalyanawathy.

I will now proceed to analyze the evidence of Kalayanawathy before considering the position taken

up by the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant during her submissions.

According to the evidence of Kalayanawathy the intruders have broke opened the front door of her

house and entered the house through the opening. At that stage her husband had thrown acid at the

intruders and one of them had fired at her husband. After her husband received gunshot injuries and

fallen the person who shot at her husband had removed the gold chain warn by the deceased. They

ransacked the Almirah while the inmates were pushed to a corner. The intruders were inside her

house for nearly 10 minutes.

According to the witness, her husband had switched on the tube light near the main entrance when

they heard the noise from outside and therefore there was sufficient light for her to identify the

intruders at that time. In addition to the light outside, there was another light burning near the

Buddha Statue and that too had helped her to observe what was happening inside the house.

In the land mark decision on identification, Regina V. Trunbull and another 1977 (1) QB 224 at

228 the question of visual identification in Criminal cases was discussed as follows, ..... Secondly

i i

t i i I ! f ( I

t

5

the judge should direct the jury to examine closely the circumstances in which the identification by

each witness came to be made. How long did the witness have the accused under observation? At

what distance? In what light? Was the observation impeded any way, as for example by passing

traffic or a press of people? Had the witness seen the accused before? How often? If only

occasionally, had he any special reason for remembering the accused .....

In the present case, according to the evidence of Kalayanawathy the 151 accused-appellant and the

other person had stayed inside the house for nearly 10 minutes. With regard to the 2nd accused-

appellant there was ample light to see him with the aid of the tube light which was near the main

entrance.

If this evidence is accepted we see no reason to reject the identification made by witness

Kalayanwathy with regard to both accused.

According to her, out of the two accused entered the house, the 151 accused who had the knife with

him had stabbed her hand and she suffered an injury to one of her fingers. During this time the 2nd

accused-appellant was standing near the door frame of her house.

The above position taken up by the witness Kalyanawathy was challenged by the defence under

cross examination and several omissions were marked in her evidence.

Since the admissibility of the said omissions were challenged by the Learned Senior Counsel during

the argument before us I would like to consider the argument raised by the Learned Senior State

Counsel first.

It was the argument raised by the Learned Senior Counsel that the defence in the High Court Trial

had failed to prove the contradiction and omissions as required by law. In this regard the Learned

Senior State Counsel relied on the interpretation given in the Evidence Ordinance to the term proved

and not proved,

6

Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance provides interpretation to the said terms proved and not proved

as follows;

Proved; a fact is said to be proved when, after considering the matters before it the court either

believes it to exist or consider its existence so probable that a prudent man ought,

under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it

exists

Not proved; a fact is said not to be proved when it is neither proved nor disproved

However when going through the above interpretation given by the Evidence Ordinance, what we

observe is that there is a requirement by court "after considering the matter before it, the court either

believes it to exist or consider its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the

circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that exists"

In this regard we are mindful of the decision in Keerthi Bandara V. Attorney General 2002 (4) Sri

LR 251 where the court held "thus when the defence contends that there is a vital omission which

militates against the adoption of the credibility of the witness, it is trial judge who should peruse the

Information Book and decide on that issue ...... .

Therefore it is our view that when the trial Judge permits a contradiction or omission is marked after

correctly putting it before the witness it is understood that he permitted the making of the said

omission or contradiction as required under the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance.

Under these circumstances we see no merit in the argument raised by the Learned Senior State

Counsel before us.

The Learned Counsel for the 2nd accused-appellant had placed before this court several omissions

and contradictions marked at the High Court trial and argued that even though the said omissions

7

and contradictions are not evidence in the present case, it is the duty of the trial judge to consider

them when considering the credibility of the witness.

In this regard we are also mindful of section 155 (c) of the Evidence Ordinance which reads thus;

155 The credit of a witness may be impeached in the following ways by the adverse party, or with

the consent of the court, by the party who calls him,

(c) By proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his evidence which is

liable to be contradicted

As observed above witness Kalynawathy was the sole eye witness, on whose evidence the identity of

the 2nd accused-appellant is mainly relied upon. Therefore it is important to consider the credibility

of the said witness before acting upon her evidence.

In this regard the Learned Counsel for the 2nd accused-appellant has brought to our notice the

following contradiction and omissions marked in the said trial;

In addition to the above contradictions and omissions marked through the evidence of witness

Kalyanawathy the Learned Counsel had brought to our notice of certain omissions marked in the

evidence of witness Deshapriya with regard to the identity of the accused.

As observed above, the identity relied upon by the 2nd witness Deshapriya was based on dock

identification only and therefore we are not inclined to consider those omissions and contradiction as

important in deciding the present case.

As observed by us, the omissions referred to above in the evidence of witness Kalayanawathy are

mainly on the incident that took place at her house during night when she was sleeping with her

husband and her 6 years old son.

The intruders who broke open the door of her house had fired at her husband killing him. In such a

situation it is not fair to expect a witness to come out with each and every thing that took place

during that unexpected event within few hours after the incident, when she is making her statement

to police.

With regard to the main incident, there was no major contradictions intersay between the two eye

witnesses.

As observed by this court the main issue left open is the question of identity of the remaining

accused-appellant.

When considering the omissions and the contradiction marked, we observe that except for

contradiction marked 2 C) 1 and the omission referred to in page 108 of the appeal brief, all the

other omissions cannot be considered as important omissions which goes to the root of the case.

11

The contradiction 2 Oland the omission referred to above, refers to the one and the same issue

whether witness Kalyanawathy in her statement to police had after giving description of one person

had said that she cannot identify any other or she had said that she could identify the other if seen.

As observed above this court cannot simply reject the evidence of an eyewitness who took the

trouble to make a detailed statement after a tragedy of this nature. Even if the witness had failed to

mention it in her statement, she had identified him at the parade in which no complaint was made by

the 2nd accused-appellant with regard to the identity she made.

Even though the witness had denied, the counsel who represented the 15t accused-appellant had

suggested to the witness that the 15t accused-appellant was shown to her at the police station. There

was no such suggestion made to the witness from the counsel on behalf of the 2nd accused-appellant

but the 2nd accused-appellant in his dock statement had said that he was shown to the witnesses at the

police station prior to the identification parade.

In this regard we are mindful of the decision in Gunasiri and two others V. Republic of Sri

Lanka (2209) 1 Sri LR 39 at 45-46 where Sisira de Abrew J observed,

"Although the 3rd accused-appellant took up the position that he was at the temple at the

relevant time with the priest, he never asked for summons on the priest nor did he file a list of

witnesses indicating the name of the priest. The trial commenced on 29.11.2001and the defence

case was concluded on 19.09.2003. Thus during a period of 2 years he failed to move Court to

get summons on the priest. Although the 3rd accused-appellant raised an alibi in his dock

statement, he failed to suggest this position to prosecution witnesses. The Learned Counsel who

appeared for the defence did not suggest to the prosecution witnesses the alibi raised by the 3rd

accused-appellant. What is the effect of such silence on the part of the counsel. In this connection

I would like to consider certain judicial decisions. In the case of Sarwan Singh V. State of Punjab

12

ZOOZ AIR SC III 365Z at 3656 Indian Supreme Court held thus: "It is a rule of essential justice

that whenever the opponent has declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in

cross examination it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted."

This judgment was cited with approval in Bobby Mathew V. State of Karnataka, Z004 CR U

3003. Applying the principles laid down in the above judicial decision, I may express the

following view. Failure to suggest the defence of alibi to the prosecution witnesses who

implicated the accused, indicates that it was a false one. Considering all these matters I am of

the opinion that the defence of alibi raised by the 3rd accused-appellant is an afterthought."

When considering matters referred to above we see no merit in the argument raised by the

counsel for the Znd accused-appellant that,

a) It is unsafe to act on the evidence of witness Kalyanawathy in convicting the Znd

accused -appellant

b) The Learned Trial Judge had erred in law when he decided that the omissions and

contradiction marked at the trial does not go to the root of the case.

The next important issue we have to consider at this stage is whether the Znd accused-appellant

had shared the common intention with the others, for the Learned High Court Judge to find the

Znd accused guilty of murder.

As revealed before this court, the incident had taken place in midnight when the Znd accused-

appellant with two others had gone to the house where the deceased and the witness had lived,

armed with a gun and a knife. There is no evidence that the Znd accused-appellant was armed

with a gun or knife but the evidence was that the intruding party had first demanded the inmates

to open the door, later brake open the door and when the inmates threw acid on them the person

who was armed with the gun had fired at the chief occupant of the house and thereafter

I

13

ransacked the house for nearlylO minutes. All this time the 2nd accused-appellant was standing at

the door step probably giving cover to the acts committed by the others inside the house.

From the evidence available before this court, the act of firing had taken place when the inmates

resisted the entry in to the house. The intruders have come armed with deadly weapons, and

when the inmates refused to open the door they broke the door. Even after the firing, the 2nd

accused-appellant remained at the house of the deceased until the others fulfilled the mission.

From these events it is clear, that each member who participated in the said incident had shared

the common intention of each act committed by the other members as a result of a pre arranged

plan. The act of firing cannot be considered as an isolated act committed just by one person.

In the case of Ram Jahal V. State of Uttar Pradesh (1972) 1 see 136 Indian Supreme Court

whilst referring to section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, held that

"Common intention denotes action in concert and necessarily postulated a pre-arranged

plan, a prior meeting of minds and an element of participation in action. The acts may be

different and very in character but must be actuated by the same common intention which is

different from same intention or similar intention"

For the reasons discussed above we see no grounds to interfere with the conviction and sentence

imposed by the Learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya on the 2nd accused-appellant. We

therefore dismissed this appeal and affirm the conviction and sentence.

Appeal dismissed.
