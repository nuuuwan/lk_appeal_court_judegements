At the time the present cases were filed, both Petitioners were retired from the government service

having served as Investigating Officers in the Department of Local Government.

The Petitioner in Application OS/2013 T.M.C.S. Bandara has been in the Public Service since 1965,

was appointed to the post of Investigating Officer Grade II w.e.f. 01.02.1972 and the Petitioner in

06/2013 SJ.S.P Perera has been in the Public Service since 1963, was appointed to the post of

Investigating Officer Grade II w.e.f. 10.07.1973 both after a competitive examination.

Both Petitioners submitted before us that they were promoted as Investigating Officer Grade I in the

Department of Local Government w.e.f. 08.07.1981 with a salary scale of Rs. 6840-6x 240, 6x300-

10 800/- which was later back dated to 04.05.1981. On 01.01.1990 both Petitioners were appointed

to the post of Investigating Officer Grade I in the Central Province Public Service.

When the Public Servants were given an option to retire under Public Administration circular

44/1990, both Petitioners opted to retire under the said circular and accordingly the Petitioners

retired from the Public Service w.eJ. 01.01.1991.

The two Petitioners did not contest the fact that both of them were belonging to a salary scale of

22,560-3x 480- 15x600 -33,000 at the time they retired and their pension was calculated based on

the above scale.

The salary revisions introduced to the Investigating Officers in the other Departments such as

Railway and Postal since year 1981 were not applied to the Investigating Officers who were serving

at the Department of Local Government which created salary anomalies between the Investigating

Officers serving in the Department of Local Government and the Investigating Officers who were in

the other departments.

The salary scale of the Investigating Officers belonging to the Department of Local Government was

also revised by Public Administrative Circular 2/97 (iii) and the new scale of the said category of

officers was referred to as T -3-7 -5 by the said circular and it represented a scale of Rs. 92, 580- 15x

240 - 129, 480.

However at the time the said circular was issued in November 1997 the Petitioners have already

retired, but the Ministry of Provincial Council and Local Government decided to extend the benefit

of the said salary revision to all retired Investigating Officers by placing them on the same scale on

the date of their retirement subject to the condition that the revision of pension will take effect from

1 sl January 1997.

Petitioners did not challenge this position before us and in fact Petitioners submission before us was

that, all their issues were solved and the payments were duly made. The grievance of the Petitioner

before this court was a subsequent decision taken by the Department of Pension to recover purported

excessive amount paid to the Petitioners as evinced in documents produced marked P-22 and P-23.

The Petitioners argument before this court was that the original award dated 05.05.2009 was made

after several consultations, discussions and also obtaining instructions from the Honorable Attorney

General. The Petitioners further submitted that after obtaining such instructions and directives the

Petitioners were duly paid with their revised pension by the Department of Pensions taking in to

account the respective pension circulars applicable to public servants. In this regard we observe a

directive by the lSI Respondent to Divisional Secretary, Abanganga Korale to pay the revised

pension w.eJ. 01.01.1997 by calculating the pension, taking in to account all pension conversions

since 01.01.1991.

The argument of the Learned State Counsel who represented the Respondents was two fold. His first

argument was that the Petitioners do not have an absolute right to a pension and therefore he is not

entitled to any relief by this court. He secondly argued that in any event the claim by the Petitioners

cannot be sustained on its merits since the decision and the calculation referred to in the two

impugned documents P-22 and P-23 are made in good faith by ad-hearing to the provisions of the

relevant circular which categorically states that the revision of pension benefits of Investigating

Officer of the Department of Local Government will become effective from 01.01.1997.

Rule 01 of the Minutes of Pension Provides,

"Public Servants have no absolute right to any pension or allowance under these

rules, and the crown retains the power to dismiss a Public Servant without

compensation. "

In the case of Gunawardena V. Attorney General 47 NLR 359 Supreme Court discussed the above

provision as follows,

"It was contended, a Court of Law has no jurisdiction in any matter relating to payment of

pensions to retired government servants, such matters depending entirely upon the grace and

bounty of Crown. In my opinion the Learned Commissioner's judgment upholding this

objection was correct. The payment of pensions to retired government servants at the relevant

date was regulated by certain rules sanctioned by the Secretary of State for Colonies and

incorporated in the Minutes of Pensions dated 05.02.1934. Rule 1 expressly provides that

public servants have no absolute right to any pension or allowance under these rules."

The above decision was followed in the case of Attorney General V. Abeysinghe 78 NLR 361 in the

said case Thennakoon C] observed,

"The expression"' no absolute right to my mind means "no legal right" It is a signal

hoisted by the draftsman to indicate both to the beneficiaries under the Minutes of

Pensions and to the Courts that the Minutes are not to be taken as creating rights

enforceable in the courts. The "no legal right" concept contained in rule 1 of the

Minutes is then reinforced by the text of rules 2 and 15 which contain the

expressions" may be awarded" and "may in his discretion granted"

Whilst concurring with the above decision Tittawella J further observed,

"I agree with the Chief Justice that the Minutes on Pensions create no legal right

infavour of a Public Servant and that the court have no jurisdiction to entertain an

action praying for a declaration in regard to his pension and the date from which he

should be paid. I also agree that in Sri Lanka there is no constitution provision or any

other provision of written law which has the effect of altering the provisions of rule

1 of the Minutes of Pension."

When reaching the above decision the Supreme Court was mindful of the similar provision

contained in section 30 of the Superannuation Act of 1834 which deals with Superannuation benefits

for public servants in England and interpretations given by the Chancery Division and the King's

Bench on this provision. II! It

In the case of Yorke V. The King [1915J 1 KB 852 the Kings Bench commented,

"I cannot consider whether a mistake has been made in the calculation of the

suppliant's pension or not; 1 can only say that the suppliant has no legal right to ask

this court to decide either that he is entitled to a pension, or as to the basis upon

which it should be calculated."

7

We observe that the decision in Yorke V. The King deals with almost similar situation to the two

cases before us, where the Petitioners complain against the second calculation made by the 1st

Respondent.

When considering the position taken up by our courts as considered by me in this judgment, it is not

possible for this court to agree with the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioners when they

argued that the Respondents have arbitrarily deprived of the entitlements given to public officers

under Pension Circulars 16/1994,01/1997 and 05/1999.

Learned State Counsel without prejudice to his first argument further submitted that even though the

Petitioners are not entitled for a pension as of right and therefore not entitled to question the

correctness of the decision taken to recover the arrears of pension already decided, the decision to

recover the said over payment was made with a valid legal basis.

As admitted by both parties before this court the investigators belonging to the Department of Local

Government was placed at T-3-7-5 scale with effect from 01.01.1997. when extending the validity of

the said circular to the retired officers who retired prior to 01.01.1997, it was necessary to first

calculate the revised salary based on the last drawn salary and then determine the pension by

reference to the revised lost drown salary and the said determined pension was to be paid w.eJ.

01.01.1997. The argument of the Petitioners before this was that, even though the revised pension

was paid w.e.f. 01.01.1997 the Petitioners are entitled to the revisions proposed to the pension under

pension circular 16/1994, 01/1997 and 05/1999.

This court cannot agree with the above contention of the Petitioners, since the Petitioners are to be

paid revised pension only with effect from 01.01.1997.

Therefore any revisions proposed by pension circulars prior to 01.01.1997 will have no bearing on

the calculation made to the Petitioners pensions.

For the reasons set out above we see no merit in the Arguments raised by the Petitioners before us

and therefore this court is not inclined to grant any relief to the Petitioners in both applications. Both

Applications are dismissed without cost.
