P.R.Walgama, J

The Plaintiff- 3rd Respondent made application 1n terms

of Section 18( 1) of the Agrarian Services Act No. 58

of 1979, amended by Act No. 04 of 1991, and the

complaint has been made against the tenant Cultivator

for failure to pay the rent for two seasons.

After the . . to the said application the 1nqu1ry 1n

Commissioner of Agrarian has come to a finding that

the tenant cultivator 1S 1n arrears of rent and ordered

to pay rent 1n a sum of Rs 3000/. As the tenant

cultivator has failed to pay the rent as ordered by

the Commissioner, the Commissioner sent a quit notice

of ejectment under Section 18(1) of the Agrarian

Services Act, and a notice 1n terms of Section 18(2)(3)

ordering him to vacate the paddy field.

Being aggrieved by the said orders dated 20.07.1999

and 09.08.1999 the Respondent - Petitioner moved the

High Court for a mandate 1n the nature of Writ of

3 I

irt ! 1 !

Certiorari to quash the decisions of 1 st and 2nd

Respondents accordingly.

In the said application to the High Court the

Petitioner- Appellant has unfolded the following;

That the 4 th and 5th Respondents are joint tenant

cultivators and their names are registered In the paddy

land register as the joint tenant cultivators and as per

documents marked P8(1) to P 8(10) the Petitioner and

4th and the 5th Respondents had paid the acreage fee

to the land In Issue.

It IS alleged by the Petitioner- Appellant that he has

paid the rent to the 3rd Respondent who is the land

lord of the said paddy field, but nevertheless the 3rd

Respondent had refused to accept the same.

The 4th and the 5th Respondents had tendered their

objections and pleaded that they should be heard and

as such to make order to the 1st Respondent to hold

a fresh inquiry in respect of the alleged failure to pay

the rent to the 3rd Respondent. (owner of the paddy

land).

It is to be noted that the Learned High Court Judge

Court Rules 3(3) by not tendering the certified cop1es

of the documents tendered with the petition.

Rule 3-1(a) of the Court of Appeal rules 1990 reads

thus;

" 3(1)(a) - every application made to the Court of Appeal

for the exercise of the powers vested in the Court of

Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the Constitution shall

be by way of petition, together with an affidavit 1n

support of the averments therein, and shall be

accompanied by the originals of documents material to

such application (or duly certified cop1es thereof) 1n the

form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender

any such document, he shall state the reason for such

inability and seek the leave of court to furnish such

document later. Where a Petitioner fails to comply with

the prOV1SlOns of this rule the court may, ex mero

motu or at the instant of any party, dismiss such

application. "

Therefore it 1S abundantly clear that the said rule 1S

mandatory and the failure to follow the said rule 1S

fatal, and will result 1n the dismissal of the application

of the Petitioner.

Further the strict compliance of this rule was

Further it was observed by the Learned High Court

Judge that the dossier tendered by the Petitioner-

Appellant were not certified cop1es but only endorsed

as true cop1es by an Attorney -at -law. Therefore the

Learned High Court Judge was of the V1ew that on

that account alone that the Petitioner- Appellant's

application should be dismissed.

It was also observed by the Learned High Court Judge

that, although the Petitioner- Appellant has stated that

there were another two tenant cultivators, but has not
