JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The Petitioner is an officer who had served in the Sri Lanka Air Force

whose right leg above the knee was amputated as a result of being shot

at, by another airman at Sri Lanka Air Force unit at Bandaranaike

International Air port.

The Medical Board that was convened consequent to the aforesaid

amputation had decided in its proceedings as follows:

"Assess MB held today and rec. that he be unfit for the service under

existing standard relating to fitness

ES: A4 G4 (P)."

This document titled"Medical Board proceedings - all ranks" is produced

marked R 1 by the Respondents. The above decision is found therein

under the section "Findings of the Board" as item No. 12.

The argument advanced by the learned counsel for the Petitioner is that

the Petitioner is eligible to receive compensation which should be

equivalent to 120 months' salary in terms of the provisions contained in

clause 3 (a) (ii) and 3 (a) (iii) of the Public Administration Circular No. 22 /

1933, dated 1993-09-21, produced marked P 9 ( 60 months' salary

referred to in that circular has subsequently been increased by 1000/0 by

the Cabinet of Ministers subsequently).

4

Clause 3 (a) (ii) and (iii) relied upon by the learned counsel for the

Petitioner are as follows:

Clause 3 (a) (ii)

if the injury results in permanent total disablement

"60 months' salary being deemed unfit for service by the Board dealing

with the payment of compensation mentioned in section 5 of this Circular.

The Board will take decision on the recommendations of the Head of the

Department concerned and based on the report of the Medical Board.

when patients is categorized under "permanent total disablement" the

Medical Board will not state any percentage of loss of earning capacity /

disability. Instead it will report that the patient is not fit to perform the

duties of the present post he holds and that the patient is "permanently

and totally disabled".

Clause 3 (a) (iii)

if the injury results in permanent partial disablement

"Compensation payable to be determined by the Board dealing with the

paymentbf compensation mentioned in section 5 of this Circular as a

percentage of 45 months' salarl based on the percentage loss of earning

capadty determined by a Medical Board in accordance with the annex I of

this Circular. The f-.1edical Board will not categorize a patient who is not fit

to perform the duties of the present post he holds under this category."

The argument advanced by the learned counsel for the Petitioner is

twofold. They are;

5

i. that the Medical Board cannot state any percentage of loss earning

capacity when it recommends to categorizes a patient under clause

3(a)(ii) "permanent total disablement" category.

ii. that the Medical Board should not categorize a patient who is not fit

to perform the duties of the present post he holds under clause

3(a)(iii) when it makes a finding on the percentage loss of earning

capacity of a patient as has been determined by the Board in this

case.

It was his submission that the finding of the Medical Board is therefore

compatible with clause 3 (a) (ii).

A4 G4 referred to in item No. 12 under the 'Findings of the Board' in the

Medical Board proceedings is found in the Air Force Orders No: 680 marked

and produced by the Respondents as R 2 (al. It is as follows:

"Fit to fly as a passenger only ( either as a passenger in normal transport

flight or as a patient in an aero medical flight)."

"Limited Ground duties of his trade in addition to limitation of service

duties. Limitation is specified, i. e. Unfitness for. Night Duty, Shift Work,

Standing up or at heights or an laddees or underground or in confined

spaces or in the open or outdoors or with food stuffs, close work, Driving,

Wearing headsets, Exposure to noise or heat or cold or water or glare or

6

skin irritants or fumes, Heavy lifting, Driving heavy vehicles, work kneeling

down, Use of one hand ( an arm) opportunity for regular meals work under

supervision only, use of fire arms etc."

It was the submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that the

Medical Board findings contained in item No. 15 of its proceedings R 1 is

contrary to clause 3 (a) (ii) of the circular as it has stated that "when

patient is categorized under permanent total disablement, the Medical

Board will not state any percentage of loss or earning capacity/disability."

The question before this court therefore is, whether the Medical Board has

categorized the Petitioner under limb 3 (a) (ii) or 3 (a) (iii) of the relevant

Circular above referred to.

The answer to this question could and should be found from the document

marked R 1. Air Force Order No. 608 has been produced by the Petitioner

as P 2 and by the Respondents as R 2. Therefore it is clear that the

documents relied on by both parties are not at variance.

It is relevant to note that the findings of the Board has been entered in R

1 under item No. 12 (b), the heading of which is "Employment Standards.

Add any specific restrictions on employability". The Medical Board has

clearly categorized the Petitioner under the category A4 G4 and that is the

reason as to why the Medical Board has gone on to make a finding on the

percentage of the loss of earning capacity of the Petitioner.

Item No. lO(a) in R 2 explains the meanings of 'A' as indicating flying

duties and 'G' as indicating ground duties.

7

Further it is relevant to observe that the note appearing on top of item No.

15 of the Medical Board proceedings (R 1) reads thus; " what is the

present degree of disablement as compared with a healthy person of the

same age and sex? Percentages will be expressed as NIL or in UNITS up to

20% or in MULTIPLES OF TEN from 20% to 100%. Where an artificial

appliance (other than aid to hearing) has been satisfactorily fitted, this

assessment will be related to the residual degree of disablement. "

There appears a table below that note which comprises four separate

columns.

The Petitioner in this proceeding seeks inter alia,

I. a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st _3rd Respondents

contained in the letter dated 2013-07-18 marked (P13) and in the

letter dated 2013-07-25 marked (P14),

II. a direction on the 1st and 2nd Respondents to grant the Petitioner

with a monetary compensation of 120 months' salary instead of the

compensation that the Petitioner has presently been granted.

It is to be observed that the prayer No. (ii) above does not specify the

nature of the writ that is being sought by the Petitioner. This has an

importance as this application is an application made under Article 140 of

" ' the Constitution which empowers this Court to issue several types of writs.

In the case of Dayananda Vs. Thalwatta1 this Court has held as follows.

1 2001 2 SLR at page 73

8

" .... An aggrieved person who is seeking to set aside an unfavourable

decision made against him by a public authority could apply for a

prerogative writ of certiorari and if the application is to compel an authority

to perform a duty he would ask for a writ of mandamus and similarly if an

authority is to be prevented from exceeding its jurisdiction the remedy of

prohibition was available. Therefore it is necessary for the Petitioner to

specify the writ he is seeking supported by specific averments why such

relief is sought. Even though the Petitioner has set out in the caption that

"in the matter of an application ... for writ of quo warranto and prohibition"

there is no supporting averment specifying the writ and there is no prayer

as regards the writ that is being prayed for. The failure to specify the writ

therefore renders the application bad in law ..... "

Admittedly the applicable Circular for payment of compensation to Public

officers who suffer injury while on duty is Public Administration Circular No.

22/93 (marked P 9) as amended by the Circular No. 22/93 (iii) (marked R

7 (al). Consideration of the provisions of the said Circular in its totality

shows ~hat the quantum of compensation payable .~o such injured officer

will depend on the loss of that officer's earning capacity.

Clause 3 (a) (iii) specifies how a loss of earning capacity should be

measured in case of a permanent partial disablement.

The disablement the Petitioner has suffered is an amputation of his leg

from his right knee. It is an injury which is permanent in nature. But it

cannot be categorized as a total disablement which envisages a situation

9

where the Petitioner 'is not fit to perform the duties of the present post he

holds and that the petitioner is permanently and totally disabled' category

which falls under clause 3(a)(ii).

Therefore in this case the nature of the injury which the Petitioner has

sustained is a permanent partial disablement for which the Respondents

are authorized to pay only 90 Months' salary as the applicable clause is

clause 3(a)(iii) .

To the contrary according to Clause 3 (a) (ii), when a patient is categorized

under "permanent total disablement" the Medical Board will not state any

percentage of loss of earning capacity / disability. Instead it will report that

the patient is not fit to perform the duties of the present post he holds and

that the patient is "permanently and totally disabled".

In the instant case the lastly convened Medical Board of the Air Force had

determined the percentage of disability for the Petitioner's disablement of

right above knee amputation as 75%2 The composite assessment of all

disability sustained by the Petitioner is also indicated to be 75%3 The

"Minimum duration of this degree of disablement" of the Petitioner is

mentioned as 02 years4. It is the position of the Respondents that this

". . duration refers to the validity period of the assessment in R 1 and that

after the lapse of two years the relevant officer will have to be re-assessed

to obtain his accurate fresh medical status.

3 Column 3 of the table under item No. 15 in BJ,

4 Column 4 of the table under item No. 15 in BJ,

10

'The calculation of the loss of earning capacity of the Petitioner for the loss

of his leg at or above knee to be 75% is also supported by Schedule 1 of

the Circular N 0 22 / 93. This Schedule is an annexure to the above

circular.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons we see no basis as to

why the decision contained in the letter dated 2013-07-18 marked (PI3)

and in the letter dated 2013-07-25 marked (P14) should be quashed by a

Writ of Certiorari. Therefore we decide to dismiss this application. No cost

is ordered.

Application is dismissed without costs.
