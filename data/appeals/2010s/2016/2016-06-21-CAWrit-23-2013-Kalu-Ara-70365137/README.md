Petitioner K.A. Allen Nona had come before this court seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

determination marked P-8 made by the 2nd Respondent under section 90 of the Agrarian Development

Act No. 46 of 2000.

3

When this matter was taken up for argument before this court the counsel for the Respondents have

raised preliminary objections for the maintainability of this application before this court.

The objections raised by the Respondents were twofold. Firstly they took up the position that the

Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to hear and determine the present application and only the

Provincial High Court has the jurisdiction, under the provisions of the 13th Amendment to the

Constitution.

Secondly the Respondents challenge the locus standi of the Petitioner to come before this court.

Article 154 (4) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka reads thus,

154 P (4) Every such High Court shall have jurisdiction to issue according to law

b) Order in the nature of Writ of Certiorari, Prohibition, Procedendo, Mandamus

and quo warranto against any person exercising within the province any power

under

1. any law or

11. any statute made by the Provincial Council established for that

Province

111. respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council List

Out of the 37 subjects enumerated in the Provincial Council List item 9 of the Provincial Council list

reads as follows;

9. Agriculture and Agrarian Services:-

9.1 Agriculture, including agricultural extension, promotion and education

for provincial purposes and agricultural services (other than inter-

provincial irrigation and land settlement schemes, state land and

plantation agriculture)

i 1I1I

fI

9.2 Rehabilitation and maintenance of minor irrigation works

9.3 Agricultural research, save and except institutions designated as

national agricultural research institutions

As observed above, with the implementation of the provisions of the 13th amendment to the

constitution and with the introduction of Provincial Councils, Writ Jurisdiction with regard to certain

matters were conferred with the Provincial High Courts when certain conditions are satisfied. As

referred to in the relevant Constitutional Provisions, the said requirement can be summarized as

follows;

1. The Writ must be sought against a person exercising power within the Province

11. The power so exercised must be under either a law or a Provincial Council Statute

111. The said law or statute must relate to a matter set out in the Provincial Council List

The Agrarian Services Act was repealed in the year 2000 with the introduction of the Agrarian

Development Act and the long title to the Agrarian Development Act describes the Ambit of the Act

as follows;

"An act to provide for matters relating to landlords and tenant cultivators of paddy lands, for

the utilization of agricultural lands in accordance with agricultural policies for the

establishment of Agrarian Development Councils, to provide for the establishment of a land

bank and Agrarian Tribunals .... "

From the description given to the ambit of the said act, it is clear that the said Act fulfills the

requirement to the title "Agriculture and Agrarian Services" referred to in section 9 of the Provincial

Councils list if a purposive interpretation is given as referred to by the Supreme Court in the case of

Madduma Banda V. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services and Another 2003 (2) Sri LR

80.

In this case the Supreme Court held,

"The word 'Agrarian' in section 9 of the Provincial Council list relates to landed property and

such property could no doubt attract paddy lands and tenement cultivators of such land and

hence the impugned order would be covered by the said section 9 in the Provincial Councils

List.

In the case of ambiguity the enactment should be interpreted so as to give effect to its purpose.

The purpose of the 13th Amendment is to give a right to an aggrieved party to have recourse to

the Provincial High Court instead of having to seek relief from the Court of Appeal in

Colombo. As such the High Court is deemed to have jurisdiction to grant writ sought under

Article 154 P (4)."

However if the particular Act or Statue does not fall or falls outside the subjects enumerated in the

Provincial Council list in such a situation the Provincial High Court would not have jurisdiction to

entertain writ applications.

In the case of Weragama V. Eksath Lanka Wathu Kamkaru Samithiya 1994 (1) Sri LR 293 the

Supreme Court held;

"The Industrial Disputes Act and any other enactments which may confer powers on Labour

Tribunals are not within the scope of any item or matter in the Provincial Council List; and also .... it

is only the Reserved List which contains any item or matter which would cover those enactments and

Labour Tribunals- 'Justice in so far as it relates to the judiciary and the courts structure [including] ....

jurisdiction and powers of all courts .... ' Accordingly, those enactments would not fall within 'any

law .... in respect to any matter set out in the Provincial Council List', and the High Court [of the

Province] would not have writ jurisdiction over Labour Tribunals."

It is further observed by this court that the document sought to be quashed i.e. P-8 is signed by the

Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development for the Gampaha District at Gampaha Office. The

6

said Assistant Commissioner has made the impugned order acting under the provisions of the

Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 and the present case refers to a decision made by the 2nd

Respondent under section 9 (1) of the Agrarian Development Act with regard to the rights of using a

threshing floor or of the existence of an agricultural road and as discussed above, when purposive

interpretation is given, the said act comes within section 9 of the Provincial Council list and therefore

it is clear that all the requirement needed under Article 154 P (4)(b) have been fulfilled in the present

case.

Therefore it is clear that under Article 154 P (4) of Constitution, the Provincial High Court has been

conferred the Jurisdiction to hear and determine the present case as submitted by the Respondents.

However, it is also important to consider the effect of Article 154 P (4) (b) on the jurisdiction

conferred on the Court of Appeal under Article 140 of the Constitution.

Article 140 of the Constitution reads thus,

Article 140 subject to the provisions of the constitution, the Court of Appeal shall have full power

and authority to inspect and examine the records of any court of first instance or

tribunal or other institution, and grant and issue according to law, orders in the nature

of Writs of Certiorari, Prohibition, Prosedendo, Mandamus and quo warranto against

the judge of any court of first instance or tribunal other institution or any other person.

When Article 154 P (4) conferred the jurisdiction with the High Court, the powers already conferred

with the Court of Appeal with regard to the areas covered under sub-article (b) had not been taken

away from the Court of Appeal.

This issue was discussed by Mark Fernando J in the case of Weragama V. Eksath Lanka Wathu

Kamkaru Samithiya and Others as follows;

t i I j

"These amendments affected the appellate revisionary, and writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal

only in two respects. Firstly Article 154 P (3) (b) Conferred appellate and revisionary jurisdiction (but

not writ jurisdiction) in respect of Magistrate's Court and Primary Courts (but not labour tribunal or

other courts and tribunals); this was "not withstanding anything in article 138" (and that article was

in any event "subject to the provisions of the constitution") and so either the jurisdiction of the Court

of Appeal was protanto transferred to the High Courts or the Court of Appeal and the High Courts

had concurrent jurisdiction. secondly, Article 154 P (4) conferred writ jurisdiction over any person

exercising within the province, any power under any law or statute specified there in; this was not

stated to be "exclusive" or "not withstanding anything in Articles 140 and 141" and hence the High

Court had concurrent jurisdiction with the Court of Appeal.

This issue was once again discussed by Sri Skandarajah J in the case of Nilwala Vidulibala Company

(Pvt) Ltd V. Kotapola Praseshiya Saba and Others 2005 (1) Sri LR 296 as follows;

"Writ jurisdiction conferred on the Provincial High Court is Concurrent with the jurisdiction

of the Court of Appeal and Article 140 and the latter has not been diminished by the 13th

amendment. "

Under these circumstances it is understood that with regard to the applications come within Article

154 P (4) of the Constitution, Provincial High Courts are conferred with concurrent jurisdiction with

the Court of Appeal.

In their second objection the Respondents have challenged the locus standi of the Petitioner on the

ground that the Petitioner had failed to explicitly disclose the basis for the entitlement to the property

in question. When going through the documentation before this court we see no reason to believe that

the Petitioner is an outsider or a third party to the inquiry conducted by the 2nd Respondent. The

documents produced by all the parties such as 1R1, 3R1 clearly refers to the involvement of the

Petitioner in obstructing of an agricultural road as alleged by the 3rd to 5th Respondents and the notice

I , i f I i i ! , , l

r I

\If " [ ,

issued by the 2nd Respondent produced marked P-6 and the impugned order P-8 are addressed to the

Petitioner herself. The fact that the Petitioner was in control over all the properties referred to in the

complaints are well established from the inquiries conduct by the 2nd Respondent. It is further

observed that the petitioner is a person who is affected from the decision of the 2nd Respondent and

therefore we are of the view that the Petitioner possesses sufficient interest to this matter.

Under these circumstances we see no reason to dismiss this application based on the preliminary

objections raised by the Respondents.

As observed by us the Provincial High Court is conferred with concurrent jurisdiction with the Court

of appeal to hear and determine the present case.

Proviso to section 12 of the High Court of Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No 19 of 1990 has

given the Court of Appeal a discretion as to which court should hear such application when it is

before the Court of Appeal.

Proviso to section 12 of the said Act reads as follows;

"Provided, however, that where any appeal or application which is within the jurisdiction of a

High Court established by Article 154 P of the Constitution if filed in the Court of Appeal, the

Court of Appeal may if it considers it expedient to do so order that such appeal or application

be transferred to such High Court and such High Court shall hear and determine such appeal

or application."

As observed by this court, the impugned decision has been given by the 2nd Respondent at Gampaha

and the parties referred to this application are also from Gampaha.

As observed by Bandaranayake J in the case of Madduma Bandara V. Assistant Commissioner

Agrarian Services and Others, "the purpose of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution is to give a

9

right to an aggrieved party to have recourse to Provincial High Court instead of having to seek relief

from the Court of Appeal in Colombo"

Even though the Petitioner to the present application has decided to come before the Court of Appeal

to use its concurrent jurisdiction, with regard to the present application, we are of the view that it is

expedient to hear and determine this case in the Provincial High Court of Gampaha rather than in this

court.

Therefore we have decided to transfer the present application to the Provincial High Court of

Gampaha to hear and determine this case.

Objection overruled, Application is transferred to the High Court of Gampaha.
