RESPONDENTS

Before: Vijith K. Malalgoda PC 1 (PICA)

P. Padman Surasena 1

Counsel: Mahanama De Silva for the Petitioner

Priyantha Nawana SDSG for the 1st & 2nd Respondents

3rd - 11th Respondents are absent and unrepresented.

Argued on: 2016-06-13

Decided on: 2016-08-10

JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The Petitioner in these proceedings seeks an order in the nature of a writ

of Certiorari to .quash the decision marked Y 6 in which th~ 1st Respondent

had ordered the Petitioner to reinstate with back wages, 9 workmen of the

Petitioner company. 3rd - 11th Respondents are the said 9 workmen.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner advanced two arguments.

They are:

1. that for the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special

Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971 (as amended) to apply, there must be

a termination of service in terms of section 6 of the Act,

-

II.

5

that there is no evidence to establish a termination of service of the

3rd - 11th Respondents by the Petitioner.

In order to evaluate the above arguments, it would be necessary to refer

to the sequence of events occurred at the inquiry.

The letter marked Y 1 has been sent to the Petitioner by the Assistant

Commissioner of Labour informing him that a formal inquiry with regard to

the complaints made by the 3rd - 11th Respondents would be held at 10.00

AM on 2013-11-08. The said notice has clearly explained to the Petitioner

that he is afforded the opportunity of placing whatever the material on his

behalf at the said inquiry.

1 st and 2nd Respondents have produced a copy of the proceedings

pertaining to this inquiry marked 1 R 1. It could be seen that a

Superintendent of the estate, S M Sumedha Silva had been present on

2013-11-08 at the said inquiry. He had made a statement before the

inquiring officer. Even in that statement he is not specific whether the

services of the 3rd - 11th Respondents have been terminated by the

Petitioner or not. He has just narrated an incident. It is also not clear from

that statement whether he indeed represented the Petitioner. This aspect

assumes some importance because the Petitioner is a company.

On behalf of the 3rd -11th Respondents, 8th Respondent and the ih

Respondent have made statements before the inquiring officer. 7th and 8th

Respondents in their statements, have spoken to the incident pertaining to

the termination of their services by the Petitioner.

6

It is pertinent to note that the said Superintendent of estate is on record as

saying before the inquiring officer that he is not prepared to take the 3rd -

11 th Respondents back to their employments.

It has to be observed that at no stage the said Superintendent of estate S

M Sumedha Silva has taken up a specific position that the Petitioner did not

terminate the services of 3rd _11th Respondents.

Further when the 2nd Respondent attempted to settle this dispute between

the Petitoner and the 3rd -11th Respondents, said Superintendant of the

estate who presumably represented the Petitioner had categorically stated

that the Petitioner is not ready to give them, their jobs back.

It could be seen from the record of the proceedings of the inquiry held on

2013-11-08 that the inquiring officer was not satisfied whether in fact said

Superintendent of estate had represented the Petitioner. The inquiring

officer has therefore informed him to produce a letter of authority from the

Petitioner company.

Inquiring officer at the end of the proceedings of that day has also

explained to both parties regarding the provisions of the Termination of

Employment (special provisions) /~ct and had explained that the parties

have the opportunity of submitting any materia! they wish either orally or

in written form, for consideration by the inquiring officer.

3rd - 11th Respondents at that time had stated to the inquiring officer that

they would take steps to submit affidavits for the consideration by the

7

inquiring officer. The inquiring officer at the end of the proceedings of that

day had fixed the further inquiry for 2013-11-22.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General brought to the notice of this court,

the documents marked Y 3, Y 4, Y 5 to establish that the Petitioner had

not thereafter partiCipated in the inquiry.

Inquiring officer by the document dated 2013-11-22 marked Y 3 has

informed the Petitioner

I. that the Petitioner had not partiCipated in the inquiry on 2013-11-22

II. that he has not provided any excuse for his absence

III. that the 3rd - 11th Respondents had submitted affidavits for the

consideration of the inquiring officer

IV. to submit his material on or before 2013-12-11

V. that further inquiry with regard to this matter would be held on 2013-

12-11 at 10.00 AM.

VI. that he is notified to partiCipate in that inquiry

VII. that the inquiring officer would have to make a finding on the

available material, in case he does not take steps either to participate

in the inquiry or to adduce any material for the inquiry

VIII. to produce a letter of authority from a Director of the company.

It is pertinent to note that the copies of the affidavits submitted by the 3rd -

11 th Respondents have also been annexed to this letter and sent to the

Petitioner by the inquiring officer.

In the affidavits filed by the 3rd - 11th Respondents the details pertaining to

their employer, date of their appointment, their designation, date of

8

termination of their service; salary they had received at the time of

termination of service, number of employees under the employer have

been add uced.

The argument advanced by the learned counsel for the Petitioner is that

the material adduced by the 3rd - 11th Respondents before the inquiring

officer is not sufficient to establish that there has been in fact a termination

of services of 3rd - 11th Respondents.

However, perusal of the material produced before this court would clearly

show that if there is any insufficiency of material that insufficiency would

be to establish the claim of the Petitioner that he had at no stage

terminated the services of 3rd - 11th Respondents. Best evidence with

regard to this aspect must come from the Petitioner as the employer.

However, for the reasons best known to him, the Petitioner had not taken

any step to adduce any material before the inquiring officer.

The Petitioner in his petition has not averred the ground upon which he

seeks to quash the decision contained in the document marked Y 6 by a

writ of Certiorari.

Nature of the writ jurisdiction of this court is different from that of its

appellate jurisdiction. At this stage vile cannot and we should not be sitting

in appeal against the impugned decision of the 1st Respondent.

The inquiry that was conducted by tre 1st and 2"d Respondents has been

conducted with due regard to the observance of the rules of natural

justice. There is no procedure laid down in the statute as to how one

should conduct such an inquiry. The second Respondent has adopted a

9

procedure which appear to have been appropriate under the given

circumstances. Learned counsel for the Petitioner did not complain against

the procedure so adopted.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons we see no basis as to

why the decision contained in the document marked Y 6 should be

quashed by a Writ of Certiorari. Therefore we decide to dismiss this

application. No cost is ordered.

Application is dismissed.
