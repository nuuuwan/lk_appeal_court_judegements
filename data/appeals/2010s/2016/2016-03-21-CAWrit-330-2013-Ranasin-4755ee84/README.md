Order

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

Petitioner-Respondent to the present application has come before this court seeking inter alia, a Writ

of Certiorari to quash a decision of the 1st to 5th Respondents to acquire a block of land to the extent

of 33 perches belong to the Petitioner.

Petitioner whilst alleging that the said acquisition was not for a public purpose, submitted that it is for

the purpose of constructing a short-cut road to the 6th Respondent.

This application has originally supported before this court on 18th December 2013 and the

Respondents who came before this court, on 30.01.2014 had moved time until 02.04.2014 to file

objection. In the meantime on 27.03.2014 the two Intervenient-Petitioners have come before this court

and filed papers seeking intervention.

Since the Petitioner-Respondent has objected to the said intervention, the inquiry into the intervention

was fixed, but had gone down since then for several days. When the matter was fixed for the inquiry

on 23.07.2015 the Intervenient-Petitioners was absent and unrepresented and therefore the application

by the Intervenient- Petitioners for intervention was dismissed and the main matter was fixed for

argument for 22.09.2015.

The present application before us is the re-listing application filed by the Intervenient-Petitioner.

Intervention in to the Writ Applications before the Court of Appeal are generally not entertained, in

the absence of specific procedure laid down in the Court of Appeal Appellate Procedure Rules 1990

unless the intervenient parties can satisfy court that the said party have sufficient cause and interest in

the matter in question and is a necessary party to the application before court. This was discussed by

7

the Judges of the Court of Appeal in several cases including Illandar:i Devege Ranasinghe and Others

V. Commissioner General Excise and Yen. Udawaththe Nanda Thero and Others CA /Writ

Application 127/10 (Court of Appeal minutes 11.05.2011) and L.U.P. Jayawardena V. Minister of

Health and Others CA Writ Application 978/2008 (Court of Appeal minutes 21.05.2011).

Under these circumstances, it is the duty of the Intervenient-Petitioners to satisfy court of their

position before this court and the court cannot go behind the intervenient parties and grant relief to

them. It is their duty to be present on all days when the matter is fixed for inquiry.

After the said dismissal, the intervenient-Petitioners have now come before this court and filed

papers', moving the matter to be relisted for inquiry into intervention.

In the absence of any specific provision in the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure Rules) 1990 for

intervention, once again this court wish to re-iterate that this court is reluctant to make order for

relisting, unless the party moving for relisting, establishes the bona-fides from their part with sufficient

material within reasonable time.

The position taken up by the Intervenient-Petitioners before this court was that the junior counsel who

appeared before this court on 28/4 had noted down the date of inquiry as 27/7 instead 24/7 and

therefore the counsel could not appear in the Court of Appeal 24/7. In support of this position the

Intervenient-Petitioners has filed along with their Petition Copies of the diaries of the two counsel.

However when going through the documents filed before this court, I observe that the Intervenient-

Petitioners has taken nearly 1 Yz months to come before this court. If the date is incorrectly recorded as

27/7, by 27/7 the parties should take steps to ascertain what has happened to the case and take

appropriate steps without waiting for nearly 1 Yz months. This conduct of the Intervenient-Petitioners

are worst than the mistake already committed. The Intervenient-Petitioners have failed to explain their

delay before this court.

8

The Intervenient-Petitioners have however submitted along with the petition and affidavit, an

additional affidavit from the Junior Counsel who appeared on 28/4 and recorded the date of inquiry as

27/7, along with copies of her diary, her senior's diary and the cover page of the file maintained at the

office of the Instructing Attorney indicating the date as 27/7.

This court further observes that the Intervenient party which had come before this court in March 2014

was represented by counsel since then except on 24.07.2015. When considering all these matters, this

court is not inclined to dismiss the application for relisting by the Intervenient-Petitioners merely for

the unexplained delay of 1 1/2 months and therefore make order relisting the application for

intervention by the Intervenient -Petitioners.
