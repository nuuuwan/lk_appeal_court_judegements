Malinie Gunaratne, J.

The Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant)

filed an Application No. 09/2003 dated 02.06.2003 in the High Court of

Kurunegala seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the Order dated

03.05.2003 ( P 16) issued by the 1st Respondent and a Writ of Mandamus

3

directing the 15t and 2nd Respondents - Respondents (hereinafter referred to

as the 15t Respondent and the 2nd Respondent) to reinstate the Appellant as

the General Manager of the 2nd Respondent Society.

After filing objections by the Respondents and having considered the

submissions made by both parties, the learned High Court Judge dismissed

the Petition, filed by the Appellant.

Aggrieved by the said Judgment dated 31.03.2005, the Appellant has

preferred this appeal seeking to set aside the Judgment of the learned High

Court Judge.

The facts that have given rise to the instant application are as follows:

The Appellant was the General Manager of the 2nd Respondent. On

28th October 1997, the Appellant was sent on compulsory leave and

thereafter his services were suspended. The Appellant was served with a

charge sheet and he had been subjected to disciplinary action by the 2nd

Respondent. The Appellant was discharged from four of the nine charges

and found guilty of the other five charges. Thereafter his services were

terminated. The Appellant forwarded an appeal to the 15t Respondent

against the said decision of disciplinary action.

The 15t Respondent appointed an inquiring officer, one A.M.P.

Atapattu to hold the inquiry. He conducted the inquiry and submitted a

report. By that report he had recommended that the Appellant be discharged

from five charges that he had been found guilty at the disciplinary inquiry.

Thereafter the 15t Respondent, called the Appellant for a discussion

and he was told that the 15t Respondent was going to overrule the report of

4

the Inquiring Officer. According to the new report the Inquiring Officer has

found the Appellant guilty of the five charges.

The Order is marked as 'P 16' and against that Order the Appellant

sought the reliefs from High Court of Kurunegala. The learned High Court

Judge of Kurunegala dismissed the Petition filed by the Appellant. Being

aggrieved by that Judgment the Appellant has preferred this appeal.

When this case was taken up for argument on 12.11.2015, the learned

Counsel for the Appellant contended that the Order 'P 16' is ultra vires,

unreasonable and arbitrary and had been reached in violation of natural

justice.

The learned Counsel further contended that, after the Appellant was

sent on compulsory leave and thereafter his service suspended, a disciplinary

inquiry was held and after he was found guilty of five charges, his service

was terminated. When the Appellant forwarded an appeal against the said

order, to the 1st Respondent, one A.M.P. Atapattu was appointed to inquire

into the appeal. He conducted the inquiry and recommended that the

Appellant be discharged from the five charges that he had been found guilty

at the disciplinary inquiry. The 1 st Respondent has rejected the report of its

own inquiring officer and reviewed the same sitting as an appeal board. It

has compared the report of the Inquiring Officer with the original

disciplinary report and come to some conclusions without holding an inquiry

and decided to dismiss the appeal forwarded by the Appellant.

It is the stance of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that the Order

(P 16) made by the 1 st Respondent rejecting the appeal is ultra vires,

unreasonable and arbitrary and had been reached in violation of natural

I

Justice. The learned Counsel contended that, by letter P 13 and P 14, the 1 st

Respondent had called the Appellant only for a discussion to reach a

decision with regard to the appeal forwarded by the Appellant without

holding an inquiry. It is the stance of the learned Counsel that, once, the 1 st

Respondent appointed an inquiring officer to conduct an appeal inquiry he

cannot sit as an appeal board over the report of its own appeal inquiring

officer.

It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that in the

absence of any provision in the Regulations, as to how the commission

should act, when they reject the report of their own appeal inquiring officer,

it is necessary to hold an inquiry by themselves or through a new appeal

inquiring officer. The Counsel further contended that the commission had

exceeded its authority when it sat as an appeal board and reviewed the report

of the appeal inquiry officer, it had appointed earlier.

The learned State Counsel argued that the so called report of the

inquiring officer cannot be considered as a recommendation or a decision.

Drawing the attention of the Court to Clause 153 of the Co-operative Service

Commission Regulations, the Counsel further argued, that only the

Commissioner can take a decision and the report of the inquiring officer

does not have any kind of binding power upon the parties and also it cannot

be considered as any kind of a decision. Accordingly, it is the contention of

the learned State Counsel that, only the Commissioner can make a decision

and an inquiring officer is not empowered to make any decision.

The learned State Counsel further contended, therefore that the

Appellant's application for two orders in the nature of Writ of Mandamus

and Writ of Certiorari is misconceived in law and cannot be maintained.

It is relevant to note that it was the 1 st Respondent that had taken the

decision (P 16) and not the Inquiring Officer to reject the appellant's appeal

on the report of the inquiring officer appointed by the 1 st Respondent.

It is the grievance of the Appellant, without holding a fresh inquiry

that the 1st Respondent has accepted the 2nd report of the inquiring officer

and has taken the impugned decision (P 16). Hence, it is the stance of the

learned Counsel for the Appellant that the decision (P 16) is ultra vires,

unreasonable and arbitrary and had been reached in violation of natural

justice.

Professor Wade calls ultra vires "acting beyond one's power of

authority". The general idea behind the term is that a decision or action of a

functionary is said to be ultra vires when that functionary acts outside the

ambit or scope of his authority. Ultra vires doctrine prevents public

authorities from doing anything which the law forbids, or taking any action

for which they have no statutory authority.

It is the stance of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that, although

it is imperative that the 1 st Respondent has to conduct an inquiry either by

itself or through an inquiring officer, without holding an inquiry the 1 st

Respondent had come to some conclusions.

The learned Counsel further contended, that what the 1 st Respondent

had done is, on its own, compared the report with the original disciplinary

inquiry report which had been rejected by the 1 st Respondent, without giving

7

an opportunity to the Appellant to make representations before the 1 s1

Respondent.

At this juncture it is necessary to consider the Clause 150 of the

Cooperative Service Commission Regulations enacted by the Provincial

Council.

When an appeal is filed by an employee, Section 150 provides the

procedure that has to be adopted by the 1 s1 Respondent in determining the

appeal and accordingly there are two options available to the 1 s1 Respondent.

(i) An appeal against termination of service or dismissal from

service or compulsory retirement can be tried by the

Commission and be determined by the Commission.

(ii) If not, can direct an inquiring officer who has been appointed to

hold an inquiry and to submit a report.

On a plain reading of the provisions of Clause 150 of the Regulations,

it is imperative that the Commission has to conduct an inquiry either by

itself or through an inquiring officer. The inquiring officer should submit a

report after the inquiry. Clause 153 of the Regulation states that after taking

into consideration the inquiring officer's report, using its discretion, the 1 st

Respondent should make a decision. It is to be noted that although a sort of

discretion has been given by the legislative provisions, to the 1 s1 Respondent

to take a decision on the report of the inquiring officer, he is bound to

exercise his discretion in the best interest of the public.

In the instant case the inquiring officer had recommended that the

Appellant be discharged from five charges that he had been found guilty.

The 1 s1 Respondent rejected the report of its own inquiring officer and then

went on to review same sitting as an appeal board from the appeal inquiry.

It has compared the report of the inquiring officer with the original

disciplinary report and has come to some conclusions without holding an

mqUIry.

In the written submissions filed in this Court by the Respondents, it is

contended that, in the determination (P 16) of the 1 st Respondent, the facts

have been widely analysed and well considered and according to the facts

and circumstances of the incident, it is apparent that the determination /

decision of the Commission is very accurate and in accordance with the facts

and circumstances of the incident.

The Cooperative Service Commission Regulations does not provide

any provision or has not given any power to the 1 st Respondent to compare

the report of the inquiring officer with the original disciplinary report and

come to a conclusion and determine an appeal. Hence I hold that there is no

merit whatsoever in the submissions made by the learned State Counsel.

The Appellant requires an inquiry to make representation as to why

the original disciplinary inquiry should be or should not be accepted.

Without giving that opportunity the 1 st Respondent has compared the report

on its own with the original disciplinary report and has come to a decision.

Since the Regulations does not allow the 1 st Respondent to sit as an appeal

board and review a report submitted by an inquiring officer, I am of the

view that the 1 st Respondent has exceeded its authority and acted ultra vires.

Also it is against the Natural Justice. Clause 150 requires the 1 st

Respondent to have an inquiry before they arrive at a decision. There is a i If

t

legal requirement to hear the Appellant before the 1 s1 Respondent arrived at

the decision. That has not been done.

An administration body may in a proper case be bound to give a

person who is affected by the decision, an opportunity of making

representations. The Appellant should have been given an opportunity to

present his case before an adverse decision is made against his expectation.

There was an obligation on the 1 s1 Respondent to act fairly. It is an admitted

fact that no inquiry was held by the 1 s1 Respondent before he arrived at the

impugned decision (P 16).

Each party must have the chance to present his version of the facts

and to make his submissions on the relevant rule of law. It is said "qui

aliquid statuerit discerit, hand acquum fecerit" - which means that he who

determines any matter without hearing both sides, though he may have

decided right, has not done justice.

It is observed by Lord Wright in The General Medical Council vs.

Spackman 1943 A.C. 627 "If the principles of natural justice are violated in

respect of any decision it is indeed, immaterial whether the same decision

would have been arrived at in the absence of the departure from the essential

principles of justice. The decision must be declared to be no decision".

It is mentioned in "P 16"

It is relevant to note, that the regulations of Cooperative Service

Commission does not empower the 1 st Respondent to compare the original

disciplinary report with the appeal inquiring officer's report and to arrive at

a decision.

Hence I am of the view that the 1 st Respondent has not acted within

the rules of reason and justice. The Court can interfere where there is

manifest unreasonableness in an administrative act.

According to Atkin L.J. in R VS Electricity Commissioner, a Writ of

Certiorari will be issued-

"Whenever any body of persons having legal authority to determine

questions affecting the rights of subjects and having the duty to act

judicially, act in excess of their legal authority" ....................... "

In Trade Exchange (Ceylon) vs Asian Hotels Corporation Ltd. (1981)

1 S.L.R. 67, it was observed that "an application for prerogative remedy of

writ of certiorari is a proceeding calling some public authority to show legal

justification for its action and to account for exceeding or abusing the

power".

In the above circumstances, I am of the view, that the learned High

Court Judge has failed to consider the right question. On perusal of the

entirety of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge, it is apparent that

the learned High Court Judge has only looked into the question whether the

11

discretion had been used in a lawful manner by the 1 st Respondent when he

arrived at the impugned decision (P 16).

Before the High Court, the Appellant had argued that the said decision

was ultra vires, unreasonable, arbitrary and against the rules of natural

justice. But the learned High Court Judge has dismissed the application,

without considering the right question, simply based on the fact that the 1 st

Respondent had a discretion under Section 153 of the regulations. I am of

the view that the learned High Court Judge has not looked into the question

whether the discretion had been used lawfully or not.

The Appellant had placed sufficient materials to establish that the 1 st

Respondent had acted unlawfully exceeding his powers.

Hence, I am of the view, that the learned High Court Judge was

misdirected in law in refusing to issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the

decision (P 16) of the 1 st Respondent.

In the given circumstances, after considering this appeal on its merits,

this Court comes to the conclusion that the impugned order (P 16) dated

03.05.2003 should be quashed.

Hence I set aside the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated

31.03.2005 and the Order made by the 1 st Respondent, (marked P 16) dated

03.05.2003 is quashed and the application for Writ of Certiorari is allowed

with costs in terms of prayer (b) of the Petition.

This Court has not considered the issuance of a Writ of Mandamus as

prayed for in Paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition, since the 1 st

Respondent has to follow the correct procedure; and to hold an inquiry
