Petitioner to the present application has come before this court seeking inter alia,

2

b) Grant a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus compelling anyone or more

of the Respondents to direct and/or conduct the investigations and institute

criminal prosecutions against any individual, forthwith regarding the matter

complained here-in particular in respect of the complaints reflected in the lists

produced marked P-14(a) and P-14 (b)

The petitioner who claimed to be a 'Jehovah's witness' and a member of the 'Appointed Elders

(Religions Ministers), had complained in his petition, the failure by anyone or more of the

Respondents to initiate and/or continue with effective and meaningful investigations and

commence criminal proceedings against the individuals, who were complicit in several illegal

activities, particularly such attacks on the followers of Jehovah's witnesses and the failure of any

one or more Respondents to take meaningful and effective steps to effectively investigate such

illegal activities, whilst seeking writ of Mandamus compelling as referred to above.

The petitioner has brought before this court series of events took place in several parts in the

country which leads to making complaints and counter complaint, when followers of Jehovah's

witnesses were engaged in preaching and declaring the gods news of the Kingdom of God by

Public Ministry/ house to house teaching.

Even though the Petitioner was not a victim in any of the said incidents he had filed the present

application in public interest and had referred to 11 such incident resulting in various forms of

attacks and/or harassments faced by Jehovah's witnesses.

The Petitioner under paragraph 7, subheading 7.1- 7.11 referred to those incidents in detail and in

paragraph 8 of his petition summarized them under two categories and explains as follows,

"Paragraph 8 for propose of clarity the Petitioner sets out below several lists prepared by

him regarding the incident set out in the preceding sub paragraph;

a) A list prepared by the Petitioner setting out several complaints lodged by the victims,

with the police. The Petitioner states that no effective investigations being conducted

or arrests and/or prosecutions flowing there from and states that the police are

refusing to make any disclosure of the progress of any such investigations;

(Annexed here with marked 14 (a) a document prepared by the Petitioner setting out

such information and such is pleaded and part and parcel of this application)

b) A list prepared by the Petitioner setting out the several instances of malicious

prosecutions instituted against the victims who attempted to seek redress and

protection from the police, where in the police should have acted under the law and in

particular the Police Ordinance and section 56 thereof;

(Annexed herewith marked P-14 (b) is a document prepared by the Petitioner setting

out such information and such is pleaded as part and parcel of this application)

As observed by this court, out of the two lists referred to above, list 14 (a) referred to incidents

where no effective investigations being carried out and list 14 (b) referred instances where

prosecutions are being launched against 'Jehovah's witnesses', maliciously.

Since the Petitioner had refers to several incidents took place in various parts of the country, it is

important to consider as to how the complained incidents have initially commenced. The

4

Petitioner in paragraph 5 and 6 of his petition explains the background to Jehovah's witnesses as

follows;

"Jehovah's witnesses are recognized traditional religion, followed by a considerable

number of Sri Lankans, and they engage, in public, as well as private, to manifest their

religion and observe, practice and teach such religion, similar of other main religions in

Sri Lanka"

"As a follower of his religious faith, one aspect of worship of Jehovah's witnesses is

preaching and declaring the gods news of the Kingdom of God as reflected in the

Bible ... , the Petitioner states that Jehovah's witnesses where ever in the world, engage in

such public ministry/house to house teaching and provide the opportunity to any

individual to learn more about the Bible massage. The Petitioner further state that

Jehovah's witnesses habitually carry several publications/ literature when engaging such

preachinglhouse to house teaching."

Therefore it is an admitted fact that the followers of the Jehovah's witnesses were engaged in

house to house teaching of religion. They further admit that the said followers when engaged in

public ministry/house to house teaching that they distribute publications/ Literature religious

material. During the arguments before us, the Respondents took up the position that there were

villagers who disliked the said conduct of the Jehovah's witnesses, which amount to propagation

of religions and was resisted by the said villagers.

In this regard this court is mindful of the interpretation given to the term "propagation" by the

Supreme Court in the determination 19/2003 in the following manner,

"As referred to earlier, the Constitution does not recognize a fundamental right to

propagate a religion. The expression 'propagate' has a number of meanings, but

according to the shorter Oxford Dictionary it means 'to spread from person, or from place

f

f

5

to place to disseminate, diffuse (a statement, belief, practice etc) in the Supreme Court

Determination No. 2/2001 it was stated that,

"In Sri Lanka the Constitution does not guarantee a fundamental right to 'propagate'

religion as in article 25 (1) of the Indian Constitution. What is guaranteed here to every

citizen is the fundamental right by article 14 (1) (e) to manifest, worship, observe and

practice that citizen's religion or teaching"

As observed by this court majority of the said incidents were reported in areas where the

majority of the populations were non catholic.

In majority of such incidents have ended up in police station where the villagers have brought the

followers of Jehovah's witnesses into police station and making complaints. The Respondents

have further submitted that when complaints were made by the public, there was a duty cast

upon the police to take prompt steps to maintain the peace in the said areas and to investigate

such complaints and if necessary, report the facts before Court. However the Respondents

admitted before this Court that when the said followers of Jehovah's witnesses were brought

before police stations and when their statements were recorded, in some instances the said

followers had complained incident of sexual harassment, etc and in such instances police had

taken steps to investigate those complaints too.

As observed by this court the Respondents have admitted taking following steps with regard to

the complaints reported to police. It is also important to note at this stage, that the police

investigations referred to above have been commenced not by the complaints made by the

followers of Jehovah's witnesses but by the complaints made by the general public of the area

against the conduct of the Jehovah's witnesses.

1. '2R-I ': A report filed in court under the Criminal Procedure Code upon receipt of

a complaint against propagation of religion by Athurugiriya Police Station

6

producing three suspects. This relates to the alleged incident at Athurugiriya

Police area in List' P -14 ( a)' and referred to in paragraph 7.1 of the petition.

11. (a) '2R-2': Weliveriya Police Station investigated into complaints against

propagation of religion and statements were recorded where the followers of

'Jehovah's Witness' admitted such propagation, as borne-out by '2R-2' in relation

to the allegation in paragraph 7.2 of the petition.

(b) 2R-4': Report on an inquiry into a complaint lodged at the police

Headquarters, where it was concluded that the incident had arisen as a result of

propagation of a religion. The report concluded that the parties had agreed that

they had not wanted to proceed further. This relates to the alleged complaint made

at the Police Headquarters and referred to in List' P-14 (b)'.

iii. (a) '2R-4) A report filed in court producing three suspects under the Criminal

Procedure Code by Matara Police Station upon receipt of a complaint against

propagation of religion. This relates to the alleged incident in Matara Police area

in List 'P14 (a)' and referred to in paragraph 7.3 of the petition.

(b) '2R-5': A complaint received from 'Jehovah's witness' Chathusandika by the

Matara Police Station on an alleged sexual assault in the course of her house-to -

house propagation of religion; and, the notes of the investigation ensued thereon.

'2R-5 (a)' is a report filed in Matara Magistrate's Court presenting facts to court

on alleged sexual assault.

IV. '2R-6'and '2R-6 (a)': Katunayake Police Station, upon receipt of the complaint,

investigated and the matter was referred for mediation as borne-out by '2R-6'. On

7

receiving a Certificate of Non-settlement, a report was filed III court for

prosecution as supported by '2R-6 (a)'.

v. Complaints received by Galagedara and Mawathagama Police Stations while the

followers of 'Jehovah's witnesses' were propagating religion were inquired into

by police. As the matters were amicably settled among the disputant parties, there

was no need for criminal prosecution as affirmed to by the 2nd Respondent in

terms of paragraph 11 of his affidavit.

Whilst submitting the steps taken by the Respondents with regard to the complaints received by

the respective police stations, Respondents have argued that the Court of Appeal cannot grant a

Writ of Mandamus in these instances when public functionary has already taken steps acting

within the powers vested on them by the respective statutes.

As observed by this court, the relief the petitioner is seeking from this court is limited to "any

one or more Respondent to direct and/or conduct the investigations and institute criminal

prosecutions against any individual forthwith regarding the matters complained here in particular

in respect of the complaints reflected in the lists produced marked 14 (a) and 14 (b)."

However as revealed above, the 1st complaint with regard to the matters referred to in the lists 14

(a) and 14 (b) have not been received by the follower of the Jehovah's witnesses but from the

General Public of the areas and the officers of the respective police stations after considering the

material revealed during their investigation has taken steps to initiate action against the persons

responsible for the said complaints.

In this regard we observe, that out of the two lists produced by the petitioner, the instances the

Petitioner has referred to in list 14 (b) where he alleges that the Respondents have maliciously

filed plaints in the Magistrate's Court, are also connected to paragraphs 7.1 and 7.3 of his

Petition having corresponding entries in the list 14 (a).

8

It is also observed by this court that some of the matters (referred to in paragraph 7.2, 7.4 and

7.9) have been settled between the parties. In these circumstances it is clear from the material

placed before us by both parties that the police, having received the complaints against the

followers of the Jehovah's witnesses with regard to their conduct and after having conducted

investigation, where ever it appeared to them in their judgment reached decisions, either to file

prosecutions or to mediate or settle the matters between the parties. The said actions have taken

by the police where ever it appeared to them in their judgment as the best course of action in the

discharge of their discretion.

In the said circumstances it is observed by this court,

a) That the functions of the officers of the respective police stations are not ministerial

in its nature

b) The decisions referred to above have been taken by the said officers, wherever it

appeared to them in their judgment as the best course of action

Availability of a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus in the said circumstances were

discussed by M.R. Mallick and B.P Benerjee as follows;

"Generally Mandamus will lie to compel performance of duties, purely ministerial in

nature and so clear and specific that no element of discretion is left in their performance,

but Mandamus will not lie to all acts or duties necessarily calling for the exercise of

judgment and discretion on the part of the officer or authority [Shiv Shankar Dal Mills

v. State of Haryana AIR 1980 SCI037]. However in case where the authority has to

exercise its discretion the court cannot command it to perform the duty, but Mandamus

will set it in motion and command it to act by using its discretion but a writ court will

not interfere in any manner with the exercise of such discretion or control or dictate

9

the judgment or decision which shall be reached. (Emphasis added) Writs Law and

Practice M.R. Mallick 2nd Edition at page 492.

"But most important principle to be observed III the exercise of the jurisdiction by

Mandamus and which lies at the very foundation of the entire system of rules and

principles regulating the use of this extraordinary remedy is that which fixes the

distinction between the duties of mandatory nature and those which are discretionary in

character involving the exercise of some degree of judgment on the part of the office

or body against whom Mandamus is sought. Generally, Mandamus will lie to compel

performance of duties purely ministerial in their nature and so clear and specific and no

element of discretion is left in their performance but Mandamus will not lie to all acts or

duties necessary calling for the exercise of judgment and discretion on the part of the

officer or body at whose hands their performance is required. In other words when

authorities are vested with discretionary power as to the performance of any duty

required to be done by them, or when performing an official action they are

required to use some degree or judgment and/or discretion." (Emphasis added) Writ

Remedies B.P. Benerjee 4th Edition at page 172

It is further observed by this court that in his prayer the Petitioner has averred, to grant a Writ of

Mandamus ... . .investigate and institute criminal prosecutions ...... reflected in the list produced

marked 14 (a) and 14 (b).

According to the Petitioner, the list referred to as 14 (b) consist of incidents of malicious

prosecutions filed by the Respondents.

In the said circumstances I observed that in the absence of a proper mandate to quash the

decision to prosecute the said Jehovah's witnesses, this court will not be able to grant such relief

to the Petitioner.

In the said circumstances this court is not infavour of granting any relief to the Petitioner in the

nature of Writ of Mandamus as prayed by the petitioner since the Petitioner has failed to

discharge his burden of satisfying this court.

Application is accordingly dismissed. However this court will not make order with regard to

cost.
