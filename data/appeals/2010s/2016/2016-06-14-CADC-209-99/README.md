ARGUED ON: 16.03.2016

DECIDED ON: 10.06.2016

Gaffoor J.,

The Plaintiff has filed this action for a declaration of title to the land

morefully described in the schedule to the Plaint and for ejectment of the

Defendants therefrom and for damages. The details of the devolution of title is

given by the Plaintiff in her amended Plaint dated 13.12.1984.

According to the Plaintiff's pedigree, the subject matter of the action

comprising of 3 lots, bearing Nos. 449, 450 and 45, which were originally

belonged to the State and later was granted to three persons, namely, Hitihamy

Mudiyanselage Kuma, Hitihamy Mudiyanselage Banda and Hitihamy

Mudiyanselage Ranmenika respectively ( P1).

The said H.M. Kuma (owner of Lot 449) and her 5 children sold and

transferred their rights together with H. M. Banda (owner of Lot 450 also

transferred his rights) by Deed No. 26439 dated 18.10.1967 to the Plaintiff.

Ranmenika who was entitled to Lot 451 alleged to have transferred her lot also

to the Plaintiff by deed No. 433 dated 10.12.1972 and thus the Plaintiff has

3

become entitled to the entirety of the corpus, which is morefully described in

the schedule to the Plaint. The Plaintiff, further says in her Plaint that in June

1973, the original Defendants unlawfully and forcibly entered into the land in

dispute and have been in possession thereof to the loss and damage of the

Plaintiff and therefore she claimed Rs. 600/- as damages per month with other

relief. The Defendant while denying the averments in the Plaint state in their

amended answer dated 15.01.1981 that the land in dispute belonged to their

mother by Deed No. 4506 dated 9.3.1930 and after her death the Defendants

became entitled to the said land which they are possessing since March 1930

upto now. The Defendants categorically deny that (i) they forcibly entered into

the land in June 1973 and (ii) that deed No. 433 referred to in the Plaint is a

genuine deed and state that the signature appears in the deed is a forgery and

therefore ask for dismissal of the Plaint and the cancellation of Deed No. 433 on

the ground of forgery.

According to the documentary evidence led in this case, the Plaintiff Podi

Nona became entitled to the subject matter of the action by two deeds, namely,

Deed No. 26439 dated 18.10.1967 (P2) and Deed No. 433 dated 10.12.1972 (P3).

Out of these two deeds, she has bought 39 perches (Lots 449 and 450) by P2 and

14 perches by P3, both comprising an extent of 53 perches (or 1 rood and 13

perches). But the schedule to the Plaint speaks of only 39 perches and not 53

perches. Plan No. 194 dated 24.7.1992 made by P.W. Nandasena, Licensed

Surveyor, marked P4, describes Lot 1 as the land in dispute and the extent is

shown as 39 perches. Hence, it is clear that the land in dispute contains only 39

perches and not 53 perches.

Although the Plaintiff became entitled to 39 perches by Lots 449, 450 by

deed P2, yet she became entitled only to 25 perches because according to P1,

the extent of 449 is 12 perches and the extent of 450 is 13 perches. Lot 451 is 14

perches, when this is added to 449 and 450 makes the total extent 39 perches.

As such the land described in the schedule to the Plaint has been correctly

identified by the surveyor as Lot 1 in his Plan marked P4.

The primary allegation against the execution of Deed No.433 (P3) by the

Defendants was that it was not signed by their mother Ranmenika and it was a

forgery. The transferor in this deed is Ranmenika and the transferor has put her

thumb impression (P3 ) on it. The Notary, Malwattage Jayaranee Peiris, in her

evidence says that III do not know the executants but I knew both witnesses

who said they know the executant Ranmenika." This evidence though not

contradicted by the Defendants, does not prove the execution of the Deed No.

437 in terms of Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Since the Notary has said that she did not know the executant Ranmenika

personally. the question arises whether the thumb impression on P3 is that of

Ranmenika or not. If that is not the thumb impression of Ranmenika, then the

execution is in doubt.

In the case of Lawrence Marian vs Soosai Jesuthasan, 54 CLW 31,

Sinnathamby J., said IIA document affecting land is executed before a Notary to

comply with the provisions of the Ordinance No.7 of 1840, and that fact alone

does not make the Notary an attesting witness. To become an attesting witness

a Notary must personally know the executant and be in a position to bear

witness to the fact that the signature on the deed executed before him is the

signature of the executant."

According to the evidence led in this case, Ranmenika who is the

executant in Deed No. 433 was unable to walk and was bed-ridden due to

paralysis. Therefore she could not have gone to the Notary's office to sign the

Deed {P3}. As it is, there is suspicion whether the thumb impression appears in

P3 , can be that of Ranmenika. Hence, Deed No. 433 {P3} cannot be taken to

have been duly executed in terms of section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Deed No. 26437 {P2} has not been proved. When this Deed was produced,

it was produced, it was admitted subject 'subject to proof'. The Plaintiff has not

taken any steps to prove this deed. Therefore this Deed stands not proved, and

thus the Plaintiffs title deeds P2 and P3 are not sufficiently proved to have

passed title to the Plaintiff.

In a rei-vindication action the Plaintiff must have title. Once the Plaintiff

proves his title satisfactorily only the burden will shift on to the Defendant to

prove his possession lawfully. If the Plaintiff fails, his action to be dismissed

however, weak the Defendant's case is to be.

I hold, therefore that the Plaintiff has failed to prove her title and

therefore her action stands dismissed.

It is to be noted that since the lodging of the appeal, the Plaintiff was

absent and not represented though several notices were issued by the registry

of this Court. Taking the position into account I do not want to impose any cost

, . 6

in this case. I allow this appeal and set aside the judgment of the lower court

without costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Wijesundera J.,

I agree.
