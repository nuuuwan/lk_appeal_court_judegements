Decided on: 2016-09-19

JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Learned counsel for the 1st Party Petitioner Appellant and for the 2ndparty

Respondent agreed when this case came up on 2016-06-29 before us, to

rely fUlly on their written submissions. They requ~sted this Court to

pronounce the judgment after considering the written submissions they

had filled and informed this court that they do not intend to make oral

4

submissions. Therefore this judgment would be based on the material that

have been adduced by parties in their pleadings and written submissions.

The Officer in Charge of Police Station, Dankotuwa filed an information in

terms of section 66 (1) (a) in the Magistrate's Court of Marawila reporting

that a dispute between the 1st party Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the Appellant) and the 2nd party Respondent - Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) pertaining to a land had arisen

and that dispute would result in a breach of peace.

Learned Magistrate after inquiry pronounced his order on 2007-06-13

holding that the Respondent was entitled to the possession of the land in

dispute.

The Appellant thereafter made an application for revision to the Provincial

High Court of the North Western Province at Chillaw against the order of

the learned Magistrate.

Journal entries of the High Court record show that the said revision

application has been filed in the High Court of Chillaw on 2007-06-22. The

application was supported on 2007-06-28 and the court had issued notice

on the Respondent and an interim relief staying further proceedings in the

Magistrate's Court.

-5

Thereafter this case had come up in the High Court of Chillaw a number of

times. According to the journal entries it was on 2007-07-26 that the

Respondent had first moved for time to file objections. The Respondent

has tendered his objections on 2008-02-07. Argument has been fixed for

2008-10-02. A motion on behalf of the Appe"ant has been submitted on

2008-09-25 requesting permission of court to file counter objections.

However learned High Court Judge has made no order on that request and

has ordered that the argument be held on 2008-10-02.

On 2008-10-02, which is the date fixed for argument, learned counsel for

the Appellant has requested court to re-fix the argument submitting a copy

of full set of proceedings of the Magistrate's Court case.

It was the submission of the learned counsel for the Appellant before the

learned High Court Judge on 2008-09-25 due to a lapse on the part of the

Attorney-at-Law who appeared on behalf of the Appe"ant an application

had not been made to file counter objections. It was on that basis that the

learned counsel for the Appellant sought permission from the learned High

Court Judge to have the date of argum~nt re-fixed and to file counter

objections. It has to be noted that this application has been made on 2008-

09-25.

Learned High Court Judge having heard submissions of both parties had

rejected the application made by the Appellant and confirmed the date

fixed for argument as 2008-10-02.

Even on the date of argument i.e. on 2008-10-02, learned High Court

Judge had heard submissions of both parties with regard to this issue. It is

appropriate at this juncture to turn to the rules relevant to this issue.

Rule 3 (1) (a)l states as follows:

Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the

powers vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the

Constitution shall be by way of petition, together with an affidavit in

support of the averments therein, and shall be accompanied by the

originals of documents material to such application (or duly certified copies

thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender any

such document, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the

leave of the Court to turnish such documents later. Where a petitIoner fails

to comply with the provisions of this rule the Court may, ex mere mortu or

at the instance of any party, dismiss such application:

lCourt of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990

7

(b) Every application by way of revision or restitutio in intergrum under

Article 138 of the constitution shall be made in like manner together with

copies of the relevant proceedings (including pleadings and documents

produced), in the Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution to

which such application relates ............. "

"

(13) It shall be the duty of the petitioner to take such steps as may be

necessary to ensure the prompt service of notice, and to prosecute his

application with due diligence.

(14) Where the parties fail to comply with the requirements set out in the

preceding rules, the Registrar shall without delay, list such application for

an order of court.

(15) These rules shall also apply, mutatis mutandis, to applications made

to the Court under any provision of law, other than Articles 138, 140 and

141 of the Constitution, subject to any directions as may be given by the

Court in any particular case.

"

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the Appellant,

I. that the Respondent had not moved for the dismissal of the

application and therefore the learned High Court Judge erred in

law to dismiss the entire application of the Appellant,

II. that the learned High Court Judge should have taken the case up

for argument in which event the Appellant could have taken up

the position that she had tendered all the material documents she

relied on for her case, in terms of Rules 3 (1) (a) and 3 (1) (b).

III. that there was no material prejudice caused to the Respondent as

Rule 3 (1) (a) and (b) were substantially complied with even at a

later stage.

Learned counsel for the Appellant has drawn the attention of this court to

the case of Kiriwanthe and another Vs Nawarathne and another2.

This case was decided on then applicable rule 46 of the Supreme Court

Rules of 1978. One has to be milJdful of the fact that this rule3 did not

specifically provide for dismissal for non-observance and therefore has no

direct application to the instant case in which the issue is a question of

2 1990 (2) 5 L R 393

3 Rule 46 of the Supreme Court Rules of 1978.

-I

interpretation of Rule 3(1) (a)4 where it has specifically provided that the

Court may, ex mere mortu or at the instance of any party, dismiss such

application Where a petitioner fails to comply with the provisions of this

rule.

In the case of Shanmugawadivu Vs Kulathilake5 the Supreme court has

held as follows" ....... the new Rules permit an applicant to file documents

later, if he has stated his inability in filing the relevant documents along

with his application, and had taken steps to seek the leave of the Court to

furnish such documents. In such circumstances, the only kind of discretion

that could be exercised by Court is to see whether and how much time

could be permitted for the filing of papers in due course.

The appellant had made no such statements in her petition and the Court

of Appeal had rightly decided that in the absence of the relevant

. . documents, the Court is "unable to exercise its revisionary powers in

respect of the order sought to be revised" by the appellant. ..... "

It has to be noted that the motion that the Appellant had filed on 2008-09-

25 has been filed without notice to the Respondent. It was in that motion

that the Appellant had sought permission of High Court to file counter

objections.

It has been brought to the notice of this court by the Respondent that the

Appellant had filed another revision application also on the same mater

bearing case No. CA (PHC) APN No. 68 / 2013 in the Court of Appeal which

had later been withdrawn.6

It is to be observed that the Appellant had undertaken in the petition? he

filed in the High Court to produce the documents marked P 02 to P 06 no

sooner, he receives them. The Respondent has filed her objections in the

High Court of Chillaw on 2008-02-07 and took up the position therein8 that

the Appellant had failed to submit certified copies of the relevant

documents of the Magistrate's Court. Further the Appellant had failed to

file counter objections also. Thus, the Appellant has neither controverted

the position taken up by the Respondent with regard to non-tendering of

6 Paragraph 16 of the written submissions of the Respondent

7 Paragraph 02, Prayer (el of the Petition and the journal entry dated 2007-06-22

8 Paragraph 02, 05-10, of the objections filed by the Respondent in the High Court

11

certified copies of Magistrate's Court proceedings nor had taken any step to

address that issue .

Further it has to be noted that the motion filed on 2008-09-29 is dated

2007-07-10. It could also be seen that the Appellant had obtained a

certified copy of the Magistrate's Court proceedings on or around 2007-07-

10 and had kept holding on to it until 2008-09-25 which is more than 01

year after filing of the application.

When one reads Rule 03 (1) as a whole, the purpose that these rules are

expected to serve is to avoid unnecessary delays and have the cases

disposed as quickly as possible by keeping the litigating parties within the

rules. Our courts have conSistently held that the compliance of these rules

are mandatory. There is no acceptable reason as to why the Appellant

could not have complied with this rule at the proper time. Date of the

argument is certainly not the time for a defaulting party to make an

application to take steps to furnish material certified copies of the

documents he relies upon, particularly when that matter has been taken up

< as a preliminary objection by the opposing.party. If it is made imperative

for the judges to allow such applications as argued by the Appellant, no

one will need to comply with Rule 03 (1) (a) at the time of filing petition or

,

even thereafter, for he could be sure he would get the opportunity of

tendering such documents on the date of argument when the opposing

party raises it as a preliminary objection. That is certainly not the purpose

that the Rules are expected to serve.

Brown & Co. Ltd. and another Vs. Ratnayake, Arbitrator and others9 is a

case where the dismissal by the Court of Appeal of an application for a Writ

on the basis of a failure on the part of the petitioner in that case to annex

to the petition, certified copies of relevant proceedings with regard to the

particular dispute. The Supreme Court referring to Rule 46 of the Supreme

Court Rules of 1978 which required the petition to be supported by

affidavit and to be accompanied by original or duly certified copies of

documents material to the case in the form of exhibits stated thus " .... So

the fact that the record was subsequent Iv made available to court is not an

excuse for failure to complv with basic requirements of the rule. To hold

otherwise would lead to unfairness. The Rule itself is a commonsense

response to litigants wanting the disturbance of an order or award. It is. no

more than a normal procedural step deemed necessary to inform both

"

court and respondents of the matters of complaint It is consistent with

ordinary practice. One cannot claim a right to proceed to the next step

without compliance with a valid invocation of jurisdiction in the first place.

Such would lead to uncertainty, unreasonableness and oppressive results.

In this sense the rule is mandatory . ... ,dO (emphasis effected in the above

quotation is mine)

It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court has taken this view despite the

fact that this rulell did not specifically provide for dismissal for non-

observance of Rule 46.

Thus it could be seen that the compliance of this rule is mandatory and

that such compliance is necessitated in order to avoid uncertain,

unreasonable and oppressive results.

It has to be noted that this is a case in which the petitioner had obtained

an ex-parte interim relief namely a stay order staying further proceedings

in the Magistrate's court. It was the position of the petitioner that he had

undertaken to furnish the certified copies of the relevant Magistrate's court

lO(lbid) at page 100

f 14

proceedings no sooner he receives them. However the petitioner has

breached this undertaking and that breach would be with impunity, if this

court is to excuse that breach.

Next question that this court should consider is whether the relevant

Magistrate's court proceedings that the petitioner failed to furnish could be

considered material in dealing with this revision application.

The petitioner in his petition complains inter alia,

i. that the learned Magistrate's order is against the material adduced by

the parties.

ii. that his conclusion is erroneous.

iii. that there has been a miscarriage of justice.

In these circumstances it becomes necessary for the court to examine the

relevant court proceedings with the view of evaluating the above

arguments. It is therefore clear that the Magistrate's court proceedings of

this case is very much materia1 for the maintainability of this revision

a ppl ication.

In these circumstances, we see no reason to interfere with the findings of

the learned High Court Judge. Thus we decide that this appeal should

stand dismissed.
