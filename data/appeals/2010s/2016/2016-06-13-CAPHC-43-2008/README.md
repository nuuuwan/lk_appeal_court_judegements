P.R. Walga:rna, J

The Petitioner- Appellant (in short the Appellant) moved

Court to set aside the impugned judgment of the

3

Learned High Court Judge dated 03.04.2008 In the

case bearing No. PHC - Polonnaruwa - 10/2006

The Appellant's application before the Provincial High

Court of Polonnaruwa was as stated below;

That the 1 st Respondent In contravention of the

provlslOns of the Land Development Ordinance had

conveyed the property more fully described In the

schedule, to the 3rd Respondent.

The father of the Appellant and the . 3rd Respondent

became the owner of the said land by the Crown

grant marked as PI.

Their father Ukkubanda and the mother Ranmanike

had cultivated this land SInce 1951.

In the year 1960 said Ukkubanda died and he has

not nominated a successor to the above property, in

terms of Section 72 of the above Act.

Further it IS seen from the documents marked P6

and P7 the Appellant has taken steps to acquIre

his rights to the subject land. Nevertheless at a later

stage he became aware that his brother the 3rd

Respondent had gained title to the land In Issue.

Therefore it IS alleged by the Appellant that the 1st

and 2nd Respondents acted In contraven tion of the

provlslOn 72 of the Land Developmen t Ordinance by

gIvIng all rights to the 3rd Respondent. Further it IS

4

stated that the 3rd Respondent has appointed the 4th

and 5th Respondents as his successors to the subject

land.

The said Section 72 states thus;

"If no successor has been nominated, or if the

nominated successor fails to succeed, or if the

nomination of the successor contravenes the provisions

of this ordinance, the title to the land alienated on a

permit

or her

of the

to a permit holder who at the time of his

death was pay1ng an annual sum by virtue

prOV1SIOns of the subsection (3) . of section 19a

or to the holding of an owner shall, upon the death

of such permit holder or owner without leaving

behind his or her spouse, upon the failure such

spouse to succeed to that land or holding ,<?r . upon

the death of such spouse, devolved as prescribed 1n

rule 1 of the Third Schedule."

In the above setting it 1S stated that the 1st and

the 2nd Respondents do not have any authority to

register the names of the 4th and 5th Respondents

as the successors of the 3 rd Respondent.

In the light of the facts surfaced above it 1S

contended by the Appellant that to have the said

decision of the 1 st Respondent set aside by a .' writ of

Certiorari, and for a writ of Mandamus to compel

the and the Respondent to hold an . . InqUIry

in terms of Section of the above Act and to appoint

5

the Petitioner -Appellant as original owner of the said

land.

The 1 st Respondent by his objections to the above

application of the Appellant had stated the following;

That the

nominated

as his

24.04.1953

Therefore

original permit holder P.G.Ukkubanda has

the 3rd Respondent Pihee1egadara Heenbanda

successor to the permit granted on

for the purpose of develop the land.

it IS said that the 1 st and 2nd

Respondents need not have acted in terms of Section

72 of the said Act.

In proof of the

marked as IVI

said

and

fact

the

the purported permit IS

nomination of the 3rd

Respondent as his successor has been marked as

1 VIA. Further the relevant ledger is marked as IV2.

Therefore it IS apparent that the 3rd Respondent has

been duly nominated by their father Ukkubanda as

the successor to the subject land. Therefore the

Appellant cannot have recourse to the Section 72 of

the said Act, as the original permit holder has

nominated the 3rd Respondent as his successor to

the subject land.

Hence in the above setting this Court is of the VIew

that the Appellant's argunlent IS untenable In law,

and has no locus to maintain this appeal.

6

Accordingly appeal IS dismissed subject to a costs of

Rs.5000j.
