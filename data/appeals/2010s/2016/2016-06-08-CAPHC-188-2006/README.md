The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) instituted proceedings under the Case No. 78441, against the

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant),

in the Magistrate's Court of Matugama under the Provisions of State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as the

said Act). It was filed on 25.10.2004 seeking for an Order from the

Magistrate's Court to eject the Appellant from the land more fully described

in the schedule to the application.

After serving summons the Appellant appeared before the

Magistrate's Court and the learned Magistrate has given the opportunity to

show cause why Writ of Eviction should not be issued against her.

4

The Appellant filed her objections and having considered the

submissions made by both parties the learned Magistrate delivered her Order

on 17.03.2005, ejecting the Appellant from the subject land.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Appellant sought to move in

revision against the said Order by the Revision Application No. 13/05 filed

before the High Court of Kalutara.

The learned High Court Judge of Kalutara, delivering his Judgment on

27.07.2006, affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate and dismissed the

Revision application filed by the Appellant.

The Appellant has preferred this Appeal against the said decision of

the learned High Court Judge, praying for annulling of the said Judgment

and the Order made by the learned Magistrate.

The main ground urged by the Council for the Appellant in this

Appeal is that the findings of the learned High Court Judge with regard to

the defective affidavits, violation of Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal

Rules 1990 and the failure to file a proxy is ex facie misconceived and

therefore, liable to be set aside.

However, it is to be noted, that, the learned High Court Judge has

taken into consideration the main issue of this case too, that is whether the

Order made by the learned Magistrate is correct or not, under the said Act.

The main issue of the case was of the inquiry held in the Magistrate's

Court, under Section 9 of the said Act, whether the Appellant had failed to

produce any valid permit or written authority of the State to support the

occupation 1 possession of a State Land, as the learned Magistrate had

5

decided that the Appellant had failed to do so. The learned High Court

Judge deciding that the Order made by the learned Magistrate is correct,

dismissed the Revision Application filed by the Appellant.

It is significant to note that the learned Counsel for the Appellant has

not addressed to effect of that issue, in the written submissions filed by him

in this Court or when he made oral submissions at the time when this case

was taken up for argument. I am of the view, the reason is that the

Appellant had admitted in her objections (Paragraph 5 of the Affidavit) filed

in the Magistrate's Court, that she has no valid permit or deed issued by the

Land Reform Commission.

Paragraph (5) reads as follows:-

tlae5)o) @@ eJ@ ~~e5)) @) @e)t tS)s@ ~OQ)~~ @e5)) clge)~ eJ

g~o~t1)6@:) @t1)~ ~e5))e) OO~ ~) ~ @eD)63@~ qt6, @) @@@ eJ@ eu~63

e;~@ 8~~e) OO@ e;@6)G)t)e)~~ 63@@~ eDl;t"

It is to be noted, as the Appellant had not established that she is in

possession or occupation the land upon a valid permit or other written

authority of the State, the learned Magistrate had correctly made the Order to

eject the Appellant from the land.

Section 9 of the said Act reads as follows:

9 (1) At such inquiry the person on whom summons under Section 6

has been served shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters

stated in the application under Section 5 except that such person may

establish that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon valid

permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance

6

with any other written law and that such permit or authority is in force

and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid.

(2) It shall not be competent to the Magistrate's Court to call for any

evidence from the competent authority in support of the application

under Section 5.

A simple reading of the Section shows, that the validity of the matters

stated in the application cannot be questioned, challenged or contested

except the matters mentioned in Section 9 (1).

It is relevant to note that, the Sections 9 (1) and 9 (2) of the said Act

takes away from the Magistrate, the power to inquire into the matter stated

in the application under Section 5, except to inquire into the evidence of a

valid permit.

In the context of the case in hand, it is important to consider the

following decided cases, related to the question that arises for determination

in this case.

(i) Farook vs. Gunawardana, Government Agent Ampara (1980) 2

SLR 243;

(ii) Muhandiram vs. Chairman, Janatha Estate Development Board

(1992) 1 SLR 110;

(iii) Nimal Paper Converters (Pvt) Ltd; vs Sri Lanka Ports Authority

and Another;

(iv) Keenigama vs. Dixon C A No. 116/95; CA Mts. 22.02.2002.

(v) Herath Vs. Morgan Engineering Co. S.C. Appeal 214112,

(vi) Ihalapathirana vs. Bulankulama, Director General U.D.A.

(1988) 1 S.L.R. 416.

F or the reasons set out above, I hold that the learned Magistrate's

Order for ejecting the Appellant is correct and as such there is no reason to

set aside the said Order. Therefore, it is not necessary to interfere with the

Judgment of the learned High Court Judge who affirmed the Order of the

learned Magistrate.

Accordingly, no ground exists which justifies the intervention of this

Court to set aside the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 17.03.2005 and

the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 27.07.2006.

F or the above reasons, I hold that there is no merit in this Appeal.

Accordingly, Appeal is dismissed.
