Order

Vijith K. MaJaJgoda PC J

The accused-appellant Jayasinhage Sanjeewa Deepal Jayasinghe was indicted before the High Court of

A vissawella for

01. Causing the death of Malani Rathnayake Subasinghe on 1 i h September 2003 an offence

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code and

02. Committing the offence of Robbery of Jewellary in the course of the same transaction, an

offence punishable under section 383 of the Penal Code.

When the indictment was served on the accused on 21st January 2008 the accused elected to be tried

before a Judge without a Jury and during the said trial the prosecution had relied on the evidence of

several witnesses including the husband of the deceased Don J ayatunge Subasinghe and the

Daughter of the deceased Janitha Madavi Subasinghe.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case, when the accused was explained his rights, he elected to

make a statement from the dock and closed the case without leading any evidence. In his dock

statement having admitted that he was arrested by Mirihana Police, he denied any involvement to the

charges leveled against him. The Learned High Court Judge who had the opportunity of following

the evidence of the entire prosecution and the defence case, had convicted the accused-appellant on

both counts against him and imposed death penalty on the 1st count against him and sentenced 10

years Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000 with a default term of 6 months Simple

Imprisonment on the second count.

Being dissatisfied with the above conviction and the sentence the accused-appellant had preferred

the present appeal before this court.

As observed by this court the prosecution case was totally depend on circumstantial evidence. The

deceased Malani Ratnayake Subasinghe was married to one Gamaralalage Don Jayathunga

Subasinghe who is a medical practitioner having his dispensary at Hanwella.

During the period relevant to this case the deceased and her husband were living in their house in

Ihala Bomiriya Kaduwela and all four children they had from their marriage were living separately.

According to the evidence of witness J ayathunga Subasinghe he had gone to his dispensary as usual

around 8.00 am on 17.09.2003 and returned home for lunch around 2.30-3.00 pm. Around 9.00 am

when he was in the Dispensary the accused came to meet him and asked for Rs. 80/- to buy some

electrical parts from Malwatta Road. The accused is the son of his driver and he used to do odd jobs

at his place and do some repairs for his electrical items. However he has refused to give any money

to him on that day. When he returned home he saw his wife with bleeding from her mouth fallen

between a cupboard and the writing table in the front room.

Even though the witness was a Medical Practitioner he could not remember what he did at that time

but only remember calling his front door neighbour and thereafter informed his daughter about the

incident.

The next witness relied upon by the prosecution was the daughter of the deceased J anitha Madavi

Subasinghe. According to the said witness, after her marriage she was living separately with her

family and the deceased mother and the father were living in their house at Ihala Bomiriya. When

the father went for work, mother was alone at the house. During this period her father had a driver

by the name Wilbert who was working for her father for nearly 8 years. She could also remember

Wilbert accompanying his two children including the accused in the present case in order to clean

their estate at Mathugama.

According to this witness, it was around 5.30 pm she managed to come to the house and at that time

there were several people in the house but the police did not allow her to go to the room where the

body was lying and therefore she could not had a close look of her mother prior to the body was

removed from the house.

However once the funeral was over and when she was cleaning the house she found the rare portion

of an earring worn by her mother, from the room the body was found and immediately thereafter she

1

handed over the same to Navagamuwa Police.

This witness was asked about the Jewellary worn by the deceased at the time of her death, and she

had given detailed answers to the said questions but I will discuss the said evidence separately.

Prosecution had led the evidence of one Dampahalage Don Chandrasiri who had visited the scene of

crime on the request of the husband of the deceased around 3.00 pm on that day. According to him

the witness's house was just opposite the house of the deceased and around 3.00 pm the doctor had

i I

come to his house in an exited manner and requested the witness to come to his house and informed

\

that his wife is fallen near a table with bleeding.

I When he visited the house, he observed the deceased fallen inside the front room and at that time the

deceased's husband had wiped her face with a piece of cloth. Witness had requested the doctor to

inform police but at that time they found that the telephone was disconnected.

Another neighbor who visited the scene after hearing the cries had taken the doctor to the police

station and he remained at the house until the police arrived in 10 minutes, but nobody went inside

the house until the police arrived.

The evidence of Inspector of Police Galappaththi Waduge Lal Ravindra was led in the place of

Inspector Mangala Dehideniya Officer in Charge of Nawagamuwa Police Station who visited the

scene immediately after the first complaint, with a police party consist of IP Ravindra, PS

Abeyrathne, PC Sukumaran, PC Dammika, PC Piyatissa and PC Bandara.

As revealed before the trial IP Mangala Dehideniya who conducted the investigations of this incident

was abroad on an official assignment, and therefore the prosecution has decided to lead the evidence

of IP Ravindra with regard to the investigation carried by IP Dehideniya with his assistance.

This witness had identified the notes made by IP Dehideniya and confirmed that he had the

opportunity of going through them during the investigations.

According to the evidence of witness Ravindra the following observation had been made with regard

to the house. The house was situated at Ihala Bomiriya facing the main Awissawella- Kaduwela

Road and there was a wall six feet in high around the house with a gate to enter the garden.

At the main door they had observed a blood patch for about 1 V2 feet high. The room in which the

body was found, the fan was working and the Television was on. The deceased was wearing a frock

at the time and there was a blood patch of about 2 V2 feet near her body. They could not found any

Jewellary on her body and since they observed a bottle of sprite and a glass, steps were taken to

check for finger prints but that was not successful.

It was further revealed from the evidence that the subsequent investigation with regard to the arrest

of the suspect and the recoveries made thereafter had been done by the Special Investigation Unit of

Mirihana Police Station. This witness further confirmed that the handing over of a part of an earstud

after the funeral by the daughter of the deceased and by that time no arrest was made by any police

station.

According to the evidence of Sub-Inspector of Police Vithanage Nimal Jayantha Perera, he was

attached to the Special Investigation Unit Mirihana during the time relevant to this case. On an

information received by Sgt. Hemantha of his unit, he had gone to Pahathgama with a police party

consist of PS 27829, 27856 PCC 38013, 3984, 21284, 1523 and RPC 9102 on 25.09.2003 in order to

arrest a suspect. Subsequent to the arrest of the suspect namely, Sanjeewa Deepal layasinghe a

statement had been recorded from him, at 11.45 am and some recoveries were made with the help of

his statement. The statement which helped him to make those recoveries to the effect, " .... B3;Q .....

the said statement.

1. One Diamond cut gold chain 22 inches long

2. A pendent in the shape of a flower

3. A pair of earrings -in one of them the rear stud was missing

4. A ring with a white stone

5. A ring with a blue stone

6. Another plain ring

7. A knife with a carved handle

said items were recovered at 12.20 pm and thereafter steps were taken to hand over the suspect

with productions recovered to the Nawagamuwa Police.

As observed in the evidence of witnesses Don layatunga Subasinghe and lanitha Madavi

Subasinghe, both these witnesses had identified the said lewellary as the lewellary worn by the

deceased on that day.

Before the said lewellary was shown to witness Madavi the following questions were put to her by

the prosecution,

From the above answers it is clear that the witness had clearly remembered the Jewellary worn by

her deceased mother and identified them with a clear description. The rear portion of the earring

which she found when cleaning the house was also identified by the witness at the trial.

In addition to the Jewellary recovered on the statement made by the accused, this witness was able to

identify the knife recovered on the statement made by the accused as a knife used by the accused.

Her evidence with regard to this fact reads thus.

8

Page 68,

Page 71,

In the absence of any direct evidence in the case in hand, the case for the prosecution is mainly relied

on the circumstantial evidence placed before court. In this regard the prosecution has mainly relied

on the evidence with regard to the recoveries made on the statement made by the accused. As

9

observed by this court it is necessary for this court to consider the recoveries made with regard to the

Jewellary worn by the deceased at the time of her death comes within the illustration (a) of section

114 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance which permits the court to presume the existence certain

facts reads thus,

"The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened,

regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and

private business in their relation to the facts ofthe particular case."

The existence of the above facts were illustrated under eight important categories and illustration (a)

to the said section which is relevant to the present case reads as follows,

"The court may presume, that a man who is in possession of stolen goods soon after the theft

as either the thief or has received the goods knowing them to be stolen unless he can account

for his possession."

In the case of Cassim V. Uday Mannar (1943) 44 NLR 519 the court cited with approval the

following views of Taylor on evidence. The presumption is not confined to cases of theft but applies

to all crimes even the most Penal.

"Thus on indictment on arson proof of that property which was in the house at the time it was

burnt, was soon afterwards found in the possession of the prisoner has been held to raise a

probable presumption he was present and concerned in offence. A like inference has been

raised in the case of murder accompanied by robbery, in the case of burglary and in the case

of possession of a quantity of counterfeit money."

However in the absence of any direct evidence with regard to the recovery of the items belonging to

the deceased from the custody of the accused, this court will have to analyze the extent to which a

10

recovery made under section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance can be extended in a case of this

nature.

Section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance reads thus,

"Provided that when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information

received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much of

such information whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact

hereby discovered may be proved."

It is observed by our courts as to how an accused person could have acquired the knowledge when

he points out a place where an item is concealed, and identified 3 ways that he could have gain the

relevant knowledge,

a) The accused himself concealed those items

b) The accused saw another person concealing those items

c) A person who had seen another person concealing those items has told the accused

From the evidence led at the trial it was revealed that, specially the Jewellary items were recovered

from the backyard of the house of the accused which is far away from the house of the deceased.

Amongst the recovered Jewellary, there was a part of an ear stud without the rear portion and the

said portion was with the Nawagamuwa Police prior to the recovery of the Jewellary items by the

officers of Mirihana Police Station.

It is further observed by this court that witness Madavi Subasinghe has clearly identified the knife as

a knife used by the accused on previous occasions and this knife was also recovered using the same

statement made by the accused.

However the accused-appellant had failed to offer an acceptable explanation to bring his case within

the position set out in the two positions referred to as (b) and (c) above. In this regard this court is

1

~ I I

J ,

j

11

further convinced from the fact that the arrest and the recoveries referred to above had been made by

completely a deferent unit outside Nawagamuwa Police Station which was involved in probing the

crime committed.

In the said circumstances I would like to follow the views expressed by Amaratunga J III

Ariyasinghe and others V. Attorney General (2004) 2 Sri LR 357 at 387 to the effect that,

"However no explanation came from 15t to the 12th accused to bring their cases within the

positions set out in No.2 and 3 above. In law they are not bound to explain but in certain

circumstances failure to explain damming facts may become in law, presumptive evidence

against them (see Seetin vAG)

And, when concluded that, 'having considered the places where the money was found

concealed, the Learned Trial Judge had held that all accused had possession of G/66 Notes.

The facts of possession and the intention to posses were both established. We agree with the

conclusion of the trial judge.'

In the said case of Ariyasinghe and Others V. Attorney General 2004 (2) SLR page 358

Amaratunga J when referring to the presumption contained in section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance

had further concluded,

"A presumption is an inference which the judges are directed or permitted to draw from

certain state of fact in certain cases and these presumptions are given certain amount of weight in

scale of proof. Some presumptions are conclusive and established. Some presumptions are

presumptions of fact which can be rebutted by facts inconsistent with presumed fact.

11. In order to draw a presumption there must be proof of certain basic facts before court"

111. Bare facts necessary for a court to consider the principle contained in section 114 were

before court.

12

iv. When strong prima facie evidence is tendered against a person, in the absence of a

reasonable explanation prima facie evidence would become presumptive.

In the said circumstances we see no reason to interfere with the findings of the Learned Trial Judge

when she concluded to act under the presumption in section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance

In addition to the strong circumstantial evidence with regard to the recoveries made, this court is

further mindful of the following important items of evidence revealed during the High Court Trial.

According to the evidence of Jayatunga Subasinghe and Janitha Subasinghe it was revealed that the

accused used to attend to odd jobs at their place and he is the eldest son of their driver. In these

circumstances it is clear that he is a person known to the inmates of the deceased family. As

observed by the police, when they visited the house they found an opened sprite bottle and a glass in

the house and they in fact made an attempt to recover finger prints from the said items but were not

successful. However the fact that the police observed the opened sprite bottle and the glass reveals

that somebody known to the deceased had come to the house in the absence of her husband during

that morning for her to offer a soft drink.

It is further observed by this court from the evidence of witness Dampahalage Don Chandrasiri that

the telephone was disconnected when they tried to call the police from the deceased's house. This

fact too confirms that the person who was involved in the murder had a knowledge of the place for

him to disconnect the telephone line.

When these two items of evidence taken separately will not help the prosecution to establish the

prosecution case against the suspect, but taken along with the evidence I have already discussed with

regard to the recoveries made from the accused within few days from the incident, the above

evidence will certainly strengthen the prosecution case.

I I I

13

According to the Medical evidence led at the trial the deceased who was around 64 years of age at

the time of her death had 38 post mortem injures on her body.

As observed by this court majority of these injuries were found on the chest, neck, face and the arms

of the deceased and they are either cut or stub injuries and some of them were defensive injuries

caused when resisting an attack. Out of the said injuries the doctor had bound two fatal injuries

caused to the neck which were necessaraly fatal to the deceased.

The doctor who examined the knife which was recovered from the statement made by the accused-

appellant had given an opinion that it was possible to cause both the cut and stab wounds found on

the body of the deceased using the said weapon. In this regard the doctor had said,

As observed above, the present case is entirely depending on circumstantial evidence. In this regard

the Learned Trial Judge had correctly analyzed the strong circumstantial evidence available in this

II f I

1

f i !

14

case. When analyzing the said evidence this court is mindful of the principles identified in the case

of Don Sunny V. Attorney General (1998) 2 Sri LR 1 to the effect,

1. When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the proved items of

circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point towards the only

inference that the accused committed the offence.

On a consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can be arrived at should

be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2. If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence if an inference can be

drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, then one cannot say that

the charges have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

3. If upon a consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence if the only

inference that can be drown is that the accused committed the offence then they can

be found guilty.

4. The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had the

opportunity of committing the offence, the accused can be found guilty only and only

if the proved items of circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and

inconsistent with their innocence.

When considering the evidence discussed above, it is our considered view that the only irresistible

inference that can be arrived by this court is that the murder of Malani Rathnayake Subasinghe and

robbery of Jewellary worn by the deceased at the time of murder was committed by the accused-

appellant Jayasinhage Sanjeewa Deepal Jayasinghe and not by any other person.

In this regard we observe that the Learned Trial Judge had carefully evaluated each and every

item of circumstantial evidence in the present case before coming to the conclusion. Even though

she has not specifically referred to the principle behind it, this court is mindful of the fact that the

15

trial judge with a trained legal mind was alive and mindful of the relevant principles of law and

has applied them in arriving at his conclusion.

In the case of Dayananda Loku Galappaththi and Eight Others V. The State 2003 (3) Sri LR

362 this position was discussed as follows;

"In a Jury trial an accused is tried by his own peers. Jurors are ordinary laymen. In order

to perform their duties specified in section 232 of the Code, the Trial Judge has to inform

them of their duties. In a trial by a Judge of the High Court without a jury, there is no

provision similar to section 217. There is no requirement similar to section 229 that the I f

\

Trial Judge should lay down the law which he is to be guided. In appeal the Appellate

Judges will consider whether in fact the Trial Judge was alive and mindful of the relevant

~ principle of law and has applied them in arriving at his conclusion. The law takes for

granted that a Judge with a trained Legal mind is well possessed of the principles of law,

he would apply."

For the reason set out above we see no reason to interfere with the findings of the Learned High

Court Judge. We therefore confirm the conviction and sentence imposed on the accused-appellant.

Appeal dismissed, Conviction and Sentence is affirmed.
