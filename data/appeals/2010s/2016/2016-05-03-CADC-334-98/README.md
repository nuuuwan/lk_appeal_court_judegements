DEFENDANT-RESPONDENTS

W.M.M. Malinie Gunaratne, J. and

P.R. Walgama, J.

Ranjan Suwandaratne. for the Plaintiff-Appellant

Nihal Jayamanne, P.C. with Noorani Amarasinghe for the 5th Defendant-Respondent.

Argued on 25.09.2015

Written submissions filed on: 30.11.2015

Decided on 09.02.2016

Malinie Gunaratne, J.

The Plaintiff - Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant)

filed the above-mentioned partition action to partition the land described in

the schedule to the Plaint. The 5th Defendant - Respondent who was the

only contesting Defendant filed statement of claim and sought for dismissal

of the action. After the trial, the learned District Judge dismissed the

Plaintiff s case.

Aggrieved by the said Judgment, the Appellant preferred this Appeal

to this Court seeking to set aside the Judgment of the learned District Court

Judge made on 05.03.1988.

When this case was taken up for argument on 11.01.2012 the

Appellant informed Court that the 1 S\ 2nd, 3rd, 4t\ 9th and 11 th Defendants -

Respondents have expired and that substitution should be effected.

Accordingly, the Appellant was given time to file substitution papers.

The Plaintiff substituted in place of the deceased 1 S\ 2nd, 4th and 11th

Defendant -Respondents but did not take steps on behalf of the 3rd

Defendant - Respondent. As the Appellant had failed to take the necessary

steps to effect the substitution of the 3rd Defendant - Respondent, the Court

made an order on 25.03.2014 abating the Appeal. The Order of the Court of

Appeal was pronounced in the District Court of Homagama on 11.11.2014

I l

and thereafter the Appellant has made the present application on 19.12.2014

to this Court to have the Order for abatement set aside.

The 5th Defendant-Respondent objected to the application and the

matter was fixed for inquiry. When the matter was taken up for Inquiry on

29.05.2015, learned Counsel for the parties made submissions and

subsequently tendered written submissions.

It is the contention of the learned President's Counsel for the 5th

Defendant-Respondent, (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) that when

an order has been made for abatement by the Court of Appeal under the

Supreme Court Rules, the Court of Appeal itself cannot and has no

jurisdiction to set aside its own order. The learned President's Counsel

further contended that the Appellant should have appealed against the

abatement order to the Supreme Court.

However, it is the stance of the learned Counsel for the Appellant, that

in view of Section 403 of the Civil Procedure Code the same Court can set

aside an order for abatement. The learned President's Counsel for the

Respondent argued, that Section 403 must be read in the context in which it

is incorporated to the Civil Procedure Code. He further argued that the

Section 403 comes under Part III of the Civil Procedure Code under the

heading INCIDENTAL PROCEEDINGS (Chapter XXV) and therefore

Section 403 applies to incidental proceedings taken under the Civil

Procedure Code and it is a clear reference to orders of abatement entered by

the District Court, and the District Court alone. However, the stance of the

learned President's Counsel is, that it does not apply to orders of abatement

made by the Court of Appeal.

7

Accordingly, the first question that arises for consideration in this

application is whether when an order has been made for abatement by the

Court of Appeal, the Appellant should appeal to the Supreme Court against

that order or whether the Court of Appeal itself has jurisdiction to set aside

its own order. In the case at hand, firstly, it is relevant to note, that the order

of the Court of Appeal was not a judgment pronounced at the termination of

the hearing of an Appeal, but rather an order on an incidental question,

viz., an application for re-listing. It was held in Jinadasa and Another vs.

Sam Silva and Others (1994) 1 SLR 232 since, there is no legislation

governing the matter, the Court has the power to restore the application to

the list in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction. (Issarsing vs. Udhavdas

and Others AIR 1921 Sind 55,57).

Accordingly, I find myself unable to agree with the submissions made

by the learned President's Counsel for the Respondent. As such I am of the

view that this Court has the power to restore the application to the list in the

exercise of its inherent jurisdiction.

The next question that arises for decision is, if this Court has the

power to order re-listing, under what circumstances should the matter be

reinstated. If sufficient cause for reinstatement has been established, the

Court may have to reinstate the matter.

It is important to note, that the burden of alleging and proving the

existence of facts, rests on the party who seeks reinstatement. It was held in

Jayasooriya vs. Kothalawela (1922) 23 N.L.R. 511, the Court cannot order

the reinstatement of an application it had abated, unless sufficient cause is

! t l!rI II i I I !I l, tt 1!

!! ! i

8

established. It cannot hold that, there is sufficient cause to reinstate the

matter unless the grounds for coming to that conclusion were reasonable.

It is relevant to note, when this case was mentioned on 11.01.2012 to

fix for argument, Counsel for the Appellant informed Court that the 1 S\ 2nd,

3rd, 4th, 9th and 11th Defendant- Respondents have expired and that

substitution should be effected. Even though the Appellant substituted in

place of the deceased 1 S\ 2nd, 4th and 11th Respondents after two years, he

did not take steps on behalf of the deceased 3rd Defendant-Respondent.

On 08.03.2013 the Court directed the Plaintiff to take steps before

30.05.2013 and if not, that the appeal will be abated. When the case was

mentioned on 30.05.2013, as the Plaintiff had not taken steps to substitute

persons in place of the deceased 3rd Defendant-Respondent, again the Court

granted time to take steps until 15.07.2013. On that day also Counsel for the

Appellant moved for further time to file substitution papers and another date

(17.09.2013) was granted for the Appellant to take steps. When the case

was mentioned on 17.09.2013 without mentioning that he has not taken steps

to substitute a person in place of deceased 3 rd Defenandant - Respondent,

the Counsel for the Appellant stated to Court that the matter can be now

fixed for argument and accordingly the Court fixed the matter for argument

on 25.10.2013 for the second time.

On the argument date the Counsel for the Appellant moved to support

a Petition and Affidavit filed on 09.07.2013, which was an application to

substitute in place of the 3rd Defendant-Respondent. It is to be noted, that

application had been filed before the matter was fixed for argument for the

second time. This application was dismissed as the papers were not in order.

9

The Court granted further time finally warning the Appellant to file

the papers before 17.03.2014 and if he does not act with due diligence that

the Appeal will be abated. On 21.03.2014, the learned Judge was absent and

the case was re-fixed to be mentioned on 25.03.2014. On that date, as the

papers were not in order, the application was rejected and the Court made

an order abating the Appeal. It is relevant to note that the Court has been

generous and considerate in allowing so much time to file the necessary

papers for substitution.

Abating the Appeal, this Court has observed that the 3 rd Defendant -

Respondent had died in the year 1985, while this case was pending in the

District Court, and the Appellant being the Plaintiff to this action should

have taken steps to substitute the heirs of the 3rd Defendant-Respondent at

that point of time. Further Court has observed, for nearly 30 years the

Appellant has failed to perform his duty.

Now, I will tum to the contents of the Petition and Affidavit filed by

the Appellant seeking to set aside the order of abatement made by this Court

on 25.03.2014. Paragraph 8 of the Petition states, "after the case record was

sent to the District Court of Homagama, the Appellant found that when the

case record was reconstructed after the destruction of the Homagama

District Court on t h April 1988, a motion dated 9th April 1986, the Petition

and Affidavit also bearing the same date was submitted to Court and sought

to substitute the 1 st Respondent of the said Application, the said Vincent

Boteju to be substituted in place of the deceased 3rd Defendant-Respondent".

It is relevant to note these facts were not mentioned at all before making the

order of abatement. It was held in Jinadasa and Another vs. Sam Silva and

Others (1994) 1 S L R 232, "Belated reflection on irrelevant side issues and

10

matters which are not of decisive importance should be discouraged in the

interests of the expeditious disposal of the work of the Appellate Courts".

Although the Petitioner has stated that he annexes certified copies of

the said Motion, Petition and Affidavit they are only true copies signed by

the Petitioner's Registered Attorney. Be that as it may, on perusal of

document marked X2 (the Petition) it is relevant to note, that the date of the

death of the 3rd Defendant - Respondent is not mentioned. Also, a copy of

the death certificate has not been filed along with the Petition. However, it

is important to note, that the Appellant has not annexed an Order with effect

to the substitution in place of the deceased 3rd Defendant-Respondent made

in the District Court. As such, the Petitioner cannot say that the substitution

on behalf of the deceased 3 rd Defendant -Respondent was made in the

original Court.

It is relevant to note, documents marked Xl, X2 and X3 are photo

copies of pages 83 - 86 of the appeal brief which were available to the

Plaintiff at the time he made the application for substitution in place of the

3 rd Defendant - Respondent and at the time the order for abatement was

made. The Appellant has admitted that he perused, and examined the brief /

original case record after the abatement order was made. Had he perused

the brief before making the order for abatement, he would have found those

documents filed along with the Petition. However, by those documents it

has not been proved that the deceased 3rd Defendant-Respondent has been

substituted.

The Appellant was under a heavy obligation to prosecute his

application with due diligence. However it is important to mention the

11

following observations of Amarasinghe 1. m the case of linadasa and

Another vs. Sam Silva and Another.

"The Petitioners were under no legal obligation to be heard through

lawyers. Yet no doubt after due consideration and deliberation as a matter

of conscious willing and resolution, they decided to place the matter in the

hands of lawyers. The success might have come from their lawyer's

endeavours would have been enjoyed by them. They must, now, with

evenness of mind, take the consequences of the defaults and failure of their

lawyers".

It is important to note, the Counsel would gain full control of the case,

if he retained and instructed. In the case at hand, the discovery of

documents marked X I, X2 and X3 after the abatement order, is nobody's

fault but the Counsel's. Had he perused the briefbefore the abatement order

was made, he would have found those documents filed along with the

Petition. Admittedly, it is the party who suffers when the Counsel do not

discharge their duty properly.

However, reinstatement will not be granted because of the culpable

failure of the Counsel.

The journal entries of this case show, that the Appeal of this case has

been preferred on 19.93.1988 and was not heard till 25.03.2014 and during

that time the case has been postponed on seventeen (17) occasions. Three

(3) of which were to suit the convenience of Court, and all other occasions

for the convenience of the Appellant. This shows that the Appellant has not

shown due diligence to prosecute his Appeal.

12

Provision 34 of the Supreme Court Rules -Part II -General

Provisions, reads as follows:

"Where an appellant or a petitioner who has obtained leave to appeal

fails to show due diligence in taking all necessary steps for the purpose of

prosecuting the appeal or application, the Court may on an application in

that behalf by a respondent, or of its own motion, on such notice to the

parties as it shall think reasonable in the circumstances, declare the appeal or

application to stand dismissed for non-prosecution, and the cost of the

Appeal or application and any security entered into by the appellant shall be

dealt with in such manner as the Court may think fit".

I am of the view, this Court taking the requirements of the due

administration of justice into account, was justified in ordering to abate the

Appeal on 25.03.2014.

Having taken the above facts and circumstances into consideration

this Court is of the view that the Order made on 25.03.2014, should not be

set aside, and accordingly, the application of re-listing is dismissed with

costs ofRs.50,0001-.
