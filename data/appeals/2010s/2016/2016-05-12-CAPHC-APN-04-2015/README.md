Malinie Gunaratne, J.

The Plaintiff - Petitioner has instituted an action bearing No.

HCICivil/l05/131MR in the Commercial High Court of Colombo, seeking

the reliefs set out in the plaint. On 05.11.2014 the learned High Court Judge

delivered his Judgment dismissing the Plaint.

The present Petitioner has filed an appeal against the judgment in the

Supreme Court (as per paragraph 16 of the Petition). Having done that the

Petitioner has filed this revision application in this Court seeking to set aside

the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 05.11.2015.

The High Court has exercised Civil Jurisdiction under the High Court

of the Province (Special Provision) Act No. 10 of 1996. In terms of

Section 5 of the Act No. 10 of 1996 an appeal from an order or judgment of

3

the Commercial High Court shall be made to the Supreme Court. Therefore,

the Court of appeal has no appellate jurisdiction in respect of orders or

judgments of the Commercial High Court.

I have carefully considered the submissions of the learned President's

Counsel. In the course of the submissions, the learned President's Counsel

for the Petitioner contended that, since the final appeal will take a long time

to be listed, the Petitioner filed this application invoking the revisionary

jurisdiction of this Court. He further contended that the Supreme Court is

not vested with the revisionary jurisdiction and the exclusive revisionary

jurisdiction is vested with the Court of Appeal as per Article 138 of the

Constitution.

The learned President's Counsel has completely disregarded the

change made by the legislature by enacting Act No. 10 of 1996 as far as

High Court orders made in the exercise of powers vested in the High Court,

under the Act. No.10 of 1996. By the enactment of Act NolO of 1996, it is

clear that in any civil matter dealt with in the High Court, the appeal lies

only to the Supreme Court.

The right of appeal from judgments / orders of the High Court is dealt

with under Section 5 of the said Act. The said Section 5 reads thus:

"( 1) Any person who is dissatisfied with any judgment pronounced by

a High Court established by Article 154 P of the Constitution, in the exercise

of its jurisdiction under Section 2, in any action proceeding or matter to

which such person is a party may prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court

against such judgment, for any error in fact or in law.

4

(2) Any person who is dissatisfied with any order made by a High

Court established by Article 154 of the Constitution, in the exercise of its

jurisdiction under Section 2, in the course of any action proceeding or matter

to which such person is, or seeks to be a party, may prefer an appeal to the

Supreme Court against such order, for the correction of any error in fact or

in law with the leave of the Supreme Court first had and obtained".

In Australanka Exporters Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Indian Bank 2001 (2) SLR

156, it was held that the appellate jurisdiction in respect of judgments and

orders of the High Court of the Provinces made in the exercise of its civil

jurisdiction was vested exclusively in the Supreme Court.

In Senanayake and Others vs. Kohmen and Others 2002 (3) SLR 381

Justice Amaratunga had made the following observation:

"It is not proper for the Court of Appeal to examine the legality of the

judgment of the Commercial High Court even for the limited purpose of

safeguarding itself that the petitioner is entitled to the relief prayed for. If

the Court of Appeal ventures into such an exercise it is an indirect

usurpation of the exclusive jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by

the legislature".

In the case of Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd. Vs. J.P. Wijewardana

and others 2010 (B.L.R.) 233, it was held that the right of appeal from

judgments / orders of the High Court is vested exclusively in the Supreme

Court and this Court cannot exercise even revisionary powers.

Being aggrieved by the said order, appellants made an application for

special leave to appeal in the Supreme Court. In that case, dismissing the

5

appeal it was held that the judgment of the Court of Appeal is correct in law

as it has held that the exclusive right of appeal from an order or judgment of

the High Court exercising civil jurisdiction is vested with the Supreme

Court. In that case Suresh Chandra J. observed thus: (other two judges

agreeing) " ...... .if revisionary jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal is given

then it would give the party applying for revision in a situation as in the

present case a favourable position by granting an additional opportunity of

review as against a party who comes within a purview of the civil

jurisdiction of the High Court regarding other matters as they will be entitled

only to the right to appeal to the Supreme Court".

" . . . . . . This would give the party in such circumstances two

opportunities of review of the preliminary judgment when the clear intention

of the Legislature is that there should be only an appeal to the Supreme

Court from any judgment or order of the High Court in the exercise of its

Civil Jurisdiction in terms of Sections 5(1) and 5(2)".

This Court is bound by the authorities of the Supreme Court referred

to above. Moreover, there is a clear statutory provision in Act No.10 of

1996.

Therefore, taking into consideration all the facts, relevant authorities

and submissions made in this case, this Court refuses to issue notice on the

Respondents.
