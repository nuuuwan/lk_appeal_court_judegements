Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C., 1 (PICA)

Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner in support of

this application. The Petitioner has come before this Court challenging

a decision of Debt Conciliation Board made in proceedings No.

39392 where the Debt Conciliation Board had concluded that the

deed in question had been a mortgage and not a transfer deed. The

learned Counsel for the petitioner has challenged the said decision by

challenging the valuation report which was produced before the Debt

Conciliation Board marked P3 and submitted that the valuation given in

the said valuation report is 4.6 million rupees His position was that

the said valuation is the valuation as at 2011 and therefore the

members of the Debt Conciliation Board was misdirected themselves

when they considered the said valuation as the valuation as at 2001.

However when gomg through the order made by the Board we

observed that the Board was mindful of the fact that the said valuation

of 4.6 million is not the valuation at 2001 but they were mindful that

the valuation in year 2001 in any event should be more than

Rs. 150,0001= which was the amount appeared in the deed m question.

Under these circumstances we observed that the Debt Conciliation

Board when reaching the decision i.e., the deed which was produced

marked P 1 is not a deed of transfer but a deed of mortgage and

decided to act under Sec 2~) ~and C of the Debt Conciliation Act

~ ." in according to the provisions of the said law. Therefore we see no

merit in the argument placed by the learned Counsel for the petitioner.

Therefore we are not inclined to issue notices in this matter. The

application is dismissed.
