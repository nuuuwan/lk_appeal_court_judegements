P.R. Walgama, J

The instant application lies against the order of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 23.04. 2015, for

refusing the application of the Petitioner to grant

bail, for her son the Accused - Respondent.

The Petitioner IS the mother of the Accused-

Respondent, who IS in remand for the last 2 years

and 10 months.

The Accused - Respondent was indicted for possessIng

and trafficking of 130.28 grams of heroin. The

Accused was arrested on 14.07.2012 by the police,

on the charge of possessing of 600 grams purported

to be heroin.

The Petitioner applied for bail

Accused which was refused by

on behalf of the

the Learned High

Court Judge by the said impugned order on the

basis that no exceptional circumstances has been

established by the Petitioner for the release of the

Accused.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Petitioner has

come by way of revision and urged for the release

of the Accused.

The Counsel for the Respondent has tendered the

Statement of Objections and had stated the following;

That this

exceptional circumstances exist. It IS

by the Counsel for the Respondent that

has failed to aver the exceptional

circumstances as required by law.

Further it IS alleged by the Respondent that the

Petitioner has not come with clean hands as she

has failed to disclosed the fact that the Accused is

facing another similar charge of being In posseSSIOn

of 1500 grams of heroin and being tried In the

Magistrate Court of Maligakanda in the case bearing

No. 68387/12.

Therefore it IS the categorical position of the

Counsel for the Respondent that there do not exist

exceptional circumstances which warrant this Court to

in tervene to set aside the order of Learned High

Court Judge and grant bail to the Accused. It IS

also been noted that the Petitioner has not tendered

a copy of the said impugned order of the Learned

High Court Judge and the medical certificate as a

proof of the terminal decease of the Petitioner.

In addition it said that the trial will be

and the

Petitioner's sickness is no ground for the granting of

bail.

The counsel for the Respondent had adverted to the

case of CARDER .VS. OFFICER IN NARCOTIC

BUREAU SLR-2006 VOL 3 PAGE 74, which was

observed thus;

"orders refusing to grant bail are considered as

final orders against which appeals lie. No appeal was

filed In these cases and no reasons are gIven why

he did not lodge an appeal. The petition was filed

four months and twenty days after the High Court

pronounced its order and no exceptional

circumstances have been mentioned."

"Revision like an appeal IS directed towards the

correction of errors, but it IS supervISOry In nature

or solely the relevancy of gnevances of a party.

Revisionary powers should be exercised where a

miscarriage of justice has occurred due to a

fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only

when a strong case IS made out amounting to a

positive miscarriage of justice" (emphasis added)

In encapsulating the above

the instant application for

reasons as stated below.

it abundantly clear that

bail should fail for the

That the failure on the part of the petitioner to

establish existence of exceptional circumstances to

enable this Court to exerCIse the revlslOnary

jurisdiction. That the Petitioner lacks uberrima fides

as she failed to disclose the fact that there IS a

pending case which the accused is charge with the

similar offence,

That the petitioner has failed to adhered to rule 3

(1) (a) of the Court of Appeal, as per Appellate

Procedure Rules of 1990. In that the Petitioner has

not tendered any document to prove the fact that,

she IS the mother of the accused.

It is also considered vital to consider the out come

of the case of SHIYAM .VS. OFFICER IN CHARGE OF

NARCOTIC BUREAU- (2006) 2- Sri .L.R- 159 which held

thus;

"hence section 3(1) of the Bail Act had no effect

Therefore it is crystal clear that an accused charged

under Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Act, could

be released on bail not In terms of Section 3(1) of

the Bail Act, but only In terms of Section 83 of

the said Act. It IS explicitly stated thus;

"No person suspected or accused of an offence

under section S4(a) or S4(b) of this Ordinance shall

be released on bail, except by High Court In

exceptional circumstances".

Hence for the above compelling reasons this Court

will dismiss the application of the petitioner.

Accordingly application is dismissed without costs.

I agree.
