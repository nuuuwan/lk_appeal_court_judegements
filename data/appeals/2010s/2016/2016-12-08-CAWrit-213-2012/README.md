b) To issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the second nomination that had been registered under Sections 19 and 72 of the land Development Ordinance the Mathugama Land Registry under LD0199/70 on 25th October 2010 and the endorsement.

c) To issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus to direct the 18t Respondent to enforce the first nomination registered as LDO 59/ 11 7 dated 26th January 2006.

under LDO 159/ 11 7 date 26th January 2006 which is marked

However the original permit holder Unduwana Athoralage

Ejinona passed away on 24th October 2010 her death

certificate marked as P4. Prior to her demise she took steps to

cancel the above mentioned 1 st nomination and nominated the

2nd respondent as the sole successor to the said land. The

said nominations was made by the deceased on 20/ 10/2010

four days prior to her demises and said nomination was

registered on 25th October 2010 One day after the death of

the original permit holder.

In this matter petitioner pointed out the nomination of

the 2nd respondent was bad in law as per Section 60 of the

Land Development Ordinance No.19 of 1935 as the 2nd

nomination was registered after the death of the original

permit holder. Therefore it should be analyzed whether the 2nd

nomination to the 2nd respondent was bad in law according to

the land Development Ordinance Section 60.

According to the Section 60 of the Land Development

Ordinance Section 60 " No nomination or cancellation of the

~. I t i I { I I

\

nomination of a successor shall be valid unless the document

(other than a last will ) effecting such nomination or

cancellation is duly registered before the date of the death of

the owner of the holding or the permit holder". In this matter

nomination of the 2nd Respondent as the sole successor to the

said land had been registered on 25th October 2010 a day after

the death of the original permit holder (24/10/2010) and the

2nd nomination was made by the deceased on 20/10/2010.

However it should be noted , whether the 1 st respondent

had submitted the nomination for registration without any

delays or within a reasonable time period.

As above nomination was made by deceased on

20/10/2010 which was a Wednesday followed by the

Thursday 21/10/2010 a working day there after Friday a

poya day (public holiday) and the weekend Saturday and

Sunday namely 23/ 10/2010 and 24/ 10/2010 . Based on this

1st respondent had a reasonable time ( two working Days)

namely 20.10.2010 and 21/10/2010 ( Wednesday and

Thursday) to submit the nomination made by deceased on

20/10/2010 for Registration. Here Section 8(2) of the

Interpretation Ordinance is not applicable hence 20/10/2010

and 21/ 10/2010 are working days and office is opened on

that day.

And also it should be noted the interpretation of

"Registered" in Interpretation Ordinance that " Registered

used with the reference to a document shall mean registered

under the provisions of the law for the time being applicable to

the registration of such document".

Supported in Judicial decision in Madurasinghe Vs.

Madurasinghe SLR 1988 Volume 2, Page No.14 and C.A.

No.408/78 (F) D.C.Gampaha 16946/L.

Therefore in this matter the effective nomination date was

25/10/2010 and which day the nomination to the 2nd

respondent submitted to the Registration. Admittedly the

nomination of 2nd respondent as a sole successor by the said

permit holder Unduwana Athoralage Ejinona has not been

registered before her demise as required by the provisions of

the land Development Ordinance. Therefore in terms of

Section 60 of the Land Development Ordinance there is no

valid nomination made in the said permit.

In this circumstance we issue,

a) Writ of Certiorari to quash the nomination of the 2nd respondent in the LDO 199/70 dated 25th October 2010.

b) Writ of Certiorari to quash the second nomination that had been registered under Sections 90 and 72 of the Land Development Ordinance the Mathugama Land Registry under LDO 199/70 on 25th October 2010 and the endorsement.

c) Writ of Mandamus to direct the 1 st Respondent to enforce the first nomination registered as LDO 59/ 11 7 dated 26th January 2006.

Appeal is allowed.
