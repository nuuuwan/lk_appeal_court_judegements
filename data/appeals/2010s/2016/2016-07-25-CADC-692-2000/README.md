The plaintiff has filed this case on 03.05.1990 against the original

defendant in the District Court of Homagama to set aside or for the

cancellation of a deed of transfer bearing No.6005 dated 18.01.1984

attested by S. Wickreamarachchi, Notary Public. The plaintiffs

position was that he never intended to transfer the land to the plaintiff,

but to give it on lease. The plaintiff avers in his plaint that on a right

the defendant took him to the Notary to execute the deed but the Notary

refused to prepare the deed as it was about 10.0 Clock in the night but

he sign some blank sheets and came. Later he came to know that what

he signed was a deed of transfer and not a lease agreement.

\ The plaintiff also states in his plaint that the amount mentioned in the

said deed No. 6005 is Rs.20,0001= but this lands in extent 2 Acres was

worth about 2 Y2 Lakhs in 1984.

The defendant had filed his answer denying the averments in the plaint

and stating that he had purchased the land for valuable consideration

and prayed for dismissal of the Plaint. The defendant also averred in

the answer that the plaintiffs action is prescribed. After trial the

learned District Judge delivered judgment on 03.10.2000, holding that

the property had been duly transferred to the defendant by the said

deed No.6005 and dismissed the plaintiff action with costs. The

plaintiff has preferred this appeal against this judgment to this Court.

In the written submissions of the plaintiff, the following matters are

taken material points:-

(1). the deed was lease and not a transfer.

The plaintiff h has not adduced any evidence to prove that what he

signed was lease agreement and not a Deed of Transfer. According to

P3, the land in dispute was earlier transferred by the defendant to the

plaintiff and by P4, the plaintiff had re transferred the same land to

the defendant. Both those deeds No.6004 (P3) and No.6005 (P4) had

been extended on 18.01.1984 by the same Notary S. Wickramarachchi .

This Notary has given evidence in this case. He has been called by the

plaintiff. This witness has clearly stated in his evidence in chief to a

suggestion by the plaintiffs counsel "that the plaintiff intended was to

execute a lease agreement and not a transfer deed", it was told to him.

(Page 117-118 of the brief). Under cross-examination, this witness said

that before the attestation of this deed he had explained the deed to the

grantor, grantee and the witnesses. The evidence of this witness is not

contradicted. I am therefore of the opinion that the plaintiff executed

not a lease agreement but a transfer deed and therefore the contention

that P4 was not intended to be a deed of transfer cannot be accepted.

(2) Plea of "non est factum"

This maxim or plea is applicable only in cases where the person

executed the document or deed is unaware that what he sign was not a

5

example of A intends to execute a conditional transfer in favour of B,

but be executes a deed of transfer. Prof. Weeramantry states, " what

must be established the order that such a plea may succeed is not

merely that there was misapprehension in regard to the contents of the

document, but that the misapprehension related to the character and

class of document" See Weeramantry on Law of contract Vol. I, Page

296. In this instant case, if the plaintiffs intention was only to execute

a lease agreement and not a deed of transfer, then his misapprehension

of the character or class of the document must be established by cogent

evidence. The evidence of the Notary Wickremaarachchi is very clear.

He has explained the nature of the deed to the plaintiff, the defendant

and the witness and the Notary categorically denied that he was told

that the plaintiff was intended to execute a lease agreement. In the light

of the evidence I hold that the plea of 'non est factum' is not

applicable to this case since the plaintiff knew very well that he was

executing a deed of transfer. The Notary also denied that the plaintiff

signed some blank papers in the night at his house. The evidence reveals

that on 18 .01.1984 , the deed of transfer had been attested by the

Notary P3 and P4 are those deeds and both these deeds were executed

on the same day. According to the Notary both these deeds were sign at

transferor and in P4 the plaintiff should have signed as the transferor.

In a transfer deed unlike a lease agreement, it is only the transferor

signs and not the transferee. Considering this procedure, the plaintiff

cannot be heard to say that he signed on some blank sheets. If that be

correct, the defendant also must have signed on some blank sheets. On

the contrary , it very clear that the plaintiff has signed the deed after

knowing the nature of the deed P4. I therefore of the view that the pea

of "non est factum': is not applicable to the plaintiff in this case.

(3) Action Prescribed.

The plaintiff says that the deed of transfer P4 had been executed on

18.01.1984 and he had come to know about it in 1986. If this statement

is true, he could have instituted this action immediately thereafter. P6 is

an affidavit filed by the defendant in the Primary Court case No.4919.

This affidavit was signed on 09.01.1987 in which in paragraph 2 the

defendant has stated that on 18.01.1984 by deed No.6005, he has

brought the land for consideration from Wimalasiri, the plaintiff. At

least, in 1986 or in the January 1987, the plaintiff came to know about

the deed No.6005 which he is now seeking to cancel. If the plaintiff says

, I

\

the execution of deed No.6005 as a deed of transfer it is serious matter.

But he has not taken any action to have the deed cancelled in 1986 or in

January 1987. Further, the plaintiff has not established fraud on the

part of the defendant or the Notary. The defendant's contention is that

the plaintiff action is prescribed.

In order to cancel a deed Notarially attested, the action should have

been filed within three years. The deed No.6005 (P4) had been extended

on 18.01.1984 and this action is filed on 03.05.1990. Assuming that the

plaintiff has come to know of the execution of the deed in 1986 or in

January 1987, three years period is lapsed. But according to the

judgment in Ranasinghe Vs. De Silva 78 NLR 500, the period of three

years runs from the date of execution of the deed, Le.18.0 1.1984. If that

be no, the plaintiffs action is prescribed in terms of Section 10 of the

Presumption Ordinance.

(4) Value of the Land.

The plaintiff says that the normal value of the land in 1984 was about 2

r II

accepted as he is not a qualified Valuer. The plaintiff has not proved by

authentitave valuation reports of the value of the land. Further he

cannot says it is laesio enormis because he has not averred laesio

enormis and also not adduced any evidence to prove it.

The doctrine of laesio enormis is applicable only in cases where the

plaintiff was not aware of the real market value of the property that was

transferred by him. In the present case, the plaintiff knew that value of

the land in 1984 it about 2 ~ Lakhs. Hence, he cannot seek remedy on

the basis of laesio enormis in this case.

For the reasons stated above, I hold that the plaintiff has failed to

prove his case. I affirm the judgment of the learned District Judge and

dismiss this appeal with costs.
