Firstly the matter was supported only for notices on the 17.12.2014

and the learned High Court Judge has issued notices on the Respondents

returnable on 22.01.2015. For the interim relief the matter was supported on

the 26th of March 2015. The Respondents objected to the said relief being

granted. However, the learned High Court Judge delivered the Order on 26th

March 2015, granting an interim relief, restraining the Petitioner from

functioning as the Chairman of the Akmeemana Pradashiya Sabha until the

final determination of the Writ Application.

Aggrieved by the said Order, the Petitioner in this application has

sought to set aside and/or vacate the said order of the learned High Court

Judge and a Stay Order staying the operation of the said Order. Further the

Petitioner has sought an interim order staying further proceedings in the said

case until hearing and final determination of this application.

When the matter was taken up for support on the 15th and 29th of June

2015, the Respondent objected to issuing an interim order staying further

proceedings in the Case No. 15/2014 High Court of Galle. Having heard the

submissions of the parties, they agreed to file written submissions to support

their respective positions.

The facts that have given rise to the instant application are as follows:

The Petitioner is the Chairman of Akmeemana Pradeshiya Sabha.

The 1 st Respondent is the Chief Minister of Southern Province and also the

Minister of Local Government of Provincial Council. The powers of

supervision and the administration of the local authorities within the

province had been given to the Minister in charge of Local Government of

the Province. Accordingly, the aforesaid power had been vested with the

7

1 st Respondent in respect of the local authorities within the Southern

Province as the Minister in charge.

The Respondent being a citizen of the country, addressing the 1 st

Respondent a letter dated 06.05.2015 had been sent (at Page 165 of brief

marked as X 15 before the High Court) requesting an inquiry against the

Petitioner regarding misappropriations of public properties and funds of the i h Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha. The 1 st Respondent had not taken any

steps to hold an inquiry upon the allegations made by the Respondent

against the Petitioner.

Thereafter, the Respondent filed the Writ application before the High

Court of Galle seeking a Writ of Mandamus, directing the 1 st Respondent to

commence an inquiry against the Petitioner and suspend him from

functioning as the Chairman of the Akmeemana Pradeshiya Sabha during

the inquiry. An interim relief also had been sought by the Respondent,

restraining the Petitioner from functioning as the Chairman of Akmeemana

Pradashiya Sabha, until the final conclusion of the Writ Application. The

learned High Court Judge granted the interim relief as prayed for by the

Respondent. Aggrieved by the said Order the Petitioner filed this revision

application.

At this stage, this Court is only considering the issue of an interim

order, as prayed for in the Petition. It is settled law that a Stay Order is an

incidental measure pending disposal of the main matter before the Court. In

Billimoria vs. Minister of Lands and Land Development and Mahaweli

Development and two others, (1978 - 1979 - 1980) 1 SLR 11, the Supreme

Court observed that the Court had to decide whether Writ could issue or not,

..

8

and this could not be decided without notice being first issued on the

Respondents affording them an opportunity of being heard. All this would

have taken considerable time. In the interest of justice, therefore, require

that a Stay Order be made as an interim measure. It would not be correct to

judge such orders in the same strict manner as a final order. The interim

orders, by their very nature, must depend a great deal on a judge's opinion as

to the necessity for interim action.

In Duwaratchi and another vs. Vincent and others (1984 2 SLR 94),

the Court laid down the principles on which an interim order could be

issued. It held, an interim stay order in a writ application is an incidental

order made in the exercise of the inherent or implied power of the Court.

The Court should be guided by the following principles:

1. Will a final order be rendered nugatory if the Petitioner IS

successful?

2. Where does the balance of convenience lie?

3. Will irreparable or irremediable mischief or injury be caused to

either party?

The rationale of the judgment in Biliomoria vs Minister of Lands and

Land Development and Mahaweli Development and two others, (1978 -

1979 - 1980) 1 SLR 11, and Duwaratchi and another vs. Vincent and

others (1984) 2 SLR 94, is that in considering the question of interim order

the Court must bear in mind that an interim order is made in the exercise of

inherent or implied power of Court, in circumstances where the final order

is, if the Petitioner is successful, be rendered nugatory and the aggrieved

party will be left holding a decree worthless for all purposes.

9

In the light of the above principle, having considered the submissions

made by both parties, this Court issues an interim relief staying further

proceedings until hearing and final determination of this application as

prayed for in Paragraph (4) of the prayer in the Petition.
