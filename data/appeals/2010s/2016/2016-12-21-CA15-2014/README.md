In this appeal the Accused -Appellant has called In

question the legal acceptability of the judgment passed

by the Learned High Court Judge on 5th March 2014

by which Judgement death sentence has been

pronounced.

It IS against the said conviction and sentence the

Accused -Appellant has preferred the instant appeal to

this court.

the TV at about 7.30 at night. The Accused - Appellant

1S a known party who was living 1n the same

vicinity. The son gave evidence 1n the Magisterial

Inquiry and Non Summary Inquiry to the effect that

the Poddeaiya killed the farther(the deceased). There is

no doubt as to the identity of the Accused - Appellant

as it was not a fleeting glance that the only eye

witness identified the Accused - Appellant. Besides it 1S

vital to note that soon after the incident the wife

who was at a another house close to the deceased

had heard the son cry1ng had come home, and to

her surprise has seen the deceased seated on a chair

with bleeding 1nJunes from the neck. When she

en tered the house the son has said that the accused

stabbed the father, more fully soon after the incident

when investigating officer came to the place of

incident the child has promptly stated that the

accused cut the father's neck. But it is observed from

the proceedings that the investigating officer has failed

to record a statemer~t from the said witness. (the son)

The failure on the part of the investigating officer to

have recorded the statement of the said witness

according to the counsel for the Accused - Appellant

was a fatal irregularity and inimical to the procedure

laid down in Section 11 O( 1) of the Criminal Procedure

Code which states thus;

Section 110(1)

" Any police officer or inquirer making an investigation

under this chapter may examine orally any person

supposed to be acquainted with the facts and

circumstances of the case, and shall reduced into

writing any statement made by the person so

examined, but any oath or affirmation shall not be

administer to any such person ........... "

Therefore it IS contended by the counsel for the

Accused -Appellant , that although the witness had

made a statemen t the police officer has not recorded

the same.

Hence it IS contended

Accused- Appellant, that In

by the counsel for the

the above setting the Police

Officer IS

said that

not entitled to proceed with criminal

without recording statements. Therefore it is

the evidence of the sole eye witness

statement has not been recorded such evidence should

not be taken In to account in deciding the case.

Further it was the

that he

the Counsel

prosecution witness due to an enmity arose between

them due to a land dispute. But it IS salient to

note that a child of above tender age did not know

of such dispute but knew who the assailant was.

It 1S observed from the submissions of the counsel

for the Accused- Appellant that the defence 1S purely

planked on the ground that the failure on the part

of the investigating officer to comply with section 110

(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code therefore the police

would have not proceeded to investigate the cnme.

The short point for consideration revolves on a narrow

compass, which 1S explicitly stated above. Therefore it

was incumbent on the trial judge be convinced of the

testimonial trustworthIness of the boy of tender age. It

was the op1nlOn of the Learned High Court Judge

that the police would have not recorded the

statement of the boy as he was too tender for the

said purpose. Nevertheless he has made a statement

1n the Magisterial Inquiry as to how his father came

about his death. In addition he gave evidence 1n the

non summery inquiry and was subjected to cross-

examination too, without a single contradiction. Further

the Leaned High Court Judge was also convinced of

the fact that immediately after the incident the boy

has stated that the Accused cut his father's neck

and same was stated to the in vestigating officer.

Therefore when there 1S cogent evidence against the

Accused- Appellant for committing the murder of one

Chandrapala the deceased, the mere fact that the

statement of witness No.2 was not taken down 1n

writing 1S not a fatal procedural irregularity as alleged

by the Counsel for the Accused- Appellant.

5

In the said back drop this Court is of the View that

the position of the Accused- Appellant and ground of

Appeal raised by the Counsel for the Accused-

Appellant IS untenable as no material prejudice has

been caused to the Accused- Appellant and it is worthy

to mention that the Learned High Court Judge has

arrived at the above conclusion in the correct

perspective, and as such we see no reason to

interfere with the same. Hence the Appeal should stand

dismissed.

Appeal is dismissed accordingly.
