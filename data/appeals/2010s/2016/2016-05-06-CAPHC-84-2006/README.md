Section 66(1)(a) of the Primary

No. 44 of 1979, 1n the

Magistrate Court of Elpitiya, 1n the CASE BEARING

No. 3508, of a land dispute, which 1S likely to occur

or a threat to the breach of the peace.

As per information filed by the Police the following

facts had emerged;

According to the complaint made by the 1st party

Respondent, the 2nd Party Respondent had planted tea

1n the estate belonging to the 1st party Respondent's

As per complaint made by the Su perin tenden t of the

Respondent had on 25.05.2002 planted some king

coconut trees and on 16.06.2002 had planted tea

plants 1n the land belonging to the above estate.

It is the contention of the 2nd party Respondent that

he 1S entitled to the paddy field and had been

enJOY1ng the thrashing floor, and he planted coconut

an year ago.

The Police had also filed the observation notes which

has not been challenged by the 2nd Party Respondent.

trees and 700 tea plants had been planted by the

2nd Respondent just a week ago pnor to the alleged

dispute.

Therefore the Learned Magistrate was of the Vlew that

there had not been a permanent cultivation as

claimed by the 2nd party Respondent, and had

disbelieved his verSIOn.

In the above setting the Learned Magistrate has arrived

at the conclusion that alleged plan tation was effected

just before the complaint made by the 1 st Party

Respondent. Therefore it was the opInIon of the

Magistrate that two months pnor to the information

filed In Court it was the 1 st Party - Respondent who

was In possessIOn of the disputed land and had

Being aggrieved by the said order the 2nd party

Respondent went by way of revision to the High Court

of Balapitiya to have the said order of the Learned

Magistrate set aside.

In the Revision application as stated above the 2nd

party Respondent had stated the following;

That the said impugned order is contrary to law and

it is ill-considered order, as the Learned Magistrate has

failed to consider many important facts, documents

The Learned High Court has adverted to the following

facts.

That the complaint referred to was made by the 1st

Party - Respondent to the effect that the 2nd Party

Respondent had forcibly entered the disputed land and

evicted the watcher.

The Learned High Court Judge In dealing with the

evidence that surfaced had noted the fact that the

police officer in his report had failed to m~nt1on the

age of the three king coconut plants. Further the

Learned High Court Judge has arrived at the

conclusion that the 2nd Party Respondent had effected

the tea plantation with good faith, and as such he

has the right to possess the said disputed land.

Magistrate, and allowed the application of the 2nd

Being aggrieved by the said impugned order of the

Learned High Court Judge the 1st Party -Respondent

has appealed to this Court to have the said order

set aside or vacate.

It is the contention of the 1st Party Respondent that

the disputed land IS a portion of a larger land

belonging to Ketandola State Plantation, Elpitiya,

managed by Elpitiya Plantation Ltd.

The land In disputed IS depicted as lot 1 In plan

No. 26/2001 dated 28.5.2002, and IS marked as P10.

and it IS categorically stated that the said plan has

not shown any portion of the Respondent's land

abutting the land of the Appellant.

Further it is the stance of the 1st Respondent that

the 2nd Party Respondent had encroached the portion

of the land in dispute which belongs the Ketandola

Estate, and had used as his threshing floor.

When reviewed the impugned order of the Learned

High Court Judge it is patently clear that the facts

of this case has not been evaluated In the correct

perspective and should be set as-irle acrocrrll ..... rrl .. r ... "'" """ .IL "'-'L .&..a.r::;, .J

In the above setting I am of the view that the order

of the Learned High Court Judge should be set aside

and should the order of the Learned Magistrate

should be affirmed.

Hence the appeal IS accordingly allowed, I order no

costs.

Registrar of this court shall communicate this order to

the Learned Magistrate of Elpitiya.
