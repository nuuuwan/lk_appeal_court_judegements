JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The Petitioner is a company engaged in designing and manufacturing

woven and printed labels for direct and indirect export. In order to carry

out its business activities it has established a factory building in the

property bearing assessment No. 17 Condrad Premathiratne Mawatha,

Seeduwa. The Petitioner company is also a company engaged in an

enterprise which the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) has approved.

The Petitioner has paid all rates as prescribed by the 1st Respondent

(Urban Council, Katunayake - Seeduwa) from the year 2005 till the year

2013.During this period the 1st Respondent had assessed the annual value

of the said property to be Rs. 31~,570.00 Thus the amount of tax payable

by the Petitioner per quarter was Rs. 11,833.88 Copies of these notices of

assessment for the years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 have been marked and

produced as P 07(a), P 9(a), P lO(a) while the receipts relating to those

payments have been marked and produced as P 07(b), P 08(b) and P

lOeb). It is the complaint made by the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent

j i i

f I I

has assessed this property for the year 2014 to be of annual value of Rs.

6459868.00 (20 times the annual value of the previous year) to make the

amount of tax payable per quarter by the Petitioner to be Rs. 193796.04

(over 16 times the tax payable in the year 2013). This notice of

assessment for the year 2014 has been marked and produced as P 12.

Upon objection raised by the Petitioner against this move, the 2nd

Respondent who is the secretary of the Katunayake - Seeduwa Urban

Council had held an inquiry.

Subsequent to the said inquiry the 2nd Respondent by letter marked and

produced as P 18 had informed the petitioner that the annual value of the

property had been amended to be Rs. 5580865.00 and that the quarterly

tax was assessed to be Rs. 167425.95

It was the submission of the petitioner that this annual value of the

premises was still almost 18 times the figure of year 2013.

The Petitioner had re-agitated this by the letter marked and produced as P

19.

The chairman of the 1st Respondent Council, responding to this objection of

the Petitioner has addressed the letter marked and produced as P 20 to

the chief valuer of the valuation depar.tment who is the 4th Respondent.

In the meantime the petitioner had addressed letters on the same matter

to the 3rd Respondent who is the regional valuer. The 3rd Respondent,

replying to these letters had stated that the impugned assessment will not

be changed.

The 2nd Respondent by letter dated 2015-06-25 had requested the

Petitioner to attend an inquiry pertaining to his objection for the year 2015.

The inquiry was to be held on 2015-07-09. This letter has been marked

and produced as P 28.

Thereafter the petitioner has received a seizure notice marked and

produced as P 29.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that the

decisions to increase the annual value of the said property and the

resultant rates of taxation as well as the seizure notice are not based upon

bona fide due and proper exercise of powers by the 1st Respondent council

vested in it by the Ordinance, and that no valid or conscionable reason has

been given. He further submitted that therefore these determinations and

actions are ultra vires, arbitrary and therefore illegal.

The Urban Council is vested with powers and duties including the power to

impose rates and taxes, by virtue of Urban Councils Ordinance, No. 61 of

1939 as amended. Portions of the relevant sections of the said Act are as

follows.

Section 160 (1)

"The Urban Council of a town may, subject to such limitations,

qualifications, and conditions as may be prescribed by the Council and

subject to the approval of the Ministe0 impose and levy a rate on the

annual value of any immovable property or any species of immovable

property situated within the town. "

Il I

Section 160 (3)

"Where the Council, in imposing any rates for any year, resolves to levy

without alteration the same rate as was in force during the preceding year,

the approval of the Minister shall not be required for the imposition and

levy of such rate."

It is thus evident that the approval of the Minister is necessary where

alteration to the existing rates is to be imposed.

Section 166

"The assessment of any immovable property for the purpose of any rate

under this Ordinance shall, with the necessary modifications, be made in

manner prescribed by section 235 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance,

with respect to immovable property within Municipal limits, and all the

provisions of the said section, together with those of sections 233, 242,

243, and 236 to 241, shall, with the necessary modifications, apply with

respect to every such assessment made for the purposes of this Ordinance:

Provided that, pending the making of any such assessment, any valuation

of any immovable property made for the purposes of the assessment tax

under the Police Ordinance, or any enactment passed in amendment

thereof, shall be deemed to be the valuation of such property for the

purpose of any rate on the annual value thereof under this Ordinance."

It is relevant at this stage to refer to Section 238 of the Municipal

Councils Ordinance which is as follows,

I I ! I I

I I I

7

1) ''Municipal Council shall prepare a new assessment only when so

directed by the Minister, generally or specially. The Minister may

direct the preparation of a new assessment in respect of any class or

species of immovable property or all immovable property in any

Municipal Council area having regard to the provision of new services

or the improvement of existing services in such Municipal Council

area. Except when a new assessment is carried out on the directions

of the Minister, the CounCil shall adopt the valuation or assessment

for the preceding year with such alterations as may, in particular

cases, be deemed necessary, as the valuation or assessment for the

year following:

Provided always that notice of such valuation and assessment shall

be given in the prescribed manner.

2) The Minister may on representations made or of his own volition

direct the revision of the assessment of the annual values in respect

of any past year in such manner as he may deem fit having regard to

the services that had been provided at the time.

3) Where there has beef} a reduction of the rates as a result of .the

revision of assessments on a direction of the Minister under

subsection (2J the Council shall

(a) where such rates have been paid, set off the amount of such

rates and any costs incurred for the purpose of recovering those

t , III

8

rates so reduced, against future rates due on the property in respect

of which such rates have been paid, or

(b) where such rates have not been paid, waive the amount of such

rates and any costs incurred. "

The word 'Minister' mentioned in the Urban Councils Ordinance, No. 61 of

1939 refers to the Minister of Local Government.

However, according to Section 2 (1) of the Provincial Council

(Consequential Provisions) Act, No. 12 of 1989,

"Where any power or function is conferred on or assigned to a Minister or

to a public officer, as the case may be, by any written law made prior to

November 14, 1987 on any matter set out in List I of the Ninth Schedule,

such power or function may,

(a) if such power or function is conferred on, or assigned to, a Minister, be

exercised or discharged, in relation to a Province and unless the context

otherwise requires, by the Governor of that Province or the Minister of the

Board of Ministers of that Province to whom the subject has been

assigned; and accordingly, references in every such written law to a

Minister shall be deemed to include reference to a Governor of a Province

or the Minister of the Board of Ministers of such Province to whom the

function has been assigned; ...... "

Therefore, the term 'Minister' set out in the Urban Councils Ordinance, No.

61 of 1939 as amended, read with the Provincial Council (Consequential

I IJ ! ! I

J I i f

l t 1 I I l i

f I

Provisions) Act, No. 12 of 1989, in respect of the present application, refers

to the Minister of Local Government of the Western Province.

What is apparent from the above provisions is that an assessment cannot

be prepared without the direction of the Minister. The Respondents have

failed to establish before this Court that there has been such a direction by

the Minister. In these circumstances this Court has no alternative but to

hold that the 1st Respondent has acted outside his powers.

Mr. Ariyarathne, Attorney-at-Law had appeared for the 1st and 2nd

Respondents in this court when it had come up for objections on 2015-10-

13 and had moved for time to file objections. Since then, the 1st and 2nd

Respondents had not taken any steps to file any pleadings on their behalf.

This court had granted an interim relief in this case. Since then, this court

had also been extending the said interim relief namely the stay order it had

granted every time it had come up as a case to be mentioned in court.

That satisfies this court that there has been ample opportunity for the 1st

and 2nd Respondents to become aware of the pendency of this matter, as

these orders have been communicated to them from time to time.

When this matter was taken up for argument on 2016-07-04, there was no

appearance for the 1st and 2nd Respondents. This court then kept it down . . as a case marked ready to be taken up for argument. Thereafter when it

was taken up for submissions by the learned counsel for the Petitioner, Mr.

Ariyarathne, Attorney-at-Law appeared and moved for a postponement.

Said Mr. Ariyarathne further submitted to court that he had also informed

the 1st and 2nd Respondents that this matter has been fixed for argument

II

10

today but submitted that he had not received any instructions from the

said Respondents.

In these circumstances this court took the view that the 1st and 2nd

Respondents are well aware of the ongoing proceedings of this case and

the fact that the argument of this case has been fixed for that date. Those

Respondents had however not taken any interest either to file their

pleadings or to present their positions to court through a counsel.

Indeed there was no counsel to make submissions on behalf of the 1st and

2nd Respondents as said Mr. Ariyarathne also, though he stated that he

appears for the 1st and 2nd Respondents, had left court consequent to the

refusal of the application to move for a postponement by this court.

The absence of said counsel in court at least at the argument stage

resulted in not even presenting an application to this Court at least to file

written submissions on pOints of law which the 1st and 2nd Respondents

would have been desirous of placing before this court. Thus, at the end of

the day this court was only left with the written submissions filed by the

Petitioner.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons we decide that,

(a) a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

decision and/or determination to issue a new assessment on

the annual value of the property bearing Assessment No. 17,
