CASE- NO- CA-888 197 IF - JUDGMENT- 29.07.2016

P.R. Walgama, J

The instant appeal was

-Appellant (in short

lodged by the 4th Defendant

the Appellant) who was

5

dissatisfied with the judgment of the Learned District

Judge pronounced on 28.11.1996.

The Appellant IS dissatisfied with the said judgment

to the extent that the share allotted to him is not

accurate and thus he IS entitled to a larger share

than that is allotted to him in the above judgment.

The Plaintiff instituted action In the District Court

of Kegalle In the case bearing No. 24534/P, to have

the land described In the schedule to be partitioned

among the co-owners, as it was not practical to

possess the said land In common.

The land sought to be partitioned was a land

known as Arambawatta, containing in extent 12 lahas

situated at Matiyagana, depicted in plan bearing No.

368, made by S.P.P. Kulatunge license surveyor.

It IS being noted that only the 4th

appealed against the said Judgment

District Judge.

Defendant has

of the Learned

As per pedigree submitted by the Plaintiff, the

original owner one Sundara possessed 1 19 undivided

share of the said land. After the demise of Sundara

his rights devolved on his two sons namely Bandara

Wimaladharma the third Defendant and Sunil

wickramasinghe the 4th Defendant.

It is salient to note that at the out set it is being

recorded that the 1 st 4th 7th and 9- 17 Defendants

6

are admitting the rights gIven by the plaintiff and

only contentious Issue had been that the 1 st

Defendant should be declared entitled to lot 1 and

plantation and the buildings standing thereon should

be allotted to the 1st Defendant. Apparently the 1st

Defendant IS satisfied with the share and other

rights allotted to him and had never appeared In

this court to vindicate his rights.

As it was mentioned above there had been no

contest by the 1 st 4th 7th Defendants and 9-17

defendants as it has been recorded that the above

Defendants admit the rights glVen In the plaint In

the said partition action.

In the above setting this court is of the VIew that

there is no merits in this appeal and should stand

dismissed.

Accordingly appeal IS dismissed without costs.
