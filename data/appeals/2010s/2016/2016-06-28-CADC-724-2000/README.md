ARGUED &

DECIED ON: 27.07.2015

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J

In this matter by a petition of appeal dated 27.11.2000 the substituted defendant-

appellant namely Jayasinghe Manichchige Karunawathi prefers an appeal against

the order of the learned District Judge of Trincomalee dated 20.10.2000 wherein

the learned District Judge rejected the application made by the substituted

defendant-appellant under Section 402 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Before the learned District Judge came to make this order on the 20.10.2000 he

had made an order laying by the case because the plaintiff had stated to Court that

there was a connected case and the case had been taken off the trial roll. (Please

see the journal entry dated 02.03.1998 when the learned District Judge had allowed

the application of the plaintiff-respondent to have the case laid by).

Thereafter, on 18.02.2000 the learned Counsel for the plaintiff-respondent had

moved the District Court to have the case withdrawn reserving the right to institute

a fresh action under Section 406 of the Civil Procedure Code. In respect of this

application the Attorney-at-Law for the substituted defendant-appellant preferred

his statement of objection and stated that there cannot be an application to file a

fresh action since the matter in the District Court had abated by virtue of Section

402 of the Civil Procedure Code. (please see objections filed by the substituted

defendant-appellant at page 72-73 of the brief). Written submissions have also

been filed by both the plaintiff-respondent and the defendant-appellant in regard to

both their separate applications. Whilst the substituted defendant-appellant

strenuously opposed the re-institution of the proceedings on the basis of Section

402, of the Code, Counsel for the plaintiff-respondent had sought to support his

application for re-institution by attempting to come within Section 406 of the Civil

Procedure Code. The learned District Judge by his order dated 20.10.2000

considered both contentions and rejected the individual applications made by both

the plaintiff and the defendant. Whilst the plaintiff has not appealed against the

order made against him the substituted defendant-appellant has preferred this

appeal against that part of the order which dismissed his objections based on

Section 402 of the Civil Procedure Code. Mr. Lasith Chaminda, Attorney-at-Law

for the substituted defendant-appellant quite rightly concedes in the best traditions

2

of the bar that he would not be canvassing the reasons contained in the order of the

learned District Judge for rejecting the objections of the substituted defendant-

appellant, in view of the fact that Section 402 of the Civil Procedure Code would

not be applicable in a situation where an order of laying by has been made. There

is proposition for this contention articulated in Samsudeen vs. Eagle Star Insurance

Corporation 64 NLR at page 372. In the circumstance, this Court finds no reason to

interfere with the order made by the learned District Judge of Trincomalee dated

20.10.2000. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed but with no cost.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.
