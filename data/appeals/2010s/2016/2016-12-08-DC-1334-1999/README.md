Being aggrieved by the said judgment the Defendant-

Appellant appealed to this court for an annulment or

to vacate the said judgment.

In an action of this nature it 1S incumbent on the

Plaintiff to prove the title to the subject land,

appellate reV1ew the it 1S duty of this court to

consider whether the Learned District Judge has given

adequate atten tion to the same.

It 1S apparent from the pleadings of the Amended

Plaint that the Plaintiff has gained title to the

disputed land through the valid legal documents, V1Z

the title deeds produced at the trial.

As per pleadings 1n the afore said Amended Plaint,

one W.G.Punchi Naide was the original owner of the

land more fully described 1n the schedule to the

Amended Plaint.

The said Punchi Naide 1n 1892 by deed bearing No.

5173, has conveyed his title to Dingiri Amma, and

said Dingiri Amma 1n 1924.07.28 by Deed bearing

No. 438 conveyed her title to Attaragama Piyaratana

Thero and said Thero con veyed the title to

Mudiyanselage Punchi Banda Ratnayake on 1938-05-30

bearing Deed No. 11279, and the said Punchi Banda

Ratnayake 1n 1953 .07.14 has conveyed his rights to

Ramon Kudatittawela by bearing Deed No. 1136, and

Tittawella on 13 .12.1980 by Deed bearing No. 13132

has conveyed his rights to the Plaintiff accordingly.

Besides it IS the position of the Plaintiff- Respondent

that he and his predecessors In title had possessed

the subject land over ten years and as such has

prescribed to the disputed land.

But it IS seen from the pedigree that the Defendant-

Appellant IS relying on IS quite different to that of

the Plaintiff. Nevertheless it apparent from the

Defendant pedigree that she has admitted that afore

said Dingirimanikas title and her rights had been

conveyed to W.P. Manikethana.

It IS contended by the Defendant- Appellant that at

one stage the disputed land belonged to one Sethuwa

who was the father of the Defendant- Appellant and

he had built a house In the said land and after

his demise the title has devolved on the Defendant-

Appellant.

It IS the categorical position of the Defendant-

Appellant that she and her predecessors in title had

possessed this land and had prescribed to the same.

Further it IS contended by the Defendant-Appellant

that she built the house depicted In plan No. 576

In lot No.1 made by B.P.Rupasinghe L.S dated 28th

December 1987, and she IS a co -owner of the land

In Issue. As such disputes the Plaintiffs title and

prescriptive title to the subject land.

The land 1n 1ssue 1S known as 'PETHIGE PITIYA

HENA' more fully described 1n the schedule to the

amended plaint. The said land is depicted in the plan

stated above and was marked 1n the course of the

trial without any objection of the Defendant- Appellant.

Further it 1S contended by the Plaintiff- Respondent

that it 1S common ground, and had admitted

specifically

Plaintiff's

Thithawela

to occupy

admitted

registered

by the Defendant -Appellant that the

predecessors in title namely Jamis Kuda

and K.B .Ratnayake permitted the Defendant

the land 1n issue. In addition

1n evidence that K.B.Ratnayake's

as the owner of this land

Agricultural Land Register. The extract from

Register has been marked as P9, and as

document the owner of subject land has

the

per

been

was

1S

the

said

said

the

father of Kuda Thitawela and the Lessee cultivator was

P.G.Ranmanika the Defendant 1n the present action.

Hence it 1S abundantly clear that the Defendant-

Appellant cannot claim prescriptive title over this

land, as the pedigree shown by the Plaintiff-

Respondent has been established at the trial in the

original court. Therefore I am of the V1ew that the

Learned Trial Judge has correctly accepted the

Plaintiff's pedigree and rejected the Defendant's as the

Defendant - Appellant has admitted the Plaintiff's

predecessors title to the land 1n 1ssue.

It IS established by the Plaintiff-Respondent that said

Kuda Thitawela by Deed marked as P2, transferred his

title to the Plaintiff- Appellant and the Plaintiff became

the right full owner of the disputed land accordingly.

Therefore it was the categorical position of the

Plaintiff- Respondent that the Defendant- Appellant has

no right to challenge his title and prescriptive title

to the disputed land.

The Defendant- Appellant has raised the following

Issues In the appeal, In that it IS stated that the

plaintiff has not formulated Issues In accordance with

the amended plaint. Ii IS viewed from the original

plaint the Plaintiff has stated P.B.Ratnayake as the

original owner who conveyed the title to his son

Kuda Tittawela who had conveyed the title to the

Plaintiff -Respondent by virtue of deed No. 13132 dated

13.12.1980.

By the Amended Plaint the Plaintiff endeavoured to

established his title by details of his

predecessors in title beyond P.B. Ratnayake.

Further it IS salient to note that Plaintiff- Respondent

has categorically stated that pedigree In which the

Defendant- Appellant IS relying on are his ancestors

VIZ a VIZ Manik Ethana IS his great grand father

and dingiri Ethana is his maternal grand mother and

Heen Appu IS his mothers father. Therefore it IS

asserted by the Plaintiff that his non of the afore

~ I t Ii f II

t

said ancestors had conveyed their title to the

Defendant - Appellant.

In the afore said back drop even as per pedigree the

Defendant- Appellant cannot claim any title and the

issues framed by the Plaintiff- Respondent has confined

only to the original plaint. By doing so no material

prejudice has been caused to the Defendant-

Appellant. Therefore the said argument of the

Defendant- Appellant 1S devoid of merits and should

stand rejected.

In addition to the afore said the Plaintiff- Respondent

has stated that after he purchased the land in 1980

he possessed the same.

Hence in the above exposition of the facts and law

I am persuaded to affirm the impugned judgment and

dismiss the appeal.

Accordingly appeal is dismissed subject to a costs of

Rs. 5000.

Appeal is dismissed.
