CASE- NO- CA (PHC)- 20-2004- JUDGMENT- 13.09.2016

P.R. WALGAMA, J

The Petitioner- Appellant tendered an application in the

nature of a mandate of a writ of Certiorari to quash the

decision of the 1st Respondent and for a writ of

2

Mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent to accept the

appeal marked as P3.

The Petitioner- Appellant was the Treasure of the

Cooperative Thrift and Credit Society Ltd of lIakkapaliama,

Tissamaharama.

The 3rd Respondent after an inquiry, held in terms of

Section 44 of Act No. 5 of 1972, has revealed that there is

a shortage of Rs. 3,20,118.57, which amount is payable by

the Petitioner- Appellant. The said decision was marked as

P2.

The Petitioner- Appellant by his letter dated 24.06.1999, has

tendered an appeal to the 1st Respondent. On 16.09.2000

the Petitioner-Appellant appeared at the inquiry, but the 1st

Respondent has dismissed the Appeal on the basis that

there is no proper appeal in terms of Rule 49{1}{a) of the

Co-operative Societies Act.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Petitioner-Appellant

moved In revision the Provincial High Court of

Hambanthota to quash the said order by issuing a writ of

Certiorari and for a writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st

Respondent to accept his appeal.

3

It is viewed from of impugned order of the Learned High

Court Judge that the purported appeal to the 1st

Respondent has not been tendered in conformity with the

Rule 49(xii)(a) of the Cooperative Societies Rules.

It is contended by the Petitioner- Appellant that the

requirement to pay an appeal deposit in terms of the Rule

49(xii)(a) of the Co-operative Societies IS ultra vires.

In fact it is the stance of the Petitioner- Appellant that

when the Rule 49(xii)(a) stipulates two sums of appeal

deposits to be made and if an aggrieved party had

deposited either of the two sums of appeal deposit the

Registrar of Co operative Societies should accept and hear

the appeal.

The Petitioner- Appellant to buttress the above contention

basically rely on the case of SEBASTIN FERNANDO .VS.

KATANA MULTI PURPOSE COOPERATIVE SOCIETY LTD AND

OTHERS 19903 SLR 342.

Therefore it is contended by the Petitioner- Appellant that in

view of the above case it is unfair and unjust to have

rejected on the above ground and thereby had denied the

procedural fairness to the Petitioner- Appellant.

4

For convenience and brevity the above section is

reproduced herein below;

/I Every appeal to the Registrar from an award of an

arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators shall be made within

30 days from the date of the award by a written

statement setting out the grounds of appeal. Every such

appeal shall be forwarded to the Registrar with an appeal

deposit of Rs. 50 or 10% of the sum awarded where the

appeal is made by the party against whom the award has

been made and by Rs. 50 or 10% of

dispute where the appeal is made by

the sum claimed In

the party claiming

any sum of money, which ever sum is the higher sum in

either case."

The pith and substance of the Appellant's case is that the

payment of Rs.50 is a sufficient deposit in respect of the

appeal in terms of Rule 49(xi}(a) and the rejection of the

same is unlawful and ultra virus.

But it is the contention of the counsel for the Respondents

that as per rules it IS the highest sum VIZ. the 10% of

the amount has to be deposited with the appeal. It is

seen from the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge

who has accepted the said position of the Respondents

had afforded an opportunity to the appellant to deposit

5

the balance sum of Rs. 203,234.26 being the 10% of the

to be recovered from the Appellant.

The counsel for the Respondents has submitted that the

Sebestian Fernando's case was on a different footing, in

that it was said that in the above case the appeal was

rejected on the basis that the appellant has failed to pay

the balance of the 10% of the money due to the Co

operative Society. Therefore it is obvious that the ratio is

not that the rule 49 (xii}(a) is ultra vires, but it was

decided that the Appellant should be given time to pay

the balance of 10% of the deposit, and it was observed

thus;

" ........... In the Petition filed in the Court of Appeal, although

the Appellant contended that the Registrar (4th Respondent)

should not have refused to entertain the appeal, he did

not contend that the requirement in Rule 49?(xii}(a) of an

appeal deposit is ultra vires or that the rejection of the

appeal was bad for any reason, nor did he pray for

Certiorari and Mandamus against the Registrar to quash the

order rejecting the appeal and to direct him to hear and

d . h " etermme t e same .......

6

It is salient to note that their Lordship has not made any

remark as to the rule 49 (xii)(a) and the legality of the

same, therefore it remains as obitar dicta.

The counsel for the Respondents has also adverted to the

case of WEERAKKODY PATHIRENNAHELAGE SOMARATNE .VS.

D.O. PREMACHANDRA, COMMISSIONER OF CO OPERATIVE

SOCIETIES which was held thus;

"that Rule 49(xii)(a} IS not ultra vires and should be

mandatory confirmed to when preferring an appeal under

Section 58(3}."

As per Ismile J, ..... " therefore I am of the view that Rule

49(xii)(a} is not ultra vires the rule making power conferred

on the Minister particularly since under section 58(3}

provides the period within which the appeal may be filed

can be prescribed by the rules .. "

It is seen from the above section and it is abundantly

clear that the said provision has been made prescribing the

time and the manner pertaining to the disposal of an

appeal.

Accordingly the Minister by exercising his rule making

powers under section 61 (1) read together with 61(2)(y} had

formulated the Rule 49 (xii)(a) which deals with the time

7

limit for making an appeal to the Registrar, and the

manner in which the appeal should be lodged.

Therefore it IS worthy to note that the above section

postulate the payment of the higher amount being the 10%

of the money payable.

In the above setting it IS ostensible that the Minister will

not be acting ultra vires when he formulated the rule

49(xii)(a) in terms of section 58(3) of the said rules.

In the above setting this court see no merits in the

application of the Appellant and thus dismiss the appeal

Accordingly appeal is dismissed subject to a costs of Rs.

10,000/.
