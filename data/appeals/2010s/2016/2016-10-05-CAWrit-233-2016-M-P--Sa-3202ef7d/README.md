C.A. (Writ) Application No. 233/2016

BEFORE VIJITH K MALALGODA, PCJ (P/CA)

COUNSEL Prinath Fernando for the petitioner.

SUPPORTED ON 12th August, 2016

**********

VIJITH K MALALGODA, PCJ (PICA)

Heard Counsel in support of this application.

The position taken by the learned Counsel before this Court

is that the vehicle that he has imported was imported under Regulation

1 ( c ) of Gazette No. 1949/29/1 dated 12th January 2016. The

petitioners' position before this Court is that the said vehicle was

imported for the private use of the two petitioners who are partners of a

vehicle importing Company. I observe that the petitioners have failed to

substantiate their position by documentation to show that the vehicle so

imported was imported for the purpose of their private use. The

petitioners have failed to establish that they have declared the said fact

2 eo

at the time the letter of credit was opened. I observe that the only

document they submitted before this Court with regard to this fact is a

document marked P7 where an appeal has been preferred to the Hon.

Minister informing that the said vehicle was imported for their personal

use. When the petitioners had made the same appeal to the Director

General Customs, he too has rejected this application informing that the

evidence supplied by the petitioners does not substantiate the

requirements spelt out in section 1 ( c) of the said gazette notification.

I see no reason to interfere with the said finding of the

Director General, Customs and therefore I refuse to issue notices in this

application.

Application for notice is refused.
