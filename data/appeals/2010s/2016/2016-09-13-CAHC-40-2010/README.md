M.M.A. Gaffoor J.,

The Accused-Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Kalmunai

for committing the murder of One Ponniah Navaratnam which is punishable

under Section 296 of the Penal Code. At the conclusion of the trial learned

High Court Judge found the accused guilty as charged and sentenced him to

death. The accused -appellant has preferred this appeal against the said

conviction and sentence.

This matter came up for argument the Counsel for the accused-appellant

Were confined to following grounds of appeal:

1. The prosecution has failed to comply with Section 199 (3) of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and non-compliance

of the said procedure stipulated in Section 199 (3) necessarily vitiates

the conviction and the death sentence.

2. The Procedure adopted by the learned trial Judge contrary to the

provisions of section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance and violating the

norms and principles of an adversary system of Criminal Justice.

The counsel for the accused-appellant further submitted that

upon perusal of the above mentioned proceedings and the

corresponding journal entries and the indictment of the brief, it is

apparent that there is a total failure on the part of the learned Trial

judge to comply with the aforementioned mandatory Provisions as

embodied in Section 199 (3 ) of the CPC and he further submitted that

the Provisions relating to adducing all statement of the accused at the

non-summery inquiry, have not been comply by the learned trial

Judge, wherein the procedure adopted by the learned trial judge not in

accordance with Section 199(3) of the CPC.

Counsel for the accused-appellant further draws the attention

of Court to the following pages Pwl- pgs 58 to 61, Pw2- Pgs.

69,70,73,75,18 ,80 to 84 , Pw-12 Pgs.88,90,97 tol02 PwIO- Pgs.I07

brief in order to satisfy the nature question put and the extend of

intervention of the learned trial Judge during the course of the trial.

Upon perusal of the questions put by the learned trial judge in the

above said pages it is manifestly clear that the learned trial judge had

encroached the duties and descending to the arena of the prosecuting

counsel. Some of the questions put by the learned trial judge are

leading questions and some amount to irrelevant whilst not relating to

the fact in issue. Counsel for the accused-appellant further cited to

case III queen vs Aluthge don Hemalapa 64 NLR citing Abdul

Rahaman Vs. The King Emperor 4 (4) (7926-27 I.A.96 at 104) Five

Honorabel Justices of the Supreme Court held thus" they wish to be

understood that no serious defect in mode of conducting a criminal

trial can be justified or cured by the consent of the advocate of the

accused." It was further held thus" that it is a fundamental right of an

accused person to be tried in accordance with the procedure

prescribed in the Criminal Procedure Code and the practice

established there under. It is illegal in a criminal trial to follow a

procedure to warranted by the code or the practice there under. He

recall the following words of Lord Herschell L.C. in Sumrthwaite vs.

Hannay 1 (1 (1984)A.C.494 at 501) " If unwarranted by any

enactment or rule, it IS, III my opinion, much more than an

irregularity" .

Learned S.D.S.G. states that he has no objection for sending

this case back for re-trial based on the premise that the brief

5

demonstrates the involvement of learned trial judge in the leading of

the evidence.

Taking all theses matter into consideration and the submissions

made by the both counsel, we are of the view that there is a fit and

proper case to send back for re-trial.

We direct to the Learned trial Judge to re- hear and determine

this case on priority basis expeditiously according to Law.

Re-trialordered.
