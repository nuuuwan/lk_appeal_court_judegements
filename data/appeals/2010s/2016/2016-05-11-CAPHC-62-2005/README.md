In this appeal the Appellant among other reliefs is seeking to set aside

the Order of the learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura dated 08.12.2004.

The facts which led to the making of the said order by the High Court

are as follows:

Pursuant to an information filed by Ratnapura Police in terms of

Section 66 of the Primary Procedure Act, the learned Primary Court Judge

of Ratnapura held an inquiry into the dispute between G. Sirineris (1 st party

Respondent-Respondent), Thushara Douglas (2nd Party Petitioner -

Appellant) and D.M. Jayawardena (Intervenient 3rd Party Respondent -

Respondent) in respect of a roadway and held that the 1 st Respondent has

the right to use the roadway and ordered the 2nd Party to remove all

obstructions placed across the road.

Further he rejected the claim of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents in regard

to the possession of the land.

Dissatisfied with that Order the 2nd Party - Petitioner-Appellant

invoked the Revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of Ratnapura,

seeking to set aside the learned Magistrate's Order.

The learned High Court Judge having considered the submissions

made by both parties affirmed the learned Magistrate's Order and dismissed

the Petition. For the first time the Appellant had brought the General

Manager of the Railway Department to the case as the 3rd Respondent.

5

The Appellant being aggrieved by the aforesaid Order preferred an

appeal to this Court seeking to set aside the order made by the learned High

Court Judge, dated 08.12.2004.

The case for the appellant was that he has been in possession of a land

belonging to the Railway Department for more than 10 years and has planted

Banana, and flowers. Sirineris (1 st Respondent) has been using a roadway

across the said land. To protect the plantation, with the approval received

from the Railway Department he took steps to erect a fence. Some unknown

people had removed the fence and the 3 rd Respondent was excavating the

side of the road to construct a drain obstructing the roadway. He made

complaints to the police on 27.04.2002, 17.05.2002 and 22.05.2002 to the

effect of the aforesaid incidents. In the meantime, Sirineris had made a

complaint to the police on 09.11.2002 alleging that the appellant is

obstructing the roadway by putting sand and bricks. The learned Primary

Court Judge has proceeded to treat the dispute under Section 69(1) as to who

was entitled to the right to use the disputed roadway. It requires the Court to

determine the question as to which party is entitled to the disputed right

preliminary to making an order under Section 69 (2) of the Act.

In this case, the Primary Court Judge was called upon to reach a

decision on the affidavits filed. After considering the contents in those

affidavits the Primary Court Judge held, that the 1 st Respondent has the right

to use the roadway and ordered to remove all obstructions placed across the

road. The claim of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents in regard to the possession,

was dismissed.

6

It is an admitted fact by all parties that the disputed roadway belongs

to the Railway Department. However, the Appellant has claimed that he has

been in possession of the land for more than 10 years, and the 3 rd

Respondent has claimed that he has been in possession for about 15 years.

Having considered the contents of the affidavits and the documents

filed by the parties, the learned Magistrate has, rejected the claim made by

the Appellant and the 3rd Respondent for the land as they were not able to

produce a valid permit or written authority to possess the land. However,

the learned Magistrate has held that the 1 st Respondent has the right to use

the disputed roadway and ordered the 2nd Respondent to remove all

obstructions placed across the road. Undoubtedly, this order has been made

by the learned Primary Court Judge in terms of the provisions of Section

69(1) and (2) of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

On perusal of the entirety of the judgment of the learned High Court

Judge, it is apparent that the learned High Court Judge has taken into

consideration the submissions made by all parties and has come to the

conclusion that there is no basis to interfere with the Order made by the

learned Primary Court Judge.

Hence, I do not see any error in which the learned High Court Judge

has considered the facts and the way in which he has applied the law in this

instance.

There is no reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned High

Court Judge of Ratnapura. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed with costs.

7

It is relevant to note in the prayer of the Petition of Appeal, the

Appellant has not sought to set aside the order made by the learned Primary

Court Judge and therefore the said Order would prevail.

F or the reasons stated above the appeal is dismissed with costs.
