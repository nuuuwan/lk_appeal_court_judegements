The 2nd Respondent Respondent (the 2nd Respondent) was an

employee of the Petitioner Petitioner Society (the Petitioner). A charge

sheet was served on him on the allegation of financial misconduct and at

the inquiry he was convicted of all the offences. The inquiring officer

recommended to fine him one week's salary, recharge the amount

misappropriated and to place him on post of clerk without back wages.

The Board of Directors of the Petitioner Society discussed the issue at the

Board Meeting held on 09.12.2003 and he was offered one week to pay

back the amount due and it was communicated to the 2nd Respondent on

10.12.2003, but has failed or neglected to pay. Thereafter the Board of

Directors decided on a meeting held on 23.01.2004 to terminate his

services. The decision was communicated to the 2nd Respondent on

03.02.2004 by the letter marked XII. The 2nd Respondent appealed to the

1 st Respondent Respondent Commission (the 1sst Respondent) against the

decision of the Board of Directors on 29.01.2005. The 1st Respondent,

after considering the appeal, issued the order marked XI5 ordering the

Petitioner to reinstate the 2nd Respondent. The Petitioner not being carried

out the order, the 1 st Respondent instituted action in the Magistrate Court.

In the meantime, the Petitioner made an application to the Provincial

3

High Court of Uva Province holden at Monaragala. The learned High

Court Judge was of the view that the order of the 1 st Respondent is ab

initio void for the reason that the appeal presented was time barred, but he

did not give relief to the Petitioner on the basis that the delay in filing the

writ application in the High Court was not explained. This appeal is from

the said order.

The decision of the Board of Directors of the Petitioner was

communicated to the 2nd Respondent on 03.02.2004. If the he is not

satisfied with the decision, as an employee, he can appeal to the 1 st

Respondent. The appellate procedure is governed by the rule 135 of

regulations published in the Gazette Extraordinary no. 169/8 dated

01.12.1981. The Minister has approved the regulations prepared by the

Commission and published under the section 32 of the Co-operative

Employees Commission Act 12 of 1972 as amended by Act 51 of 1992.

The section reads;

32. (1) Unless otherwise expressly provided, the Commission may

make all such regulations as may seem to the Commission to be

necessary for carrying out the provisions of this Act or giving

effect to the principles thereof, including regulations for all

matters for or in respect of which regulations are authorized or

required to be made under this Act, and alt matters stated or

required by this Act to be prescribed.

(2) No such regulation shall have effect until it has been

approved by the Minister and notification of such approval has

been published in the Gazette.

(3) Upon the publication in the Gazette of any notification

under subsection (2), the regulation to which the notification

4

relates shall be as valid and effectual as though it were herein

enacted.

As per the Gazette notification, subsections (1) and (2) have been

complied with and therefore subsection (3) comes in to operation and the

regulations become valid and effectual as it was enacted therein. The

regulations published in the Gazette have a statutory flavour.

The rule 135 of the regulations requires that any employee who is

dissatisfied with the order, to appeal to the Commission within 60 days

from the order. This is an absolute time bar. When the law requires a

person to do a thing within a prescribed period and if it has not done

within that period, he is precluded from doing it thereafter. The 1 st

Respondent's contention is that under the Code of Procedure of

Cooperative Employees the time period provided for presenting the

appeal is 06 months. Under subsection (2) of section 32 of the Act, no

such regulation shall have effect until it has been approved by the

Minister and notification of such approval has been published in the

Gazette. The 1 st Respondent has failed to submit that the said Code has

been approved by the Minister and published in the Gazette. Especially

when the Code has an effect of amending the rule 135, the approval and

publication should have been established. Without it, the rule 135 exists.

The order of the 1 st Respondent X 15 referrers to the appeal dated

29.01.2005. The order made on the appeal presented on 29.01.2005 under

rule 135 of the regulations published in the Gazette 169/8. Therefore it is

clear that the appeal in question is dated 29.01.2005. The order

challenged by the 2nd Respondent in his appeal to the 1 st Respondent, was

conveyed to him on 03.02.2004. The appeal submitted 11 months after

the order. It is clearly out of 60 days provided in the rule 135 and it is out

of 06 months period too. The 1 st Respondent has no jurisdiction to

entertain an appeal presented after the appealable period. The learned

5

High Court Judge correctly decided that the order of the 1 st Respondent is

without jurisdiction and is bad in law. The Petitioner did not contest that

part of the order.

The current writ application presented to the High Court by the

Petitioner after two and half years of XIS. Unexplained delay in coming

to Court is considered as bar in obtaining relief in discretionary remedies

such as prerogative writs. But the delay in coming to Court has to be

considered in reference to the circumstances of each case. In reference to

revision applications, which is also a discretionary remedy, the Court held

in the case of Gnanapandithen and another V. Balanayagam and another

[1998] 1 Sri L R 391 the question whether delay is fatal to an application

in revision depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. In the case

of Biso Menika vs. Cyril de Alwis and Others [1982] 1 Sri L R 368 the

issue of delay in coming to Court has been considered and held that;

The proposition that the application for Writ must be sought as

soon as injury is caused is merely an application of the equitable

doctrine that delay defeats equity and the longer the injured person

sleeps over his rights without any reasonable excuse the chances of

his success in a Writ application dwindle and the Court may reject

a Writ application on the ground of unexplained delay.

"Laches is such negligence or omission to assert a right and taken

in conjunction with the lapse of time, more or less great, and other

circumstances causing prejudice to an adverse party operate as a

bar in a Court of equity" Ferris - Extraordinary Legal Remedies -

para 176.

"Where it would be practically unjust to give a remedy either

because the party has, by his conduct done that which might fairly

be regarded as equal to a waiver of it, or where by his conduct and

6

neglect he has, though perhaps not waiving that remedy, yet put the

other party in a situation in which it, would not be reasonable to

place him if the remedy were afterwards to be asserted, in either of

these cases lapse of time and delay are most material. But in every

case, if an argument against relief, which otherwise would be

unjust, is founded upon mere delay, that delay of course not

amounting to a bar by any Statute of Limitation, the validity of that

defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable. Two

circumstances always important in such cases are the length of the

delay and the nature of the acts done during the interval which

might affect either party and cause a balance of justice or injustice

in taking the one course or the other, so far as related to the

remedy." Lindsey Petroleum Co., Vs. Hurd (1874) L.R., 5 P.C 221

at 239.

An application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filed within a

reasonable time from the date of the Order which the applicant

seeks to have quashed. What is reasonable time and what will

constitute undue delay will depend upon the facts of each

particular case. However the time lag that can be explained does

not spell laches or delay. If the delay can be reasonably explained,

the Court will not decline to interfere. The delay which a Court can

excuse is one which is caused by the applicant pursuing a legal

remedy and not a remedy which is extra -legal. One satisfactory

way to explain the delay is for the petitioner to show that he has

been seeking relief elsewhere in a manner provided by the Law.

When the Court has examined the record and is satisfied the Order

complained of is manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction the

Court would be loathe to allow the mischief of the Order to

continue and reject the application simply on the ground of delay,

7

unless there are very extraordinary reasons to justify such

rejection. Where the authority concerned has been acting

altogether without basic jurisdiction, the Court may grant relief in

spite of the delay unless the conduct of the party shows that he has

approbated the usurpation of jurisdiction. In Any such event, the

explanation of the delay should be considered sympathetically.

"Recent practice clearly indicates that where the proceedings were

a nullity an award of Certiorari will not readily be denied" - de

Smith - Judicial Review - 4th Ed. page 426.

In this connection Professor Wade in his ''Administrative Law" 4th

Ed. at page 561 states

"the discretion to withhold remedy against unlawful action may

make inroads upon the rule of Law and must therefore be exercised

with the greatest care. In any normal case the remedy accompanies

the right, but the fact that a person aggrieved is entitled to

Certiorari ex debito justitiae does not alter the fact that a Court

has power to exercise the discretion against him, as it may in the

case of any discretionary remedy. "

Unlike in English Law or in our Law there is no statutory time limit

within which a petition for the issue of a Writ must be filed. But a

rule of practice has grown which insists upon such petition being

made without undue delay. When no time limit is specified for

seeking such remedy, the Court has ample power to condone

delays, where denial of Writ to the petitioner is likely to cause

great injustice. The Court may therefore in its discretion entertain

the application in spite of the fact that a petitioner comes to Court

late, -especially where the Order challenged is a nullity for

absolute want of jurisdiction in the authority making the order.

In the case of P. Beatrice Perera V s. The Commissioner Of

National Housing 77 NLR 361 it was held that;

Where summons has not been served at all, an ex parte judgment

against the defendant is void ab initio and the defendant can

challenge its validity at any time when the judgment so obtained is

sought to be used against him either in the same proceedings or

collaterally, provided always that he has not by subsequent

conduct estopped himself by acquiescence, waiver or inaction.

Delhi High Court in the case of Dinesh Elhence v Delhi

Development Authority, Case No: W. P. (C) 2954/2016 (2016 Indlaw

DEL 4553) the issue of delay in filing writ applications have been

discussed and held that;

13. The question of condonation of delay is one of discretion and

has to be decided on the basis of the facts of the case at hand, as

the same vary from case to case. It will depend upon what the

breach of fundamental right and the remedy claimed are and when

and how the delay arose. It is not that there is any period of

limitation for the courts to exercise their powers under Article 226,

nor is it that there can never be a case where the courts cannot

interfere in a matter, after the passage of a certain length of time.

There may be a case where the demandfor justice is so compelling,

that the High Court would be inclined to interfere in spite of

delay. Ultimately, it would be a matter within the discretion of the

Court and such discretion, must be exercised fairly and justly so as

to promote justice and not to defeat it. The validity of the party's

defence must be tried upon principles substantially equitable. (Vide

P.s. Sadasivaswamy v. State of TN. [(1975) 1 SCC 152 : 1975

SCC (L & S) 22 : AIR 1974 SC 2271 1974 Indlaw SC 110}, State of

MP. v. Nandlal Jaiswal [(1986) 4 SCC 566 : AIR 1987 SC 251

9

1986 Indlaw SC 256} and Tridip Kumar Dingal v. State of WE.

[(2009) 1 SCC 768 : (2009) 2 SCC (L & S) 119 2008 Indlaw SC

2180})

14. No hard-and-fast rule can be laid down as to when the High

Court should refuse to exercise its jurisdiction in favour of a party

who moves it after considerable delay and is otherwise guilty of

laches. Discretion must be exercised judiciously and reasonably. In

the event that the claim made by the applicant is legally

sustainable, delay should be condoned. In other words, where

circumstances justifying the conduct exist, the illegality which is

manifest, cannot be sustained on the sole ground of laches. When

substantial justice and technical considerations are pitted against

each other, the cause of substantial justice deserves to be

preferred, for the other side cannot claim to have a vested right in

the injustice being done, because of a non-deliberate delay. The

court should not harm innocent parties if their rights have in fact

emerged by delay on the part of the petitioners. (Vide Durga

Prashad v. Chief Controller of Imports and Exports [(1969) 1 SCC

185 : AIR 1970 SC 769 1968 Indlaw SC 352), Collector (LA) v.

Katiji [(1987) 2 SCC 107 : 1989 SCC (Tax) 172 : AIR 1987 SC

1353 1987 Indlaw SC 28811}, Dehri Rohtas Light Railway Co. Ltd.

v. District Board, Bhojpur [(1992) 2 SCC 598 : AIR 1993 SC 802

1992 Indlaw SC 1 o 79}, Dayal Singh v. Union of India [(2003) 2

SCC 593 : AIR 2003 SC 1140 2003 Indlaw SC 61} and Shankara

Coop. Housing Society Ltd. v. M Prabhakar [(2011) 5 SCC 607 :

(2011) 3 SCC (Civ) 56: AIR 2011 SC 2161 2011 Indlaw SC 340}.)

In the present case in hand the learned High Court Judge has found

that the impugned order of the I st respondent marked XI5 is bad in law. I

agree with the learned High Court Judge because the appeal was time

10

barred. The 1 st Respondent shouldn't have entertained the appeal.

Therefore the order XI5 is void ab initio. The learned High Court Judge

has not granted the relief only on the ground that the delay in filing the

application was explained. As it was mentioned above the Court has the

discretion to grant relief in cases where the justice requires doing so. In

the present case the 2nd Respondent was convicted for offences of

financial misconduct. The petitioner Society is an institute handling

public funds in large scale. A person who has been convicted for financial

misconduct is not a suitable person to be employed in an institution like

the Petitioner. Therefore the Petitioner has a good and reasonable ground

to challenge the order X 15 even after some time when the I st Respondent

took steps to implement the order.

I act in revision and set aside only the part of dismissal of the

application in the order of the learned High Court Judge dated

31.10.2013.

I order to issue a writ in the nature of writ of certiorari against the

1 st Respondent quashing the decision of the 1 st Respondent dated

13.06.2008 marked X15.

Revision application allowed. Considering the nature of the case, I

order no costs. The parties to bear own their costs.
