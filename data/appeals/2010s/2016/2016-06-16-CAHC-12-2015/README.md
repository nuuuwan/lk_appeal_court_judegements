Arumugam Sebestian the Accused - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Appellant) was indicted on two counts under the provisions of

the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. The first count was under

Section 54(a) (d) of the Act, for the possession of 2.42 grams of Heroin and the

second count was under Section 54(a) (b) for trafficking. The Learned Trial

Judge by his judgment dated 09.03.2015 convicted the Appellant after trial and

sentenced him to life imprisonment. The Appellant preferred the instant appeal

against the said conviction and sentence.

The sole ground of this appeal relied by the Counsel for the Appellant in

his argument was that the failure of the Learned Trial Judge to give due

consideration to the defense taken up by the Appellant in the original Court. The

Learned Counsel confined his argument to a preliminary issue i.e whether the

Learned Trial Judge has failed to apply the test of reasonable doubt on the

evidence adduced by the Defense and thereby deny a fair trial to the Appellant.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant has emphasized that the trial judge has

rejected the defense evidence on the basis that the Appellant has failed to

suggest the position taken up in his evidence in the trial Court to the prosecution

witnesses during the trial.

The Learned Counsel relied on an Indian Supreme Court decision in

Dudh Nath Pandey vs State of Uttar Pradesh (1981 AIR 911) in which it was

2

stated that "defense witnesses are entitled to equal treatment with those of the

prosecution and Courts ought to overcome their traditional instinctive disbelief

in defense witnesses, quite often, they tell lies but so do the prosecution

witnesses. "

In the instant case the Police Inspector Rangajeewa (PW2) attached to the

narcotic bureau, arranged a police team for a raid on a tip off he received on the

23rd of June 2010, that a person called Sebastian was getting ready to go to

Rajagiriya Bandaranayakepura to prepare Heroin packets for trafficking. For the

purpose of the raid PW2 arranged a police team with two vehicles of which one

was a police jeep and the other was a three-wheeler. As per evidence led at the

trail it was revealed that the jeep stopped on Sri Jayawardenapura road at around

15.20 hours and Inspector Rangajeewa (PW2) with two police sergeants

namely, Fernando and Ajith proceeded about 100M 1150 M further in the three-

wheeler and turned to Sarana Mawatha and stopped in front of the Election

Commissioners Office so that the intersection was clearly visible. The

prosecution witness then contemplated Sebastian, who was known to Inspector

Rangajeewa, to go to Bandaranayakepura through Arunodaya Mawatha.

At 6.25 p.m. PW2 had spotted that Sebastian was coming towards the

police officers. As Sebastian came closer to the three-wheeler IP Rangajeewa

had got off and held him. Sebastian was clenching the fingers in his right hand

when IP Rangajeewa made Sebastian unfold his fingers and searched out a light

3

pink cellophane bag which had been tied and found in his hand. Inspector

Rangajeewa (PW2) identified the brown color powder which was in the

cellophane bag as heroine thereafter arrested the accused Sebastian for having

heroin in his possession.

While denying the version of Inspector Rangajeewa (PW2) the defense

Counsel in the trial Court suggested that the arrest of the accused was made at

the Nawala Junction when the accused came there consequent to a telephone

call given by PW2 requesting him to come. But the accused at the trial in his

evidence has stated that when he was at home the police officers had taken him

near the Nawala Caterers and told him to show a person called "Chutti" who

sells heroine and since the Appellant could not assist the Police he was arrested.

Thereafter he had been taken to the police station and asked to sign a statement.

W elu Ramani, the wife of the Appellant who had been a defense witness

at the trial had stated that her husband was arrested when he was at home by

Inspector Rangajeewa (PW2) on the 22nd of May 2010.

Having considered the evidence of the Appellant and his wife the

Learned Trial Judge has rejected their evidence for two reasons. One being that

the position taken up in the defense evidence has not been suggested to the

prosecution witnesses and the other is that in contrast to the evidence of the

4

prosecution witnesses, which the Learned Trial Judge goes so far as to say has

no contradictions, the defense evidence ought to be rejected.

The Learned Senior State Counsel in his written submissions submits that

the Learned Trial Judge had very correctly analyzed the evidence in this case

and had given cogent reasons as to why the prosecution's evidence was relied

on and why the defense evidence was rejected. He further submits that the

Supreme Court in Alwis Vs. Piyasena Fernando 1993 [1] SLR 119 has held that

"it was well established that findings of primary facts by a trial judge who hears

and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed in appeal."

In the case of The Attorney General V s. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

2011 [2] SLR 292 at 307 Shiranee Thilakawardena J citing R vs. Paul states that

"There is simply no jurisdiction in an appellate Court to upset trial [mdings of

fact that have evidentiary support. A Court of Appeal improperly substitutes its

view of the facts of a case when it seeks for whatever reason to replace those

made by the trail judge. It is also to be noted that the state is not obliged to

disapprove every speculative scenano consistent with the innocence of an

accused". Her Ladyship further observed that "In view of the facts elicited by

the prosecution and indeed the real evidence discovered by the officers

conducting the investigation, it cannot be said that the factual conclusion drawn

by the trial judge is either unsupported or unreasonable."

5

In considering the credibility of a witness it was further observed in

above case by Her Ladyship that "a key test of credibility is whether the witness

is an interested or a disinterested witness. Rajarathnam J in Tudor Perera Vs.

AG observed that when considering the evidence of an interested witness who

may desire to conceal the truth, such evidence must be scrutinized with some

care. The independent witness will normally be preffered to an interested

witness in case of conflict. Matters of motive, prejudice, partiality, accuracy,

incentive and reliablility have all to be weighed (Vide, Halsbury Laws of

England 4th Edition para 29) Therefore, the relative weight attached to the

evidence of an interested witness who is a near relative of the accused or whose

interests are closely identified with one party may not prevail over the testimony

of an independent witness (vide Hasker Vs. Summers - Australia; Leefunteum

Vs. Beaudoin- Canada). "

In Gunasiri & 2 others Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka 2009 [1] SLR 39

His Lordship Sisira de Abrew J has stated that it is a rule of essential justice that

whenever the opponent has declined to avoid himself of the opportunity to put

his case in cross - examination it must follow that the evidence tendered on that

issue ought to be accepted. The failure to suggest the defense of alibi to the

prosecution witnesses, who implicated the accused, indicated that it was a false

one.

tI t,

In the instant case it is clear that the contention which was taken up in the

defense case is significantly different to the contention suggested to the

prosecution witnesses by the defense Counsel at the time of trial.

Considering the relationship between the witness and the Appellant and

the probability of her version being true in light of the independent evidence

presented to Court on the facts of this case, I am of the opinion that the Learned

Trial Judge had no alternative other than rejecting the evidence of the Defense.

Therefore, I see no reason to interfere with the decision of the Learned

Trial Judge.

As such this Court dismisses the instant Appeal and affirms the

conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned Trial Judge.

Appeal dismissed.
