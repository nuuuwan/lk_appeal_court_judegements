********

L.T.B. Dehideniya, J.

The appellant has sent a petition to HIL the President of

the Court of Appeal informing, among other things, that he is serving

a term of life imprisonment. This fact was not brought to the notice

to the Court before.

The appellant appeared personally before this Court on

08.05.2015 and the case was fixed for argument on 20.10.2015, but

was adjourned on the application of the Counsel of the appellant.

Thereafter the appellant being absent and unrepresented on the date of

argument, the case fixed for judgment. Now it is brought to the

notice of the Court that he is in the prison. Unless the Court orders

the prison authorities to produce the appellant in Court, he is unable

to present himself in Court.

Under these circumstances, I order to remove the case

from the judgment list.

3

I direct the Registrar to issue notice to the Superintendent

of Prison, Monaragala to produce the appellant in Court on the next

date.

I further order to Issue notice on the Respondent informing

that the case is removed from the judgment list and will be

mentioned.

Mention on 10.11.2016.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

H.C.J. Madawala, J.

I agree.
