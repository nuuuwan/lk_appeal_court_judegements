Order

Vijith K. MaJaJgoda PC J (PICA)

Petitioner to the present application Chandima Ranaweera Gamage had come before this court

seeking inter alia,

c) Grant a mandate in the nature of Writ of certiorari quashing the decision

embodied in P-2 to conduct a disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner.

d) Grant a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision

embodied/reflected in P-4, P-5 and P-6c to defer two salary increments of the

Petitioner.

The Petitioner who is a project co-ordinator of the 15t Respondent Authority was serving in the

District of Hambantota.

As revealed before this court, there were certain complaints with regard to some irregularities of

the service of the Petitioner and he has been transferred to the office of the District Director-

Monaragala pending disciplinary action, in the same capacity. By the letter dated 1503.2012 the

Petitioner was informed of a preliminary investigation being conducted by the 11th Respondent

on the said complaints.

The Petitioner was summoned for the said preliminary investigation on two occasions and his

statement was recorded. Subsequent to the recording of the statement of the Petitioner, he has

received a letter dated 14.06.2012 from the 9th Respondent informing the Petitioner that,

a) The 11th Respondent has completed the preliminary investigation and forwarded the

said report to the meeting of the Board of Directors which was held on 14.06.2012.

5

b) After considering the said report which was forwarded by the 9th Respondent, it was

decided by the Board of Directors to conduct a further investigation regarding the

said allegations.

c) The 2nd, 9th, 10th and 11th Respondents were appointed as the investigation committee.

d) The said investigation would be held on 21.06.2012 at the Head Office of the 1st

Respondent Authority and the Petitioner was requested to attend the said inquiry with

the documentary evidence to be submitted to the investigation committee.

The investigation referred to above had been conducted as scheduled and according to the

Petitioner, six officers along with the Petitioner were summoned for the said inquiry and the

attendance was signed. Eventhough six officers were summoned, only five officers were present.

The 11th Respondent, was asked by the 2nd Respondent to explain the allegations against the five

officers present and thereafter two officers from the internal audit division submitted certain

documentation in order to substantiate the allegations and the Petitioner and the four others

denied the allegations against them, with documentation to support their version.

However as submitted by the Petitioner, no charges were framed against them or read out to

them at the said inquiry and the inquiry was lasted for about two hours.

The Petitioner had received another letter dated the same, informing him that his transfer to

Monaragala had been cancelled on sympathetic grounds after considering his appeal with effect

from 01.07.2013 and informed him to report to Hambantota Office.

On 05.07.2012 the 2nd Respondent had issued another letter to the Petitioner, and by the said

letter the Petitioner was informed that, according to the audit report dated 23.05.2012 prepared

by the 9th Respondent and submitted to the Director Board on 14.06.2012 through the 2nd

Respondent,

6

a) Eight charges in respect of irregularities in distributing banana plants in the

Hambantota District under the "Divinaguma Project 2011."

b) Eight charges connected with submitting fraudulent documents in respect of obtaining

plants

were made against the Petitioner and a committee comprising of 2nd, 9th and 10th

Respondents having conducted an inquiry on 21.06.2012 by summoning the relevant officers

before them had found the Petitioner guilty of 14 charges and decided to,

1. Warn the Petitioner

ll. Defer the next two salary increments of the Petitioner CP4)

As observed by this court documents P-4 refers to 16 charges against the Petitioner and after the

said investigation/inquiry, the Petitioner was found guilty of 14 charges. However the position

taken up by the Petitioner, right throughout this case was that, the Petitioner was neither served

or informed of any charges prior to the said investigation/inquiry nor a proper disciplinary

inquiry held against him.

In this regard the Respondents have drawn the attention of this court to the section 7 of the

Administrative Code of the 1st Respondent Authority where it is provided for a Summary

Procedure to conduct a disciplinary inquiry. Whilst relying on the provisions of the said section,

the Respondents took up the position that the inquiry referred to in P-4 was conducted under

section 7 of the Administrative Code.

According to section 7 of the Administrative Code of the 1st Respondent a summary inquiry will

be held against an employee, when that employee was found responsible with clear evidence for

committing minor offence after a preliminary investigation.

7

Under section 7.2 there is duty on the officer who conducted the summary inquiry to explain the

charges to the employee. Under the same Administrative Code minor offence is identified as an

offence where dismissal or a fine up to three days salary is not warranted and schedule (b) to

section 4 of the said Code identifies some of the minor offence as,

a) Failure to report to work without valid reason

b) Getting late to report to work without valid reason

c) Causing damage to property by negligent Act

d) Work slow or work without due attention

e) Sleep during office hours

t) Disrespect to public

g) Falsely pretending as sick during office hours

Section 14.2 of the Administrative Code further provides that, when imposing a sentence for

committing a minor offence, more than one punishment cannot be imposed. For example a

warning and a fine cannot be imposed together and it should be only one punishment.

However when considering the 16 charges referred to in P-4 it is clear that the offences referred

to in P-4 does not come under any of the minor offences identified under schedule (b) to section

4 of the Administrative Code. It is further observed by this court, that the sentence imposed was

also contrary to the provisions in section 14.2 of the Administrative Code.

When considering the above provisions of the Administrative Code of the 15t Respondent this

Court cannot agree with the arguments raised by the Respondents, that the disciplinary inquiry

referred to above was conducted under the summary procedure identified in the Administrative

Code of the 15t Respondent Authority.

According to P-2 a committee comprising of 4 members including the 2nd, 9th, 10th and 11th

Respondents were nominated to hold the investigation by the Board of Directors but according to

8

P-4 the committee which considered the material against the Petitioner comprised only three

members including 2nd ,9th ,and 10th Respondents and the 11 th Respondent was summoned as a

witness before the said committee. In these circumstances it is further observed that there wasn't

a proper appointment to the committee to investigate the irregularities committed by the

Petitioner.

The Respondents have further argued that, the Petitioner is estopped from objecting to the

procedure followed in conducting the inquiry for the reasons, that

a) The procedure followed is provided under section 7 of the Administrative Code

b) Petitioner had consented for the conduct of the said inquiry by signing the attendance

on that day

However this court cannot agree with the said argument raised on behalf of the Respondent for

the reason that,

a) The procedure followed by the Respondents in conducting the disciplinary inquiry is

contrary to the provisions of the Administrative Code of the 15t Respondent.

b) Even if there was consent, (Petitioner has challenged this position) a consent given to

an illegal procedure to follow, cannot be considered as true consent.

When going through the procedure follow by the Respondents in conducting the disciplinary

inquiry against the Petitioner this court further observes that, the Respondents have failed to hold

a proper disciplinary inquiry by

a) Informing the charges against the Petitioner

b) Giving an opportunity to get ready for the inquiry

c) Place the evidence against the Petitioner when he is present before the inquiry and

giving him an opportunity to cross examine the witnesses

9

d) Give an opportunity to place his evidence before the inquiry

and thereby failed to followed the principles of Natural Justice when conducting the said

inquiry.

It is observed by Mallick, that "Natural Justice" requires that persons liable to be directed by acts

decision, or proceedings of any authority be given adequate notice of what is proposed- so that

they may be in a position to make a representation on their behalf, to appear at hearing and

enquiry and effectively prepare their own case and answer the case. Writs Law and Practice

M.R. Mallick at page 757.

In the case of Trianbak Pati Tripathi Vs, BH.SJ. Education Allahabad AIR 1973 All 1 it was

held that, "one of the essential principles of Natural Justice is that the persons whose rights are to

be affected must be given notice of the case or the charges which he has to meet."

In the case of Sevaragen V. Race Relation Board [1976J 1 All ER 12 (CA) Lord Denning M.R.

has held that, "the fundamental rule is that if a person be subjected to pains or penalties, or

exposed to perverse proceedings, or deprived of remedies or redress, or in some other way

adversely affected by the investigation and report, then he should be informed the case against

him and be afforded fair opportunity of answering it."

In the case of Nanaykkara V. University of Peradeniya (1985) 1 Sri LR 174 it was held that,

"the right to a fair hearing is a rule of universal application and in case of administrative acts or

decisions affecting the rights the duty to afford it is a duty lying upon everyone who decide

anything."

When considering the material already discussed above it is clear that the Respondents have

acted in violation of the rules of Natural Justice when conducting the disciplinary inquiry as

referred to in P-2 and imposing a punishment to the Petitioner as revealed in documents P-4.

10

In the said circumstance this court concludes that the Petitioner is entitled to the relief clamed in

paragraphs (c) and (d) of his petition and therefore I make order granting the relief prayed for in

paragraphs (c) and (d) of the petition with cost to be paid to the Petitioner fixed at Rs. 10,000/-
