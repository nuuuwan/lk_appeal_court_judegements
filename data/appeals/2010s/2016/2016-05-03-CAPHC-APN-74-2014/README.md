Malinie Gunaratne, J.

The Petitioner being an aggrieved party, has filed this application and

moves,

(a) To revise the Judgment dated 14.03.2014 made in Case No.

160/2000 of the Provincial High Court of Kandy;

(b) order 2nd Respondent to frame charges against the accused for

the injuries caused to the Petitioner;

(c) consider enhancement of sentence for the accused to the charge

he pleaded guilty.

The 1 st Accused - Respondent was indicted in the High Court of Kandy,

for causing the death of Don Henry Peter Vittatchi, on or about 08.08.1997

and thereby committing an offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal

Code.

After evidence of five witnesses were led on behalf of the prosecution on

14.03.2014 the 1 st Respondent pleaded guilty to the charge under Section 297

of the Penal Code; culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis

the accused had acted under sudden provocation. It is to be noted that the 2nd

4

Respondent had taken time nearly Two and a half years (2 ~ years) to

consider with regard to the plea for lesser offence.

The learned State Counsel and the Defence Counsel made submissions as

to the facts and circumstances of the case. The learned State Counsel invited

the Court to impose an appropriate sentence considering the serious nature of

the offence, which should serve as a deterrent. The learned Defence Counsel

also made submissions in mitigation of sentence.

Thereupon, the learned Trial Judge sentenced the 1 st Respondent to a

term of two years (02 years) rigorous imprisonment and suspended the same

for fifteen years (15 years) and a fine of Rupees One thousand five hundred

(Rs.15001-) with a default sentence of six months (06 months) imprisonment.

The Petitioner who is a son of the deceased, being aggrieved by the said

order has filed this application and has moved to set aside the said sentence

imposed on the 1 st Respondent on the basis that it is totally disproportionate

having regard to the serious nature of the offence to which the 1 st Respondent

had pleaded guilty. It seems that it is the main relief that the Petitioner has

sought by this application.

The 2nd relief of the prayer is, Order 2nd Respondent to frame charges

against the 1 st Respondent for the injuries caused to the Petitioner. It is the

stance of the learned State Counsel that it is upon the opinion of the 2nd

Respondent, indictment is to be dispatched or not. Further she has contended

the 2nd Respondent has a statutory discretion. However, I am of the view

when there is cogent and sufficient evidence against a person, the 2nd

Respondent's duty is to file indictment against the person.

5

Even though at this juncture this Court has no power to make any order

with regard to the 2nd relief, it is to be noted, on perusal of the evidence led in

the Trial Court, the Judicial Medical Officer has given evidence and the

prosecution, has marked a Medical Report through him 'P 5' (vide Page 148)

as to Petitioner's injuries. The Judicial Medical Officer has stated, out of the

injuries he had observed on the Petitioner the injury No.2 of the MLR was

grievous injury. (Vide Page 150).

It is significant to note, even though the victim (Petitioner) had been

listed as the 3rd witness in the list of witnesses and being an eye witness also,

without having led his evidence, the Medical Report as to Petitioner's injuries

has been produced through the Judicial Medical Officer. Even the learned

Trial Judge also has not taken into consideration that fact. Accordingly, I am

of the view a grave injustice has been caused to the Petitioner as the 2nd

Respondent has failed to indict the 1 st Respondent for attempted murder or at

least for causing grievous hurt.

When considering the merits of the case, the central issue to be decided

here is whether the sentence imposed by the learned Trial Judge is inadequate

and inappropriate having regard to the serious nature of offence for which the

1 st Respondent had been convicted.

Before addressing my mind to the above matter, it is pertinent to refer

briefly to the facts of the case.

The deceased is the Petitioner's father and the 1 st Respondent is the

accused son-in-law. On 08.08.1997, while the deceased was having his

dinner, the 1 st Respondent who was drunk and shouting opposite the house of

the deceased threatened to kill him uttering obscene and abusive language.

6

Then the deceased told him through the front window of his house "if you

drank, go home without shouting". Thereafter the 1 st Respondent left the

place and returned armed with a weapon (Chisel). He broke the front door of

the house of the deceased; entered the house and stabbed the decease on the

chest to death. The Petitioner who is the son of the deceased bent to hold the

deceased and to help him; and at that time the Petitioner was also stabbed on

his back behind his chest. The Petitioner was hospitalized and had to undergo

a surgery.

In the oral and written submissions of the Counsel for the Petitioner, it

was contended that, the 75 year old person died instantly and his son nearly

escaped death. He further contended if the stab went just another Y4 inch deep

his heart would have got injured and he too would have died.

The learned Counsel further contended, the 1 st Respondent had broken

the closed door of the house into pieces and forcibly entered and committed

the murder and stabbed the Petitioner also. His stance is the deceased was

inside his house and never provoked the 1 st Respondent.

Hence, it is the stance of the learned Counsel, that the sentence passed by

the High Court of Kandy is illegal and inadequate, therefore it has to be

enhanced to a custodial imprisonment and a sufficient compensation also has

to be awarded to the Petitioner.

It is submitted by the learned Counsel for the 1 st Respondent that it was

revealed in evidence that the 1 st Respondent also sustained injuries in the

incident and was hospitalised. Further submitted, the 1 st Respondent tendered

a plea under Section 297 on the basis of sudden fight and grave and sudden

provocation.

7

The State Counsel has contended on behalf of the 2nd Respondent that,

there was evidence of the 1 st Respondent also having sustained injuries. Both

Counsel have contended that the Petitioner has suppressed that fact and

therefore Petitioner's application ought to be dismissed in limine.

It is relevant to note, on perusal of the evidence given by the 1 st and 2nd

witnesses of the prosecution, it has not been suggested to them by the Defence

Counsel that the injuries were caused by the witnesses or how the 1 st

Respondent sustained the injuries.

It is evident by the following questions put to the 1 st witness and the 2nd

witness of the prosecution:

To the 1 st witness:

(g) @@ e)o)ffi~ @~@E)eD @cmdeD) t:J)oo@eD e@eD @e!V~eD @@@ 8t!GJ@~eD ag

To the 2nd witness:

(g) e@eD(s) o@e!V)e,oocm qe6 @E)OO @)Q} t;,~6~t:D SJO) e)o)ffioo~O q)E) @E))

e@eD(s) 8~ eD~ffi~eD) tSk~) @@ @~:)deD) t:J)OOW.

Credibility of these witnesses has not been assailed throughout the cross-

examination.

Hence, there is no clear evidence to show how the 1 st Respondent

sustained injuries. I am of the view it is the duty of the Defence Counsel to

8

convince the Court that the deceased party caused the InJunes to the 1 st

Respondent as he has alleged.

Be that as it may it is evident, that the incident had taken inside the house

of the deceased. There is overwhelming evidence to that effect. Evidence of

P WI, P W 2 and P W 6 (Police Officer who visited the scene) support it.

The Defence Counsel also has conceded it. P W 1 constantly takes the

position that the 1 st Respondent was drunk and shouting opposite the house of

the deceased; threatening to kill him. Then the deceased told him "if you

drank go home without shouting". Then the 1 st Respondent left the place and

few minutes later came back with a weapon, broke the front door, came inside

and stabbed the deceased. Credibility of this witness has not been assailed

throughout the cross examination.

Also when the Defence Counsel made submissions in mitigation it has

not been explained how the 1 st Respondent had sustained injuries. He has

submitted "aO)ljei)~ ~eDei) q0)6 t5)SG5@ ~~6G5t;D cle)~aG5t5)eD Se:GJG5 qlj~e)(~P

~G5ei)w. ~O) Q)w@ @fV@) (6)e5)@ (5)0)t;D6 Se:; ~e) O)e:De)eD qei)e)6~G5 e:J

~~ei)e)."

Accordingly, it is evident that the 1st Respondent intentionally has come

to the house of the deceased with a weapon to harm him. However the

learned Trial Judge and the 2nd Respondent have agreed to accept a plea under

Section 297 on the basis the 1 st Respondent had acted under sudden

provocation, although such situation had not been established by any

evidence.

9

Be that as it may, assuming that the 1 st Respondent had acted under

sudden provocation, it is to be considered whether the sentence that was

imposed by the learned Trial Judge is adequate and appropriate.

When a person commits a crime by violating criminal law, he is punished

by imprisonment, a fine or any other mode of punishment which is prescribed

in criminal law. The criminal is to be punished simply because he has

committed a crime. If punishment is not properly imposed, the aggrieved

party may take the law into their hands and attempt to punish the offender.

The purpose of a criminal punishment may vary. Protection of society,

deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend,

retribution and reform. The purpose overlap and none of them can be

considered in isolation from the other when determining what an appropriate

sentence is, in a particular case.

The main objective of criminal justice is to protect society from criminals

by punishing them under the existing penal system. The Court has to weigh

all relevant factors in order to determine the blameworthiness of the offender.

The determination of the right measure of punishment is not an easy task,

and no hard and fast rule can be laid down. The Court has always to bear in

mind the necessity of balancing the offence, the offender and the punishment.

In other words the Court should impose a balanced punishment taking into

consideration the offence and the offender both.

As to the matter of assessing sentence in the case of Attorney General vs.

H.N.G De Silva (Supra) Basnayake A.C.J. observed as follows:-

" ............. in assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, a

Judge should consider the matter of sentence both from the point of view of

the public and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the question

only from the angle of the offender. A judge should in determining the proper

sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence, as it appears from the nature

of the act itself and should have regard to the punishment provided in the

Penal Code or other Statute under which the offender is charged. The

reformation of the criminal, though no doubt an important consideration is

subordinate to the others I have mentioned. Where the public interest or the

welfare of the State (which are synonymous) outweighs the previous good

character, antecedents and age of the offender, public interest must prevail"

In the case of Attorney General vs. Mendis 1995 (1) SLR 138, it was

held, to decide what sentence is to be imposed on the Accused, the judge has

to consider the point of view of the Accused on the one hand and the interests

of the society on the other. In deciding what sentence is to be imposed the

judge must necessarily consider the nature of the offence committed, the

gravity of the offence, the manner in which it has been committed, the

machinations and manipulations resorted to by the Accused to commit the

offence, the persons who are affected by such crime, the ingenuity in which it

has been committed and the involvement of others in committing the crime.

It has been held in Santa Singh vs. State of Punjab AIR 1976 S.C. 2386,

that, before imposing an appropriate degree of punishment a "hearing" directs

the Court's attention to such matters as the nature of the offence, a prior

criminal record, if any, of the offender, his age and record of employment, his

background with reference to education and home life and the possibility of

treatment of training. Also to the possibility that the punishment may act as a

11

deterrent to both the offender and others, and meets the current community

needs, if any, for such deterrent in respect of that particular type of offence.

Ravji vs. State of Rajasthan (1996) 2 S C C 175, it was held "it is the

nature and gravity of the crime and not the criminal which are germane for

consideration of appropriate punishments in a criminal trial".

In Dhannajay Chatterjee vs. State of W.B. (1994) 2 S C C 220, it was

held "The Court must not only keep in view the rights of the criminal but also

the rights of the victim of the crime and the society at large while considering

the imposition of appropriate punishment".

In the case of Attorney General vs. Janak Sri Uluwaduge and Another

(1995) 1 S.L.R. 157, it was held in determining the proper sentence, the Judge

should consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from the nature of the

act itself and should have regard to the punishment provided in the Penal

Code or other statute under which the offender is charged. He should also

regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent

it will be effective.

It was held in Percy Nanayakkara vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1993) 1

S L R 71, that in assessing punishment the Court has to consider the matter

from the point of both the offender and the Public.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner contended that the offence for

which the 1 st Respondent has pleaded guilty is of a serious nature and has

been committed with much deliberation and calls for the imposition of an

immediate custod ial sentence.

12

When I perused the Order of the learned Trial Judge, it clearly indicates

that he has looked at the question only from the angle of the offender. In his

Order he has said

"reO)~G5 B~@ B~@C ~B6JG)w 8s~ ~ex:5a)@eJ ~ex:5a)@(5)O) e;D~~ ~ ree5)

tl~() BcsS~el)B e:J@c reO) @B6tl~~e;D~@tlQ} @el)e:J@ e;D6~~ ~~6)@@) @C5.)el)

Be5)O) B~ ~~tl ,ffiw@ e;D6."

It is clearly shown that the learned Trial Judge has looked at one side of

the picture; the side of the 1st Respondent. He has failed to consider the

gravity of the offence and the manner and the circumstances in which it was

committed.

I am of the view that the I st Respondent had been the perpetrator of a

very serious crime which had been committed with much deliberation and

planning. Had the learned Trial Judge considered the relevant factors or

criteria referred to above in determining what the appropriate sentence should

have been, the sentence imposed on the I st Respondent may well have been

different.

Having regard to the serious nature and the manner in which the offence

has been committed by the 1 st Respondent, I am of the view that the sentence

imposed in his case is grossly inadequate. I cannot escape from the

conclusion that the 1 st Respondent has been too leniently treated by the

learned Trial Judge. Such lenient treatment of an offender for such serious

crime is bound to defeat the main object of punishment, which is the

prevention of crimes.

13

In this case the learned Trial Judge has sentenced the 1st Respondent to a

term of two years (02 years) rigorous imprisonment and suspended the same

for fifteen years (15) years) and has imposed a fine of Rupees One thousand

five hundred (Rs.15001-) with a default sentence of six months imprisonment.

It is to be noted, even though the Court has a discretion to impose a

suspended sentence, it should be taken giving due regard to the specific

provision listed under Section 303 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Specific

guide lines listed under Section 303 (1) (a) - (i). If a trial judge wishes to

impose a suspended sentence of imprisonment he should address his mind to

all the issues listed under Section 303 (1) (a) - (i) and also reasons to be stated

in writing.

In this case the learned Trial Judge has not addressed his mind to these

issues. Also he has not stated the reasons to impose a suspended sentence.

Although it is an admitted fact that, the quantum of sentence is a matter for the

discretion of the Trial Judge, an Appellate Court has the power to interfere if

the Trial Judge has exercised its discretion improperly or wrongly.

On the material before this Court, I am satisfied that there has been a

wrongful exercise of discretion in that, no weight, or no sufficient weight has

been given to the relevant considerations enumerated above. Accordingly, the

Order made by the learned Trial Judge in respect of the 1 st Respondent, should

be set aside.

It is seen, several aggravating circumstances are present in this case. I

cannot escape from the conclusion that the 1 st Respondent has been too

leniently treated by the learned Trial Judge without any justifiable reason. The

offence is far too grave to be dealt with a suspended imprisonment. There is

14

no doubt that the crime committed by the 1 st Respondent is a heinous crime

which requires a deterrent punishment.

On the whole I am of the VIew that public interest demand that a

custodial sentence be imposed in this case, having taken into consideration the

nature, gravity of the offence and the manner in which it has been committed,

I set aside the Order of the learned Trial Judge, and the 1st Respondent is

sentenced to six years (06 years) rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rupees

Ten Thousand (Rs.lO,OOOI-) in default a sentence of six months (06 months)

simple imprisonment.

The sentence imposed on the 1 st Respondent shall be implemented from

today.
