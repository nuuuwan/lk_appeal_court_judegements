COUNSEL Defendant-Appellants absent and

unrepresented.

Kuvera De Soyza P.e. with Thusitha

Nanayakkara for the Plaintiff-Respondent.

Argued on 31.03.2015

Decided on 13.11.2015

A.H.M.D. NAWAZ, J,

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Plaintiff") filed

this action on 2ih June 1979 to partition a land called "PEHEBIYAGAHA WATTA",

among the parties specified in the pedigree annexed with the plaint. A commission

7

was issued to W.A.Garvin Silva, Licensed Surveyor, whose Plan bearing No.2462

dated 2ih and 28th September, 1981 and his report were filed of record marked X

and Xl respectively. The corpus to be partitioned is depicted as Lots A to D

containing in extent 2 acres and 28.5 perches. The surveyor has identified the land

depicted in his plan as the corpus to be partitioned among the parties.

The 10th and 11th Defendants filed their statement of claim disputing the pedigree of

the plaintiff and sought a partition of the corpus in terms of the pedigree submitted

by them. The 19th, 20th and 21st added-defendants also filed their statement of claim

and claimed a partition of the corpus according the pedigree of the 10th and 11th

Defendants.

When this case was taken up for trial on 13th January 1984, the parties agreed

without any contest that Lots A to D as shown in Plan NO.2462 dated 2ih September

1981 constituted the corpus. Thereafter, issues Nos.l to 7 were raised on behalf of

the Plaintiff, issues Nos.8 to 14 on behalf of the 10th and 11th Defendants and issues

No.ls on behalf of 23rd Defendant respectively. As the adduction of evidence

proceeded, some more issues were raised with regard to plantations and

improvements in the corpus. On behalf of the 1st Defendant only one issue was raised

as to the plantations. However, 13th to 18th Defendants-Appellants had not raised any

issue, either regarding the corpus or plantations, but stated that they relied on the

issues raised by the 10th and 11th Defendants.

Previous Trial

Upon a perusal of the appeal brief, it appears that there was a previous trial that had

been conducted before. In that trial the Plaintiff gave evidence in the first instance

and produced documents marked 'Pl' to 'P13'. He explained how the property

devolved on the parties from the original owners. After the conclusion of the

8

Plaintiff's evidence the Court entered judgment on 2ih April 1984. On 31st May 1984,

the Counsel for the 23rd Defendant moved Court to set aside the judgment entered in

the case and the application was considered by Court subject to costs in favor of

other parties. On 1ih February 1988, Court had allowed the application to set aside

the judgment and with the consent of all the parties, the judgment was set aside by

the then learned District Judge and the case was re-fixed for fresh trial.

Fresh Trial which gives rise to the Instant Appeal

Accordingly, on 1ih February 1988, admissions and fresh issues were framed. As

stated in the anterior part of this judgment, issues Nos. 1 - 7 wee formulated by the

Plaintiff, issues Nos. 8 - 14 by the 10th and 11th Defendants, and issues No.1s was

raised by 23rd Defendant respectively. No other party raised issues. Thereafter, when

the trial resumed on 20th July 1988, the Plaintiff gave evidence. The Plaintiff was

cross-examined only by the 1st, 10th, 11th and 19th Defendants. Under cross-

examination by the Counsel for the 10th and 11th Defendants, the Plaintiff clearly

delineated as to how the title devolved from the original owners, and thereafter on

the persons mentioned in the pedigree filed by him. He concluded his evidence by

stating that he was seeking to partition the corpus among the parties stated in the

plaint vis-a-vis their respective shares and that the plantations must be divided

according to the soil rights. His testimony of course lasted for several days.

Thereafter as the 1 i h Defendant who was called to give evidence crossed the great

divide, the 13th Defendant was next called to testify. Upon the disclosure in the

course of his evidence that there were new parties, the Court made an order to add

them as parties to the case. Subsequently on 31st January 1995, the 13th Defendant's

evidence began afresh. In his evidence the 13th Defendant admitted most of the

matters pertaining to the devolution of title mentioned by the Plaintiff in his

9

~ l

\

t i i

i

\ ;

pedigree. He admitted that the Plaintiff who was residing in the land had been in

possession of the plantations since 1958. He also admitted that just like the Plaintiff,

the other persons shown in Plaintiff's pedigree were also residing on the land.

It appears from the record that the case of the 10th Defendant brought forth

documents 10V1 to 10V2. The 11th, 13th - 18th and 19th Defendants closed their case

without producing any documents. The 23rd Defendant had moved for a date to give

evidence but on the date of resumption of the trial it was stated that he would not

give evidence-vide pages 221 and 222 of Appeal Brief. Thereafter, the parties filed

their written submissions and the case was fixed for judgment which was delivered

on 1ih October 1995 by the learned District Judge. So much for the concatenation of

chronology in the court a quo.

It is only the 13th to 18th Defendants who have preferred this appeal. One has to bear

in mind that although there was no dispute over the corpus, the contest revolved

around the pedigree submitted by the Plaintiff, which had been accepted by all other

parties except the 10th, 11th and 13th to 18th Defendants. It must be borne in mind

that the Appellants (13th to 18th Defendants) neither raised any points of contest nor

did they cross-examine the Plaintiff at the trial. Although the 10th and 11th

Defendants disputed the Plaintiff's pedigree, they did not prefer to give evidence to

establish their pedigree and devolution of title. Such failure on their part does not

advance their cause. When a party disputes the Plaintiff's pedigree and relies on a

different pedigree for his title and ownership, it is his bounden duty to establish his

pedigree and I must state that the 10th and 11th Defendants have failed to discharge

this burden.

10

I am therefore of the view that the corpus should be partitioned according to the

proven pedigree filed by the Plaintiff, and the plantations as allotted by the

judgment.

It must be noted that on 16th March 1992 after the Plaintiff's evidence was

concluded, the 1 ih Defendant was called to give evidence. But it is not clear whether

the Plaintiff had closed his case. It is not recorded as to whether Plaintiff's case was

closed. The 1 i h Defendant was called without following this procedure. After the

Plaintiff's evidence, no other witnesses were called for the Plaintiff. The 10th and 11th

Defendants who filed a contesting pedigree have not given evidence.

The record reveals that the 1ih Defendant after his examination-in-chief had died.

On osth October 1993, parties agreed to recant the evidence already given by the

deceased 1ih Defendant and call the 13th Defendant to give evidence on behalf of

the contesting defendants in order to prove the pedigree filed by the 10th and 11th

Defendants. It must be noted that the 13th Defendant was called to give evidence not

only for himself but also for 10th, 11th, 13th to 18th and 19th Defendants who were all

supportive of the pedigree of 10th and 11th Defendants.

On a perusal of the evidence of the 13th Defendant, it is very clear that he does not

know his family background and he further admitted that it was not him who gave

instructions to his lawyer to prepare the pedigree. His evidence is perse

contradictory. His evidence given on the first day was departed from on the second

day. His evidence is nothing but admission of the devolution of title to the parties

mentioned in the pedigree of the Plaintiff. He miserably failed to give a satisfactory

evidence as to the devolution on their pedigree. The learned District Judged has

commented on this evidence as "hopelessly bad". Surprisingly, the 13th Defendant

virtually admitted the Plaintiff's pedigree and stated "the plaintiff and his

11

predecessors in title have had long years of possession for the plantations, and

Premadasa (plaintiff) came to reside in 1958 and I admit that the persons mentioned

in plaintiff's pedigree are residing on the land". (See pages 208, 217 and 220 of the

Appeal brief). If that is the position, the 13th Defendant, who has given evidence on

behalf of 10th and 11th Defendants and 13th to 18th Defendants-Appellants can be

taken into account as a party who has accepted the Plaintiff's pedigree. It was in such

a background that the learned District Judge has rejected the pedigree filed by the

10th and 11th Defendants.

The 13th to 18th Defendants who have now appealed against the judgment, filed their

statements of claim and stated that they accepted the pedigree filed by the 10th and

11th Defendants. The 19th to 21st Defendants who were later added, also relied on the

pedigree of the 10th and 11th Defendants. Hence, the real contest is between the

pedigree the plaintiff and the pedigree asserted by the 10th and 11th Defendants. But

the question is whether, as against the Plaintiff's pedigree, the pedigree of the 10th

and 11th Defendant has been proved? The testimony of the 13th Defendant has failed

to furnish satisfactory proof of the pedigree and therefore, as the learned District

Judge commented, the second pedigree stands unproved. The 13th Defendant has,

admittedly stated that the Plaintiff has allotted shares correctly to the respective

Defendants, and thereby he has contradicted his own pedigree. He did not know

how many daughters his predecessor "Velun" had and how many sisters and

brothers his mother had.

In the written submissions of the 13th to 18th Defendants, it is stated that the reasons

for the appeal are given in paragraph 10 of their Petition of Appeal, and they plead

that on the grounds stated therein the judgment of the learned District Judge must

12

f ! I I I , , !

be set aside. What they have stated in paragraph 10 that is the pedigree which they

have filed in the District Court and that is the one which remains unproved.

In these circumstances there is no evidence before the Appellate Court to establish

the pedigree filled by the 10th and 11th Defendants although sufficient opportunity

was available to establish it at the trial before the lower Court? Proof of pedigree

should have been done by adducing sufficient evidence, by the parties who rely on

that pedigree. The contesting pedigree was filed by the 10th and 11th Defendants, on

which the 13th to the 18th Defendants-Appellants have relied. In the absence of such

proof, the learned District Judge has correctly accepted the unchallenged pedigree of

the Plaintiff, which is proved to the satisfaction of the Court, and entered judgment

on that pedigree.

Considering the stand taken by the parties and the evidence led in the case, I am of

the view that the Defendants have totally failed to lead any evidence against the

evidence of the Plaintiff on the pedigree submitted by him. The 13th to the 18th

Defendants have not raised any issue at the trial. They said that they would accept

the pedigree filed by the 10th and 11th Defendants. If these two Defendants opted

not to give any evidence, and the 13th Defendant gave unsatisfactory evidence, it is

the duty of the other Defendants to produce sufficient evidence to prove the

pedigree which they rely upon. I must state that no such obligation was ever

undertaken by any of the Defendants. Certainly a Defendant in a partition suit stands

in the shoes of a Plaintiff and this dual capacity imposes a burden on the Defendant

to adduce proof of his title as the duty of a judge to investigate title cannot be

effectively discharged without adduction of some evidence towards proof of facta

probanda. In any event a District Court cannot embark on a wild goose chase or a

voyage of discovery in the discharge of its task of fact finding if parties for bear to

13

!

\

adduce evidence of the case they have placed before court - see Bandi Naide v Appu

Naide {1923} 5 CL Recorder 192 for the proposition of double capacity of Plaintiff and

Defendant.

The 10th and 11th Defendants further to the devolution on the pedigree, also

depended on prescriptive title. But they failed to raise any issue as to prescription

nor did they lead any evidence to prove prescription in their favour.

The learned District Judge has gone into the question of devolution of title and the

persons who are entitled to the buildings and plantations. In this regard, the learned

Judge has considered the oral evidence as well as the documents marked and

produced

Therefore, I hold that the learned District Judge's finding to allot the respective

shares to the parties in his judgment is correct. The learned District Judge has taken

into consideration of the claims of the parties to the buildings, plantations and

improvements and how they should be allotted to the parties concerned.

In the circumstances, this appeal is dismissed with costs and the record is sent back

to the lower Court to proceed with further steps to partition the land and to allot the

buildings and plantations in terms of the judgment entered in the case.
