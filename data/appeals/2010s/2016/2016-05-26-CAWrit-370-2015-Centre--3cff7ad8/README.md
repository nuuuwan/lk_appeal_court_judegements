the Department of Zoological Gardens of wild animals that are found orphaned, abandoned or

injured or are rescued by the Department of Wildlife Conservation;

As observed by this court the two Petitioners lSI being an organization involved in the conservation

and preservation of fauna and flora of Sri Lanka and the 2nd being a writer who advocates animal

rights through her writings and also a past secretary for the society for the Protection of Animal Rights

have filed the present application as public spirited persons.

In the case of Wijesiri V. Siriwardena [1982J 1 Sri LR 171 Court of Appeal has confirmed the right

of the Petitioners to invoke writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in the public interest. In the said

case Wimalarathne J whilst Ratwatte J concurring held, "To apply for a Writ of Mandamus it is not

necessary to have personal interest but it is sufficient if the applicant can show a genuine interest in the

matter complained of and that he comes before court as a public spirited person, concern to see that the

law is obeyed in the interest of all." Having considered the material placed we are satisfied that the

Petitioners to the case in hand have sufficient interest to come before this court even though the locus

standi of the two Petitioners were not challenged by the Respondents before this court.

The case before this court as submitted by the Petitioners, refers to a decision taken by the lSI

Respondent to transfer four Sloth Bears to the Department of Zoological Gardens, on a request made

by the 2nd Respondent to be kept at Pinnawala Zoological Garden.

When this matter was supported before us, for notices the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner, in

addition to the notices on the Respondents move for interim relief as prayed in paragraphs G) and (k)

to the petition but, the Learned Senior State Counsel who represented the 1 sl and 2nd Respondents

without objecting for such relief being grated undertook to keep the 4 sloth bears away from public

until the conclusion of the present case. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners agreed for the said

proposal instead of pursuing the interim relief as prayed for. However considering the importance and

the urgency of this matter this court decided to grant both parties a time line to submit their pleadings

,

t

and fixed the matter for argument for 19.01.2016. Even though this court could not take up this case

for argument on that day, the arguments were concluded within a week since then.

As stated above, the application before this court refers to four Sloth Bears that were held in the

custody of the Department of Wild Life Conservation. According to the Petitioners the Sloth Bears in

Sri Lanka is a separate subspecies of Sloth Bears live in Asian Region which is identified as an

endangered species in the Asian Region and identified as "Melurslls llrsinus inornatus" and declared

by the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance No.2 of 1937 (as amended) under schedule II of the

ordinance as "Mammals that are strictly protected" in terms of the law. It was further submitted that

the Sloth Bear is listed as "vulnerable" in terms of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It was

the position taken up by the Petitioners before this court that rehabilitation and re-integration to

endangered species such as wild elephants and Sloth Bears were one of the main objective of the

Department of Wild Life Conservation and in support of the above position had submitted marked

P-13 A-D the performance Reports of the Department of Wild Life Conservation for the years 2011-

2014.

As revealed by the documentation submitted before us and the arguments placed, the four Sloth Bears

referred to this case were in the custody of the Department of Wild Life Conservation and three out of

four Sloth Bears were kept within the rehabilitation programme at the Elephant Transit Home in

Udawalawa while the 4th was kept at the Wild Life Health Management division at Girithale.

According to the Petitioners the four Sloth Bears were being maintained at these centres under

conditions which were conductive to their final re-introduction to the wild which included minimum

contact with humans with regard to the conditions under which the bears were kept. With regard to the

decision taken by the Department of Wild Life Conservation to complete the rehabilitation process by

releasing the Bears to the Jungle, the Petitioners have heavily relied on a press release issued by the

All Ceylon Game Guards Association which was produced marked P-7. According to the said press

release,

i IIi

6

a) The Bears in question have been brought up under conditions conductive to their rehabilitation

and re-introduction,

b) A radio caller worth of Rs 600,000/- had been already received in order to track the movement

of the adult bears after re-introduction to the wild,

c) The fencing material required to house the bears within the Yala National Park for further

acclimatization/ familiarization prior to release had already been transported to the said

location.

d) The Bear at Girithale too had been kept under conditions of limited contact with humans

preparatory to final release to wild.

e) The veterinary officers of the Department of Wild Life Conservation had already

recommended their re-introduction to the wilds.

In spite of all those measures taken by the Department of Wild Life Conservation to re-introduction

the Sloth Bears to wild with lot of dedication by its officers as submitted in P-7, it is alleged by the

Petitioners that the lSI Respondent had suddenly taken a decision to hand over the four Sloth Bears to

the Department of Zoological Gardens to keep the four Sloth Bears at the New Zoological Garden at

Pinnawala after abandoning the said rehabilitation and re-introduction process which was carried out

for several months spending a large sum of public money.

Petitioners have produced marked P-5 and P-6 two letters said to have written by the 2nd Respondent

and the Secretary to the Ministry of Tourism to the lSI Respondent requesting the said release.

Even though the Petitioners have not been able to submit any documentary proof of any decision taken

by the lSI Respondent in response to the requests referred to above in P-5 and P-6, Petitioners had

submitted that the said rehabilitation programmes were abundant and the bears were taken to

Hambantota and Dehiwala until the construction work is completed in Pinnawala Zoological Gardens.

7

In response to the above position taken up by the Petitioner, the 1 sl and the 2nd Respondents whilst

admitting their decision to transfer the four Sloth Bears to Pinnawala Zoological Gardens have

submitted that,

a) Sloth Bears (Melursus ursinus) is listed under schedule II ( Mammals and Reptiles) of the

Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance No.2 of 1937 (as amended) and are strictly protected

and categorized as "vulnerable" on the National Red List 2012 of Sri Lanka.

b) The Department of Wild Life Conservation and the 1 sl Respondent operate in accordance

within a mandate specified by law and in terms of the provisions of the Fauna and Flora

Protection Ordinance No.2 of 1937 (as amended) which includes the rehabilitation of orphaned

wild animals.

c) However no specific centres for rescue and rehabilitation of orphaned animals have been

established so far, except for Elephant Transit Home (ETH) or commonly known as "Ath

Athuru Sevana" for the rehabilitation and re-integration of Elephants.

d) In the absence of specific centre for rescue and rehabilitation of other wild animals, facility at

Elephant Transit Home (ETH) are currently being used as a temporary measure due to the

constant presence of assigned veterinarians who are available to attend to such animal when

required.

e) The Sloth Bears in question, were rehabilitated at Elephant Transit Home (ETH) are now tame

and have become familiar with humans and may have difficulty in adopting to new

environment and that on previous occasions the Department had faced difficulty in releasing a

leopard and a bear to their natural habitat since they were unable to adopt in to their new

environment.

f) The purpose of handing over the animals to zoo includes conservation and breeding objectives.

However when analyzing the position taken up by the Respondents before this court, it is important to

note that this court is surprise to observe that the Department of Wild Life Conservation has not realize

8

the money and efforts they utilize to rehabilitate the four Sloth Bears were of no use until they

received P-5 and P-6 in order to abundant the rehabilitation programme. The lSI Respondent had

further failed to explain this court as to the next step the department would have taken, if no request

was made as evident in P-5 and P-6 to hand over the Sloth Bears to the Department of Zoological

Gardens, in the light of the difficulties they have encountered in releasing wild animals to natural

habitat.

Even though the lSI and 2nd Respondents have made an attempt to justify their decision to abundant the

rehabilitation/ re-integration programme, they have failed to answer the position taken by the

Petitioners with regard to the rehabilitation process carried out by the Department of Wild Life

Conservation until the four Sloth Bears were arbitratraly removed from the rehabilitation programme.

As observed by me earlier in this Judgment the Petitioners have heavily relied on the press release

issued by the All Ceylon Game Guards Association which was produced marked P-7. The contents of

the said documents were referred to in paragraph 25 of the Petition filed before this court and,

surprisingly the lSI and 2nd Respondents in their objections filed before this court had failed to

challenge or answer the contents of the said paragraph but, in the Petition as well as in the affidavit

filed before this court by the lSI Respondent had submitted that he is unaware of the contents of

paragraph 25 of the Petition.

As observed in this Judgment the said paragraph refers to receiving a radio caller worth of

Rs. 600,000/- in order to track the movements of the adult bear after re-introduction to the wild and

transporting fencing material to Yala National Park for further acclimatization/ familiarization prior to

their release to wild, in addition to the other things averred to.

In the 41h paragraph of P-7, All Ceylon Game Guards Association has further said, "GC)C)~C) Ql 05

9

This court is concerned over the conduct of the lSI Respondent before this court when he has strangely

submitted that he was unaware of a rehabilitation process carried out by his own department as

referred to above and also taking specific measures for re-introduction as referred to above.

The lSI Respondent has further failed to contradict the purported recommendation said to have given

by the veterinary surgeons of the Department as referred to in P-7.

During the arguments before this court the Petitioners have brought to our notice the annual

performance reports of the Department of Wild Life Conservation from 2011-2014 and submitted that

the Department had given top priority for the management of animal rehabilitation centres and

therefore the lSI Respondent as the Head of the said Department cannot simply submit that the

\Department does not have facility to rehabilitation of other wild animals, when the Fauna and Flora

Protection Ordinance mandate the department to rehabilitate the orphaned wild animals.

The Respondents have further submitted before this court that the lSI Respondent is empowered by the

said ordinance to take a decision with regard to the animals managed under the said ordinance by the

Department, considering, their well being, conservation and breeding objectives.

However it was the position of the Petitioners before this court that, in the document P-7, by the very

Iofficers who were managing the Sloth bears during the rehabilitation, had clearly indicated the manner

in which the Sloth Bears were kept and the need for their rehabilitation. It was further submitted that

these are Sloth Bears that originally came from the wild and when released to the wild would not

become a new introduction.

With regard to the request made in P-5, the Petitioners have submitted before this court that the

Zoological Gardens at Dehiwala already has six Sloth Bears out of which a large male Sloth Bear is

\

10

being kept caged away from public view due to aggression and the breeding programmes carried out at

the Zoological Gardens had limited efforts with regard to Sloth Bears.

However the lSI and 2nd Respondents have not challenged or denied the said submission but submitted

that they were unaware of such issues referred to in paragraph 23 of the Petition.

As revealed during the arguments before this court the Sloth Bear is listed under schedule II of the

Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance No.2 of 1937 (as amended) and are strictly protected and that

the Sloth Bears is categorized as "vulnerable" on the National Red List 2012 of Sri Lanka.

In terms of the provisions of the said ordinance the lSI Respondent is mandated with the rehabilitation

of orphaned wild animals.

As admitted before this court the four Sloth Bears referred to this Petition were undergoing a

rehabilitation programme where the Sloth Bears were being maintained at those centres under

condition which were conductive to their final re-introduction to the wilds, which includes minimum

contact with humans, until the request was made by P-5, P-6 for transferring them to be kept at

Pinnawala Zoological Gardens.

The Respondents have failed to satisfy us that the decision of the lSI Respondent to transfer the said

Sloth Bears from the said rehabilitation programme was taken in good faith, bearing in mind the well

being of the Sloth Bears and their conservation and breeding objections of the Sloth Bears under

Department of Zoological Gardens.

When considering the above material placed before us it is our view that the said decision of the lSI

Respondent to abundant the ongoing rehabilitation programme of the four Sloth Bears in order to hand

them over to the Department of Zoological Gardens to kept them at Pinnawala Zoological Garden was

an arbitrary decision reached by him, ignoring the mandate given to him to by the Fauna and Flora

Protection Ordinance No.2 of 1937.

11

The 1st Respondent has further admitted the receipt of P-12 where a request had been made to

immediately bring the Sloth Bears back to the ongoing rehabilitation programme for release into the

wild as planned by the Health Management Division of the Department of Wild Life Conservation.

This court further observes that the Department of Wild Life Conservation is mandated by the Fauna

and Flora Protection Ordinance No.2 of 1937 (as amended) for the rehabilitation of orphaned wild

animals and it is the duty of the said department to conduct such programs irrespective of the kind of

wild animal orphaned due to various reasons.

Considering all the matters referred to above by me and the arguments placed before this court by both

parties, this court decides to;

a) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari as prayed in paragraphs (b) (c) and (d) to the

Petition

b) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus as prayed in paragraphs (e) (t) and (i) to the

Petition

c) Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Prohibition as prayed in paragraph (h) to the Petition

Application is allowed.
