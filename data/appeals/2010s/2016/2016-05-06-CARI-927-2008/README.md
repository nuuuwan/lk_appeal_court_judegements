BEFORE : Deepali Wijesundera J.

M.M.A. Gaffoor J.

COUNSEL Lasitha Chaminda for the

Petitioner

H. Withanachchi for the

Defendants - Respondents.

ARGUED ON : 14th July, 2015

DECIDED ON : 06th May, 2016

Deepali Wiiesundera J.

The plaintiff respondent instituted an action in the District Court to

partition a land morefully described in the schedule to the plaint and a

preliminary survey had been done. Court had issued notice on the

claimants before the surveyor. The plaint had been amended thereafter

with permission of court and lis pendens registered again in keeping

with the land surveyed. After notice a party was added as the second

defendant. The case was taken up for trial and the plaintiff's evidence

and the documents marked have gone uncontested. The learned

District Judge had delivered judgment and Interlocutory decree had

been entered, and a commission was issued for the final scheme of

2

partition. The final plan was prepared and accordingly Final Decree was

entered based on plan no. 1323. The parties have moved for writ of

possession to divide the land. The writ was executed. The petitioner

claims that lots 8 and 10 of final plan no. 2900 were allocated to him in

another District Court partition action.

The petitioner had first filed a revision application in the Civil

Appellate High Court in Matara to set aside the Final Decree but has

later withdrawn the same. The instant application for Restitution-in-

Intergrum was filed after that.

The petitioner's counsel submitted that the learned District Judge

erred in law when he failed to examine the title deeds marked and the

extent of the land surveyed which was larger in extent. The petitioner

stated that the plaintiff respondent fraudulently suppressed title deeds

and the District Judge failed to examine the deeds marked and to find

that the corpus was larger than what was shown in the deeds.

The petitioner submitted that the revisionary jurisdiction and the

jurisdiction on restitution conferred on the Appellate Court is

discretionary and should be exercised in proper circumstances. The

petitioner stated that his rights to lots 8 and 10 in plan 2900 has been

violated by the plaintiff respondent's and the first defendant

respondent's collusive actions. Citing the judgment in Singho and

another vs Suppaiah and others 2007 (1) SLR 370 stated that

"notwithstanding the relief claimed by way of Restitution in

Intergrum the relief by way of revision does lie to the petitioner".

The instant application is not a Revision application.

The respondents learned counsel submitted that the instant

application is misconceived in law and liable to be dismissed. He stated

that the petitioner's remedy if any would have been under section 49 of

the Partition Law.

The respondents further stated that the petitioner by making an

application for Revision and then by withdrawing it later had forfeited his

rights to claim relief. The respondents also said that the petitioner is

guilty of laches and is not entitled to seek remedies which are

d iscretiona ry.

The respondents citing the judgments in Perera vs

Wijewickreme 15 NLR 411 and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd

4

vs Shanmugam 1995 1 SLR 55 argued that it is a basic requirement

that the person who seeks restitution should have been a party to the

legal proceedings.

In the instant case the preliminary survey was done in 1995 and

the final survey in 2000 and the petitioner who claimed two lots in the

final plan pleads ignorance of both surveys. The petitioner stated that

when the decree was executed in 2008 he came to know about the

partition decree.

The petitioner who claims lots 8 and 10 in plan 2900 should have

been aware of it if not both one of the surveys and should have taken

steps to show that his lands were erroneously included in the corpus but

without taking steps in the District Court or the High Court they have

moved for Restitution in the instant application. The petitioner failed to

disclose fraud or collusion in keeping with section 48 of the Partition

Act. A final decree can only be set aside if fraud or collusion is proved.

The petitioner has also failed to explain the delay in filing the

instant application. A party who has been sleeping over his rights does

not get the privilege to invoke the discretionary jurisdiction of this court.

Since the petitioner is not entitled to the remedy by way of

Restitution, the appropriate remedy would have been to act under

section 49 of the Partition Act. In Menchinahamy vs Muniweera the

Supreme Court has decided that Restitution in Intergrum whould not be

available to a party if that party had another remedy available to him.

For the afore stated reasons I decide to refuse the application of

the petitioner with costs fixed at Rs. 25,0001=.
