M.M.A. GAFFOOR, J.

The defendant-appellant has preferred the present appeal

against the judgment and interlocutory decree entered on 14.10.1997 to

partition the subject matter of the action among the 1 st defendant-

appellant and the plaintiff-respondents. The land sought to be

partitioned by the plaintiff is depicted in the preliminary plan dated

07.04.1993 bearing No.1365 dated 17.04.1993 together with the

connected report was prepared by D.G. Mendis, Licensed Surveyor. The

1 st respondent-appellant who did not agree with the corpus depicted in

the said preliminary plan and produce a plan No. 90/541 authenticated

by Surveyor General and that plan was marked 1 V5. On 26.03.1990

when the case was taken up for the trial the 1st defendant again moved

for another commission on the Surveyor General on the purported

ground that the Surveyor General had acted beyond the scope of

commIssIOn. Accordingly, the application for further commission was

allowed and it was also issued to the Surveyor General to return his

commission with plan No. (3.) 90/541 and the report dated 21.06.1991.

After the commission the 1 st defendant amended statement of claim on

26.06.1989. The other defendants did not make any appearance though ,

summons were duly served on them possibly due to the minuteness or

insignificance of shares they will be allotted with after the adjudicator

of the matter. Therefore, the contest between the plaintiff and the 1st

defendant having admitted the devolution of title, the sole issue to be

decided by the learned trial Judge was in relation to the identification of

the corpus as evidenced by the points of contest No.1 formulated on

behalf of the plaintiff and point of contest No.3 formulated on behalf of

the 1st defendant which reads as follows:-

(1) "is the corpus in this lot 6B of Siddahandiwatta shown as

lot 6B in the Plan No. 1365 dated 17th and 18th April 1983

made by G.D. Mendis, Licensed Surveyor?"

(3) "Is the corpus correctly shown in Plan No. (3))/90/541 made

by the Surveyor General?

The learned District Judge came to the finding after the

lengthy evaluation of evidence has held that the Plan No. 1365 depicts

the corpus and the shares should be devolved on the parties as per

judgment dated 14.10.1997. The learned District Judge in his judgment

gave reason as to what compel him to reject the possession of the

plaintiff that the land depicted in the Plan No. (3))/90/541 made by

Surveyor General does not form the corpus.

The learned District Judge having considered the deed

produced in the action and the three plans produced by the 1 st

I

defendant- appellant and the plaintiff-respondent has rightly come to a

conclusion that the land sought to be partitioned consist of lot 6B of

-

Siddahandiwatta shown as lot 6B in the Plan 1365 dated 17/ 18-

04.1993 made by G. D. Mendis, Licensed Surveyor. I do not see any

reason to find fault with the judgment of the learned District Judge with

regard to the point of contest relied into the identity of corpus. But the

defendant-appellant stated that the Plan No.1365 has been prepared

fraudulently. When the case was taken up for trial following facts were

recorded as admissions.

(a) There is no dispute regarding the pedigree of the title.

(b) All the cultivation should be according to the Surveyor's

report.

But the 1 st defendant-appellant in his submissions says, that the

learned District Judge had erred in law and facts in accepting the

preliminary Plan No. 1365 and rejecting the Surveyor General's Plan No.

G)/90/541 made by C.G. Gunawardena, Surveyor General and further

he says that D.G. Mendis who prepared the Preliminary Plan No.1365

dated 18.04.1983 marked "X" in his plan states as follows:-

Further to this, he states that the North and South boundaries did not

remain on the ground the 1st plaintiff requested him to establish the

boundaries according to the Plan No.3172 made by E. de Z.

Gunawardena. Accordingly, he superimposed this plan and established

the boundaries. The present boundaries on the ground are indicated in

black coloured lines and the superimposition of Plan No.3172 is

indicated in red coloured lines. The plaintiff-respondent submits that

the extent shown in the Surveyor General Plan No. G:nj90j541 in 6.5

perches whereas the extent shown in the preliminary Plan marked "X"

is 8 perches which is identical in extent to the description in the plaint

and plan No. 3172 referred to in the title deeds relied on by both parties

for their respective claims and also he draws the attention to paragraph

7 of the statement of claim of the 1 st defendant where he states as

follows:-

"~6) qotD 3172 <000 ~Q)~ 8@0 G)) aC) q<)~ qotD. 21663 <000 cG3 ~Q)~

woaC) ~a>l))~~~C) CG) 638 qa;~C) CtDOtDO ~z03 Q)zCia; ~ ~C) C)oC))

Therefore, he states that it is important to note, the 1 5t defendant is

trying to challenge the accuracy of the said PlanNo.3172 marked 151, the

I

deed No. 738 marked 154, by which the 1st defendant-appellant himself

derived title and also plaintiff-respondent says that he is respectfully

9

submitted that the 1st defendant-appellant is bound by 151, and 154,

and he cannot repudiate his own documents after about 25 years from

the date of execution of the said deed and the said plan. The plaintiff-

respondent also states that having denied the said Plan No.3172 the 1 st

defendant by paragraph 7 and 8 of his amended statement of claim

stated as follows:-

"7 . <g>~0) o-<~~ 0G@C)a) 5aici3Q)oz ozS6J<Q)6zC)~~G5 ozS6J~~~ 13 C)a)

~d<~d ~SQ)o ~ qzci3 ~a))~Q)~ 120/.336 OO(32C) .:5)C)z6( Q)C)C) 8g(3)~~~ ~Q)Q

~Q))C) ~ 8@~O )C3S Q~ Q)S g)9C~ q~C) ~ <g>C) ~Q)Q ~C)~ t530C)

Therefore, he says that the position taken by the 1 st defendant in the

above quoted paragraph are contradictory and irreconcilable preventing

the confirmation of either plan as none of them satisfies the first

defendant's condition namely, the plan to be accepted should show 8

perches an<) at the same time it should be the Surveyor General's Plan

which shows 6.5 perches only in the action.

In the event, the Surveyor General's Plan No. (3),;5 86 tallies

with the lot 6 B in the preliminary Plan No. 1365 except in extent which

is 6.5 perches and not 8 perches. The learned trial Judge has stated

that the Court is entitled to presume that the 1 st defendant-appellant did

not produce the said Plan No. (3),;5 86/17 as it would be unfavourable to

the 1 st defendant, if it is produced. In the event the learned trial Judge is

accepting the preliminary Plan No. 1365 had taken into consideration in

evidence of the Surveyor and his application of Plan No. 1372 marked as

"PI" as precise one with sufficient data for such an application. On the

other hand, the learned trial Judge in rejecting the preliminary plan

made by the Surveyor General has stated though the Surveyor General

was directed by the Court the superimpose that plan on "PI" he has

superimposed his Plain on a copy of "PI" instead of "PI" which has

been prepared 7 years later.

Before we come to a conclusion, I would like to draw the

attention to the final paragraph of the jUdgment written by the learned

District Judge.
