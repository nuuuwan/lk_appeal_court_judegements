Proceedings were instituted on 06/05/2011 by the Plaintiff -

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) against the

Defendant - Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) before the

learned Magistrate of Anuradhapura, for the recovery of a sum of

Rs.176,625/- as gratuity payable to one Anula Herath who was an employee

of the Petitioner, in terms of Section 8(1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act.

The Petitioner sought leave of the learned Magistrate to show cause

that the sum referred to in the certificate is not due from the Petitioner. The

Respondent objected to the application made on behalf of the Petitioner.

However, the Petitioner filed his objections and after consideration of

the submissions made by both parties, the learned Magistrate ordered the

Petitioner to pay Rs.176,625/- as referred to in the certificate.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the learned Magistrate the

Petitioner preferred a Revision Application to the High Court of the province

seeking to set aside the said Order of the learned Magistrate.

The learned High Court Judge affirmed the Order of the learned

Magistrate and dismissed the Petitioner's petition.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment of the learned High Court

Judge, the Petitioner has preferred the instant application seeking to revise

it.

The case for the Petitioner briefly was, one Anula Herath, who was

purported to be an employee of the Petitioner made an application to the

4

Commissioner of Labour to recover gratuity from the Petitioner. The

Respondent, after holding an inquiry, ordered to pay Rs.176,625/- to the said

Anula Herath.

After proceedings were instituted before the learned Magistrate for the

recovery of the above mentioned sum of money, the Petitioner sought leave

of the Court to show cause that he is not liable to pay the money which is

mentioned in the certificate.

The learned Magistrate after consideration of the submissions made

by both parties held, that the only cause that the Petitioner could have shown

was to establish:

i) that the Petitioner has paid the amount due,

ii) that he is not the defaulter named in the certificate, and

iii) that the certificate has been filed in the Court which has no

jurisdiction to initiate recovery proceedings,

and refused the application made by the Petitioner to show cause that the

sum mentioned in the certificate was not due or that it was incorrectly

calculated.

The Petitioner seeks to canvass the correctness of the Order made by

the Magistrate refusing the application made on behalf of the Petitioner to

show cause that the sum specified in the certificate was not due or

incorrectly calculated.

When the case was taken up for argument on 24.06.2015, the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that according to the Section 8(2) of the

Payment of Gratuity Act, the Commissioner's certificate is prima facie

5

evidence, only if it has been duly calculated. If the calculation is wrong the

certificate cannot be considered as a prima facie evidence of payment of

gratuity.

The sole question arising for decision in this application is whether

the certificate filed by the Respondent under Section 8(2) of the Payment of

Gratuity Act is final and conclusive.

Section 8(2) reads as follows:

(2) The Commissioner's certificate shall be prima facie evidence that

the amount due under this Act from the defaulter has been duly calculated,

and that the amount is in default.

The contention of the learned Counsel was that the legislature by

usmg the words "the Commissioner's certificate shall be prima facie

evidence", a provision has been made for the defaulter to show cause and

displace the effect of the prima facie evidence by offering further evidence

of an inconsistent or contradictory nature.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner, in support of his contention

has cited the case X Employer vs. Deputy Commissioner of Labour and

Others (1991) 1 SLR page 222. In this connection the reasoning adopted in

that case would be helpful in resolving the question in issue.

As Gunasekera J. pointed out in that case, thus the legislature

by using the words that the certificate is only "prima facie evidence" by

unequivocal and unambiguous language has made provision for the

defaulters to show cause and displace the effect of the prima facie evidence

by offering further evidence of an inconsistent or contradictory nature.

6

"Prima facie evidence is not conclusive evidence, it is open to the

opposing party to rebut that evidence by proving the contrary". G.L. Pieris-

Law of Evidence in Sri Lanka 1974 Edition at Page 31 dealing with prima

facie evidence and conclusive evidence states thus: Further states "The

distinguishing characteristics of prima facie evidence is that it leaves room

for the other party to displace effect of such evidence by offering further

evidence of an inconsistent or contradictory nature. It is only in the absence

of further evidence from the other side that prima facie evidence enables the

party giving it to discharge its onus".

On the strength of the above decision, it is evident that the certificate

issued by the Respondent, under Section 8(2) of the Payment of Gratuity Act

is only prima facie evidence and not final and conClusive evidence. Also it

is not limited to show that the Respondent has paid the amount due, he is not

the defaulter named in the certificate and the certificate has been filed in the

Court which has no jurisdiction to institute recovery proceedings.

In arriving at their decisions, learned Magistrate and the learned High

Court Judge had relied on the decision of Attorney General vs. City Carriers

Ltd. (1991) 1 SLR 227. It is relevant to note in that case, proceedings were

instituted and the certificate was filed under Section 38(2) of the Employees

Provident Fund Act, No.15 of 1958 as amended by Act No.8 of 1971.

Section 38(3) of the said Act states:

"the correctness of any statement of the certificate issued by the

Commissioner for the purpose of this section shall not be called in question

or examined by the Court in any proceedings under this section and

accordingly nothing in this section shall authorise the Court to consider or

7

decide the correctness of any statement m such certificate and the

Commissioner's certificate shall be sufficient evidence that the amount due

under this Act from the defaulting employer has been duly calculated and

that such amount is in default".

The Section dealing with the recovery provision in the statute that

came up for consideration in that case was different. Finality and

conclusiveness is given by the statute to the particulars given in the

certificate filed under Section 38(3) of the said Employee's Provident Fund

Act.

In the instant case, the particulars given in the certificate is only prima

facie evidence of the matters stated therein. It is relevant to note that there is

no statutory bar under the Payment of Gratuity Act to prevent a Magistrate

from leading evidence to call in question the correctness of the statement

contained in the certificate.

A careful examination of Section 8(2) of the Payment of Gratuity Act

clearly shows that the Commissioner's certificate is prima facie evidence. In

such circumstances and in the light of the judicial decisions the view of the

Court is, it is open to the Petitioner to rebut that evidence by proving the

contrary.

The learned Senior State Counsel also conceded that there are defects

of the calculation and submitted that he has no objection for having a fresh

mqUIry.

F or the reasons stated above, I am of the view, the particulars given in

the certificate is only prima facie evidence of the matters stated therein and it

8

is open to the defaulter to contravene the position that the amount has been

incorrectly calculated, by leading oral or documentary evidence.

Accordingly, I set aside the Orders made by the learned Magistrate

and the learned High Court Judge and direct the learned Magistrate to permit

the Petitioner to show cause by leading evidence, that the amount referred to

in the certificate or any part thereof is not due.

Application allowed.
