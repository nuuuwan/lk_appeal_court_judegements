Order

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC

The accused-appellant was indicted before the High Court of Kurunegala for committing the murder

of one Meragal Pedige J an aka Sampath at Giriulla on or about 25th March 2002, an offence

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code.

When the indictment was served on the accused-appellant, he elected to be tried by the Learned

High Court Judge without the jury. The trial proceeded in the High Court of Kurunegala before the

High Court Judge where the prosecution mainly relied on the evidence of a single eye witness. At

the conclusion of the said trial the Learned High Court Judge convicted the accused- appellant on the

indictment and sentenced to death. Being dissatisfied with the said conviction and sentence, the

accused-appellant had preferred the present appeal before us.

As observed above, the prosecution case is solely depend on the evidence of the single eye witness

namely Rohitha Vidyarathne. The Learned President's Counsel who represented the accused-

appellant had raised several grounds of appeal, and that can be summarized as follows;

1. Accused was shown to the witness at the police station

2. Proper procedure was not adopted at the identification parade and it should have been

rejected at the first place

3

3. Identity of 'Lal'

4. Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself and had used portions of evidence in the

inquest and non summary inquiry without having led at the trial to assist him in his judgment

5. The accused arrested at his house and there was no absconding

6. The Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself and had a wrong inference that the

accused-appellant volunteered a confession before the KUliyapitiya Magistrate on

28.03.2002.

The first three grounds of appeal referred to above are based on the identity and the said identity of

the accused-appellant is emanating from the evidence of witness Rohitha Vidyarathne. It is

important to consider his evidence before going in to the grounds of appeal referred to above.

As revealed before this court, the sole eye witness Rohitha Vidyarathne, was at his house which was

situated in the Giriulla Town on that day, when he met the deceased around 5.00-5.30 pm. Since the

witness was after an accident he could not walk on that day and he was seated in front of his house.

The deceased who came on a cycle had stopped after seeing him and came up to him. The deceased

too had sat on a stool and while they were talking to each other, a person had come and cut the

deceased and went away. In his evidence he has narrated the incident which took place at that time

as follows;

From the above evidence it is clear that the incident which had taken place somewhere around 5.30

pm was only witnessed by him, and the accused had walked away after the attack which took place

within few seconds, but he could remember the face since it was a familiar face to him.

The witness during his evidence speaks of two occasions he had seen the accused thereafter.

According to the witness, on the following morning he had gone to the hospital to see the body of

the deceased in a friend's vehicle. On his return he received a massage through a friend and gone to

the police station.

At the police station he met two police officers and they showed a person and asked whether he is

the killer. The relevant portion of evidence reads thus;

tSiCl~). tSi a C)) i!)a' tSiCl~).

As observed by this court this is the first time he saw the accused after the attack on the deceased on

the previous evening. Thereafter he was taken for an identification parade and at the parade he

identified the accused-appellant.

With regard to the conduct of the said identification parade, the Learned Counsel for the accused-

appellant had raised several objections and in fact his 2nd ground of appeal was based on the

irregularities of the said parade.

6

During the arguments before us the Learned Senior State Counsel who represented the Attorney

General keeping to the best traditions of the Attorney General's Department informed that he would

not be depend on the identification parade but would be solely depend on the identity of the accused

based on the identification made at the police station.

In this regard he placed before this court the concept of "Street Identification" which is also be

considered as a mode of identification around the world.

As observed by this court a "street identification" or "live show up" provides an eye witness with an

opportunity to identify a suspect shortly after a crime and this is used widely by police mainly in the

western world sometimes with the help of video recorded evidence. This court has no reason to

reject the concept of street identification if the evidence available reveals the said position.

For an example if the witness had come across the accused shortly after the incident at a public place

or even at a police station and identified him as the culprit, he can show him to the police, or taken

him to the police station with the help of police or with the help of general public. This identification

can be permissible since the said identification has helped the witness to identify the suspect after the

incident when the suspect was among the public.

The purpose of having an identification parade is to give an opportunity for the witness to identify a

suspect among a group, where the witness can make mistakes too. One of the main advantages of a

street identification is that the identification is made within a short period, when the memory of the I I

witness is fresh, rather than going before an identification parade after several days or more.

The Learned Senior State Counsel explained the identification made by witness Rohitha Vidyarathne

as street identification and requested this court to act upon the said identification. In this regard we

would like to analyze the evidence given by witness, with regard to the identification he made at the

police station.

When the above evidence given by the witness Vidyarathne is considered, it appears that, the

witness was got down to the police station in order to identify the accused. However this fact is not

revealed from the evidence of the investigating officers. If the above evidence given by witness

Vidyarathne is accepted the accused was in the police station, on the following day, i.e. 26.03.2002

but according to the evidence of the investigating officer the suspect was arrested at his house on

28.03.2002 at 2.00 pm.

In a case of street identification, the suspect is arrested on him being identified as the culprit by the

witness. However in the present case there is no evidence before this court that the suspect was

arrested on 26.03.2002 at the Giriulla Police Station.

With regard to the identification made by witness Vidyarathne at the police station, it is further

observed by this court, that the witness was prompted to identify the accused by asking a direct

question "Is this the man who killed the deceased?"

In this regard the Learned Senior State Counsel had argued that the said direct question had two

answers i.e. yes or no; and the answers by the witness in affirmation was good evidence to establish

that the said identification was made without any interference on the witness.

As previously observed by this court one of the main purposes of having an identification parade

was to make sure that the witness did not make any mistake when identifying the suspect. Even in

street identification we observe that the said element is present since the identification was made at a

t

public place. But the circumstances under which the suspect in the present case is identified by the

main witness, does not fulfill the said requirement, since the person was directed to him, even

though the witness now states that he identified him, since he could remember the face.

The evidence of the eye witness Vidyarathne at the High Court Trial was that, subsequent to the

suspect being seen at the police station the suspect was later identified at the identification parade.

This identification parade was seriously challenged before us and as observed earlier the Learned

Senior State Counsel did not rely on the said parade.

In the said circumstances, the only evidence with regard to identification available in the present

case, is the evidence of witness Vidyarathne, to the effect that he saw and identified the suspect at

the police station when two Sub-Inspectors asked him "Is this the person who killed the deceased?"

In addition to the infirmity which was already discussed above it is also important to note that the

said evidence of witness Vidyarathne is not corroborated by the evidence of any other witness. It is

only witness Vidyarathne says that he saw and identified the suspect at the police station when the

suspect in the company of two police constables on 26.02.2002, but according to police the suspect

was arrested at his residence on 28.03.2002.

As observed by this court the entire case for the prosecution is solely depending on the evidence of

the single eye witness Vidyarathne. During the trial before the High Court the prosecution was not

being able to place any other evidence to link the accused -appellant to this case. Even according to

the evidence of the family members of the deceased, the accused-appellant was a stranger to them.

When considering the material discussed above this court is of the opinion that it is unsafe to act on

the evidence given by the single eye witness Vidyarathne with regard to the identification of the

accused-appellant.

We are not inclined to discuss the other grounds of appeal raised by the Learned Counsel for the

accused-appellant since, the above finding of this court is sufficient to reach a decision in the case

before this court on the finding that, it is unsafe to act on the evidence of witness Vidyarathne on the

identification of the suspect and also in the absence of any other evidence against the accused-

appellant to convict him for the murder of the deceased Meragal Pedige Janaka Sampath. We are of

the view that the Learned Trial Judge misdirected himself when he concluded that there was

sufficient evidence to convict the accused-appellant for the murder of the deceased. We therefore set

aside the conviction and sentence imposed on the accused-appellant. Accused is acquitted.

Appeal allowed. Accused acquitted.
