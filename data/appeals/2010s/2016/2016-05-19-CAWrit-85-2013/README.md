The issue before court is whether the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th and i h Respondents should

be permitted to amend the affidavits of the 4th and 5th Respondents in order to

incorporate the place of attestation that has been omitted in the jurats of the

respective affidavits. The preliminary objection to the maintainability of this

application for judicial review arises in the following manner.

The Petitioner, by filing a counter affidavit dated ih July 2014, raised the preliminary

objection, pinpointing the defects in the jurats of the aforesaid two affidavits and has

urged this Court to dismiss the statement of objections filed on behalf of 1st to i h

Respondents. The impugned jurats go as follows:-

As could be seen jurats in both affidavits do not contain the name of the place where

the affidavits were affirmed and signed. The objections raised by the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner is that the statement of objections should be rejected for want of a

valid affidavit, whilst the learned Deputy Solicitor General has contended that he

should be permitted to amend the affidavits. It has to be observed that it is through a

motion dated 9th December 2014 that the Attorney-at-Law for the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and

6th Respondents (State Attorney) has moved in terms of Rule 3(8) of the Court of

Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules of 1990 seeking permission to amend the

affidavits of the 4th a nd 5th Respondents.

In support of the argument that the application by the Attorney General to amend the

affidavits should be rejected, the Petitioner relies on other matters including the

alleged invalidity. The Petitioner contends that though the Petitioner highlighted the

defects in the affidavits through his counter-affidavit, it took the State more than two

months to move for an amendment to these two affidavits. In other words there was

delay on the part of the State Attorney to move for an amendment to the two

affidavits. As for this objection I observe that when this motion was supported by the

learned Deputy Solicitor General on 18th December 2014, the Court took this matter

off the argument roll and granted both counsel an opportunity to file written

submissions on the question whether amended affidavits could be filed in Court. Thus

the primary issue uppermost before Court was whether it was open to the Counsel for

the Respondents to remedy the defects in the affidavits as have been pointed by the

Petitioner in the counter-affidavit. No doubt the Respondents moved for the

amendment rather belatedly but this Court will bear in mind the need to keep the

channels of procedure open for the merits of the objections to be gone into and the

5

all important question disposed of-namely whether a deficiency in the jurat of an

accompanying affidavit to a statement of objections is curable or not.

The Petitioner also alleges that the separate affidavits of the 4th and 5th Respondents

contain hearsay and such hearsay emerges through contradictory and uncorroborated

material contained in the affidavits. The Petitioner further points out that although a

joint statement of objections of the 1S\ 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents and a separate

statement of objections on behalf of the 6th Respondent have been filed, supporting

affidavits have been filed only by the 4th and 5th Respondents independently and not

with the consent or concurrence of the other Respondents.

Hearsay in Affidavits

On the question of hearsay I would observe that whether the evidence proffered by

the affidavits contains hearsay or not is a matter that requires to be judged at the

hearing of the petition and the question does not fall to be decided at this threshold

stage when the Petitioner cries foul of defects in the jurats of the two affidavits. The

requirement that a person who swears or affirms to the averments in a petition or a

statement of objections must do so from his own personal knowledge introduces

direct evidence and thus excludes hearsay as objections to reception of hearsay are

usually premised on its inherent unreliability for adjudicative purposes and therefore

it cannot be acted upon for testimonial trustworthiness. The requirement to adduce

direct evidence in affidavits and the exception to the requirement are found in Section

181 of the Civil Procedure Code which declares,

"Affidavits shall be confined to the statement of such facts as the declarant is

able of his own knowledge and observation to testify to, except on interlocutory

applications, in which statement of his belief may be admitted, provided that

reasonable grounds for such belief are set forth in the affidavit".l

What has to be ascertained through an affidavit was echoed by S.N.Silva J (as he then

was) in Damayanthi Abeywardana v Hemalatha Abewardancl as follows:

II Learned District Judge has observed that the affidavit confirms the averments

in the petition. Indeed, on a comparison it is revealed that the affidavit is a

verbatim repetition of the averments of the petition. However, the correct test is

not to consider whether one confirms the other upon a comparison of this

nature. Repetition of the averments of a petition in the affidavit is an evil that

we often note in affidavits that are filed. Learned Judge has regrettably seen a

virtue in this evil. The correct test is to ascertain whether the affidavit contains

direct evidence, that is, statements of such facts as the declarant is able on his

own knowledge and observation to testify to and whether this evidence

together with the documentary evidence furnishes prima facie proof of the

matters of fact set out or alleged in the petition"

Be that as it may, these are questions that this Court need not address its mind right

now as judicial review has not yet commenced and the material in the two affidavits

vis-a-vis the counter affidavit tendered by the Petitioner is yet to be tested. So we

would discountenance any argument based on hearsay at this stage. In any event one

cannot lose sight of Rajapakse v Gunasekera3 which stated that hearsay evidence

contained in the affidavit supporting corrupt or illegal practices filed with the petition

under the Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Order in Council (as amended by Act No.9

1 See identical requirements in Order 19, Rule 3 of the Indian Code of Civil Procedure

of 1970) does not vitiate the election petition. So in some cases it is clear that even

the existence of hearsay in affidavits has been condoned.

Should all Respondents file affidavits?

I also make short shrift of the argument that the 4th and 5th Respondents cannot file

affidavits when there are one statement of objections filed on behalf of the 1st, 2nd, 4th

and 5th Respondents and another on behalf of the 6th Respondent. I hold that the law

is to the contrary.

Where the law requires that an "affidavit in support" be filed together with the

petition,4 or that a supporting affidavit be filed together with a statement of

objections or a counter affidavit,S or that a statement of objections be supported by

an affidavit,6 it is not imperative that the necessary affidavit has to emanate from all

Respondents. It is sufficient if the necessary affidavit or affidavits flow from one or

more persons who can swear or affirm to the averments in the statement of

objections from his or their own personal knowledge, and it is not necessary that all

Respondents should have filed their own affidavits. Neither does the affidavit filed

need an express concurrence from a Respondent who has not filed an affidavit.

So there need not be as many affidavits as there are Respondents and a particular

Respondent is not under a duty to concur expressly in the affidavit of another

Respondent though no doubt the Court would look for consistency inter se in the

affidavits proffered to contradict or controvert the affidavit of the Petitioner.

5 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules, 1990, Rule 3 (5)

6 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules, 1990, Rule 3 (7) 8

The court now proceeds to examine the objection that the affidavits filed by the 4th

and 5th Respondents should be rejected by Court as they do not indicate the place of

affirmation.

Whose obligation is it to formulate a proper jurat?

Section 12(3) of the Oaths and Affirmation Ordinance reads as follows:-

II Every Commissioner before whom any oath or affirmation is administered, or

before whom any affidavit is taken under this Ordinance, shall state truly in the

jurat or attestation at what place and on what date the same was administered

or taken, and shall initial all alterations, erasures, and interlineations appearing

on the face thereof and made before the same was so administered or taken".

It is apparent that the obligation to state the place of affirmation in the jurat has been

cast upon the Commissioner for Oaths. Such obligation was alluded to by

M.D.H.Fernando J in Roshana Michael v Saleh, OIC Crimes, Police Station,

Narahenpita7when the learned judge stated-

II .... As for jurat, it is true that it is the person administering the oath or

affirmation who must state in the jurat that the oath or affirmation was

administered in his presence, and the place and date .... "

Learned Deputy Solicitor General has cited Kanagasabai v Kirupamorth! wherein

Basnayake C.J declared to the effect that when affidavits are filed in the course of civil

proceedings it is the duty of Judges, Justices of the Peace and Proctors to see that the

rules governing the affidavits found in Sections 181, 437 and etc., of the Civil

Procedure Code are complied with. As to the absence of the date from the affidavit in

the case, Basnayake c.J. commented,

7 (2002) 1 Sri.LR 345 at 356

8 62 N.L.R 54

9

\

i ,

" ..... the respondent's affidavit is undated. It is the duty of the Justice of the

Peace before whom an affidavit is sworn to see that the jurat is properly

made.',9

If the duty to incorporate the date and place of attestation in the jurat of an affidavit

is cast upon the Justice of the Peace or the Commissioner for Oaths, it is his obligation

and obligation alone and the dereliction of that duty cannot be visited upon the

person taking the oath or making the affirmation namely the affiant. Therefore

remissness on the part of a Justice of the Peace or the Commissioner for Oaths in not

making sure to insert the date and place of attestation in the jurat of an affidavit

cannot be a ground for penalizing the affiant because his involvement is minimalist in

the formulation of the jurat. Such remissness on the part of the Justice of the Peace or

a Commissioner for Oaths to specify the place of attestation is his non-compliance

with a statutory duty placed upon him in terms of Section 12(3) of the Oaths and

Affirmation Ordinance and a breach of the statutory duty on the part of the Justice of

the Peace or the Commissioner for Oaths cannot deprive the Respondents of their

right to be heard on their statement of objections. In the circumstances it is iniquitous

to render the defective affidavit liable to be rejected in limine, as the evidence which

has been tendered to Court by way of the affidavit remains untested and

uncontroverted.

The Court of Appeal precedent cited by the Petitioner in his written submissions-Facy

v Sanoon and Others10 which has since been reversed by the Supreme Court is in my

view not germane to the instant application before us. This is a case in which the

affidavit in question commenced with a statement that the party who signed it stated

9'bid P 58-9

10 (2003) 3 SrLLR 8

10

at the beginning, "being a Muslim, do hereby make oath and swear as follows", but

the jurat clause at the end of the affidavit stated that such party "affirmed" to the

contents. The contention that was advanced before the Court of Appeal was that a

party who signed the affidavit "having opted to take oath, cannot later 'affirm' to the

affidavit before the Justice of the Peace or the Commissioner for Oaths."

Udalagama J (with two other judges agreeing with him) accepted this contention and

rejected the affidavit stating that it was fatally defective.ll It was in those

circumstances of his holding that Udalagama J opined as follows in that case:-

" ... 1 would also hold as held repeatedly by this Court that a faulty Affidavit could

not be considered a mere technicality but in fact fatal to the entire application

and as also held by the Court on numerous occasions a defective Affidavit is bad

in law and warrants rejection."

I hasten to point out that this dictum, albeit all embracing, does not hold true in light

of the reversal of this case in appeal by the Supreme Court - vide Facy v Sanoon. 12

The contention that "if a party signed the affidavit "having opted to take oath", it was

not open for him to affirm to the affidavit before the Justice of the Peace or the

Commissioner for Oaths/J, was rejected by the Supreme Court which drew in aid

Section 9 of the Oaths and Affirmation Ordinance for its conclusions.

Section 9 of the Oaths and Affirmation Ordinance which is a curative provision goes as

follows:-

"No omission to take any oath or make any affirmation~ no substitution of any

one for any other of them~ and no irregularity whatever in the form in which any

one of them is administered~ shall invalidate any proceeding or render

11 Ibid at p 11

12 (2006) BlR 58

11

t I I i

i. ! I I i

~. I f i

\

f

inadmissible any evidence whatever in or in respect of which such omissionl

substitutionl or irregularity took placel or shall affect the obligation of a witness

to state the truth."

So the Supreme Court held that the evidence proffered by an affidavit can be

scrutinized by court notwithstanding any defect or irregularity therein in the

administration of oath by the Justice of the Peace or Commissioner for Oaths. The

affiant is not penalized and shut out of courts.

The observations of Saleem Marsoof J in relation to Section 9 of the Oaths and

Affirmation Ordinance are pertinent,

"This [section 9 of the Oaths Ordinance] is a salutary provision which was

intended to remedy the very malady that has occurred in this casel and clearly

covers a situation in which there is a substitution in the jurat of an affirmation

for an oath. This is not a case like Clifford Ratwatte v. Thilanga Sumathipalaor

Jeganathan v. Safyath ... in which there was material to show that neither an

oath nor an affirmation was in fact administered by the Justice of the Peace ... II

The learned Judge made the point that in Facy v 5anoon it was not contended by

counsel that the contents of the affidavit in question showed that the

deponent/affirmant was not present before, or that the contents of the affidavit were

not read and explained to the deponent/affirmant by, the person who administered

the oath/affirmation. Even in this case it is not even suggested by the Petitioner in its

counter-affidavit that the respective affiants in the two affidavits were not present

before, or that the contents of the affidavit were not read and explained to the

deponent/affirmant by, the person who administered the oath/affirmation. The

12

gravamen of the complaint made in the instant case before us is that as a result of the

absence of the place of attestation in the jurat there is no affidavit before us.

Substance over Form

The liberality shown by our Supreme Court in regard to defective affidavits is a

tendency to look at substance rather than form. In fact Facy v Sanoon manifests the

triumph of substance over form which is discernible in cases such as De Silva v

L.B.Finance Ltcf3 wherein the fact of affirmation was missing in the jurat. Whilst the

Court of Appeal upheld the preliminary objection raised on the invalidity of the

affidavit in the case, the Supreme Court accepted the impugned affidavit in appeal. I

must however state that the place of attestation was mentioned in the jurat of that

affidavit but the point of objection was that the affidavit was invalid for the reason

that the jurat did not contain the fact of affirmation. The Court of Appeal upheld the

objection. But when the matter went up in appeal to the Supreme Court, the

submission that the affidavit was invalid because there was an absence of the word

"affirmed" before the words "duly read over" in the jurat, was rejected. G.P.S. de Silva

C.J (with Ramanathan and Wijetunga JJ. concurring) decided to accept the affidavit

having regard to the substance of the other parts of the affidavit.

The welcome trend discernible in the approach of our Supreme Court towards

defective affidavits has been one of facilitating the course of justice to be dispensed

because the fundamental obligation of an affiant in an affidavit is to tell the truth and

Courts would not be able to ascertain the veracity of the rival versions and discharge

its dispensation if they were to be trammeled by technicalities. This gladsome

approach of the Supreme Court is also reflected in a three Bench decision of the Court

13 1993 (1) Sri.LR 371 13

\

J

\

f t

~

of Appeal where the propriety of an affidavit attested by a Justice of the Peace who

was licensed to practice in a different judicial district other than the district where he

attested the affidavit came up for consideration.

In the case of Ceylon Workers Congress v Sathasivam,14 Wijesurendra Lokuge, a

Justice of the Peace, who was appointed for the judicial district of Homagama attested

an affidavit within the Judicial District of Colombo. The Court of Appeal held that the

affidavit attested by him within the judicial District of Colombo had no validity in law.

A reconsideration of this issue came up before a Divisional Bench of the Court of

Appeal in Senanayake v Commissioner of National Housing and Others/5 where the

Petitioner had filed in the Court of Appeal, an affidavit affirmed to before a Justice of

the Peace appointed for the Judicial District of Homagama; and a preliminary

objection was raised by the Respondent as to its validity; The Divisional Bench of the

Court of Appeal held that;

(i) In Applications for prerogative relief - the Court Appeal enjoys a supervisory

jurisdiction.

(ii) Court should not non-suit a party where the non-compliance with Rules takes

place due to no fault of the party.

(iii) Strict or absolute compliance with a Rule is not essential; it is sufficient if there

is compliance which is substantial, this being judged in the light of the object

and purpose of these Rules. It is not to be mechanically applied.

Ceylon Workers Congress v Sathasivam was not followed by the three Bench and

Saleem Marsoof J (PICA), expressed the view-

14No. C.A.L.A. 86/2002 - CA Minutes of 16.10.2002

152005 (1) Sri L.R. 182 14

\

"/ am of the view that the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990

have been formulated to facilitate the judicial process and with a view of

achieving justice rather than injusticeN (sic).

Once again recourse to substance of the affidavit was facilitated for ascertainment of

truth - a trend which the Supreme Court has demonstrated. So this Court would adopt

the same approach towards the defective affidavits before us.

No illegality or nullity in the affidavits other than an irregularity

I take the view that the absence of the place of attestation in the two impugned

affidavits does not render them null and void, Nor are they illegal, No doubt jurats

have been formulated by the Commissioner for Oaths without following the statutory

rule in Section 12(3) of the Oaths and Affirmation Ordinance. To the extent of that non

compliance the two affidavits are defective but they have by no stretch of imagination

become null and void or illegal. The oversight or negligence of the Commissioner for

Oaths if one were pitch it so high in not inserting the place of attestation cannot

render the rest of the affidavits illegal or null and void. A defective jurat formulated by

one person cannot go to contaminate the evidence which is declared to be from

personal knowledge indicating the existence of direct evidence. Moreover the

evidence contained in the two affidavits has been controverted by a counter-affidavit

by the Petitioner who has then invited Court to ascertain the truth as to the issue

before Court. So the parties must be heard by court in its supervisory jurisdiction. That

is how due process would be best served.

This Court does not find a scintilla of illegality in any of the provisions of the Oaths and

Affirmation Ordinance if a reference to the place of attestation is absent from the

jurat. There is a positive duty on the part of the Justice of the Peace or the

15

\

Commissioner for Oaths to include it in the jurat but the failure to do so has not been

declared an illegality or nullity anywhere in the Oaths and Affirmation Ordinance of

such pristine antiquity. $0 we would desist from drawing any such implication in the

absence of express stipulation and the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court has not

spelled out such an eventuality.

A defective affidavit without reference to a place of affirmation is only an

irregularity

If at all there would remain on the affidavit a defective jurat which at the most is an

irregularity and not an illegality. A defective jurat without a mention of the place of

attestation therein is an irregularity but not an illegality. We are fortified by Indian

authorities which declare such a jurat to be an irregularity. Mulla on the Code of Civil

Procedure16 cites the precedent of Mehar Singh and Others v Mahendra SinghJ1

which holds-

IIA defect in a verification is only an irregularity and not fatal. It is no ground in

rejecting the affidavit ..... "18

The verification of the affidavit in Indian case had been signed without specifying the

date and place of the execution of the affidavit.

Thus this Court holds that the absence of the place of affirmation from the jurat is not

an incurable defect. We would draw in aid Rule 3(8) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules 1990 which permits an amendment to cure a defect in an affidavit.

There is judicial permission which has to be obtained for the purpose of amending

pleadings which would include remedying the defect in an affidavit. The Court of

Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 has been framed with a view to remedying

the very situation that this Court is confronted with-the regularizing the reception of

evidence after having remedied an irregularity. We hold that the application for

amendment has been properly made and the Court allows the Respondents to amend

the two affidavits only to the extent of including the place of affirmation in the

respective jurots. In view of this holding for the above reasons we overrule the

preliminary objections urged by the Petitioner.
