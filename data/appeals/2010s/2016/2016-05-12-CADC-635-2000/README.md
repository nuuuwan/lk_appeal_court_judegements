plaint. The Plaintiff

instituted action against the Defendant in the District

It IS vital at this stage to consider the admissions

recorded at the commencement of the trial;

1. Jurisdiction of the Court

2. Property In dispute In the case was the

property described In the schedule to the

plaint

3. The property In dispute In the case was

private property of Venerable Elkaduwe Sri

Sumangala chief incumbent of Hapuwida Purana

Viharaya by transfer deed bearing No. 16551

attested by S.M.P. Wijayatilleke N .P.

4. After the demise of the said chief incumbent

the property In dispute became Sangika

Property.

As per admission 3 it IS common ground that the

property In Issue belongs to the Hapuwida Purana

Viharaya, and not to Walikotuwe Viharaya as claimed

by the Defendant- Respondent.

It is pertinent to note that the Defendant at a later

stage, before the trial commenced, made an

application to Court to withdraw the said admission

No.3, and the Learned District Judge by his order

dated 12.2 1999 had refused the said application of

the Defendant.

Therefore the Learned District Judge was of the

view that only Issue to be resolved is whether the

plaintiff priest is entitled to succeed as the

Viharadipathi after the demise of the Sumangala

thero to the said temple of Hapuvida Purana

Viharaya.

In the course of the trial the following facts had

emerged; that

After the demise of Elkaduwe Sri SUMANGALA Thero,

the senlOr pupil of the said thero, the Puliydde

Saranankara thero became the Chief incumbent of

this temple. The certification of ordination of the said

Saranankara thero was marked as P2, which bears

the testimony to the effect that that S aran ankara

thero was ordained by the robbing tutor as

Elkaduwe Sri Suman gala thero.

In the year 1972 after the demise of Puliayadde

Saranankara his senlOr pu pH Puliydde Indraratne

thero the plain tiff became the chief

1. UH.:UTHOellL of

the Hapuwida Purana Viharaya. The Upasampada

certificate is marked as P3. But the Learned District

Judge has observed the fact that the said document

marked as P3 only indicate that the robbing tutor

IS Hapuwida Saranankara thero and not Puliyadde

Saranankaara thero.

Further the Learned District Judge has commented

on the testimony of the Plaintiff thero, as the

Plaintiff on many occaSlOns has admitted that

Sapuvida Saranankara was his robbing tutor: More

over the Plaintiff - Appellant had admitterl that i.t w~s

fI! t ri;

Sapuvida Saranankara thero was 1n charge of many

temples, but nevertheless to buttress the position that

Sapuvida Saranankara thero 1S the senIOr pupil of

Elkaduwe Sri Sumangal thero, has not been established

by the Plaintiff.

Therefore in the said back drop the Learned District

Judge was of the V1ew that after the demise of

Sapuvida Saranankara thero the Plaintiff - Appellant

cannot succeed to the viharadhipahiship.

Hence in the above setting it was concluded by thee

Learned District Judge that the plaintiff- Appellant has

no locus standi to maintain this action.

For the above compelling reasons this Court see no

reason to interfere with the said impugned

judgment, thus I dismiss the appeal without costs.

Accordingly appeal is dismissed.
