L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an appeal against a judgment of the learned District Judge of

Gampaha. The plaintiff Appellant (hereinafter sometime called and

2

referred to as the Appellant) instituted action in the District Court against

the Defendant Respondent (hereinafter sometime called and referred to as

the Respondent) seeking a declaration of title, ejectment and damages.

The Appellant pleaded that his predecessor in title has given the premises

on rent to the Respondent. At an inquiry held in the Rent Board of

Veyangoda, the Respondent has agreed to enter the Appellant's name as

the landlord. At the same inquiry, the Respondent agreed to relinquish his

tenancy and to hand over the possession of the premises to the Appellant

on 30th April 1990. The Appellant agreed not to collect any rent until that

date. The Respondent being failed to vacate on the agreed date, the

Appellant filed this action as a rei vindicatio action to eject the

Respondent. The Respondent filed answer claimed the protection under

Rent Act No. 7 of 1972. The learned District Judge disbelieved the

agreement and dismissed the action. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment the appellant presented this appeal.

At the argument, the parties agreed to dispose this case on the following

questions of law.

1. Whether a tenant can contract out of the protection afforded by the

Rent Act to vacate the premises at a given time?

2. Whether the agreement entered into by the plaintiff and the

defendant at the Rent Board of Veyangoda could be enforced to

eject the tenant, by the proceedings instituted in the District Court.

3. Whether an agreement entered into before the Rent Board, with

certain conditions which have not fulfilled, is enforceable in the

District Court?

The agreement entered into by the parties is marked as P3 at the trial. It is

a part of the proceedings of the inquiry held at Rent Board of Veyangoda

I If

i

held on 26.09.1989. At the inquiry the Appellant did not contest the

tenancy of the Respondent and agreed to enter his name as the landlord.

The Rent Act No 7 of 1972 was enacted to protect the tenants. It regulates

the amount of rent that can be charged by a landlord from a tenant, the

termination of the tenancy and eviction of a tenants etc.

Even though there are no admissions recorded at the trial, the fact that the

premises are governed by the Rent Act is not contested. Similarly, the

Appellant did not contest that he is the landlord and the Respondent is the

tenant. The Respondent in his answer pleaded that the Appellant has

misinterpreted the agreement entered in the Rent Board but did not raise

any issue to that fact which means that he admits the agreement entered

into at the Rent Board.

The first question that has to consider is whether a tenant can contract out

of the protection afforded by the Rent Act to vacate the premises at a

given time? It is well established principle that a tenant cannot contract

out of the Rent Act.

A. M M Ibrahim Saibo vs. S. D. M Mansoor 54 NLR 217 At 224

(five bench judgment)

A tenant can never contract out of the protection afforded It

follows from this that he can at any moment recall a promise to

surrender possession. The only two ways in which the statutory

protection comes to an end are:-

1. By the handing back of the premises to the landlord

2. By the order of a competent court that is to say a court acting

with jurisdiction.

Hussain vs. Jiffry [2002 J 1 Sri L R 185

The appellant was the landlord and the respondent was the tenant

of premises No. 297, Main Street, Colombo 11. On 31. 03. 1980,

the respondent informed the appellant in writing that he (the

respondent) was relinquishing his tenancy with effect from that

date and requested the appellant to give the premises to one R.

There was no evidence of a new tenancy, nor did the respondent

give vacant possession of the premises to the appellant.

However, the respondent sent a letter dated 05. 07. 1980 to the

appellant informing her "I continued and still remain the lawful

monthly tenant of the premises II with a cheque for rent for the

months of April, May and June, 1980, which established that the

respondent had not handed over the premises to the appellant.

The appellant instituted action for the ejectment of the respondent

from the premises, alleging that by this letter dated 31. 03. 1980

the respondent voluntarily terminated the tenancy and that he was

in unlawful occupation from 01. 04. 1980.

Held:

(1) In the circumstances, there was no termination of the tenancy

and the rule that a tenant cannot contract out of the protection

afforded by the Rent Act applies.

Rajapakse vs. Bogoda [1997J 2 Sri L R 390

(3) it is an accepted principle that parties cannot contract outside

the rent act where the premises is governed by the rent act.

In the instant case also the tenant, the Respondent, agreed to relinquish

the tenancy from 30th April 1990 but not vacated the premises. He

continued to occupy the premises even after the agreed date. He has

5

shown his intention of not to surrender the tenancy. It has been held in the

case of Hussain vs. Jiffry (supra) at page 189 that

"It is conceded that although the respondent wrote the letter P 1

dated 31. 03. 1980, the premises in question was not handed over

to the appellant. Even if the respondent had wanted to relinquish

the tenancy at the time he wrote the letter P 1, and if the owner has

accepted it, still it would be necessary for the premises to be

physically handed over by the respondent to the appellant, for the

statutory protection to come to an end. Under a contract of

tenancy, the owner and the tenant agree and accept the terms of

tenancy. Therefore, although the respondent may have

contemplated relinquishing the premises as revealed in PI, he

could, nevertheless, unilaterally change his mind and reverse his

decision, if he had not handed over the premises to the landlord. In

such circumstances the document marked P 1 by itself does not

serve to terminate the tenancy. ,.

The same principle applies to the instant case. That the parties cannot

contract outside the rent act where the premises is governed by the rent

act

As such the first question has to be answered in negative.

The second question is whether the agreement entered into by the

plaintiff and the defendant at the Rent Board of Veyangoda could be

enforced to eject the tenant, by the proceedings instituted in the District

Court.

Since the 1 st question is answered in negative, the contract of tenancy is

not terminated. Sec 22 of the Rent Act prescribes the procedure for

ejectment of a tenant. Not vacating the premises on the agreed date is not

6

a reason to eject a tenant under that section. The Act provides that

notwithstanding anything in any other law, no action or proceedings for

the ejectment of the tenant of any premises .......... shall be instituted in

or entertained by any court, unless it comes within the provisions of

section 22 of the Act.

In the case of Pinona vs. Dewanarayana and others [2004] 2 Sri L R 11

Andrew Somawansa J. cited with approval, the judgment of

Wadugodapitiya J. in the case of Jayasingham v Arumugam [1992] 1

SRI L R 350 where it has been held that;

"As the issue was whether in terms of the Rent Act, No.7 of 1972, a

letter given by the tenant that he would vacate the premises, the

Roman Dutch law would be irrelevant. Section 22 does not set out

as a ground for ejectment the giving of a notice to quit by the

tenant to his landlord. Hence the letter given by the tenant will not

terminate the tenancy in terms of the Rent Act. "

At page 357 per Wadugodapitiya, J:

"In considering issue No.4 in the context and within the frame work

of the Rent Act, No.7 of 1972, it may be mentioned that section 22

of the said Act, as its marginal note indicates, deals with

"Proceedings for ejectment", and sets out the grounds for

ejectment. However, nowhere does section 22 mention, as a

ground, for ejectment, the giving of a notice to quit by the tenant to

his landlord. It is therefore clear that the giving of such a notice to

quit the premises, or, in the context of this case, the giving of the

letter P 5 by the appellant to the respondent, stating that he (the

appellant) will vacate the premises, will in no way give rise to a

cause of action to the respondent, under the Rent Act, No. 7 of

1972, to eject the appellant/rom the premises in suit."

As such, the 2nd question also to be answered in negative.

The third and last question raised by the parties is whether an agreement

entered into before the Rent Board with certain conditions which have not

fulfilled is enforceable in the District Court? This question does not arise

as I have already answered the first two questions in negative.

Under these circumstances, I dismiss the appeal subject to costs fixed at

Rs. 10,0001-
