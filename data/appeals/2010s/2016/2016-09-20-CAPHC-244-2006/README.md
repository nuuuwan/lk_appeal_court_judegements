This is an appeal from the High Court of Kegalla. The facts of this

case are briefly as follows. The 1 st Respondent Respondent (hereinafter

called and referred to as the 1 st Respondent) is the landowner of the paddy

field named Lidakumbura. The Petitioner Petitioner's (hereinafter called

and referred to as the Petitioner) father K.P.Muhandiram was the tenant

cultivator under him until his demise on 09.11.2000. After his death, his

son the Petitioner started cultivating the paddy land without the 1st

Respondent's consent. The 1st Respondent made an application to the

Commissioner of Agrarian Service under section 7(10) of the Agrarian

Development Act no. 46 of 2000. The Petitioner submitted that on the

death of his father the rights of the tenant cultivator devolved on him. The

Commissioner, after an inquiry, decided that the Agrarian Development

Act no. 46 of 2000 is silent on devolution of rights of the tenant cultivator

and therefore the Petitioner does not become the tenant cultivator by

operation of law. The Petitioner filed an application for a writ of

certiorari to quash the decision of the Commissioner in the High Court of

Kegalla which was dismissed. Being aggrieved by the said decision the

Petitioner presented this appeal.

The first issue that has to be considered is whether the rights of his

father, the tenant cultivator, devolve on the Petitioner. The fact that the

Petitioner is the only surviving son of Muhandiram and the wife is not

among living is not disputed.

The Agrarian Development Act is silent on the devolution of tenant

cultivator's rights. The section 8(1) of the Agrarian Services Act provided

\

3

for the succession of the tenant cultivator's rights but that was repealed

by the present Agrarian Development Act no.46 of 2000. When the new

Act was enacted, the section providing the succession of the tenant

cultivator's rights has been removed. Under these circumstances, the

Petitioner does not become the tent cultivator on the death of his father by

operation of law.

The petitioner's main argument is that the application filed under

section 7(10) of the Agrarian Development Act no. 46 of 2000 is

misconceived. The section reads thus,

(10) Where a person (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the

"lessor'') lets any extent of paddy land to any other person

(hereafter in this subsection referred to as the "lessee".; and the

lessee does not become the tenant cultivator of such extent by

reason of the fact that he is not the cultivator thereof then if the

lessee lets such extent to any person (hereafter in this subsection

referred to as the "sub-tenant cultivator '') 'and the sub-tenant

cultivator become the tenant cultivator of such extent by reason of

his being the cultivator thereof, the subtenant's right as the tenant

cultivator of such extent shall not be affected in any manner by the

termination of the lease granted by the lessor to the lessee: .

Provided, that the lessee shall not let such extent of paddy land to a

sub-tenant cultivator unless he"

(a) obtains the consent in writing of the owner of such extent

of paddy land; and

(b) thereafter notifies the Agrarian Development Council

within whose area of authority such extent of paddy land

wholly or mainly lies;

4

Provided further that where any extent of paddy land is let by a

lessee to a sub-tenant cultivator without obtaining the consent in

writing of the owner of such extent of paddy land such sub-tenant

cultivator shall not be entitled to any of the rights of a tenant

cultivator in respect of such extent of paddy-land. The

Commissioner-General, after inquiry, shall in writing order that

the sub-tenant cultivator shall vacate such extent of paddy land on

or before such date as shall be specified in that order and if such

sub-tenant cultivator fails to comply with such order he shall be

evicted from such extent in accordance with the provisions of

section 8 and the landlord shall be entitled to cultivate such extent

of paddy land.

The Petitioner's argument is that he is not a sub-tenant cultivator

and there is no.lease agreement. Therefore this section does not apply.

Section 7 of the Act spelt out the procedure for evicting a person

cultivating a paddy land after an inquiry by the Commissioner. Sub

section 10 protects the rights of a sub tenant cultivator but that protection

offered only to the persons coming within the proviso of that section i.e.,

the person obtains the consent in writing of the owner of such extent of

paddy land and thereafter notifies the Agrarian Development Council

within whose area of authority such extent of paddy land wholly or

mainly lies. In the present case, the Petitioner or his father has not

obtained the prior consent of the 1 st Respondent.

Section 6(1) of the Act provides that a lessee becomes a tenant

cultivator. The section reads

(1) When a person who leases out an extent of paddy land under an

oral or written contract such person shall, if he is the cultivator

of such land and is a citizen of Sri Lanka, be the tenant

5

cultivator of such extent of paddy land for the purposes of this

Act,

The Petitioner's argument is that there is no oral or written contract

and he does not come within the ambit of this section. His father was the

tenant cultivator who comes within this section. The letting is explained

in the interpretation section, section 101;

"let" with reference to any extent of paddy land, means to permit

any person, under an oral or written agreement to occupy and use

such extent in consideration of the performance of any service by

him or the payment of rent consisting of a sum of money or a share

of the produce from such extent;

The Petitioner's father was cultivating the paddy land and paid the

rent to the 1 st Respondent. Therefore the petitioner's father cannot sub-let

the paddy land without adhering to the provisions to the proviso of

section 7 (10). The Petitioner cannot come in to the paddy land under his

father, even after his demise, as a successor, where such succession is not

provided by law. On the other hand the Petitioner at the inquiry before the

Commissioner stated that he got the tenant cultivator's rights during the

life time of his father. He said that his father was not well and he started

helping his father and later he became the tenant cultivator.

Under these circumstances we see no reason to interfere with the

findings of the learned High Court Judge.

Appeal is dismissed.
