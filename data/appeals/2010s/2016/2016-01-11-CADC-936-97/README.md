The plaintiff respondent filed an action against the defendant

appellant praying for a judgment that he is the owner of the property

described in the schedule to the plaint and for ejectment of the

defendant appellant from the said property and damages.

2

The plaintiff respondent stated that the said land was originally a

Crown land which was given on a Crown Grant (No. 4689) which on

01/04/1921 to one H.S. Dissanayake after his death his children

inherited the property, who by deed no. 1783 dated 20109/1983

transferred the said property to the respondent appellant. The plaintiff

respondent claimed that when he purchased the property the

respondent appellant occupied a temporary housed in the said land and

agreed to vacate the said property after finding suitable accommodation

but refused to keep his word later and began to dispute the plaintiff

respondent's right causing damage to the said property.

The defendant appellant in the District Court has claimed

prescriptive title to the said property. The defendant appellant in his

answer in paragraph 9 has claimed that he came into the said land in

1976 but while giving evidence at the trial (page 176 of the proceedings)

he has said that he came to the bare land which was unoccupied during

the JVP insurgency in 1971. The defendant appellant in his statement to

the Grama Niladhari marked as P3 states that he came into occupation

in 1975.

The defendant appellants' learned counsel submitted that the

connection between the original permit holder and the transferors of

deed no. 1783 and the mode of succession was not placed before court

and that he only entered the land on 23/06/1985 and started cultivating

the land. He further stated that the action in the District Court was

instituted less than two years after he purchased the property in issue

and the so called predecessors in title had no control over the subject

matter.

The defendant appellant stated that in a Rei Vindicatio Action the

action being an action in Rem heavy burden is cast on the plaintiff to

prove his title and that the plaintiff can not rely on the defendant's poor

title and that the defendant in a Rei Vindicatio Action has nothing to

prove. Vide Wanigaratne vs Juwanis Appuhamy 65 NLR 167,

Dharmadasa vs Jyasena 1997 3 SLR 327.

Citing the judgment in Silva vs Bastian 15 NLR 132 the

defendant appellant stated a Crown Grant by itself creates no

presumption of the title of the Crown to the land which it conveys. He

further submitted that the respondent has not led any evidence to show

that either he or his predecessors in title had possessed the land and

that he only had a mere paper title to the land.

4

The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent submitted that the

respondent produced the Crown Grant dated 01/04/1924 marked P6

and the deed no. 1783A marked P7 in the District Court in evidence

though the appellants cross examined the respondent at length he could

not disprove any of the documents, and that both documents were

established. The defendant respondent stated that the appellant did not

object to P6 and P7 when he closed his case reading these two

documents in evidence, and cited the judgment in Sri Lanka Ports

Authority and another vs Jogulinja Boat-East 1981 (1) SLR 18. He

further submitted that appellant did not ask a single question on the title

of the respondent's properties and that the said evidence stand affirm.

On the issue of the appellant's claim of purported prescriptive title

the respondent stated that the appellant has to justify his occupation of

the property since the respondent had proved his title to the property,

and cited the judgment in Leisa vs Simon 2002 (1) SLR 148.

The respondent stated that under Sec. 3 of the Prescriptive

Ordinance to claim prescriptive title one has to prove ten years of

adverse and independent possession of the property. Sirajadeen vs

Abbas 1994 2 SLR 365 in this judgment Justice G.P.S. De Silva, Chief

Justice has analysed the mode of proof for prescriptive title.

5

The respondent in the District Court has marked P6 and P7 to

prove his title to the land in issue these two documents were read in

evidence and no objections were taken up at the close of his evidence

as stated in the judgment of Samarakoon, Chief Justice in his judgment

in Sri Lanka Ports Authority and another vs Jogulinja Boad-East.

These two documents stand proof to the respondent's title to the said

land. Since the respondent had proved his title to the land the burden

shifts to the appellant to prove his prescriptive title.

In the case of Sirajudeen vs Abbas G.P.S. De Silva, Chief

Justice has analysed the mode of proof of prescriptive title when the title

of the plaintiff is proved the burden shifts to the defendant to establish a

starting point for his acquisition of prescriptive title. In the instant case

the defendant has failed to give an exact date he came into occupation

of the land he has given three different dates in three different places.

The point of acquisition of prescriptive title of the appellant is therefore

contradictory.

The appellant has also failed to produce any documents to

establish his possession of the disputed land.

6

The learned District Judge has carefully analysed the evidence

and documents read in evidence before him and come to his finding I

see no reason to allow the appeal of the appellant to set aside the said

judgment.

For the afore stated reason the judgment of the learned District

Judge delivered on 03/10/1997 is affirmed. The appeal of the appellant

is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 25,0001=.
