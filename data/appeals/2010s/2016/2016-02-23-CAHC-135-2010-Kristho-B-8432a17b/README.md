Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J (PICA)

The Accused -Appellant in this case Krista Baduge Anuruddha was indicted before the High Court of

Ratnapura for causing the death of Galatura Lekamlage Lakshman on 24.04.2003 an offence punishable

under section 296 of the Penal Code.

The Accused -Appellant elected to be tried before the Judge without a Jury and the Learned High

Court Judge of Ratnapura after trial before him had convicted the Accused-Appellant for the above

offence, and sentenced him for death. Being dissatisfied with the above conviction and sentence the

Accused -Appellant had preferred this appeal before us.

During the arguments before us, the Accused-Appellant relied on two grounds of appeal namely,

1. Did the Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by failing to evaluate the possibility of a

sudden fight that spontaneously occurred between the parties

2. Did the Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself when he rejected the plea of insanity

pleaded before him by the Accused-Appellant during the High Court Trial.

However during the argument before us both parties agreed to limit their arguments to the 1 sl ground of

appeal, with liberty to press for the 2nd ground of appeal, if necessity arises at a later stage.

Both, the Accused-Appellant and the deceased were three-wheel drivers by their profession. The

deceased the prosecution witnesses Wimalasiri and Dayarathne, the defence witness Chandrathilake

and the Accused-AppeUant's father Upali were all operating as taxi drivers from the one and the same

3

taxi stand in the Ratnapura Town and the Accused-Appellant was operating his taxi few meters away

from the said taxi stand.

One of the main complaint by the Learned Senior Counsel for the Accused-Appellant before this court

was that the Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the items of evidence which are infavour of the

Accused-Appellant, specially the five contradictions marked during the trial before him and the

evidence of the defence witness, and misdirected himself by failing to consider the possibility of a

sudden fight when evaluating the said evidence.

In the case of Wijerathne V. The Republic 78 NLR 49 the Supreme Court concluded that, "When an

Accused facing a capital charge it is essential that every point infavour of the Accused, though it may

seem trivial, should be placed before the jury. It may well be that all such matters, if so placed before

the jury may create a reasonable doubt, the benefit of which the Accused is entitled to, when the

circumstances against the Accused are emphasized and the trial judge express his opinion as to the

adverse inference that could be drawn from the circumstances, and fails to place the circumstances and

inferences infavour of the Accused before the jury, the Accused is deprived of the substance of a fair

trial."

The prosecution in this case has relied on the evidence of two eye witnesses namely Polwattage

Shantha Wimalasiri and Gilimalege Ranjith Dayarathne two taxi drivers from the same taxi stand.

According to the evidence of witness Shantha Wimalasiri the incident had occurred around 10.45 a.m.

when the deceased, who went on a hire had returned to the park and tried to park his three-wheeler at

the park. Witness had seen the Accused standing near a Lottery shed and heard the deceased asking the

Accused to get in to a side for him to park his three-wheeler. The Accused, who jumped to the left

side, had then stabbed the deceased for several times.

Even though this witness under examination in chief said that the deceased at one stage asked the

Accused-Appellant to get to a side for him to a park his three-wheeler, under cross examination took up

the position that the Accused who jumped to a side when the deceased parked his three-wheeler had all

of a sudden stabbed the deceased several times.

However the next witness called by the prosecution Gilimalage Ranjith Dayarathne, maintained the

earlier position taken up by witness Wimalasiri and said that he saw the Accused-Appellant standing

near the Lottery shed and the deceased had asked the Accused-Appellant to get to a side for him to park

his three-wheeler. When the deceased parked the three-wheeler at the stand, the Accused-Appellant,

who came from the back, had stabbed the deceased several times.

However under cross examination the following contradiction was marked by the defence

The Learned Trial Judge in his judgment at page 262 had considered the above three contradictions and

concluded that the said contradiction does not go to the root of the case. Whilst rejecting 0-4 he had

Even though the Learned High Court Judge observed that "in a case of stabbing of this nature, no one

can say that there was no fight", the Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the plea of sudden fight

but considered only the exception of Grave and Sudden provocation and the plea of insanity. (Page

264)

The defence summoned a witness by the name Chandrathilake to testify on behalf of the Accused-

Appellant. According to the evidence of Chandrathilake he too was operating from the same taxi stand

and on the day in question he too was in the taxi stand when the deceased tried to park his three-

wheeler at the park. At that time the Accused-Appellant was standing near the Lottery shed and when

deceased tried to park the three-wheeler, there were some cross talks between them. He saw the

deceased holding the neck of the Accused-Appellant and when he rushed towards them, he saw the

deceased going to fall. He helped the others to hold the deceased and put him to Wimalasiri's three-

wheeler but said in evidence that he did not see the Accused-Appellant stabbing the deceased or any

blood on the body of the deceased person.

This witness admitted that he did not make a statement to police but said that he gave evidence for the

Accused-Appellant at the non summary inquiry too. The witness was subject to cross examination but

no contradictions or omissions were marked during his evidence.

However the Learned Trial Judge had rejected this evidence since the witness in his evidence did not

refer to the stabbing or seen any blood or injuries at that time. But the witness had seen a scuffle

between the Accused-Appellant and the deceased and deceased going to fall when he was rushing to

the place.

In this regard the Learned Senior Counsel brought to the notice of court to the internal hemorrhage

observed by the Judicial Medical Officer in the Post Mortem Report and further submitted that one

cannot expect to see the entire episode and give evidence but, expected to say what he saw at that time.

The Learned Senior Counsel took up the position that, the three major contradictions marked during the

trial shows a scuffle between the two, where the deceased had hold the Accused-Appellant by his collar

and this position is corroborated in the evidence of the defence witness Chandrathilake. However the

Learned Trial Judge rejected the three contradictions mentioned above along with the defence evidence

and his failure to consider the plea of sudden fight deprived the Accused-Appellant a fair trial.

It is not disputed that the Appellant was convicted on a count of murder before the High Court of

Ratnapura. Section 294 of the Penal Code refers to the offence of murder and the definition of murder

is given as follows:-

294. "Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder-

Firstly-if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of

causing death; or

,II

II

II

~

~ I iI ! t

Secondly:-it is done with the intention if causing such bodily injury as the

offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to

whom the harm is caused; or

Thirdly:-if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any

person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in

the ordinary cause of nature to cause death; or

FOllrthly:-if the person committing the act aware that it is so imminently

dangerous that it must all probability cause death, or such bodily

injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any

excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as

aforesaid. "

The said offence of murder in terms of section 294 of the Penal Code is reduced to culpable homicide

not amounting to murder under section 293 of the Penal Code, if any of the five exceptions to section

294 could be shown to apply. The exceptions are as follows:-

1. Grave and sudden provocation;

2. Exceeding in good faith the right of private defence;

3. Bona fide overstepping of the limits of his authority by a public servant;

4. The plea of sudden fight and

5. The case of a mother who causes the death of her child under the age of twelve months

when the balance of her mind is disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from

the effect of giving birth to a child or by reason of the effect of location consequent to the

birth of the child.

Learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant relied on Exception 4 to section 294 and submitted that the

Learned Trial Judge had not evaluated the possibility of a sudden fight. Learned Counsel submitted that

the evidence before the High Court specially the three contradictions he relied upon and the defence

evidence clearly established that the incident which resulted in the deceased being injured, fell under

Exception 4 to section 294 of the Penal Code and throughout the case that it was the position taken by

the Accused-Appellant.

The Exception 4 to section 294 of the Penal Code reads as follows:-

"Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in

a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the

offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual

manner:'

A careful consideration of the said exception indicates that the basis for the mitigation is purely

depended on the fact that the murder had taken in a sudden fight, which had occurred in the heat of

passion upon a sudden quarrel without no malice or vindictiveness.

In this regard the Leaned Deputy Solicitor General relied on the decision in Bhagwan Munjaji Pawade

V. State of Maharashyra AIR (1979) SC 133 with reference to Exception 4 to section 300 of the

Indian Penal Code which is identical to Exception 4 to section 294 of our Penal Code where Sakaria J

held'

"It is true some of the conditions for the applicability of Exception 4 to section 300

exit here, but not all. The quarrel had broken out suddenly, but there was no sudden

fight between the deceased and the appellant. 'Fight' postulates a bilateral transaction

in which blows are exchanged. The deceased was unarmed. He did not cause any

injury to the appellant or his companions. Furthermore, no less than fatal injuries were

~ ff

inflicted by the appellant with an axe, which is a formidable weapon on the unarmed

victim. Appellant is therefore, not entitled to the benefit of Exception 4 .... "

According to Learned Deputy Solicitor General, the above decision was followed in the case of

Gurudeniya Lekamgedara Nishantha Bandara SC Appeal 62/2008 SC minute dated 12.10.2011

and submitted that the evidence of the two eye witnesses and the Medical evidence led at the trial

r

\

[

warrants a conviction for murder as held in the Indian decision of Bhagwan Munjaji Pawade's case. I

However when following the above Indian decision by the Supreme Court in the case of Gurudeniya

Lekamgedara Nishantha Bandara was mindful of the events that had taken place on the day in question.

According to the facts of the said case, there had been three incidents that had occurred between 10.30

p.m. and 11.45 p.m. on the day in question. In the first incident the Accused-Appellant had poured

blood from an injury caused after a fight, into the dishes where the food was served to the villagers

after an arms giving. Few minutes thereafter the second incident had taken place in the compound when

the Appellant dashed a chair and assaulted with the same to whom he assaulted little while ago.

The third incident happened thereafter in front of the Accused-Appellant's gate when the deceased with

some of his family members walked up to the Appellant's house. The Accused-Appellant had dealt a

blow on the head of the deceased with a club.

In the said circumstances, the Supreme Court having considered series of events took place observed

that the prerequisite referred to in the said exception had not been fulfilled in order to succeed the plea

of sudden fight.

In the case of Bandahamy V. Senanayaka 69 NLR 313 at page 322 Basnayake CJ observed with

reference to the English decision in Quinn V. Leathem as follows,

It is well settled that a case is only an authority for what it actually decides (Quinn V. Leathem) [1

(1901) A.C 495 at 506]. The only decision of authority, on the question whether, before enforcing as a

decree of the court an award brought to it in pursuance of Rule 38 (13), the court has power to satisfy

itself that the award which is brought to it for enforcement is a valid award made by a person duly

authorized by the Ordinance to determine a dispute which has properly arisen for the decision of an

extra- judicial tribunal under the Ordinance, is Jayasinhe's case with which I am in entire agreement.

Under these circumstances this court has a duty to consider the events that had taken place when

considering whether the Learned Trial Judge had misdirected himself when he failed to consider the

plea of sudden fight in the present case.

As referred by me earlier, the Accused-Appellant was standing near a Lottery shed when the deceased

tried to park his three-wheeler at the three-wheel park. None of the witnesses referred to any utterances

made by the Accused-Appellant when he was asked to get into a side by the deceased. There is no

evidence indicative of any previous incidents between the Accused-Appellant and the deceased led at

the trial other than the fact that the Accused-Appellant was not allowed to operate his three-wheeler

from the same taxi stand.

As observed by me earlier in this judgment, out of the contradictions marked, 0-2, 0-3 and 0-4

which is indicative of a sudden fight between the two prior to the incident was kept away by the two

eye witnesses in their evidence before trial court. The Learned Trial Judge had not considered the said

contradictions as serious contradiction which goes to the root of the case. This fact was further

established by the evidence of the defence witness whose evidence was also rejected by the trial judge.

f It! l ,II

l !ItI

12

However when considering the material placed before this court, I am of the VIew that the said

contradictions are vital contradictions and the Learned Trial Judge should have given due consideration

to those contradictions and to the evidence of the defence witness.

For the reasons set out above I conclude that the Learned Trial Judge had misdirected himself by failing

to evaluate the possibility of a sudden fight in the present case. According to the Medical evidence

placed before trial court the deceased had received 5 injuries out of which the 1 sl is only an abrasion but

out of the other injuries, 3 injuries are sufficient to cause death in the ordinary cause of nature and the

other (injury no 4) is necessarily fatal.

Even though the accused had acted excessively when inflicting the said injuries using a knife to the

chest area of the deceased, when considering the material placed before this court which is indicative of

a sudden fight, without premeditation in a heat of passion without taking any undue advantage.

I therefore decide to quash the conviction and sentence and replace it with a conviction for culpable

homicide not amounting to murder under section 297 of the Penal Code on the basis of a sudden fight

and imposed a sentence of 18 years Rigorous Imprisonment. I further make order to implement the said

sentence of 18 years Rigorous Imprisonment from the date of conviction i.e. with effect from

20.07.2010.

Appeal is partly allowed.
