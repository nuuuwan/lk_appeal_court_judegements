VIJITH K. MALALGODA, PCJ(P I CAl

This is a writ application filed by the petitioner, B. Yasodha,

a daughter of an employee of the Colombo Municipal Council. According

to the pleadings before this Court, we observe that the petitioner's father

was an employee of the Colombo Municipal Council until he retired from

the service in 1992. The petitioner's father had come into occupation of

the premises in question as an employee of the Colombo Municipal

Council. The petitioner's father was permitted to occupy the said

quarters only during his service as an employee of the Colombo

Municipal Council, but we observe that even after his retirement he was

. --

in occupation of this house with his family and it was brought to the

notice of Court that the petitioner's father had passed away while he was

in London in the year 2005. In 2010 the petitioner's mother too had

passed away. But even thereafter, the petitioner had continued to

occupy this premises until the possession of the said premises was taken

back under the Local Government Quarters Recovery of Possession Act

after filing necessary action before Court. We observe that pursuing this

action has now become academic but we further observe that the

petitioner has no locus standi to pursue this application for the reason

that the person who had been permitted to stay in this premises is her

farther and not the petitioner. The petitioner was never an employee of

the Colombo Municipal Council. Considering all these issues we see no

merit in this application and therefore we decide to dismiss this

application. Application is accordingly dismissed. No costs is ordered.

I agree.
