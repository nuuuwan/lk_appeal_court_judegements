The original plaintiff had instituted a partition action in the District Court

of Colombo to partition the land described in the second schedule to the plaint

under the provisions of the Partition Act. There were two defendants at the

commencement and later a third defendant had intervened. After parties filed

their statement of claim the case was taken up for trial and judgment was given

to partition the land sought to be partitioned. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment the third defendant Lanka Lands (Pvt) Ltd had preferred this appeal.

While the appeal was pending the name of the appellant company was struck

off from the company register due to the fact that it had not been registered

under the new Companies Act No. 7 of 2007. The counsel for the plaintiff

respondent has raised a preliminary issue that since the appellant company

has ceased to exist the appeal can not be maintained. Both parties tendered

their submissions on this issue. While the submissions were pending

Communication and Business Equipment (Pvt) Ltd has filed an application in

terms of Sec. 404 of the Civil Procedure Code to have itself substituted in place

of the Appellant Company stating that the appellant company had transferred

all their rights to the petitioner by deed no. 907 dated 09/08/1994. The

judgment of the District Court was delivered on 04/07/2000 by this time the

third defendant was no longer in existence.

The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that in a partition action

the court has to determine the rights of parties as at the filing of the action and

3

i I I I

;~

that court cannot simply shut out a party without hearing that party. To do so

the court had to substitute the said party. The petitioner stated that the third

defendant appellant had transferred a divided portion of land owned by them

which is a separate land and not the subject matter of the partition action to the

petitioner. He further stated that on the face of the deed marked "X" lot B

claimed by the defendant as a separate divided land in the partition action has

been sold to the petitioner pending the action. The petitioner stated that this

appeal was abated and that the petitioner made an application to relist the

instant appeal.

The petitioner submitted that at the time the partition case was filed the

amendment to the Companies Act was not in operation. The petitioner has

cited a number of judgments to say that the substitution can be made under

section 404 of the Civil Procedure Code in a partition action before the final

decree.

The plaintiff respondents submitted that section 66 of the Partition Act

prohibits the alienation of rights and interests of parties pending a partition

action. Citing the judgment in Virasinghe vs Virasinghe and others 2002 (1)

SLR 1 the respondents stated that an alienation of property can not be

permitted after the registration of a lis pendens with regard to a pending

partition action.

The respondents stated that the petitioner can not challenge the due

registration of the lis pendens in this action as there was no issue to that effect

at the trial and cited the judgment in Hanafi vs Nallamma 1998 (1) SRL 73

where it has been stated that a case has to proceed on the issues framed at

the trial. The respondents cited a number of cases on the argument of

transferring rights after the lis pendens was registered.

The respondents stated that the petitioner who has not acted with

uberima fide and who has slept over its alleged rights is not entitle to invoke the

discretion vested in this court under Sec. 404 of the Civil Procedure Code.

The respondents also stated that the petitioner is guilty of laches, that

the appellant company was struck off from the company register in 2010

according to R1 and the preliminary objection of maintability of the appeal was

taken up in 2011 and the present application for substituted was made in 2012

one year after the date of objections and two years after the appellant company

was struck off.

The transfer of interest by deed no. 907 had taken place in 1994 where

as substitution was sought in 2012 eight years after the transfer. Clearly the

petitioner has been sleeping over in his rights. The substitution was sought

after the appeal was filed and the case was abated and long after the appellant

5

1 l i t

company ceased to exist, therefore the judgments cited by the petitioner on

substitution is not applicable to the instant case.

Sec. 66 of the Partition Act states:

66 (1). ''After a partition action is duly registered as a lis pendens

under the Registration of Documents Ordinance no

voluntary alienation, lease or hypothecation of any

undivided share or interest of or in the land to which the

action relates shall be made or effected until the final

determination of the action by dismissal thereof, or by the

entry of a decree of partition under section 36 or by the

entry of certificate of sale".

66(2). Any voluntary alienation, lease or hypothecation made or

effected in contravention of the provisions of subsection

(1) of this section shall be void.

The petitioner has purchased the rights of the appellant after the lis

pendens was registered.

The petitioner stated that the land transferred by deed 907 is not part of

the subject matter to the partition action while making submissions if so why

does the petitioner want to intervene in the instant application. If it is so if his

application is refused his rights will not be affected.

For ther afore stated reasons the application of the petitioner is refused

with costs fixed at Rs. 50,0001=.
