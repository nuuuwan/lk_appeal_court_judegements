Malinie Gunaratne, J.

B.L.P.R Abayarathna, the Divisional Secretary of Minuwangoda, on

05.01.2007, applied to the Magistrate's Court of Minuwangoda, under

Section 42(2) of the Land Acquisition Act for an order directing the Fiscal to

deliver possession of the land in question to the Applicant - Respondent -

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 1 st Appellant) for and on behalf of

the State and to eject the Respondent - Petitioner - Respondents (hereinafter

referred to as the Respondents) from the land in question.

A notice had been issued on the Appellants and they claimed a right to

show cause against this application. Their claim was disallowed by the

learned Magistrate and delivered her Order on 03 rd August 2007, issuing an

order to fiscal in terms of Section 42(2) of the Land Acquisition Act

enabling the Appellants to eject the Respondents from the land in question.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondents sought to move in

revision against the said Order by the Revision Application No. 342/2007

filed before the High Court ofNegombo.

The learned High Court Judge of Negombo, delivering her order on

23.10.2008 revised and set aside the Order of the learned Magistrate after

having heard the Counsel for the respective parties.

The Appellants have preferred this Appeal against the decision of the

learned High Court Judge, praying for annulling of the said Order and for

the reliefs prayed for in the Petition.

The facts that have given rise to the present application may be briefly

stated as follows:

The 1st Appellant took steps in or about January 2007 to take over

possession, on behalf of the State, the land which forms the subject matter of

this Application on the basis that the said land has been acquired by the State

in terms of the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, No.60 of 1961, as

amended.

The Respondents objected to obtaining possession of the land and

refrained from handing over possession. Thereafter, the Appellants made an

application to the Magistrate's Court in terms of Section 42(2) of the Act for

an order directing the fiscal to deliver possession of the land in dispute for

and on behalf of the State and the learned Magistrate made an Order to that

effect.

In the course of the hearing of this case the learned President's

Counsel for the Respondents contended that the Respondents refused to

hand over the possession of the land as the acquisition was not done lawfully

and according to the provisions of the Act. It was the contention of the

learned Deputy Solicitor General, that the Appellants had satisfied all the

statutory requisites for an acquisition in accordance with the provisions of

the Act and thus acted lawfully in obtaining an order in terms of Section 42

(2) of the Act.

He further contended, in their objections filed in the High Court took

up the position that prior to the application made by the 1 st Appellant to the

Magistrate's Court under Section 42(2), the Respondents had filed a Writ

Application No. 222105 in the Court of Appeal with regard to the

I l I I I I

I I I I I I

Acquisition and it was terminated upon a settlement reached by

parties.Hence it is the contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General,

that consequent to the settlement, the legality of acquisition was no longer in

Issue.

On examining the said order it appears that the case has been settled

between the 1 st Respondent and the 1 st Appellant. The settlement was the 1 st

Appellant had agreed to hold an inquiry under Section 9 of the Land

Acquisition Act and to make an order as to compensation on or before

31103/2007.

It is important to note, that the Respondents in not disclosing of the

Court of Appeal case initiated by the 1 st Respondent and its settlement, had

in fact suppressed a material fact from the learned High Court Judge and

also from the learned Magistrate.

The Respondents were under a duty to disclose all material facts to

this Court to arrive at a correct adjudication on the issues. In the decision of

Alphonso Appuhamy vs. Hettiarachchi 77 N L R 121, Justice Pathirana held

that when a party is seeking a relief from the Court upon an application he

enters into a contractual obligation with the Court when he files an

application in the Registry and in terms of that contractual obligation he is

required to disclose all material facts fully and frankly to the Court.

It is manifestly clear that the Respondents have been remiss in duty

and have failed to carry out their imperative legal duty and obligation to

Court. In such circumstances, Justice Pathirana ruled that the Court is

entitled to raise this matter in limine and dismiss the application without

investigating into the merits of the application.

I hold that the Respondents have failed to make a full and frank

disclosure of all material facts to Court and the Respondents have been

remiss in complying with the aforesaid contractual obligation to Court.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General has adverted Court to the

document filed in the High Court which is marked V 16 along with the

objections. It is relevant to note, the Respondents have not denied or

disputed the Appellant's contention either in a reply or by an affidavit.

On examining the said Order it appears, that the case has been settled

between the 1 st Respondent (the Petitioner of the case) and the 1 st Appellant

(2nd Respondent). The settlement is that the 1 st Appellant had agreed to hold

an inquiry under Section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act and to make an order

as to compensation on or before 31.03.2007.

The contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General is, despite the

fact that numerous notices were issued, the 1 st Respondent did not attend the

compensation inquiry as directed by the Court of Appeal. Learned Deputy

Solicitor General further contended, in abiding by the said Order the

compensation was deposited in the District Court ofNegombo and thereafter

the Respondents made an application to the Magistrate's Court in terms of

Section 42(2) of the Land Acquisition Act, for an order directing the fiscal to

deliver possession of the land in dispute.

In the Written Submissions filed m this Court by the learned

President's Counsel, it was contended that the compensation payable to the

Respondents, relates to Lot 16 and have no relevance to Lot 30. However, it

is the position of the Appellants that dispute with regard to compensation is

not relevant to the validity of an acquisition under Section 38 Proviso (a) of

the Land Acquisition Act.

Hence, I am agreeable with the contention of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General and the view of this Court also is that the Respondents

estopped by challenging the validity of acquisition of the land in dispute,

since the Writ Application No. 222/05 filed by the Respondents challenging

the validity of the acquisition had been settled. Hence the view of this Court

is the legality of acquisition was no longer an issue.

I am now prepared to deal with the Section 42(2) of the Land

Acquisition Act. Section 42(2) which reads as follows:

"Where any officer directed by an Order under Section 38 to take

possession of any land is unable or apprehends that he will be unable to take

possession of that land because of any obstruction or resistance which has

been or is likely to be offered, such officer shall, on his making an

application in that behalf to the Magistrate's Court having jurisdiction over

the place where that land is situated, be entitled to an order of that Court

directing the Fiscal to deliver possession of that land to him for an on behalf

of Her Majesty".

An examination of the relevant Sections in the Act show that the

scheme of the ordinance is to enable the State to take immediate possession

of a land which is urgently needed for a public purpose. The words of

Section 42(2) quoted above clearly show that "any officer directed by an

Order under Section 38 to take possession shall be entitled to an Order of

Court directing the Fiscal to deliver possession ".

In VIew of the provIsIOns of the Land Acquisition Act, every

application for ejectment should be conclusive evidence of the facts set out

therein. In the case of M. Mohamed Lebbe and Others V s. Ananda Madana

(D.R.O. Yatinuwara), 66 N.L.R. 239, it was held that the Land Acquisition

Act makes provision for the issue of Writ upon an ex-parte application and

in the first instance, upon an application the Magistrate has no option but to

make order for the issue of the Writ.

It was held in the case of H.S.H.P. Gunawardana vs. D.R.O.

Weligama Korale 69 N.L.R. 166 before an Order for delivery of possession

of a land is made by a Magistrate in terms of Section 42(2) of the Land

Acquisition Act, evidence should be led before the Magistrate either orally

or on affidavit in support of the averments in the application for the

ejectment order. It was held the evidence may be led ex parte.

In the context of the case in hand the 1 st Respondent has filed an

affidavit along with the application in support of the averments in the

application.

It is important to note, although the Section 42(2) does not provide

any mechanism to grant an opportunity to show cause before the Magistrate

after filing an application under Section 42(2) of the Land Acquisition Act,

the learned Magistrate has allowed the Respondents to show cause why they

should not be issued an order for ejectment.

The main ground set out by the Respondents was that the vesting

order under Section 38 A of the Act is of no force or avail in law in as much

as there has been non compliance with the provisions of the Land

Acquisition Act.

The learned Magistrate pronounced her order dated 03.08.2007,

holding that since the Respondents have not provided any valid grounds to

show that physical possession should not be handed over, the 1 st Appellant is

entitled to take possession of the land in dispute under Section 42(2) of the

Act.

Since the legality of acquisition was no longer an issue at the time of

filing the application by the 1st Appellant under Section 42(2) of the Land

Acquisition Act, the learned Magistrate correctly had not addressed her mind

to the said fact. The learned Magistrate considering all the facts and the law,

had delivered her Order ejecting the Respondents from the land in dispute

and the learned Magistrate had arrived at the above determination to eject

the Respondents from the land in dispute does not merit any variation.

Hence, I am also of the view, that the grounds set out by the

Respondents do not find any matters which are legally relevant to the

question of ejectment.

On perusal of the entirety of the Judgment of the learned High Court

Judge it is apparent that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider

the right question. The learned High Court Judge has considered only the

legality of acquisition of the land in dispute. Hence I am of the view that the

learned High Court Judge was misdirected in law in rejecting (It is

important to note that the learned High Court Judge has rejected the order of

the learned Magistrate but not set aside) the order made by the learned

Magistrate.

Taking into consideration all these matters, it is my considered view

that the learned High Court Judge was clearly wrong when she reversed the

determination of the learned Magistrate.

For the foregoing reasons I allow the Appeal and accordingly set aside

the Judgement of the learned High Court Judge. Consequently, the

determination that was challenged by way of Revision in the High Court will

now prevail and the learned Magistrate is directed to give effect to the same.
