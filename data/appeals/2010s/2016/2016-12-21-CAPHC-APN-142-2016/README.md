This is a revision application filed against an order of the High

Court of Kurunegala pronounced on a revision application canvassed the

order delivered on a maintenance application by the Magistrate Court.

The learned High Court Judge dismissed the revision application and this

application is to revise the said order.

Without filing an appeal, whether a revision application can be

maintained against an order made on a revision application is in issue.

This application is to revise an order of the High Court made on an

i I ! I I I ! I I I

application for maintenance filed under the Maintenance Ordinance. The

Ordinance was repealed by the Maintenance Act No 37 of 1999. The

section 20 of the Maintenance Act it has provided that;

20. (1) Notwithstanding the repeal of the Maintenance Ordinance-

(a) all proceedings instituted under that Ordinance; and

(b) all appeals from orders made under that ordinance,

and pending on the day preceding the date of commencement of

this Act shall be heard and disposed of, in all respects, as

though such Ordinance had not been repealed.

(2) Every order made under the Maintenance Ordinance and

pending on the day preceding the date of commencement of this

Act, shall be deemed to be an order made under this Act and

may be enforced accordingly.

Under this section only the appeals pending before the on the day

of commencement of the Act are to be heard under the repealed

Ordinance. This reVISIOn application IS filed long after the

commencement of the Maintenance Act. Therefore the provisions of the

new Act shall apply to this application.

Under section 14 of the Act the procedure for appeal is provided.

The section reads;

14. (1) Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any order made

by a Magistrate under section 2 or section 11 may prefer an appeal

to the relevant High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution in like manner as if the order was a final order

pronounced by Magistrate's Court in a criminal case or matter,

and sections 320 to 330 (both inclusive) and sections 357 and 358

III!

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 shall,

mutatis mutandis, apply to such appeal:

Provided however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in

section 323 of the Criminal Procedure Code Act, No. 15 of 1979

such order under section 2 shall not be stayed by reason of such

appeal, unless the High Court directs otherwise for reasons to be

recorded:

Provided further that the Magistrate in forwarding the record to

the High Court shall retain a copy of his order for purposes of

enforcement.

(2) Any person dissatisfied with an order made by a High Court in

the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction under this section, may

prefer an appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court, on a question of

law, with the leave of the High Court, and where such leave is

refused, with the special leave of the Supreme Court, first had an

obtained.

As per subsection (2) of section 14, the appeal from the High Court

is to the Supreme Court, not to the Court of Appeal. Therefore when the

appellate jurisdiction is specifically vested with the Supreme Court by the

Legislature, can a party file a revision application, which is also exercised

as a part of the appellate jurisdiction, is questionable. The case of

Abeywardene V. Ajith De Silva [1998] 1 Sri L R 134 was decided on the

issue of Appellate jurisdiction on the matters where the High Court

pronounced orders on revision applications. In that case the Court held

that "A direct appeal does not lie to the Supreme Court from the order of

the High Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. An appeal

from such order should be made to the Court of Appeal". Whether this

authority can be applied to the Maintenance Act is a matter to be argued

i

because the Maintenance Act is being a special law which has been

enacted after the said judgment with specific provision where the

appellate jurisdiction was vested in the Supreme Court by the Legislature.

Under these circumstances, I assume that this Court shall not make

a determination on these issues without having the privilege of hearing

both parties. Therefore, without making a decision and without prejudice

to any objection, on jurisdiction, I proceed to consider the merits of the

application.

The Respondent Petitioner Petitioner's (the Petitioner) application

to the High Court was to set aside the orders of the learned Magistrate

dated 06.08.2001 and 04.08.2015. The facts of this application are that

the Applicant Respondent Respondent (the Respondent) made an

application for maintenance of herself and two minor children. The Court

at the first instance ordered to pay maintenance to the children with

consent of the Petitioner. The application in relation to the maintenance

of the wife has taken a considerable time and on 06.08.2001 the Court

ordered to pay Rs. 1000.00 per month as maintenance to the Respondent.

Being aggrieved by the said decision the Petitioner filed an appeal in the

High Court. A copy of the petition of appeal is attached to the certified

copy of the case record of the Magistrate Court marked Pl. The Petitioner

is absolutely silence in his application to this Court as well as in the

application to the High Court on this appeal. Thereafter the Court

enhanced the amount of maintenance to Rs. 4000.00 on 08.07.2014. The

Petitioner filed one revision application in the High Court of Kurunegala

to revise the both orders of the learned Magistrate dated 06.08.2001 and

04.08.2015.

The learned High Court Judge has come to the conclusion that

there is a delay in making the application to revise the order dated

6

06.08.2001 and has not disclosed the fact that there was an appeal prior to

this application. I am in total agreement with the learned High Court

Judge on this finding. The Petitioner has failed to explained the delay

even in this Court.

Seylan Bank v. Thangaveil [2004J 2 Sri L R 101 at 105,

In this application in revision the petitioner seeks to set aside the

orders dated 7.3.2002 and 10.01.2002 made by the learned District

Judge. The petitioner has filed this application on 17.7.2003. It

appears that there is a delay of one year and four months in

respect of the order dated 7.3.2002 and a delay of seven months

from the order dated 10.01.2003. The petitioner has not explained

the delay. Unexplained and unreasonable delay in seeking relief by

way of revision, which is a discretionary remedy, is a factor which

will disentitle the petitioner to it. An application for judicial review

should be made promptly unless there are good reasons for the

delay. The failure on the part of the petitioner to explain the delay

satisfactorily is by itself fatal to the application.

In the present case there is an unexplained delay of 14 years.

The learned High Court Judge was of the view that the relevant

documents were not tendered to the Court with the revision application.

Under the Rule 3(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules

1990, the material documents have to be filed with the application.

Failure to submit the material documents is considered as a fatal defect by

the superior courts. In this Court we are considering whether the order

made by the learned High Court Judge is erroneous. The defect made in

the High Court by the Petitioner by not submitting the relevant

documents with the revision application, cannot be rectified by tendering

them to this Court. The application made to the High Court will remain as

l 1

a defective application. Therefore the order of the learned High Court

Judge that the application is bad correct and it will not become incorrect

by tendering those documents to this Court.

Under these circumstances, I see no reason to issue notice on the

Respondent.

Notice refused and the application dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

H.C.J.Madawala J.

I agree.
