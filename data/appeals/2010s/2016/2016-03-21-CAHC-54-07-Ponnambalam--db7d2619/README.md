Order

Vijith K. MaJaJgoda PC J

The Accused-Appellant Ponnambalam Sathees was indicted before the High Court of Kandy for

committing the offences of,

1. Murder of one Rakan Balendran on 01.10.1998 an offence punishable

under section 296 of the Penal Code.

2. Robbery of a Van carrying the distinct number 62-2014 an offence

punishable under section 380 of the Penal Code.

When the Indictment was served on the accused-appellant, he elected to be tried before a Judge

without a jury. At the Concision of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge had convicted the accused-

appellant on both counts and imposed a sentence as follows.

Count 1-

Count 2-

Death sentence

5 years Rigorous Imprisonments with fine of Rs. 2000/-,

in default one month imprisonment

Being dissatisfied with the said conviction and sentence the accused-appellant had preferred this

appeal.

This refers to a case of Robbery of van after killing the driver of the said van. The van carrying the

distinct number 62-2014 which was hired from Colombo was stopped by the officers attached to

Lindula Police Station on a tip off in the early hours of 01.10.1998. At the time the vehicle was

searched, it was driven by the accused-appellant. Since the police had information to the effect that it

was a stolen vehicle and was trying to dispose at a lower price, the accused appellant was arrested

along with the vehicle by the Officer in Charge of Police Station Lindula Inspector of Police H.M.

Srinath Nanda and produced at the Lindula Police Station.

Based on the material revealed during the investigation the accused-appellant was subsequently

produced before the Magistrate of Nuwara Eliya for the murder of Rakan Balendran the driver of the

said van and robbery of the van carrying distinct No. 62-2014.

In the absence of any eye witnesses to the murder, the entire case was based on circumstantial

evidence. During the trial, the prosecution led the evidence of several witness including 3 lay

witnesses and 7 official witnesses.

According to the evidence of witness Sinnaiah Muththu who was also a van driver from sea street

(Hetti Veediya) Colombo, the deceased too was hiring a van in the same area with him on 30th

September 1998. When he was at sea street around 5.00 -5.30 pm, the accused came to him and

discussed a hire to go to Hatton informing that he was sick. As the witness didn't know the accused, he

had refused the hire, but the deceased had taken over the hire since the deceased too was from Hatton

area. Witness had seen the deceased leaving with the accused thereafter. The following day he heard

the death of the Deceased and his statement was recorded by the police. The witness had identified the

accused at an identification parade which was held at the Magistrate Court of Nuwara Eliya, as the

person who discussed the hire with him on 30th September and left with the deceased on a hire.

The next witness the prosecution had relied upon during the High Court trial was Dehiwala Gedara

Vipula Ananda Thilak Kumara a Police Constable attached to Dimbula- Pathana Police Station on 30th

September 1998.

According to his evidence he was on duty on 30th night, attached to a road block opposite Kotagala

Petrol Filling Station. Along with him there were 4 other officers detailed for this road block and he

was the most senior officer among them.

At 1.30 am they searched a van with the distinct No. 62-2014 which was going towards Thalawakele

from Hatton area. Two people were travelling in that van including the driver and their identity was

recorded in the register maintained at the road block as R. Balan the driver and Sathees Ponnambalam

as the passenger. Witness had identified the accused-appellant as the person who travelled in the said

van, at the parade as well as in court.

The prosecution had mainly relied on the evidence of two more police officers during the High Court

Trial. According to the evidence of Chief Inspector of Police Herath Mudiyanselage Srinath Nanda, he

was attached to Lindula Police Station as the Officer in Charge during the period relevant to this case.

Since 25th September he received an information of an attempt to dispose a stolen vehicle but until 1st

October, he could not obtain substantial details with regard to the said transaction. However early

4

hours of the 151 October he received information from his private informant about an attempt to

dispose a van but it is being driven away due to the non availability of cash with the buyers.

On this information he immediately arranged a road block on the main road opposite Lindula Police

Station. He received the information at 3.15 am and by 3.20 am the road block was arranged and the

witness had personally engaged in the road block duty along with PS 7886, PS 22498 and Police

Assistant 21068.

Around 4.30 am they stopped a van, at the road block on suspicion. The van was driven by the suspect

in the present case and he could neither prove his identify at that time nor he could submit any

documents to establish the ownership of the van.

The suspect was arrested immediately thereafter and after questioning him, his statement was recorded

at the Police Station.

Since the suspect had disclosed certain information with regard to the driver of the said van, the

witness had gone to a place called "Despord on the Nuwara Eliya- Nanu Oya road, in order to recover

the body of the Driver of the van.

The said statement to the effect, "O)~~ qC3@)~~ OC5)~O RllCS O(.J~6la ql~ O(.J~6la @)t:lc3@)ofCj

the body of the driver was produced marked P-1 at the High Court Trial.

According to the witness the place was pointed out to him by the accused-appellant and the

observations made with regard to the place where the body was found by him at that time is important

to be considered by this court.

Since the place where the body was recovered comes within Nanu Oya Police Division, witness had

taken steps to inform Nanu Oya Police and thereafter the investigation was carried out by the

Nanu Oya Police Station. IP Keerthiratne of the Nanu Oya Police Station had given evidence with

regard to the investigation carried out by Nanu Oya Police Station, but it was revealed from his

evidence that the major part of the investigation was not carried out by Nanu Oya Police but by the

officers attached to District Crime Detection Bureau Kandy. The investigation carried out by the said

unit was revealed from the evidence of Chief Inspector Senarath Bandara Senevirathne. This witness

had visited the scene of crime on the same morning on the instruction of his superiors and thereafter

taken charge of the suspect who was in the custody of Lindula Police Station.

During the investigations carried out by the District Crime Detection Bureau Kandy, the officers have

visited the house of the accused's father in Meraya Estate Lindula. During the said investigation police

had recovered a leather bag containing some cloths, a cassette player removed from a vehicle, Driving

license belong to the deceased License and the Insurance of the van and some other documents belong

to G.G.T. Fernando, Perumal Seruwan and J.D.D. Fernando.

Subsequent investigations carried out by the said unit revealed that the vehicle in question was

belonging to the said G.G.T. Fernando and J.D.D. Fernando.

In addition to the above evidence the next important evidence relied upon by the prosecution was the

evidence of the Dr. Indrasiri Perera who performed the Post Mortem Inquiry of the deceased at

Nuwara Eliya Hospital. r

Considering the injuries he observed on the body of the deceased he has come to the conclusion that

the cause of death was due to manual strangulation, most probably by one person, either from his side

or from his behind. When the doctor was confronted with fact whether it was possible for more than

one person to commit the said act, his position was that it was not possible, considering the injuries

found on the neck area. He expected more injuries on the neck if the act was committed by more than

one person.

When the doctor was questioned about the stomach contents, the position taken up by the doctor was

that other than partly digested food he could not observe anything else in the stomach contents.

The accused-appellant whilst making a dock statement admitted hiring the van to go home, checking

the van at Kotagala by police but said that, at Thalawakele three men, known to the deceased had got

in to the van and at Despord the vehicle was stopped in order for them to take some drinks. Two of

them went down near the bridge with the deceased and one person stayed in the van with him. Few

minutes later only those two returned without the driver and when he questioned as to what happened

to the driver, they pointed out a knife at him and threatened to kill him. They asked the details of him

and thereafter asked him to throw all the belongings of the deceased which was in the van and

thereafter bring the van to Thalawakele and all three left. However he had gone home dropped the

belongings of the deceased at his father's house and decided to go to the police station but on his way

to the police he was arrested by police.

During the arguments before this court, Learned President's Counsel appeanng for the

accused-appellant raised the following grounds of appeal.

a) Learned Trial Judge had permitted a large volume of inadmissible evidence to get into the

record which was influenced the mind of the Trial Judge.

b) Learned Trial Judge had permitted hearsay evidence to be led at the trial and relied upon

the said evidence arriving at his final decision.

c) Learned Trial Judge had failed to set out the legal principles that he applied in arriving at

the verdict

d) Learned Trial Judge had failed to set out the extent to which he relied upon in the section

27 statement

e) Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider matters which are favourable to the accused-

appellant

Whilst raising the said arguments the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant had referred to

several portions of evidence from the evidence of the arresting officer Inspector of Police Srinath

Nanda.

When considering the above evidence led at the High Court Trial before the Judge (without a jury) this

court is reminded of the provisions in section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance to the effect.

25 (1) No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused

of any offence.

In the case of The Queen V. Murugan Ramasamy (1964) 66 NLR 265 Viscount Radcliffe made the

following observation, with regard reception in evidence of confessions made to police officers' as

follows;

"There can be no doubt as to what is the general purpose of section 25 and 26. It is to recognize

the danger of giving credence to self-incriminating statements made to policemen or made

whilst in police custody, not necessarily because of suspicion that improper pressure may have

been brought to bear for the purpose of securing convictions. Police authority itself, however

carefully controlled, carries a menace to those brought suddenly under its shadow; and these

I ! ItII I

r! I t Ii ! ! [ tI1I-I

8

two sections recognize and provide against the danger of such persons making incriminating

confessions with the intention of placating authority and without regard to the truth of what

they are saying"

As this court observes, majority of the reported decisions on the above provisions were decided at a

time the trial were taken up before a jury and the argument at that time was that, the jury was

prejudiced when such confessionary evidence was led in evidence before the jury.

In the present day context, when majority of the cases are tried before the Judge without a jury, it is

frequently argued that, the Trial Judge with a trained legal mind was alive and mindful of the relevant

principles of law and has applied them in arriving at his conclusion.

This position was discussed in the case of Dayananda Loku Golappaththi and Eight Others V. The

State 2003 (3) SLR 362 as follows;

"In a Jury trial an accused is tried by his own peers. Jurors are ordinary laymen. In order to

perform their duties specified in section 232 of the Code, the Trial Judge has to inform them of

their duties. In a trial by a Judge of the High Court without a jury, there is no provision similar

to section 217. There is no requirement similar to section 229 that the Trial Judge should lay

down the law which he is to be guided. In appeal the Appellate Judges will consider whether in

fact the Trial Judge was alive and mindful of the relevant principle of law and has applied them

in arriving at his conclusion. The law takes for granted that a Judge with a trained Legal mind

is well possessed of the principles of law, he would apply."

When considering the argument raised by the learned President's Counsel for the accused-appellant,

what is important to consider at this stage is whether the Learned Trial Judge was influenced by

permitting the said inadmissible material being led at the High Court Trial.

When considering the Judgment of the Learned Trial Judge, it is observed by this court that the

Learned Trial Judge had not made any specific remarks to the items of evidence referred to above, but

however it is not clear from the above judgment, the exact evidence he had relied upon to conclude

that the prosecution has established the case beyond reasonable doubt.

As observed by me earlier in this Judgment the present case is based solely on circumstantial evidence.

In a case the prosecution is solely relied on circumstantial evidence, it is imperative for the Trial Judge

to place on record the items of evidence he relied upon to conclude that the prosecution has establish

its case beyond reasonable doubt. The said material the prosecution has relied upon should be

I }

I

fi

f

!

"! I

"

, 9

consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused that is to say; they should not be

explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty.

In the case of Don Sunny V. Attorney General 1998 (2) Sri LR 1 the requirements in establishing a

case based on circumstantial Evidence was considered as follows;

1. When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the proved items of

circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point towards the only

inference that the accused committed the offence.

On a consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can be arrived at should be

consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2. If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence if an inference can be drawn

which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, then one cannot say that the charges

have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

3. If upon a consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence if the only inference

that can be drown is that the accused committed the offence then they can be found guilty.

4. The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of

committing the offence, the accused can be found guilty only and only if the proved items

of circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent with their , innocence. i

t I I In this regard the Learned President's Counsel has argued that the failure by the Learned Trial Judge to I

set out the legal principles that he applied in arriving at the verdict, that is to say the principles

applicable in establishing a case on circumstantial evidence amounts to a non direction by the Learned

Trial Judge. As observed by this court even though the Learned Trial Judge had discussed some of the

items which can be considered as items of circumstantial evidence, he has failed to give his mind to

the requirements needed in establishing a case solely on circumstantial evidence.

Prosecution in the present case has further relied upon the statement made by the accused-appellant

which helped to recover the body of the deceased Rakan Balendran. In this regard prosecution has led

the evidence of Chief Inspector Srinath Nanda and led the said statement in Evidence and marked the

relevant portion as P-1.

Even though the present trial is a trial before Judge without a Jury, there is no material before us to

conclude that the said portion was considered by court to ascertain whether it is admissible under

section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance. As complained by the Learned President's Counsel, the

Learned Trial Judge has failed in his judgment to specify the extent to which he relied upon the section

\

10

27 statement. When he permitted P-1 to be led at the trial I have a doubt in my mind, whether he was

prejudiced by permitting the words "0c.J~6lC) ql~ 0c.J~6lC)" being marked in the section 27

statement.

The Learned President's Counsel had further alleged that the Leamed Trial Judge had taken into

consideration the evidence given by Chief Inspector Senarath Bandara Senevirathne with regard to the

questioning a person from a business establishment by the name Ranjanas at 127, Main Street,

Colombo on 14.10. 1994 and taken into custody a leave application dated 20.09.1994.

In the absence of calling a single witness to establish the fact that the accused-appellant after applying

for leave for 3days since 20.09.1998, had continued to refrain from reporting to work until 30.09.1998

the day on which he hired the van from Sea Street Pettah, it was argued that the said evidence is

hearsay and therefore the Learned High Court Judge had misdirected himself when taking into

considerable the hearsay evidence in his judgment as follows;

"C)@O@ OoSO)0)6l @0C)c.J O)@ 600<5))0 <5)@ q)c.JOJ<5)@c5 @~))(3)oS .5)C))~ ~C53@ ogc.J

However during the argument before us the Learned Deputy Solicitor General who represented the

Hon. Attorney General submitted that there is a strong circumstantial evidence case against the suspect

in this case.

As submitted by him, the accused-appellant was arrested few hours after the alleged act of murder

with the vehicle robbed by him. The body of the driver was recovered from a statement made by the

accused-appellant admissible under section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance and several other items

were recovered from the house of the accused-appellant's father. Accused-Appellant was identified by

a police officer as the person who travelled in the van carrying the distinct no 62-2014 during the same

night few hours prior to the incident and he was identified by another driver as the person who

discussed a hire and travelled with the deceased on the previous day evening.

Based on the very strong evidence as referred to above the Leaned Deputy Solicitor General argued

that this is a fit case to act under the principle laid by down by the Supreme Court in the case of

Mannar Mannan V. The Republic 1990 (1) Sri LR 280.

However when considering the non directions and misdirection I have discussed above in this

Judgment, specially permitting inadmissible evidence to get in to the record and failure by the Learned

Trial Judge to evaluate the items of circumstantial evidence he relied upon and his failure to set out the

legal principle he relied upon in finding the accused-appellant guilty of the charges against him

without a single eye witness evidence, this court is of the view that there was a miscarriage of justice

caused to the accused-appellant by the said conduct of the Learned Trial Judge.

It is the duty of this court to comment the conduct of the prosecutor and the role of the Learned Trial

Judge when permitting inadmissible evidence to get in to the case record, as observed in this case.

Even though this case is a trial before Judge without a Jury the Trial Judge has a duty to control the

proceedings in court without allowing the prosecutor to lead any evidence before him. In the present

case as observed by me, provision of section 25 and 26 of the Evidence Ordinance had been ignored

by the prosecutor either in ignorance or due to enthusiasm, but by doing so caused an injustice not

only to the accused-appellant but also to the prosecution. This court is not infavour of acting under the

principles laid down in the case of Mannar Mannan V. The Republic due to the reasons discussed

above. However considering the strong evidence available in this case, I decide to act under section

335 (2) (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1978.

I therefore make order setting aside the conviction and sentences imposed by the Trial Judge and

direct a retrial before the High Court of Nuwara Eliya Since the place where incident had taken place

now comes within the Jurisdiction of the High Court of Nuwara Eliya.
