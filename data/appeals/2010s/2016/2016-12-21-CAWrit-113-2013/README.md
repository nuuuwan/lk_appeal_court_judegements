JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner is the sole proprietor of the restaurant named "Dharshana

Restaurant" which is a restaurant approved by the Sri Lanka Tourism

Development Authority. He has applied for liquor licenses from the Excise

Department under the category of "Licenses issued to Tourist Board

approved restaurants". This application has been made with a view of

obtaining 'F L 7', 'F L 8' and Arrack licenses for the said restaurant.

The complaint made to this court by the Petitioner is that the 1st and 2nd

Respondents cancelled his long standing existing license by the issuance of

the letter marked X 27

It was the submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that there

was no objection by public for his resta~rant in the past and that therefore

the Respondents, without holding an inquiry could not have cancelled his

license as his license was an existing license. Learned counsel for the

5

Petitioner relied on regulation 21 contained in the Gazette Extraordinary No

1544/ 17 dated 2008-04-10 (marked X 8) to base his argument.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner further submitted that the Respondents

have failed to hold an inquiry in order to ascertain whether there is

material to their satisfaction to exercise their discretion to vary the

minimum distance of 500 meters, as provided for, in the Provision to

regulation 20 (c).

On this basis the petitioner seeks inter alia from this court;

i. a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision/ determination contained

in the letter dated 2012-10-18 issued by the 1st Respondent as

reflected in "X 27";

ii. a Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st and or anyone or more

Respondents to grant 'FL 7 TB' and 'FL 8' Hotel Bar Licenses to the

Petitioner;

iii. a Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st and or anyone or more

Respondents to hold an inquiry with regard to Petitioner's grievances

1l

6

as per the Regulations stipulated under the Excise Notification No.

902 published under the Gazette extraordinary No. 1544/ 17 dated

10th April 2008;

iv. a Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st and or anyone or more

Respondents to relax the distance as per the Regulations stipulated

under the Excise Notification No. 902 published under the Gazette

extraordinary No. 1544/17 dated 10th April 2008.

It would be appropriate at this juncture to examine the relevant provisions

in the rules pertaining to issuing and cancelling liquor licenses.

These rules are contained in the Gazette Extraordinary of the Democratic

Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka bearing No. 1544/ 17 dated 2008.04.10.

(hereinafter referred to as the 'Rules')

Regulation 2 requires all persons wishing to obtain a license of whatever

category in terms of the Excise Ordinance to forward an application to the

Commissioner General of Excise in the form specified in Schedule II to the

Rules.

7

Regulation 3 states that the Commissioner General shall satisfy himself that

the applications are in conformity to the guidelines and conditions which

are specified in Schedule III to the Rules and that this guidelines and

conditions shall be applicable in respect of any financial year.

In Schedule III there are 29 clauses. It would be relevant to refer to few of

them at this juncture.

Clause 1 (a) states that the present holders of licenses will not be entitled Ito automatic renewal on termination of the validity of their licenses and

that if the licensee wishes to redeem his license, an application should be

forwarded for the consideration of the Commissioner General of Excise in

terms of the conditions and guidelines.

According to clause 12, new applicants are required to submit along with

their applications a survey plan from a licensed surveyor or indicating the

distance (as the crow flies from boundary to boundary) from the proposed

puilding to nearest places of public religious. worship and to schools.

However according to clause 19, the existing license holders are not

required to submit such a survey plan. I

8

It is clause 20 (c) of Schedule III that the learned counsel for the Petitioner

relied upon. Hence it would be of assistance to reproduce the relevant

portion of that clause.

Relevant extract from clause 20

"20. Requirements regarding location and description of type of premises;

(a)

(b)

(c) The location of premises for operation of licenses in respect of

sale of liquor off the premises should be 100 meters away (as the

crow flies from boundary to boundary) from schools and places of

public religious worship and in respect for licenses for selling liquor

for consumption within the premises should be 500 meters away

(as the crow flies from boundary to boundary) from schools and

places of public religious worship.

Provided, however that in respect of following types of existing

licenses, the relaxation of the distance specified in paragraph (c)

of this item may be determined by the Commissioner General of

9

Excise, if he is satisfied that there are no specific objections by the

public in respect of the issuances of licenses to such premises.

i. Licenses approved by the Tourism Development Authority

(Former Tourist Board)

ii. Licenses which have been in continuous operation for 10

years or more at the same location.

iii. Licenses remained enforce prior to the establishment of such

public religious place of worship and school. ....... "

" 21. Any objection or protest received by the Commissioner

General of Excise from a member of organization of the public

either before or after the issue of a license, on the ground that

there has been a violation or no compliance with any requirement

of the Excise Ordinance or the Guidelines and Conditions herein

contained with regard to the issue or continuance of a license, will

be notified by the Commissioner General of Excise to the applicant

or the licensee as the case may be and will thereafter be inquired

into by the Commissioner General of Excise as to the validity

thereof and action taken after such inquiry on the basis of the

findings thereat. In such an inquiry, if it is found that the

i

f

f, I

10

establishment continuing the license at that place may threat or

likely threat the maintenance of law and order in the area,

Commissioner General of Excise can decide to relocate the

licensed premises to a suitable place. This decision will be final. "

Relying on Clause 21, it was the contention of the learned counsel for the

Petitioner that the Respondents are duty bound to hold an inquiry to

ascertain whether they could be satisfied that there are no specific

objection by the public in respect of issuances of licenses in favour of the

Petitioner relaxing the specified distance of 500 meters on the basis that

the Petitioner's restaurant holds a license approved by the Tourism

Development Authority.

Learned Senior State Counsel drew the attention of this court to the

application submitted by the Petitioner to obtain the liquor license. It is

marked as.R 2.

It is interesting to note that it is a fresh application to obtain a liquor

license which the Petitioner has made. Therefore the Position of the

Petitioner that he has submitted an existing license for the renewal,

I

~ I,

11

becomes false. These facts are manifest from the fact that the Petitioner

himself has submitted a survey plan from a licensed surveyor which

indicates that the distances to close by school and a temple are both

exceeding 500 meters. It is relevant to recall that submission of a survey

plan is only required when a new application is made (in terms of Clause

13) and not a requirement for renewal of the existing licenses (in terms of

Clause 19).

Further, the argument of the Petitioner that his application is an

application for renewal of an existing license is not factually correct.

Thus the Petitioner is guilty of attempting to mislead this court by

suppression of material facts. It would be appropriate to reproduce

here the following extract from a judgment of Jayasuriya J in the

case of Blanca Diamonds ePvt) Ltd. Vs. Wilfred Van Els and two

othersl.

" .... In filing the present application for discretionary relief in the

Court of Appeal Registry, the petitioner company" was under a duty to

disclose uberrima fides and disclose all material facts to this court for

the purpose of this court arriving at correct adjudication on the

1 1997 (1) SLR 360.

issues arising upon this application. In the decision in Alphonso

Appuhamy Vs. Hettiarachchi2, Justice Pathirana, in an erudite

judgment, considered the landmark decisions on this province in

English law and cited the decisions which laid down the principle that

when a party is seeking discretionary relief from this Court upon an

application for a writ of certiorari, he enters into a contractual

obligation with the Court when he files in the Registry and in terms of

that contractual obligation he is required to disclose uberrima fides

and disclose all material facts fully and frankly to this Court.3 ... II

As learned Senior State Counsel painted out the document marked R

4-2 and R (9) (h) are written objections by the public.

According to the survey plan marked R 3 the Petitioner is well within

the stipulated 500 meters of distance both to the close by temple and

school. This is manifestly clear from the document marked X 23

which is a survey plan issued by the Surveyor General.

Petitioner in his petition has not made any attempt to attack this

survey plan.

13

Indeed Perusal of the remarks made by an Excise official on the

application of the Petitioner marked R 2 it is apparent that the

restaurant of the Petitioner is situated within 500 meters to the

closest school and temple.

Respondents by the letter marked X 22 has requested the Petitioner

to produce a survey plan from the Survey Department.

The Petitioner has placed his side of the story through a lawyer to

the Respondents by the document marked X 25. It was only there

after that the Respondents have issued the letter marked X 27

cancelling his liquor license.

All these aspects have formed part of an inquiry although the

Respondents had not mentioned in their letters that they were

conducting an inquiry'.

Petitioners sought to argue that he is a person holding an existing

license by referring to documents marked X 17 (a) and X 17 (b).

However X 17 (a) has been issued for a six month period

commencing from 2011-12-05 to 2011-12-31 and had thereafter

been extended up to 2012-06-30. It is the observation of this court

that this is a case in which the Petitioner had mislead the

I

i

i ! I i II

JIIIf IiIiI

f

I r I I I

14

Respondents by producing a survey plan marked R 3 to secure the

liquor license. It is just that the distances mentioned in R 3 were

thereafter found to be incorrect by the authorities.

Writ jurisdiction of this court would be exercised at the discretion of

court. One main requisite condition is that the Petitioner must come

to court with clean hands. Secondly the right that such Petitioner

asks Court to protect in writ proceeding must be a legally protectable

right.

During the course of the argument before this court I learned Senior

State Counsel drew our attention to the document marked R 2. We

observed that the document marked R 2 which is the application

made by the Petitioner is missing from the docket as well as the

other brief. On being asked by court learned Senior State Counsel

identifies his hand writing in markings that he had given to the

documents by a normal pen. However new markings have been

inserted with a thicker pen on these documents and in particular I(

r

placing the marking" R 2" on the document which was earlier

marked as R 2 (a). Learned Senior State Counsel stated to court that

these markings were not made by him. With regard to the removal of

15 .. ,

the document marked R 2 from the briefs and introducing new

markings into the briefs, the observation of this Court is that these

acts could be deliberate acts. If such acts are deliberate, it would be

reasonable to infer that those acts have been committed by an

interested party. This document is a document that has not been

produced by the Petitioner and the contents of that document is

against him, it would be the petitioner who would benefit, if this

court by any chance missed it. Learned Senior State Counsel had

later tendered a copy of this document to Court along with his

written submissions.

There is no doubt that Courts must frown upon these kinds of acts, if

they had been done deliberately. Hence we decide to direct the

Registrar to make a formal complaint to Police so that this matter

could be investigated into, in order to find out as to whether there is

any misconduct and if so, as to who is responsible for such acts of

misconduct. Registrar is directed to keep the docket and the briefs in

his safe custody until the law enforcement authorities could have

access to them.

16

In these circumstances we refuse these applications with costs fixed

at Rs. 50,000/=.

Application is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/=.
