The petitioner has filed this application seeking a writ of Prohibition to

restrain the third respondent from issuing permits or executing any deeds or

agreements in respect of the lands and estates in respect of properties relating

to Lease Agreements marked as 3 (a) to 3 (t) and A4 (a) to A4 (h) and also for

writ of Prohibition to restrain the third respondent from interfering in any manner

whatsoever with the lawful possession and occupation of the agricultural lands

and estate referred to in Lease Agreements marked A3 (a) to A3 (t) and A4 (a)

to A4 (h).

The third respondent filed their objections to the petitioner's application

while the first, second and fourth respondents informed court that they will not

be objecting to the petitioner's application but will only assist court.

III

The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the Minister of Land

and Agriculture by gazettes no. 150/12 dated 24/07/1981, 183/10 dated

12103/1982, no. 216/11 dated 28110/1982, no. 321/8 dated 31110/1984, no.

344/5 dated 09104/1985, no. 815/10 dated 21104/1994 published under sec.

27 A of the Land Reforms Law No. 1 of 1972 as amended vested the said lands

described in the schedule unto the first respondent. (documents marked A2 (a)

to A2 (f)). The same Minister by Gazettes Extradoctory No. 150/12 dated

24107/1981, no. 815/10 dated 21104/1994 vested the lands described in the

schedule under the above section unto the second respondent. (documents

marked A2 (a) to A2 (f)). The petitioner stated by publication of the above

gazettes notification under sec. 27 A (1) the third respondent ceased to be the

owner of the said lands and the first and second respondents became the

absolute owners of the said lands. Thereafter the first and second respondents

executed lease agreements marked as A3 (a) to (h) and A4 (a) to (g) in favour

of the petitioner in respect of the said lands.

The petitioner stated that although the petitioner was granted the right to

enjoy the said land the third respondent who no longer had any rights illegally

and unlawfully issued permits to various third parties.

The petitioner further stated that the fourth respondent has provided a

legal opinion to the Ministry of Plantation Industries that under sec. 27 A (1) of

the Land Reforms Commission Law an order made has the effect of vesting in

the relevant institution such title in the land that was held by the third respondent

3

and that despite such an opinion the third respondent continued to engage in

illegal and unlawful acts which caused grave prejudice to the rights of the

petitioner.

The petitioner cited the judgments in Ashokan vs commissioner of

National Housing (2003)3 SLR 179, Biso Manika vs Cyril Alwis (1982) 1

SLR 368 and stated that nothing flows from the purported acts of the third

respondent to alienate property vested in the first and second respondents and

leased to the petitioner.

The petitioner submitted that the Minister in Charge is only permitted to

exercise his power within sec. 27 A (4) of the Land Reforms Law only where

any term or condition relating to consideration of the vesting of the land is not

complied with, and that the petitioner had enjoyed uninterrupted possession of

the land referred to in A3 and A4. And the petitioner further stated that the

petitioner had a legitimate expectation to the estates leased to the petitioner

and that the land will not be re-vested, and cited the judgment in Multinational

property Development vs Urban Development Authority (1996) 2 SLR 31

and Mahilar and Commissioner National Housing and another 2000 ALR

19.

The learned counsel for the third respondent submitted that the lands in

issue have not been properly identified by proper plans and the extent of the

lands are not specifically described.

4

,

IThe third respondent stated that a land dispute cannot be decided on a

writ application and that a writ application must be based on certain facts and

that a writ does not lie in the instant application, and cited the judgment in

Thajudeen vs Sri Lanka Tea Board and another 19811 SLR Vol 11471. The

facts of the instant application is different.

The respondents further submitted that a writ will not lie when there is

an alternative remedy available which is a District Court action. The

respondents stated that the lease agreements entered into between the first

and second respondents and petitioner are not valid agreements since the

lands have not been identified by a valid plan.

The respondents further stated that all the necessary parties are not

before court.

Sec. 27 A (1) (2) and (3) reads thus;

(1). At the request o/the Commission, the Minister may, where

he considers it necessary in the Interest o/the Commission

to do so, subject to sections 22,23 and 42H, by Order

published in the Gazette, vest, in any State Corporation

specified in the Order, with effect from a date specified in

that Order, any agricultural land or estate land or any

portion 0/ the land vested in the Commission under this

5

Law, and described in the Order, subject to such terms and

conditions relating to consideration for the vesting of that

land in such Corporation as may be agreed upon between

the Commission and such Corporation.

(2). An Order under subsection (1) shall have the effect of

vesting in such State Corporation specified in the Order

such right, title and interest to the agricultural land or

estate land or portion thereof described in that Order, as

was held by the Commission on the day immediately

preceding the date on which the Order takes effect.

(3). Where any agricultural land or estate land or any portion

thereof is vested in a State Corporation by an Order made

under subsection (1), all the rights and liabilities of the

Commission under any contract or agreement, express or

implied, which relate to such agricultural land or estate

land or portion thereof, and which subsist on the day

immediately prior to the date of such vesting, shall become

the rights and liabilities of such State Corporation.

I

Under the above sections of the said Act the lands have been vested in

1

IPetitioners, the only way the third respondent can have legal title to the said

lands is if the Minister in charge revokes the lands vested under sec. 27 A (1)

by acting under sec. 27 A (4) of the Land Reform Law.

Sec. 27 A (4) reads thus;

(4). Where any term or condition relating to consideration for

the vesting of any agricultural land or estate land or

portion thereof in any such State Corporation by an Order

under subsection (1) is not complied with, the Minister may

by Order published in the Gazette, revoke the Order under

subsection (1) relating to that land and thereupon that land

shall revest in the Commission.

The minister in charge is only permitted to exercise his powers only

where any term or condition relating to consideration of the vesting of the land

is complied with. In the instant case the land was vested with the petitioner

under sec. 27 A (1) therefore the third respondent can not make any claim to

the said land which is now vested with the petitioner. The third respondent not

being the Legal owner in terms of sec. 27 A (2) of the said act can not alienate

any property to a third party.

7

The third respondent argued that there is an alternative remedy available

to the petitioner which is to seek a decree from the District Court. On the facts

and documents available to this court I can not see an alternative remedy in the

District Court. The third respondent after the land was vested in the first and

second respondents by the Minister under sec. 27 A (1) ceased to be the owner

of the said lands therefore the third respondent had no legal right to alienate

blocks of land to third parties. In such an instance the remedy available to the

petitioner is a writ application.

The third respondent also stated that the lands have not been identified

and that a writ can not be issued without identifying the land. This is incorrect

all the lease agreements marked and produced have specifically stated what

the land is in their respective schedules.

The fourth respondent Attorney General has provided a legal opinion to

the first respondent that the legal effect of an order made under sec. 27 A (1)

of the s aid act has the effect of vesting the relevant corporation such title in the

land that was held by the third respondent prior to such order being made. The

said title vested with the corporation in this instance the first and second

respondents have subsequently been leased to the petitioner. The petitioner is

a body corporated under the name Kelani Valley Plantation Limited in terms of

the Corporation Act.

The petitioner entered into the lease agreements marked A3 and A4 on

I

Ii

the strength of the order made by the Minister in charge in the Gazette marked

A2 vesting the ownership of the said lands on the first and second respondent

corporations thus legitimate expectations have been borne in the petitioner that Ithe land will not be re-vested.

I!! For the afore stated reasons I decide to allow the petitioner's application

as prayed for in prayer (b) and (c) of the petition. The petitioner's application is

allowed.
