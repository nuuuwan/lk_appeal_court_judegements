The appellant had instituted an action against the respondent in

the District Court of Kandy to eject the respondent from the premises

described in the schedule to the plaint and also to claim arrears of rent

and damages. The learned District Judge after the trial has dismissed

the plaintiff's case on 21/01/1997 stating that the plaintiff had failed to

prove there was arrears of rent in the absence of receipts and also that

the appellant had waited four years to file action. He has also said that

the appellant had failed to give notice to the second respondent under

sec. 22 (1) of the Rent Act and also that the appellant owned two other

houses.

The counsel for the appellant submitted that the learned District

Judge erred in law in casting the burden of proving arears of rent on the

appellant, that it is the duty of the first respondent to show court that he

was not in arrears of rent. The appellant stated after receiving the quit

notice marked P1 the first respondent deposited the rent at the

municipal council of Kandy. Citing the judgment in Sa heed Vs

Wickramanayake 1981 2 SLR 67 stated that a defendant who makes a

positive assertion is required by the best evidence rule to produce

evidence of payment. The first respondent who claimed he paid rent

4

1 a i I l I I I 1 i 1 I I i I I j i I I

without arrears did not prove to court that he paid for the period in which

the appellant claims there are arrears.

The appellant stated that he never refused to accept rent from the

first respondent and that the rent deposited at the Municipal Council

Kandy is not deposited in the name of the appellant (documents marked

as V7 to V16). The appellant cited the judgments in Violet Pereira Vs

Asilin Nona 1996 1 SLR 1 and Gunasekera Vs Jinadasa 1996 2 SLR

115 stated that "Payment of rent in the name of a person who is not the

landlord does not discharge the tenant's obligation to the landlord". The

first respondent in his evidence has not stated that he offered rent to the

appellant after the letter of demand was received.

The appellant further stated that the first respondent has failed to

prove he deposited rent for the months of September, October and

November 1986 and failed to furnish receipts, and that the first

respondent was in arrears of rent for more than four months as at the

date of the plaint.

The appellant submitted that under Sec. 22 (1) (b) as being

reasonably required for occupation for the son of the appellant who

5

I

rI I f

resides in a Government house. He further stated that the learned

District Judge had come to an erroneous finding that the appellant owns

two other houses, on the two documents marked as V2 and V3 which

are assessment extracts clearly indicates that it is a co-owned property.

The learned counsel for the first defendant respondents stated

that the learned District Judge has very correctly analysed the evidence

and come to the conclusion that the appellant had not proved the case.

The respondent stated that under Sec. 33 (2) of the Rent Act it is the

statutory duty of the landlord to issue receipts for the rent received. He

further submitted that under Sec. 22 (3) of the Rent Act the appellant

failed to send notices to the respondents.

The respondents further stated that by documents V2 to V5 it

shows that the appellant had more than one house.

Both parties have agreed that the owner of the property in dispute

is the appellant. On perusal of rent receipts marked as V1, V7 to V11 it

is clear that the respondent was in arrears of rent before the case was

filed in the District Court. After V10 which is for rent in August 1986, V11

is for January, February 1987and December 1986 was paid on the 20th

6

of March 1987 after the District Court case was filed. (Plaint is dated

18/03/1987). The learned District Judge has misdirected himself when

he said the respondent was not in arrears of rent. Receipts marked V12

to V16 have been paid after the case was filed. Documents V1 and V6

which the respondents have marked and claimed the appellant gave

them but the signature in these documents different from each other.

The deposit of money as rent to the Municipal Council does not

amount to payment of rent by the first respondent since the receipts

does not state to whom it is paid therefore the learned District Judge

has erred again in law when he came to the finding that the said

receipts are proof that the first respondent deposited rent and that he is

not in arrears.

The learned District Judge has come to the conclusion that the

Commissioner of National Housing and the respondent was not served

notice under Sec. 22 (1) (a) of the said act. But document P1 and P1(a)

shows that the said procedure under Sec. 22 (a) has been followed by

the plaintiff appellant.

The respondent argued that the appellant had more than one

house and that the house was reasonably required by the appellant was

not proved. This is not so documents marked V2 to V5 shows that the

appellant is only a co-owner of the property mentioned in the extracts.

Sec. 22 (2) (bb) reads thus (Rent Amendment Act No. 55 of

1980).;

(2) In subsection (2) of that section, by the insertion,

immediately after paragraph (b) of that subsection, of the

following new paragraph:-

"(bb) in the case of premises let to a tenant, whether

before or after the date of commencement of this Act,

and where the landlord is the owner of not more

than one residential premises-

(i) Such premises are in the opinion of the court

reasonably required for occupation as a

residence for the landlord or any member of

the family of the landlord; or

(ii) The landlord of such premises has deposited

prior to the institution of such action or

proceedings a sum equivalent to five years'

rent with the Commissioner of National

Housing for payment to the tenant; or"

As that'd in this section court has to decide the house is

reasonably required for occupation of a member of the family. The

appellant's son has given evidence in the District Court and said that

they are living in official premises and they need a place to live when his

wife retires from service, which I find is more than a reasonable

requirement under Sec. 22 (a) (bb).

For the afore stated reasons I decide to set aside the judgment

dated 21/01/1997 of the learned District Judge of Kandy and grant relief

as prayed for in the plaint of the plaintiff appellant.
