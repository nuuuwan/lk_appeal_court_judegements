the alleged deed of transfer.

vii) In the meantime the property had been transferred in the

name of the 3rd Defendant;

subject to the payment of the principal and interest thereon

in default to transfer the property through the Registrar of

the Court.

Counsel for the 1 st Defendant company filed its Answer and inter

alia stated : :

i) that the Plaintiff's plaint is in violation of Section 14

of the Civil Procedure Code;

ii) Plaintiff has admitted that the Defendant is the owner

of this property and hence this action cannot be

proceeded with;

iv) The Defendant purchased the property which is the

subject matter of this action by Deed No.1946 attested

By order dated 30.4.2008 the learned District Judge gave

Judgment allowing the reliefs prayed for in the plaint and ordering the

Defendant to re-convey the land on payment of principal and interest

due thereon, failing which the Registrar of Court to convey the property

Being aggrieved by the said order the 3rd Defendant preferred an

appeal to the High Court (Civil) of the Western Province holden at Mt

Lavinia. \

In his Petition of Appeal to the HIgh Court (Civil), the 3rd

Defendant stated :

i) That on or about 22.7.1999 the Plaintiff made an

application in terms of Section 18 of the C.P.C that

the 3rd Defendant had purchased the land in suit on or

about 8th October 1996 by virtue of Deed of Transfer

No. 47 attested by M. Salpitikorale, N.P and to add

him as a party to the action;

filed Answer seeking to dismiss the Plaintiff's action

and for an order for ejecting the Plaintiff and for

vacant possession of the land in suit;

recorded;;

iv) that he verily believes that the Plaintiff may proceed

to deposit moneys ordered to he paid in the judgment

dated 30 .. 4.2008 and the 1st Defendant may recover

the said moneys from court and as a result grave and

irremediable loss would be caused to him who is a

bona fide purchaser of the land in dispute;

v) that he prayed that the court be pleased to grant

interim relief staying the proceedings in the District

Court of Mt Lavinia case No. 737/96/L until the

the deed of transfer No. 1946 was not duly completed

at the time the Plaintiff signed the said document and

in the circumstances it is null and void;

High Court (Civil) Mt Lavinia dismissed the appeal by its

Judgment dated 23.08.2012 with costs fixed at Rs 5000'-.

By Petition dated 2.10.2012 the 3rd Defendant filed a leave to

appeal application to the Supreme Court stating inter alia, that :.

i) the Plaintiff Respondent admitted that he obtained a

loan from the 1st Defendant and as security the land

was conditionally transferred and when the money is

paid back he will transfer the property;

ii) It was the Plaintiff's case that P3 was an outright

transfer as opposed to a conditional transfer as he was

led to believe.

iii) The deed in question No. 1946 dated 5.11.93 was

produced and marked P3. Therefore there is no

question of having to prove the deed.

iv) The deed was signed by him in the presence of a

Notary and witnesses. Thus all the legal requirement

set out in the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance have

been complied with;

v) P3 is a printed document the contention that he signed

on blank papers in any event becomes a clear falsehood

The 3rd Defendant raised the following questions of law:

i) that the High Court had erred in ignoring the

legal position enunciated in the judgments of

Perera vs Fernando -17 NLR 486, and

Sethuwa vs Ukku - 56 NLR 337 ;

III

ii) that the High Court erred in permitting the

Plaintiff Respondent to convert a deed of

transfer into a conditional transfer;

iii) Have the High Court erred in affirming the

learned trial Judge's view that the 3rd

Defendant Petitioner is not a bona fide

purchaser;

The 3rd Defendant prayed that the judgment dated 23.08.2012 of

the District Court and 30.04.2008 of the High Court be set aside and to

dismiss the Plaintiff's action with costs.

The Supreme Court by its order dated 20.11.2013 refused leave

and the application for leave to appeal was dismissed ..

The 3rd Defendant Petitioner further pleaded that:

i) the Plaintiff never intended land in suit to be

transferred to the 1st Defendant company, and only

intended to mortgage the said land for a sum of Rs.

500,000/-;

ii) the Deed of Transfer No. 1946 was not intended to be

a Deed of Transfer but a Mortgage Bond yielding

350/0 interest per annum;

iii) the Deed of Transfer No. 1946 was not duly completed

at the time of signing the deed and hence it is null and

void;

The learned High Court (Civil) Judge of the High Court of

Mt. Lavinia in her Judgment had stated that:

"The learned District Judge has also adverted to the/act that

the nature in which the alleged transaction took place. It is noted

8

that the document marked P2 the Notary has mentioned the fact that

a sum of Rs 900,0001- was paid to the Plaintiff and also in the Deed

which was executed about 3 weeks later the Notary has stated that

the consideration for the said amount was passed in his absence.

Hence such position taken up by the Notary arouses suspicion and

will attack the credibility of the version of the Defendant.

In dealing with the claim of the 3rtl Defendant the learned

Judge was of the view that he is not a bona fide purchaser as he has

bought this land in suit when there had been a caveat registered in

order to stop any transaction in respect of the said land.

In the said backdrop the learned District Judge was of the

view that the 3Td Defendant is not entitled to the claim as prayed for

in the Answer".

Consequently the High Court dismissed the appeal of the 3rd

Defendant.

Now the 3rd Defendant filed this Revision Application

wherein he prayed for a stay order on the District Court, set aside

the judgmentof the District Court and to enter judgment for him

orin the alternative to permit the 3rd Defendant toreeive the sum

payable, inclusive of interestby the Plaintiff and toorder the

Plaintiff to deposit the sum within a specified time.

As against these pleadings the Plaintiff submitted that the

following arguments :

i)

9

the Petitioner has failed to explain to this court

why the Petitioner did not go to the Western

Province Civil Appellate High Court;

ii) Counsel further submitted that the jurisdiction

is parallel between Court of Appeal and the

Provincial Appellate High Civil High Court and

the Petitioner has no option, but to go to the

Provincial Civil Appellate High Court if he has

a case on merits in a Revision Application. The

Respondent further stated that the technical

right has to be considered, in view of the fact

the Supreme Court, having heard at length his

application bearing No. HC/CALA 406/12 and

leave was refused.

iii) Further the Supreme Court has decided that as

"we are not inclined to interfere with the

decision of Civil Appellate High Court";

iv) In view of the above decision of the Supreme

Court no other court will interfere with the said

judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court;

Counsel for the Plaintiff Respondent submitted that the

Petitioner is guilty of non-disclosure of following cases in respect

of the same dispute:

i) the document P9 is available from pages 478-

499 of document "X". The case No. 7629 was

before M.C. Avissawella between the Petitioner

10

and the Respondent under Sec, 66 of the

Primary Courts Act for possession of the

corpus, which the Petitioner lost;

ii) The Petitioner filed writ application No.

1111199 in the Court of Appeal and withdrew;

The Petitioner failed and neglected to disclose

material facts.

iii) The Petitioner in para, 2 of his petition pleaded

to produce a true copy of the entire case record.

In para 23 of the Petition he undertook to

produce a certified copy from D.C.Mt Lavinia

The Respondent states that he did not get the

said copy upto now; and the Respondent

believes that the Respondent had not filed such

application and seeks the benefit of Rule 3(1)(6)

of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure)

Rules of 1990;

iv) The Respondent stated that Deed No 47 dated

8.10.1996 is not for valuable consideration;

v) Further the Respondent pleaded that the

Petitioner and the Chairman of the 1st

Defendant are two brothers and Deed No. 47 is

a collusive act between two brothers and it was

executed inspite of a valid caveat in force; This

fact is admitted by the Petitioner in para. 7 of

the Counter objections of the Petitioner dated

29.08.2014;

iI

f

11

vi) The Notary to Deed No. 1946 dated 5.11.1993

marked P3 is not included in the monthly list;

vii) Respondent relied on Judgments in

Wickremaratne vs Thavandraraja S.C. 1982(2)

SLR 419 and Bernedette Valangreenburg vs

Hapuarachchige Anthony - S.C. 1990 (1) SLR

190;

viii) Counsel for the Respondent states that the

Petitioner has failed to disclose exceptional

circumstances to succeed this application;

He further argued that in view of the above decisions of

the Supreme Court no other court will interfere.

Considering the above submissions we see no reason to

interfere with the judgments of the court already mentioned and

therefore we dismiss this Revision Application without costs.
