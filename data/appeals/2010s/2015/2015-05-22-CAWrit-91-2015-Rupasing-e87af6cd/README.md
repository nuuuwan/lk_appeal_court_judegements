Order

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia,

b. grant a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari against the 1st Respondent quashing his decision to deposit the compensation in relation to the acquisition of land to the credit of District Court (Homagama) Case No. 4587 rr as indicated in his letters dated 18th November 2013 and 10th February 2014.

c. grant a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to either make a decision in respect of the claims made by the parties in terms of Section (1) (a) of the Land Acquisition Act or in the alternative to refer the dispute or claims for determination in terms of Section 10 (3) of the said Act as provided in Section 10 (1 ) (b) of the said Act.

d. issue an Interim Order restraining the 2nd Respondent, as the Administrator of the Intestate estate of the Lalanadasa Perera and his family members from taking any steps to distribute the Compensation deposit by the 1st Respondent to the credit of District Court (Homagama) Case No. 4587 rr until the final determination of this matter.

e. issue an Interim Order directing the learned District Judge of the Homagama, not to take any steps towards authorizing and/or approving the distribution of the Compensation deposit by the 1st Respondent to the credit of District Court (Homagama) Case No. 4587 rr until the final determination of this matter.

When this matter was supported before this court for notices and interim relief, court being satisfied from the submissions made by the Petitioner exparte, that an irreparable damage would cause to the Petitioner if no interim order was issued, decided, in addition to the notices issued, to grant interim relief as prayed in paragraphs (d) and (e) above for a limited period of 14 days.

2nd - 15th Respondents who were represented by counsel at the inquiry, raised objection for the extension of the said order.

One Vithanage Martin Perera alias Lalanadasa Perera had become the owner of a Land called Baiyyangewatte alias Bogahawatte alias Thekkawatte at Hokandata. The said Laknadasa Perera and his entire family including his wife and four children were murdered on 10th February 1999.

On 10th March 1999 Public Trustee Commenced Testamentary proceeding before the District Court of Homagama in respect of the estate of afore said six persons of the same family.

Petitioner pleaded that her husband, Illankoon Mudiyanselage Maithreepala Illankoon alias Maithree Illankoon had aquired certain undivided shares of the said land, subjected to the said Testamentary Action bearing No. 4S87IT between Sth December 200S and 11th March 2008. Thereafter the said Maithree Illankoon had transferred his entire share to the Petitioner by Deed of Gift No. 12013 dated 1ih August 2009.

The said land was subsequently acquired in terms of the Land Acquisition Act and according to the Petitioner, her husband who is the predecessor in title had made representations to the Ministry of Defense and Urban Development with regard to the said decision.

When the said land was acquired by order made under section 38(a) of the Land Acquisition Act dated 22nd March 2012, 1st Respondent notified the petitioner's husband and predecessor in title to attend an inquiry in terms of section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act, scheduled for 12th August 2013.

By letter dated 18th November 2013 the 1st Respondent notified the petitioner, that upon the said inquiry held under section 9 of the land Acquisition Act, a decision has been arrived to deposit the money to the credit of Homagama District Court Case No.4S87 IT and the petitioner to make her claim at the said inquiry. Petitioner further submits that, subsequent to a determination under section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act made on 3rd January 2014, sum of Rupees 78,000,000/- was transferred to the credit of the said Testamentary Action.

Thereafter the petitioner made an application to intervene in the said Testamentary Action before the District Court of Homagama, but the District Judge Homagama on 30th October 2014 determined inter alia that there is no basis to entertain the application to intervene by the Petitioner.

The Petitioners application before this court was challenged by the 2nd to lSth Respondents mainly on two grounds firstly on suppression and/or misrepresentation of Material Facts and Undue Delay and Laches.

According to the petitioner her husband had acquired several undivided shares of the said Land between Sth December 200S and 11th March 2008 and thereafter on 1ih August 2009 transferred the entire share to the petitioner by a Deed of Gift. Therefore it is the petitioner who could claim for the undivided share under section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act, but the petitioner has failed to submit before this court, any claim she had made before the 1st Respondent.

It is also important to consider whether the 1st Respondent as the acquisition officer held an Inquiry under section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act. In this regard petitioner has annexed a letter addressed to her husband by the 1st Respondent informing the Inquiry, marked A-7C, affidavit by her husband claiming that he is a Co owner in the land in question mark A-8 and letter dated 18/11/2013 addressed to the petitioner by the 1st Respondent marked A-9 and also submitted in paragraph 21-23 the sequence

of events took place with regard to the said claim inquiry. Neither the pleadings nor the documents attached indicate that there was a claim inquiry conducted by the 1st Respondent before any decision was taken. The most important document with regard to the conduct of the said inquiry is the Gazette notification dates 3rd July 2013 requesting all interested parties to be present for such inquiry, has not been produced by the petitioner, nor he has made any reference to such a Gazette notification in the pleadings.

Section 10(2) of the Land Acquisition Act reads as follows;

A claimant whose claim is wholly or partly disallowed, or a party to a dispute which is determined, by the decision of an acquiring officer under subsection (1) may, within 14 days of the service on him of notice of the decision, make application to that acquiring officer for the reference of the claim or dispute, as the case may be, for determination as here in after provided; and that acquiring officer shall make a reference accordingly.

When the 1st Respondent by letter dated 18.11.2013 officially communicated the petitioner of his decision, there is no evidence that the petition made an application for the 1st Respondent to act under the above provisition of the Land Acquisition Act.

On 3rd June 2014, 7 months after the said decisions petitioner had gone before the District Court of Homagama to make an application under section 536 of the Civil Procedure Code to intervene and file objections in District Court Homagama 4587rrestamentary case, but on 30th October 2014 the above application was dismissed by the District Court of Homagama.

However there is no material before this court to demonstrate whether the Petitioner has appealed against the said decisions of the Learned District Judge or not.

Petitioner has come before this court only on 4th March 2015 seeking inter alia mandate in the nature if writ of Certiorari and Mandamus.

Paragraph 15 of the petition refers to several deeds under which the petitioner's husband acquired undivided shares of the land in question subject to the said testamentary action. However it was revealed at the inquiry before this court that some of the parties who said to have transferred their rights to the petitioner, subject to testamentary Action and not parties to the said Testamentary Action. This fact had not been brought to the notice of this court by the petitioner. By referring to the fact that several parties have transferred their shares to the petitioner, the petitioner had tried to impresses this court that he has acquired a major share, but in fact it is not.

When deciding the question of extending the stay order, this court will have to measure all these issues very carefully. Specially for the reason that the respondents are alleging suppression and/or misrepresentation of material facts.

It is settled Law that when parties are found guilty for suppression and/or misrepresentation of material facts, that alone is sufficient application for a discretionary remedy to be rejected. Similarly courts are reluctant to extend interim relief already granted in such situations.

This was considered in the case of Hettiarachchi V. Alponso Appuhamy 77 NLR 131 as follows;

"that when an application for a prerogative writ or an injunction is made, it is the duty of the Petitioner to place before the Court, before it issues notice in the first instance, a full and truthful disclosure of all the material fact; the petitioner must act with uberrima fides."

As pointed out by me earlier, the petitioner was reluctant in submitting the fact whether an Inquiry was conducted under section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act by the 2nd Respondent. Petitioner had only submitted a letter purportedly sent to her by the 2nd Respondent. Petitioner has also impressed this court, that by the time acquisition took place he has acquired a major share of the land in questions but the above fact was incorrect according to the facts revealed before this court. The above suppression with regard to an inquiry made under section 9 and misrepresentation with regard to the shares acquired by the petitioner, in fact influenced this court to grant interim relief and therefore I am of the view that the petitioner is guilty of suppression and misrepresentation of material facts at the exparte inquiry.

It was further revealed that the petitioner had taken almost seven months to make an application for intervention before the District Court of Homagama and took 15 months to come before this court after she was officially informed of his decision by the 2nd Respondent. Petitioner has failed to explain this delay before this court. Therefore I hold that petitioner is guilty of undue delay and lashes for the above reason.

When considering all these issues, this court is of the view that the material before this court does not warrant the extension of the interim relief granted by this court.

Application for renewal of the stay order is refused.
