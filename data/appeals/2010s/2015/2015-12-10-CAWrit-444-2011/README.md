COUNSEL : Mahinda Nanayakkara with

Respondents.

ARGUED ON : 13th November, 2014

DECIDED ON : 03rd December, 2015

Deepali Wijesundera J.

The petitioner has filed the instant application seeking a writ of

certiorari and a writ of Mandamus to prevent the drawing of electricity

lines along the Western boundary of the petitioner's land and also to

remove the lines already drawn in spite of his objections.

A group of officers from the Ceylon Electricity Board has gone to

survey and inspect the petitioner's land to extend the electricity supply

line across his land and a letter had been sent to him directing him to

submit any objections. The petitioner has made his objections to the

sixth respondent - Divisional Secretary. Thereafter the sixth respondent

has given instructions to the fifth respondent by letter marked as P7 to

install the electricity lines along his southern boundary and also by P10

along his northern boundary to give electricity to two houses. The

petitioner is canvasing two decisions of the sixth respondent contained

in document marked P7 dated 26/03/2009 and the decision contained in

the document marked P10 dated 24/10/2009. P7 was sent under Act

No. 17 of 1969 and P10 under Act No. 20 of 2009. The earlier Act was

repealed by the new Act.

The petitioners stated that the inquiry on the first document was

not properly conducted. Petitioner submitted that the alternate route

shown by him was not considered by the sixth respondent who acted

maliciously and that his land on two sides had electricity lines drawn

making it difficult for him to utilize the land.

The petitioner submitted the decision in P10 is governed by Act

No. 20 of 2009 and the Sixth respondent had no authority to either

conduct an inquiry or make a decision under the said Act. He further

stated that the decision making power lies with the seventh respondent

and the sixth respondent is only empowered to make inquiries regarding

the objections relating to the acquisition of the way to supply electricity.

The respondents stated that the petitioner has waited several

years to file action against P7 and that this application should be

dismissed on the ground of delay. He also stated that there is no

damage or harm caused to the petitioner by the decision taken in P7

therefore a writ of certiorari should not be issued.

The respondents submitted that the petitioner willingly gave his

consent to the drawing of electricity line mentioned in P10. The

respondents stated that from a practical point of view this application

should not be allowed since the electricity lines have already been

drawn and power given to the consumers.

The respondents on the objection taken by the petitioner on not

following the provisions of the Electricity Act No. 9 of 2009 stated since

the new laws were not known by many of the Divisional Secretaries at

the relevant time the new procedures were not followed by them.

5

The respondents citing the judgments in A.G. Peiris vs

Gunasekera and another 66 NLR 498 and Credit Information

Bureau of Sri Lanka vs Jafferjee and Jafferjee (Pvt) Ltd 2004 BLR

stated that a writ of Mandamus should not be issued. These two

judgments are not relevant to the present application.

On the own admission of the counsel for the respondents the

sixth respondent has not followed the proper legal procedure laid down

in the Act No. 9 of 2009. By this Act the sixth respondent is only

empowered to make inquiries relating to objections and the decision

making power lies with the seventh respondent. Public Utilities

Commission. Sec. 64 of Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009 states;

"Notwithstanding the provisions 0/ the Ceylon Electricity Board

Act No. 17 0/ 1969, where there is a conflict between any

regulation made under section 56 0/ that Act and any provisions

0/ this Act or any regulations made thereunder, the provisions 0/

this Act and the regulations made thereunder, shall prevail. II

6

Therefore the provisions of the new Act shall prevail by not

knowing the new Act the respondents can not breach the rights of the

public.

Sec. 4 (1) (e) of the Act states;

liTo protect the public from dangers arising from the generation,

transmission, distribution, supply or use of electricity. II

The purpose of appointing such a commission is to protect the

general public and the consumer, therefore the proper procedure should

be adopted, at all times.

Sec. 39 (1) (b) of the Act states;

(1) The following disputes arising in connection with the supply

or use of electricity shall be referred to the Commission by any

party to the dispute.

(b) Any dispute (other than a dispute referred to in paragraph

(a) Between a licensee and,

(i) a tariff customer

(ii) another licensee, or

(iii) any other affected party

7 ,I'!

i

These sections very clearly state how a dispute should be

resolved. The respondents having failed to follow the correct procedure

is now making lame excuses.

The respondents stated that the petitioner has waited several

years to challenge P7 and P10 which I find is not correct. The petitioner

has filed a writ application No. 447/2010 and withdrawn it reserving the

right to file a fresh application. Therefore the argument of the

respondents on delay fails.

The learned state counsel stated that the petitioner had already

given his consent with regard to the drawing of electricity lines referred

to in P10 which is not correct the learned State Counsel has tried to

twist the circumstances and mislead court. The State Counsel further

stated that issuing a writ will be futile since the lines have already been

drawn. The petitioner has shown an alternative route to draw the

electricity lines to the sixth respondent who has rejected it stating it was

costlier, the sixth respondent who had no authority to do so has taken a

decision without putting it to the seventh respondent. If the rights of a

party are affected by the Acts of the respondents it should be rectified.

The sixth respondent when making the decision in P7 has acted

8

maliciously and P10 was made without having authority which makes

P10 null and void.

For the afore stated reason I decide to allow the application of the

petitioner as prayed for in prayer Band C of the petition.
