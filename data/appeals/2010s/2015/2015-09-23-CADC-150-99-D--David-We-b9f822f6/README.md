VIJITH K. MALALGODA, PC J. (PICA)

In this matter one of the heirs of the deceased plaintiff-

respondent W.N. Sumanawathi had sent a letter to the Bar

Association with a copy to this Court asking for the return of the brief.

Learned Counsel appearing for the plaintiff-respondent Mr. Lakshman

Perera, PC submits that he could not take any steps in this matter for

the reason that the Counsel for defendant-appellants could not take

steps to substitute the deceased plaintiff-respondent. He further

submits that he could not hand over the brief to the said

Sumanawathi since she has not been properly substituted. Therefore

he submits that he has already handed over the brief to the

instructing attorney to be returned to the said Sumanawathi or any

other heirs of the deceased plaintiff-respondent and he has obtained a

letter from the instructing attorney to that effect. At this stage

Counsel for the defendant-appellant submits that she has written

instructions from the 2nd defendant-appellant namely, Aruna Rohana

Welikala to withdraw this appeal. She further submits the said 2nd

defendant-appellant is the son of the 15t defendant-appellant who is

deceased. She moves that she be permitted to submit the said letter

and she is instructed to file it along with a motion at the registry. Mr.

Lakshman Perera, PC too wants to file the said letter he received from

the instructing attorney with the acknowledgement from the said W.N.

Sumanawathi at the registry along with a motion. Application by the

Counsel for the 2nd defendant-appellant is allowed. Appeal is

accordingly dismissed.
