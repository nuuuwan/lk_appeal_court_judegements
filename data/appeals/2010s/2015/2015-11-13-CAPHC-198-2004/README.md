06.11.2015.

When this matter was taken up on the last date namely on the

22.10.2015, Counsel who appeared for the appellant has informed this

Court that a final decision had been made by the District Court of Marawila

in the case bearing No. 1162/L in respect of the land subjected to in this

appeal and it was against the appellant. He has also stated that the

appellant in this case has filed an appeal against the said judgment in the

District Court. Accordingly, learned Counsel for the appellant on that date

has moved time to consider as to the next step that he is to take in this

appeal. Today, neither the appellant nor any Counsel is present in this

Court on his behalf. However, a person by the name of Loku Balasooriyage

Padmasiri is present and he informs Court that he is the son of the

appellant and the appellant has given a Power of Attorney for him to act on

behalf of the appellant for the purpose of this appeal. However, we find no

Power of Attorney in the docket or in the brief.

The person alleged to have been the son of the appellant informs

Court today that the appellant does not wish to proceed with this appeal in

view of the judgment in the aforesaid case which bears the No. 1162jL. We

also note that the provisions contained in part VII of the Primary Courts'

Procedure Act No.44 of 1979 provide that the orders made under those

provisions would be in force until a decision is made in a civil suit (Section

74 of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act). Admittedly, in this case the

District Court has already made an order in respect of the land subjected to

in this case which is the proper forum as far as the dispute in this case is

concerned.

Accordingly, having considered the matters submitted by the person

who supposed to be the son of the appellant and also the law referred to

above, we dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
