Order

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J (PICA)

Petitioner-Respondent has come before this court seeking inter alia,

b. Grant a Mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision contained as an

endorsement dated 30.01.1969 in the grant marked as "PIa" and the entry based on the

aforesaid endorsement marked as "P4a"

c. Grant a Mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the lSI Respondent to

alienate the land called Magawatta, Magawattekebella, Magawatte Pokuna situated in the

village of Dedduwawala in the Giruwapattu West of the Hambantota District in Southern

Province and depicted as lot 207 in final Village Plan No 306 in filed sheet No 1 of

Surveyor General's Plan and containing in extent of Seven Acres One Rood Fourteen

Perches (7 A 1R 14P) to the Petitioners,

Petitioner- Respondent complained before this court that the lSI Respondent -Respondent had failed or

delayed to alienate the land in question, which was originally alienated to his father namely

Meegahadeniya Kankanamge Don Andiris, by the Grant dated 191h July 1955.

The Respondent- Petitioners position before this court was that the said grant was properly registered

under the provisions of the Registration of Documents Ordinance and the said Meegahadeniya

Kankanamge Don Andiris nominated the Petitioner- Respondent as the successor to the said land.

Subsequent to the said nomination the said permit holder had died on 1zth March 1964. At the time of the

death of the said Andiris, the Petitioner -Respondent was a minor and the 151 Respondent's predecessor

had alienated the said land to the wife of the said permit holder Andiris namely Peduru Wickramarathna

Ratnayake Sumanawathy and the said alienation is also registered under the provisions of the

Registrations of the Documents Ordinance.

The said permit holder, before her death on 13lh March 2008 had nominated her four children as

successors to the said land with specific instructions with regard to the alienation as follows;

5

1. Meegahadeniya Kankanamge Sumanadasa 4 Acres

2. Meegahadeniya Kankanamge Munidasa 2A 1R 14P

3. Meegahadeniya Kankanamge Karunaratne 1,12 Acre

4. Meegahadeniya Kankanamge Thilak 1,12 Acre

Petitioner-Respondent whilst challenging the said alienation by the predecessor to the lSI Respondent

dated 30. 01. 1969 moved to quash the said decision and further moved before this court to grant a

mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the lSI Respondent to alienate the said land to the

Petitioner-Respondent. Petitioner-Respondent in addition to the said lSI Respondent, had also made the

said Sumanadasa, Karunaratne and Thilak as Respondent-Respondents since they are necessary parties to

this case.

The Intervenient-Petitioner, namely Meegahadeniya Kankanamge Somapala has come before this court

and moved intervention to the present case. According to Somapala the Intervenient -Petitioner, he is the

eldest son of the Original permit holder Andiris and his successor Sumanawathy and moved this court

that, being the eldest son and the eldest brother of the Petitioner-Respondent and 2nd to 41h Respondent-

Respondents he is entitled for the alienation of the said land under section 72 of the Land Development

Ordinance.

The position taken up by the Intervenient-Petitioner before this court was that even it was presumed that

the Petitioner-Respondent has been nominated as the successor to the property in question by his father,

the Petitioner-Respondent has failed to succeed to the said property in terms of section 68 (2) of the Land

Development Ordinance.

In the above context the Intervenient-Petitioner had further submitted that the Petitioners could have

succeeded to the said property in two instances, if he had been nominated as the successor to the property

by the original permit holder.

a) Within six months from the death of the said original permit holder on 1ih March

1964.

J

, .

b) Within six months from the death of the wife of the said permit holder on 13th March

2008.

The Intervenient-Petitioner had argued before this court that the Petitioner-Respondent has failed to

succeed on both occasions in compliance with section 68 of the Land Development Ordinance and

therefore he submitted that by operation of section 72 of the said Ordinance he becomes entitled to

succeed the said property as the eldest child of the original permit holder Andiris and therefore he is a

necessary party to be added to this case.

However from the material placed before the court it is evident that the Petitioner-Respondent was a

minor when the original Permit holder died on 1ih March 1964 (P-3) but at that time the said nomination

had been properly registered under the provisions of the Registration of Documents Ordinance.

A subsequent alienation of the land had been registered under the Registration of Documents Ordinance

and the validity of the said alienation is challenged by the Petitioner-Respondent before this court.

Subsequent to the said alienation, the new permit holder has made a fresh nomination, nominating the

Petitioner-Respondent and 2nd to 4th Respondents as successors to the said land and therefore the

Petitioner-Respondent could not have succeed the said land within six months of the death of the new

permit holder, but he has made reasonable effort to succeed to the said property. This fact is evident from

the documents produced marked P-8 by the Petitioner-Respondent. Under these circumstances the

question before this court is the legality of the document which alienated the land to Peduru

Wikramarathna Ratnayake Sumanawathy which is evinced from documents produced marked P- 1A and

P- 4A.

In the case of Illandari Devage Ranasinghe and Others Vs. Commissioner General of Excise and

Others and Yen. Udawaththa Nanda Thera and Others CA Writ Application No. 127/10 (CA minutes

of 11.05.2011 the Court of Appeal followed the following criteria in considering intervention,

a. The intervenient Petitioners must have sufficient cause and interest and are

affected parties and that,

t

f

7

b. It would be the interest of justice to permit intervention and that the

intervention of the Intervenient Petitioners would assist court in the proper

administration of justice and adjudication of the matter before court.

The same issue was considered in the case of L.U.P. layawardena V. Minister of Health and

Other CA Writ Application No 978/2008 (CA minutes of 21.05.2009) as follows;

"What the court at this point of time needs to consider is whether the intervenient party is

a necessary party and having such party in the case would in all circumstances assist

court in considering the merit and demerits of the application before court"

As discussed by me earlier the Intervenient-Petitioners claim will not assist the court in

considering the merits or demerits of this case. The Petitioner-Respondent had made 3 others

nominees as 2nd to 4th Respondent-Respondent to the present application and the court consider

them as necessary parties, but the Intervenient-Petitioner has failed to satisfy the court that he is

a necessary party to the present case and therefore I am of the view that he has no locus standi to

intervene in the present application.

Therefore I make order refusing the application by the Intervenient- Petitioner for intervention

in the present case.
