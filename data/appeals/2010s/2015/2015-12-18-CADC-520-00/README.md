Court to surveyor K.S.Panditharathne, whose Plan No.4262 was filed of record on

26th May 1999. Thereafter the matter had been fixed for inquiry regarding the Plan

No.4262.

The rival position taken by the 2nd to 6th Defendants that the final plan No.68 as

suggested by surveyor Wijeratne cannot be accepted and their contention that the

judgment and the interlocutory decree need to be amended has been opposed by

the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant-Appellant.

The Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant filed objections to the position taken by the 2nd to

6th Defendants reiterating that since the final partition scheme as shown in Plan

NO.68 is in accordance with the evidence, judgment and interlocutory decree, the

objection of the 2nd to 6th Defendants must be rejected.

So the nitty gritty of the issue before the District Court boils down to the following.

There was clearly a disagreement between the parties over the final partition

scheme suggested by Surveyor Wijeratne in his Plan No.68, and the alternate Plan

No.4262 of surveyor Panditharatne. In order to resolve this issue the Court had asked

the parties to file their written submissions, but the 2nd to 6th Defendants, in the

meantime on 16th February 2000, made an application by way of a motion for an

order to correct the evidence and the judgment.

Impugned Order dated 29th August 2000

After the written submissions were filed the Court made order on 29th August 2000

that the judgment and the interlocutory decree are defective and must be amended.

The Court has also decided that the final partition Plan No.68 is defective and

ordered adduction of evidence-vide p 115-116 of the appeal brief.

decree be set aside and to permit the final partition scheme suggested by

surveyor Wijerathna in his Plan No.68

could be allowed.

Although the Court made order on 29th August 2000 that the judgment and the

interlocutory decree are defective and they be amended, it has to be noted that no

such amendment or modification of the interlocutory decree has so far not been

effected by Court. On a careful scrutiny of the order made on 29th August 2000. I

observe that there is no final scheme of partition confirmed by the Court. Neither is

there any amendment of the interlocutory decree nor is there a final scheme of

partition in esse. The Court has by the impugned order dated 29th August 2000 has

only decided to have evidence led.

When a final scheme of partition is returned to court, the legal position is crystal

clear.

Section 35 of the Partition law No.21 of 1977, as amended by Act No.17 of 1997 sets

out the following-

"After the surveyor makes a return to the commission, the Court shall call the

case in open Court and shall fix a date, for the consideration of the scheme of

partition proposed by the surveyor"

Section 36 (1) (a) of the Partition law states,

"On the date fixed under Section 35, or on any later date which the Court may

fix for the purpose, the Court may, after summary inquiry:-

..

(a) confirm with or without modification the scheme of partition proposed

by the surveyor and enter final decree of partition accordingly".

When there are two schemes of partition before Court, prepared and filed by two

different surveyors, it is the duty of the Court to go into the matter carefully and find

out which of the two schemes can be accepted and confirmed. For this purpose it is

the duty of the Court to examine the surveyors and if necessary to call for other

evidence to ascertain the correct scheme of partition which is acceptable by the

parties in the case.

In my view it is towards the achievement of this purpose that the Court has taken the

step of fixing the matter for inquiry by its order dated 29th August 2000. Since the

Court has not so far affirmed any final scheme of partition, no prejudice has been

caused to any party at this stage. No interlocutory decree has been yet amended.

The propriety of such an exercise could be taken up at the inquiry. Whether the

interlocutory decree could be amended as asserted by the 2nd to 6th Defendant and

whether there is a legal foundation for doing so are matters that have to be taken up

at the summary inquiry as contemplated in Section 36 (1) (a) of the Partition Law.

The learned District Judge has only stated that the evidence has to be led for this

purpose. This statement about amendment of the interlocutory decree, albeit with a

broad brush, does not prejudice the l stDefendant-Appeliantat this stage as it is open

to him to impugn such a course of action and raise all other issues at the inquiry.

One cannot slay phantom dragons at this stage since the inquiry has yet not begun.

The parties are at liberty to adduce sufficient evidence at the inquiry to the

satisfaction of the Court to come to a conclusion as to the confirmation of the final

scheme of partition. I am therefore of the opinion that this appeal is premature.

Section 36A of the Partition Law No.21 of 1977 as amended by Act No.17 of 1997

makes provisions for any party who is dissatisfied with an order of the Court made

under Section 36 of the said law. That is to say, after the scheme inquiry under

Section 36 of the Partition Law has terminated, an aggrieved party is granted the

right by virtue of Section 36A to prefer an appeal with the leave of the appellate

court first had and obtained.

The order of the learned District Judge dated 29th August 2000 has only fixed the

matter for inquiry because there are two schemes of partition before Court. I do not

hold the view that the stage stipulated in Section 36 of the Partition Law (the scheme

inquiry) has been reached because as I said earlier there is no confirmed final

scheme of partition as yet in the case. It is only after that stage has been traversed

that a party is vested with a right of appeal but of course such party has to seek and

obtain leave in the first instance.

I have to observe that the 1st Defendant was ill advised to prefer an appeal from the

order of the learned District Judge dated 29th August 2000 when there was no right

of appeal available to him and this matter has gone on in this court since the year

2000 under the misnomer final appeal without any end in sight to this litigation and

this displays the sorry state of how a misconception of remedies can result in

inordinate delays and procrastination.

Hence this appeal has no merit and should be dismissed. Furthermore, I would hold

that the order made on 29th August 2000 is not a final order which has determined

the rights of parties. It is an interim order fixing a date for inquiry but an error made

in that inquiry will give rise to a leave to appeal in terms of Section 36A of the

Partition Law.
