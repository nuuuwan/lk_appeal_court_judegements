This is an application for a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari

and a Writ of Mandamus. At the argument stage the counsel for the 5th

Respondent highlighted the fact that an action is pending in the District Court

of Anuradhapura to have a declaration as to the title of the land in dispute

subject to this application. The 5th Respondent moved that this matter be laid

by till the decision is arrived at by the District Court of Anuradhapura.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioners did not agree to this application.

The facts of this case are briefly as follows.

The Original permit holder of the land in question was one

W.M.Punchi Banda, the father of the Petitioners and the 5th Respondent. The

said Punchi Banda has nominated his wife R.M.Ranmanike as his successor.

After the death of the Punchi Banda, the permit was issued to his nominee,

his wife, Ranmanike. The said Ranmanike has nominated the 5th Respondent

as her successor. On the death of Ranmanike, the 5th Respondent was issued

with the grant under the Land Development Ordinance.

The Petitioners instituted this application seeking for a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the grant issued to the 5th Respondent. The Petitioners'

contention that the issuing of grant is unlawful, arbitrary, and malicious and

against the provisions of the land Development Ordinance (as amended) and

is null and void. Further the Petitioners submit that the 1 st Petitioner being

the eldest son of the family had a legitimate expectation that he will be

entitled for the permit under the 3rd schedule of the Land Development

Ordinance.

The 5th respondet instituted an action m the District Court of

Anurahdapura for a declaration of title and ejectment on the strength of the

grant issued under the land Development Ordinance to him. The 1 st Petitioner

being the 1 st Defendant in the District Court action, filed answer praying for

a dismissal of the action and alternatively praying for compensation for

improvement. In his answer he pleads that the 5th Respondent being the

younger brother and the Petitioner being the eldest, the permit issued to the

5th Respondent (the Plaintiff in the District Court action) is bad in law.

The Plaintiff in the District Court action (5th Respondent) seeking for

a declaration on the strength of the grant issued by Her Excellency the

President under the Land Development Ordinance. The District Court will

decide whether the Plaintiff in that action has proved the title to the land in

question or not. District Court cannot go into the matter of procedure adopted

by the 1 st Respondent in the application to issue the permit.

It has been held in the case of Perera v. Peoples' Bank (78 NLR 239)

that;

The District Court has no jurisdiction to grant a declaration in a

regular action where such declaration is sought as a supervisory

remedy to challenge the validity of a judicial or quasi judicial

determination made by a statutory authority. Where it is sought to

question such determination, the appropriate remedy is to invoke the

supervisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court by way of a Writ of

Certiorari.

In the application before us, the Petitioner is challenging the issuance

of the grant. The Petitioners' case is that the 1 st Respondent has acted

unlawfully, arbitrarily and maliciously. After the death of the predecessor in

title, Ranmanike, it is the 1 st Respondent who had to decide on the entitlement

of succession. When deciding this fact, the 1 st Respondent has act fairly and

justly. The 1 st Respondent should have considered the nomination made by

the deceased Ranmanike and the combined possession alleged by the

Petitioner. The Petitioners' contention is that the 1 st Respondent has failed to

consider these facts. Therefore the Petitioner is questioning vires of the 1 st

Respondent's decision which is an administrative law relief or a supervisory

remedy.

In C.A. (Writ) Application No.416/2000 dated 28.09.2015 Chitrasiri

J. held (which I agreed) that "When ajudicial pronouncement by a competent

court is in existent on a particular issue, then no writ could lie to interfere

with such a decision". In the said case the District Court has pronounced the

judgment even before instituting the writ application and the Petitioner has

appalled against it. The situation in the present case before us is deferent. The

action in the District Court of Anuradhapura is still pending.

In the case before us the issue is also quite different from the issue of

the District Court action filed by the 5th Respondent in this case. In this court

the Petitioner is questioning the vires of the 1 st Respondent to issue the permit

to the 1 st Respondent. In the District Court action, though the validity of the

grant is questioned, main relief sought by the Petitioner (1 st Defendant of the

said action) is compensation for improvement.

Under these circumstances, I hold that even there is a case pending in

the District Court of Anuradhapura on the same subject matter, the writ

application in the Court of Appeal can be proceeded.

I set this case for further argument.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.

K.T.Chitrasiri, J.

I agree.
