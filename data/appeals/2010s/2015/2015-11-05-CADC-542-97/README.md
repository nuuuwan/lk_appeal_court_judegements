The plaintiff respondent instituted action in the District Court of

Gampaha against the defendant appellant for the declaration of title to

the land described in the schedule to the plaint and for ejectment of the

defendant appellant whom the plaintiff claimed was a licensee. The

defendant appellant had filed answer claiming that he was not a

licensee but a tenant protected under the Rent Act. After trial the

learned District Judge of Gampaha had delivered judgment on

30107/1997 answering all the issue in favour of the plaintiff respondent

and granted relief prayed by the plaintiff respondent. The defendant

appellant has filed the instant application against the said judgment.

The learned counsel for the appellant stated that the appellant

came into occupation of the premises as a tenant of the predecessor in

title to the respondent namely Punyasoma Perera in 1981 which was

establishing by the documents marked as P7, P8, P9 and P10. He

stated that the evidence of the respondent and Punyasoma can not be

believed as the documents produced by the respondent marked as P7

to P10 proved otherwise. He further submitted that the respondent and

the predecessor in title had fabricated a case to demonstrate that the

3

,

appellant is a licensee when in fact the evidence and the documents

demonstrated that he is a tenant.

The appellant citing the judgment in Zackariya Vs Benedict 53

NLR 311 said that the new landlord the person who purchased the

property can not eject the tenant and must await the expiration of the

lease.

He also cited the judgment in C.B Seelawathie Vs H. Ediriweera

s.c. Appeal No. 65/87 BALJ 1990 Vol.IlI Part 1 and stated that it was

held in the above case that circumstances in which a tenant who

continues in occupation after receiving notice of the transfer of the

rented premises becomes the tenant of the transferee.

The learned counsel for the respondent submitted the appellant

who claimed tenancy had to establish his tenancy to the satisfaction of

the trial court. He stated that the respondent established his chain of title

by evidence which was unchallenged and the trial judge arrived at his

conclusion regarding the title of the respondent and answered all the

issues in favour of the respondent. He further stated that once the

issues were answered in favour of the respondent the burden shifts to

the appellant to prove the fact that his occupation of the premises is

under a legal right.

The respondent further stated that the appellant had claimed he

came into occupation when Punyasoma was the owner of the house

and one Suwaris was in occupation from 1985 and that the appellant

occupied a room during that time. The lease agreement of Suwaris is

marked as P6 Punyasoma has given the said premises on a lease

agreement to Suwaris in 1985.

The respondent submitted except for the appellant's evidence

there is no other evidence to establish the appellant's tenancy to the

said premises.

The respondent stated that the appellant who had come to

occupy the said premises on the promise of leaving when he built his

own house to Punyasoma failed to discredit his evidence when

Punyasoma gave evidence in the District Court.

The appellant who appealed against the learned District Judge's

judgment failed to establish a single legal argument to justify his appeal.

In the appellate court the issues to be decided against an original court

judgment are legal issues. The evidence which has been evaluated by

the trial judge is not a matter for the appellate court to decide.

The argument of the appellant was that documents P7 to P10

prove that he was in occupation of the said premises since 1981. On

perusal of the said documents it could be seen that the appellant had

been a member of that household and not the chief occupant. This

proves the argument of the counsel of the respondent who stated that

the appellant occupied a room in the said house under one Suwaris

whose lease agreement had been marked as P6. The appellant had

failed to prove his tenancy in the District Court and the learned District

Judge had correctly answered the issues framed before him in favour of

the plaintiff respondent.

For the afore stated reason I decide to affirm the judgment of the

Ilearned District Judge of Gampaha dated 30107/1997 and dismiss the

appeal with costs fixed at Rs. 10,0001=.
