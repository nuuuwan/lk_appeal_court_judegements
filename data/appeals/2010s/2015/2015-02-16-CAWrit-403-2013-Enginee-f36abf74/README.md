*****************

VIJITH .K. MALALGODA, PCJ(P(CA)

Petitioners to this application are two trade unions and some members

of the said unions of the 1st Respondent Board. In their petition they

alleged that the 1 st Respondent Board by an impugned decision reflected

in documents produced marked P-17(a) to P-17( e) decided to promote all

Engineers from Board Grade 6 (MM 1-1) to Board Grade 5 (MM 1-1) and

1 I 4

the said decision was illegal, unlawful, arbitrary and capricious and

therefore ultra vires.

When this matter was supported for notice on 29/ 1/2014 Court issued

formal notices on all respondents and granted time for respondents to file

limited objections before considering the question of issuing interim relief

as prayed in paragraph ( e) of the prayer, pending final disposal of this

case.

Paragraph ( e) of the prayer reads as follows;

" issue an interim order staying the operation of the said

purported decision of the 1 st Respondent Board reflected in

the letter marked PI7(a) to P17( e) to promote all Engineers

from Board Grade 6 (MM 1-1) to Board Grade 5 (MM 1-1)

pending the final determination of this application."

1 st Respondent Board has not filed limited objections but represented at

the inquiry by a President's Counsel. At the inquiry President's Counsel

informed Court that the 1 st Respondent Board is prepared to abide by

any decision by this Court on the question of interim relief and further r[ItI II

submitted that, as directed by this Court, steps have been taken to

maintain the status quo.

Second to sixth Respondents have filed limited objections before this

Court on 7th February 2014 resisting the issuance of interim relief as

prayed for.

It is important to note at this stage that the 1 st Respondent has failed to

officially place before this Court the purported Board decision which

permitted the 1 st Respondent to promote all Engineers from Board Grade

6(MMl-l) to Board Grade 5 (MM 1-1). At the inquiry the President's

Counsel appearing for the 1 st Respondent placed a document before

Court but we cannot consider this document, since it is not submitted

before this Court following the rules of this Court. Therefore, we have

conclude at this stage that the purported Board Decision is not before

us.

However, 2nd to 6th Respondents in their limited objections submitted

that the decision to promote all Engineers in Board Grade 6(MM 1-1) to

Board Grade 5(MMl-l) was necessitated due to the implementation of a

purported decision of the 1st Respondent Board dated 26/05/2011 to

create a promotional path for Engineering Assistants of special class up

to Board Grade 6 and 5, which is contrary to the provisions of the

Scheme of Recruitment of the 1 st Respondent Board.

According to the objections filed by the 2nd to 6th Respondents the above

decision was the subject matter in two Fundamental Rights Applications

one filed by the Petitioners (SCFR 531/2011) and other filed by the

Respondent (SCFR75/2013)

We are not going to give our mind to the outcome of the Board Decision

dated 26/05/2011 or any subsequent decision, which is not the subject

matter before us and also a matter before the Supreme Court in two

Fundamental Rights Applications.

However, according to the limited objection before us 1 st Respondent

Board is going to promote 219 Engineers to Board grade 5 (MM 1-1 ) (on a

personal to the holder basis) and if that is permitted, the petitioner

submits that it is contrary to the provisions of Scheme of Recruitment of

the 1 st Respondent Board.

In the present application the petitioners have prayed inter alia -

"c) grant a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing

the aforesaid impugned Board Decision (if any) of the 1 st

Respondent Board reflected in the letters marked PI7(a) to

P17( e) to promote all Engineers from Board Grade 6 (MM 1-

1) to Board GradeS (MM 1-1).

d) grant a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing

all the letters issued by the 1 st Respondent Board upon the

said impugned decision reflected in the letters marked PI7(a)

to P17( e) including the said letters PI7(a) to P17( e)

promoting all Engineers from Board Grade 6 (MM 1-1) to

Board Grade S (MM 1-1) including the 2nd to 6th

Respondents.

Petitioner further submitted that If no interim relief is granted at this

stage, at least to stop issuance of letters similar to PI7(a) to P17( e) an

irreparable loss will be occurred to the petitioners and/ or no purpose

would be served in granting leave in the present application when there

is a clear violation of the provisions of the Scheme of Recruitment in

I I i

promoting Engineers from Board Grade 6 (MM 1-1) to Board Grade 5

(MM 1-1) by the purported Board Decisions (if any).

This Court is in agreement with the above submission of the Petitioner

and I am of the view that until entire matter is looked into by this Court,

purported decision reflected in PI7(a) to P17( e) should be stayed subject

to two limitations.

Petitioner during the inquiry submitted that they will not press for the

suspension of the letters PI7(a) to P17( e) already issued and therefore

we are not going to make order suspending PI7(a) to P17 ( e).

If there are promotions of Engineers in Board Grade 6(MM 1-1) to Board

Grade 5 (MMl-l) which can be implemented without violating the

provisions of Scheme of Recruitment this Court is not going to stop such

promotions.

Subject to the above limitation, this Court decides to make interim order

staying the operation of the said purported decision of the 1 st

Respondent Board reflected in the letters marked PI7(a) to P17 ( e) to
