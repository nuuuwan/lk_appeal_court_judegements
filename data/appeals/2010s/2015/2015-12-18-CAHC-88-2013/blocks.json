J. 493 at 498/499, Justice Sisira de Abrew held that \"While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the evidence of the witness read as whole appears to have ring of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies, drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of belief Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the court before whom the witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about the general tenor of evidence given by the witness, the appellate court which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the trial court unless there are reasons weighty and formidable it would not be proper to reject the evidence on the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial details. Even honest and truthful witness may differ in some details unrelated to the main incident because power of observation, retention and reproduction differ with individuals.\"",

This had been stated by the victim over and over while giving evidence but the appellant, in his evidence, had denied going inside the house of the victim. However, under cross examination by the prosecution a contradiction was marked. Accordingly, the appellant had stated to the police that he went inside the house of the victim asking for a screw driver (vide page 133 of the brief). At the Court also appellant had admitted the fact that he went up to the victim's house asking for a screw driver. Furthermore, he had admitted that he had a close relationship with the children of the victim's family in order to ask for a screw driver (vide page 138 of the brief). It is also evident that the mother of the victim had also given evidence to the fact that usually the appellant used to come to the victim's house (vide page 60 of the brief).",

(5) In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work on the spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters. Again, it depends on the time- sense of individuals which varies from person to person .... (7) A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the court atmosphere and the piercing cross examination made by counsel and out of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of events, or fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment. The sub-conscious mind of the witness sometimes so operates on account of the fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witness is giving a truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him-Perhaps it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on the spur of the moment.

Was the accused appellant charged that he committed the alleged offence on 16.7.2007? The answer is no. the indictment alleges that the accused appellant had committed this offence during the period commencing from 1.1.2007 to 7.7.2007. According to the evidence he has not committed the alleged offence during this period.\" Furthermore he held that \"According to section 165 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the charge must, inter alia, specify the time and place of the offence with which the accused is charged. The idea behind this principal is to give sufficient opportunity to the accused to answer the charge and to ensure a fair trial. Answering the charge includes among other things preparing for his defence, presenting his defence and cross-examining the witness called by the prosecution etc. Then when a charge specifies that the accused committed the offence during a period and the evidence shows that the offence was not committed during the said period the accused cannot be convicted. In such a situation it cannot be contended that the accused was not prejudiced because the idea behind specifying the time and place of offence, as I pointed earlier, is to give sufficient opportunity to the accused to answer the charge and to ensure a fair trial.\" I n that case the evidence had showed that the offence",
