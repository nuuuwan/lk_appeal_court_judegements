The learned counsel for the Accused-Appellant submits that

she is not be supporting the conviction and the sentence but only be

making a submission for backdating of the sentence. In the present

case the accused-appellant was indicted before the High Court of

Trincomalee for the murder of his wife. According to the facts of this case

the husband and the wife were quarrelling over some money given by

the wife to the husband to buy some cement to construct their house in

the whole day. They had been fighting even when they were having

dinner and thereafter the accused said to have set fire to the wife inside

the kitchen. The daughter of the deceased had heard cries of her mother

saying that the husband had set fire to her. The deceased in fact had

made a dying deposition as well.

The learned trial Judge after considering the material placed before

him had come to conclusion that the accused is not guilty for murder but

convicted him for culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the

basis of grave and sudden provocation and imposed a sentence of 12

years Rigorous Imprisonment and fine of Rs.I0,000/- with the default

terms of one year Rigorous Imprisonment. The counsel submits that she

has instructions received from the accused-appellant to withdraw the

said appeal. However, she makes an application under section 359 of the

Criminal Procedure Code to implement the sentence from the date of

conviction i.e from 27.07.2009.

The learned Additional Solicitor General has no objection for the

said application. We therefore make order dismissing the appeal and

with regard to operation of the sentence, we make order to implement the

said sentence with effect from the date of conviction i.e from 27.07.2009.

Subject to the above variation the appeal stands dismissed.
