Heard both Counsel with regard to this application.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General representing the respondents

submitted a copy of the Affirmation forms submitted by the

petitioners before this Court to satisfy that the petitioners have not

included their names in the Affirmation forms. Learned Deputy

purely a ministerial act and there is no discretion on these issues

rather than rejecting the nominations.
