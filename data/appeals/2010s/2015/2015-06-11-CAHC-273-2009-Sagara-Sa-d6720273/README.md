Order

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J (PICA)

The accused Appellant in this case was indicted before the High Court of Colombo for

possession of 2.89 grams of Heroin, an offence punishable under sec.54A (d) of the Poisons

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No 13 of 1984. At the conclusion of

the trial before the High Court the accused was found guilty of the offence against him and

sentenced for life imprisonment. Being dissatisfied with the said conviction and the sentence, the

accused had preferred this appeal.

In this case the Prosecution relied on the evidence of Sub Inspector Rajakaruna of Maradana

Police, who was the Chief Investigation Officer. According to his evidence at the High Court

trial, on 29th December 1999 around to 2.00 pm he had left the Police Station with PC 11700

Kumara and Security assistance 10 for a raid. When he left the Police Station, he took necessary

equipment for sealing of productions with him.

They visited Lockgate Lane in Sangaraja Mawatha area but the said raid was unsuccessful. They

decided to come back to the Police Station and on their way back they decided to take a short cut

from Sangaraja Mawatha to Panchikawatte Road through a passage. The passage they took was

known as "105 C>mm" When they proceeded through this area he saw a man standing in front of

a house. He questioned the said person, whether they could go to Panchikawatte Road through

the passage .The person answered the above, saying he does not know anything since he is not

from that area. Since the Police Officer felt suspicious of the conduct of the said person he

decided to search the person.

The said person was then searched by the Police Party led by the witness and during this search

he recovered ten packets wrapped in to a rolled handkerchief and was tied to the waist along with

the sarong, the accused was wearing. When opened the said packets he observed each packet

contained ten small packets containing a powder which he suspected as Heroin.

What was recovered from accused was sealed by the witness using the equipment he had in his

possession and returned to the Police Station at 16.45 hours. He handed over the productions to

the reserve after entering the production under PR 35/99. Again on the same day at 17.07 hours

he left to the Police Narcotics Bureau along with the accused in Jeep No. 32/3537 driven by PC

19057.

At the Police Narcotics Bureau the productions were weighed and properly sealed in the

presence of the accused. The weight of the brown powder was 7 grams and 600 mille grams. In

additions to brown powder 111 pieces of metal foil also sealed separately. The two parcels were

marked separately as 1 and 2 and handed over to reserve on their return. The productions were

sent to the Government there after.

Counsel for the accused Appellant argued that the prosecution has relied only on the evidence of

a single witness, which is against the accepted practice. His position was that, other than the

investigating officer no other police witness was called at the trial. Counsel further submitted

that the failure by the prosecution to call the officer who received the production at the Maradana

Police Station is fatal in this case.

Failure by the prosecution to produce the handkerchief at the trial was also highlighted by the

defence. However the learned Deputy Solicitor General brought to the notice of the Court three

admissions made under sec. 420 of the Criminal Procedure Cord during the trial. The said

admissions were recorded in the proceeding at pages 55, 95 and 117 of the appeal brief.

At Page 55 an admission under section 420 was marked with regard to 110 pieces of aluminum

foil. At page 95 the recovery of the handkerchief from the Accused was marked as an admission.

The inward production chain from the police Station to Government Analyst and out ward

production chain from the Government Analyst to High Court was admitted under sec. 420 of the

Criminal Procedure Code at page 117.

Whilst referring to the above admissions, Learned Deputy Solicitor General took up the positions

that in view of the above admissions, calling additional witness to establish the production chain

was not warranted. However with regard to the detection, Learned Deputy Solicitor General

relied on the Supreme Court decision in the Attorney General V. Devunderage Nihal. SC

Appeal 154/10 to the effect, "Therefore it is quite clear that unlike in case where an accomplice

or a decoy is concerned in any other case, there is no requirement in Law that the evidence of a

Police officer who conducted an investigation or raid resulting in the arrest of an offender need

to be corroborated in material particulars" and submitted that the Learned trial Judge was correct

in acting on the un contradicted and convincing evidence of Sub Inspector Rajakaruna in finding

the accused guilty on the Indictment.

We have the opportunity of going through the convincing evidence given by Sub inspector

Rajakaruna at the High Court trial and is of the view that, as pointed out by Justice Suresh

Chandra in the above cited case, it will be an additional burden on the prosecution to call more

than one witness in a drug related offence, however satisfactory the evidence of the main Police

witness would be and therefore we are of the view that there is no merit in the submission made

on behalf of the Accused- Appellant to the effect that it is against the accepted practice to convict

a suspect in a drug related case based on one single police witness. For the reasons adduced

above we see no reason to interfere with the conviction and sentence of the Learned Trial

Judge. The appeal is accordingly dismissed
