Vijith K. MaJaJgoda PC J (PICA)

Petitioner has filed the present application before this court seeking inter alia;

D. Grant interim order staying the decision and/or implementation thereof and/or taking any

further steps of the decision to award the tender of Green- bar tavern for 2015 to the 6th

Respondent for year 2015 more fully reflected in P-4 until the final determination of this

application.

E. Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the one or more or all of the 3rd ,4th ,5th

Respondents made under the authority of the 1st Respondent dated 24.09.2014 to award

the tender of "Green bar" tavern for the year 2015 to the 6th Respondent which is

reflected in P-4

F. Grant mandate in the nature of Mandamus directing the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd and/or 4th

and/or 5th Respondents to award/grant the tender of "Green bar" tavern for the year 2015

to the Petitioner

The petitioner was an applicant for the tender of the license for "Green bar" (Foreign liquor) tavern for

the year 2015. By Gazette notification No. 1876 dated 05.08.2014 which produced marked P-l 3rd

Respondent had called for tenders for 12 tavern licenses for the year 2015 in respect of 12 areas situated

in Negombo Divisional Secretariat, including for the "Green bar" tavern which was the only foreign

liquor license to be issued.

Petitioner had submitted that he was a joint successful bidder for the same tavern for the year 2014 and

submitted duly preferred an application for the same tavern for the year 2015.

When the tenders were opened, the petitioner came to know that there were only two bidders and the

tender was awarded to the highest bidder, namely the 6th Respondent. Since the Petitioner has observed

several irregularities in the awarding process, he has filed the present application seeking inter alia a

Writ of Certiorari and Mandamus and also supported for interim relief as prayed in paragraph D to his

prayer.

This court being satisfied with the material placed on 04.12.2014 issue interim relief as prayed III

paragraph D to the prayer.

During the Argument before us Petitioner brought to the notice of this court the following facts,

According to the notification published in Government Gazette calling for the tenders, following

conditions were specified by the 3rd Respondent.

a) Any alteration done by the tenderer on the application, should be confirmed by his

signature, any violation will be liable for rejection (rule 3)

b) The successful tenderer should furnish a cash deposit of more than three months

rent value on or before 2.00 pm on the date of the sale of the tender (rule 7)

The annual rent the Petitioner bided for the above tender was Rs. 1272000/- (Rs. 106,000 x12) and since

the successful bidder was required to furnish a cash deposit more than three months (rule 7) rent value

on the day of the sale, he was compelled to refrain from bidding a higher annual rent value, since strict

adherence of conditions in the said notification was required.

On 24.09.2014 when the tenders were opened before 3rd , 4th and 5th Respondents, Petitioner and the 6th

Respondent were present. Since there were several alterations in the tender application preferred by the

6th Respondent which was not confirmed by his signature, petitioner brought the same to the notice of

the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents in the form of an objection and requested the 3rd to 5th Respondents to

reject the tender of the 6th Respondent.

However the 3rd Respondent over ruled the objection and announced the 6th Respondent as the

successful bidder as he bided Rs. 1300500/- (108,375 x12)

Subsequent to the said award the 3rd Respondent had informed the 6th Respondent to furnish only two

months' rent value which is violation of the Rule 7. Petitioner has objected to the above decision too, but

that objection too was also overruled by the 3rd Respondent and 6th Respondent was permitted to deposit

Rs. 216 750/- being the two months' rent value.

Being aggrieved by the said decisions, Petitioner has complained to the 3rd Respondent in writing on the

same day (P-2) and also complained to the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs on

26.09.2014 (P-3)

Since the 3rd Respondent refused to grant any redress the Petitioner has come before this court to invoke

Writ Jurisdiction.

Whilst denying the specific allegations against the 3rd to 5th Respondents, the Respondents have taken up

the position that the operative Gazette for calling and evaluation of tender for liquor licenses, is not the

rJ

Gazette 1876 of 15.08.2014 but the applicable Gazette is Gazette No 207 dated 20. 08.1982. It was

further submitted that according to section 10 of the said Gazette, an applicant is only required to deposit

an amount corresponds to two months' rent value before 3.00 pm on the day of the sale.

For the reasons set out above the Respondents have submitted that the 3rd to 5th Respondents have not

violated any tender condition when granting the tender to the highest bidder, i.e. the 6th Respondents.

Respondents have further denied the fact that there were alterations in the application of the 6th

Respondent, but failed to submit the tender application of the 6th Respondent along with the statement of

objection.

By Gazette dated 20.08.1982 Commissioner of Excise has published special conditions with regard to

sale of liquor licenses applicable after 1.1.1983. According to the said notification, the special conditions

referred to in the notification are applicable along with General conditions which are applicable at the

time the applications are called. According to Rule 10 of the said special conditions, any successful

applicant has to deposit as security an amount decided by the Government Agent which is more than

two months rent.

In the present application the Government Agent or his agent when calling for tenders, by Gazette No.

1876 dated 15.08.2014 has decided the amount, any successful tender has to deposit as three months rent

value, which is an amount more than two months rent value as decided by Gazette dated 20. 08.1982.

Therefore the argument by the State Counsel, that the applicant is required to deposit only an amount

corresponding to two months' rent vale, cannot be accepted.

The Gazette Notification 1876 by which, the tenders were called to the Green bar tavern, does not

contain a clause to the effect that the amount to be deposited will be decided at the time the tenders are

opened but instead there was a specific condition that the amount to be deposited at the time the tenders

were opened is an amount more than three months rent value.

Therefore the position taken by the Respondent as evident by P-4 that, "it was unanimously decided by

the tender committee that two months' rent value should be furnished before 2.00 pm on the same day

and the said decision was communicated when the tenders were opened was an arbitrary decision by the

members of the tender board.

With regard to the complaint, that there were alterations, which was not confirmed by the 6th

Respondent, in the tender document submitted by the 6th Respondent, was rejected by the Respondent

before this court. However the Respondents have failed to produce the said tender application along with

their statement of objection, but subsequently submitted along with a motion dated 6th April 2015, when

the Petitioner raised a specific objection with regard to the said failure in their counter objections.

In the Tender Application Produced Marked lR2, we observe that the alteration made with regard to the

tender value had been confirmed by a signature. The Petitioner has challenged lR2 and by way of

another affidavit filed before this court, submitted that "the tender application before this court is not the

original tender application of the 6th Respondent which was opened on 24.09.2014 in his presence."

When the facts are in dispute this court is not going to decide in favor of either party on this issue but,

we are mindful of the fact that the petitioner has challenged the tender document on the same basis from

the time the tender were opened in his presence.

For the reasons discussed above I conclude that the decision of the 1st to 3rd Respondents to reduce the

initial deposit from three months rent value to two months' rent value was an arbitrary decision and

therefore this court decides to grant a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision

of the 1st and lor 3rd to 5th respondents to award the tender of Green bar tavern to the 6th Respondent for

the year 2015, reflected in document P-4.

However I am not inclined to grant a mandate in the nature of Mandamus at this stage since the

petitioner has failed to establish that he was the highest bidder for the tender of the license for Green bar

tavern for the year 2015.
