Vijith K.Malalgoda, P.C. J (PICA)

In this case the Accused-Appellant was indicted before the High

Court of Panadura for the murder of one Handuwalage Premawathie. At

the conclusion of the trial the learned High Court Judge convicted the

Accused-Appellant for culpable homicide not amounting to murder on

the basis of sudden fight. Counsel for the Accused Appellant at this

stage informs that he has instructions to withdraw this appeal. But he

makes an application under Section 359 of the Criminal Procedure

Code to effect the sentence from the date of conviction. Learned Deputy

Solicitor General appearing for the Respondent has no objection for the

above request.

Considering submissions made by the Counsel, we make order to

implement the sentence already imposed, i.e. a period of 10 years

rigorous imprisonment from the date of conviction that is from

26.10.2009.

Subject to the above variation the appeal stands dismissed.
