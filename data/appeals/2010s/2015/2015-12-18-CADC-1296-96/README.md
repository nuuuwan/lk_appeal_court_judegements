The plaintiff respondent instituted a partition action in the District

Court Kandy seeking to partition the land described in the schedule to

the plaint against the first defendant and later by amended plaint second

to fifth defendant appellants were added. The case was taken up for trial

on 19 issues. The learned District Judge has delivered his judgment on

30108/1996 in favor of the plaintiff respondent. Being aggrieved by the

said judgment the defendant appellants preferred this appeal.

The plaintiff respondent's son Tikiri Banda in his evidence has

referred to a previous case no. 18049 filed in the District Court of Kandy

in 1963 where the second to third defendant appellants were parties.

The appellants in their submissions stated that they disputed the plaintiff

respondent's title in the said case, and a decree was entered against

one Punchi Banda alias Jamis Appuhamy and not against the

appellants. The appellants submitted since the date of filing the plaint in

the previous case in 1964 the defendant appellants have had adverse

possession to the corpus. He stated that the plaintiff respondent has

purchased the corpus from the successors in title of the plaintiff in the

said previous case bearing no. 18049 which was admitted by the

plaintiff respondent's witness at the trial. The appellants stated by the

3

J. time the instant application was filed in the District Court of Kandy the I I j

defendant appellants had more than ten years of adverse and

uninterrupted possession and earned prescriptive title to the corpus. I I I I

The appellants citing the judgment in Silva vs Fernando 15 NLR

499 stated that it was decided "the rights of the parties to an action have ! to be ascertained as, at the commencement of the action". Counsel for

the appellants stated that the appellants have clearly proved their

prescriptive title to the corpus and that the learned District Judge has

erred in holding that the appellants have not proved prescriptive title to

the corpus. He further stated that the learned District Judge failed to

consider and analyse the aforementioned facts and the legal position

clearly established by the defendant appellants.

The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent stated that the

learned District Judge had come to a correct finding considering the

evidence led before him and also considering the documents marked

and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

The respondent's counsel on issue no. 15 being answered in the

negative stated citing the judgment in Mithrapala and others vs Ikonis

Singho 2005 (1) SLR 206 that where a party invokes the provisions of

Sec. 3 of the Prescriptive Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of

the adverse claimant to immovable property the burden of proof rests

squarely and fairly on him to establish a starting point for his or her

acquisition of prescriptive rights.

The learned District Judge has carefully analysed the evidence

placed before him before coming to the final determination. The District

Judge has relied on the previous action bearing no. 18049 in the said

action the defendant Punchi Banda alias Jamis Appuhamy filed to claim

ownership and ejectment order was issued against him. The second to

fifth defendants are his wife and children according to the documents

marked P24 and P25. The contesting defendants at the trial the second

to fifth defendants claimed the property on prescriptive title and in the

alternative prayed damages for the improvements done by them.

The plaintiff appellant has proved his pedigree by documents and

evidence and it is the duty of the defendants who were seeking

prescriptive title to prove the same as correctly stated by the learned

District Judge.

For the afore stated reason I see no legal basis to allow the

appeal of the defendant appellants. The judgment of the learned District

Judge of Kandy dated 30108/1996 is affirmed. Appeal is dismissed with

costs fixed at Rs. 25,0001=.
