Appellant is present in person.

Case is taken up for argument.

At this stage, learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the

respondents submits that the Board of Review decision has been based

only on the written submissions submitted by the parties. There were no

documents marked at the inquiry nor oral evidence was placed before the

Tribunal before the determination. Written submissions referred to

certain documents but there is no proof of the Board of Review having

considered the valuations of the adjoining lands or valuation by the

government valuer when coming to a conclusion.

In an appeal of this nature this Court should have the benefit of

considering oral evidence including the evidence of the government valuer

and that of a private valuer if parties so desire and also consider the

valuation of compensation paid to adjoining lands. An adoption of

evidence will also include permitting the appellant to lead evidence as to

how the neighboring land owners have been compensated in the

assessment of compensation and the appellant is entitled to provide

documentation in proof of the same.

The Board of Review should be mindful to the scheme of assessment of

compensation contemplated by Section 45 of the Land Acquisition Act, in

making a determination of the quantum of the compensation. In view of

the interests of justice, this matter should be sent back to the Board of

Review to comply with the provisions contained in part 3 of the Land

Acquisition Act.

In the above circumstances, we decide to set aside the order of the Board

of Review dated 2 j 7 j 2012 and send back the case to the Board of Review

to conduct a fresh inquiry based on the guide lines we have provide

above.

The Tribunal is directed to hear, determine and conclude the entirety of

the appeal within a period of five months.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz. J.

I agree.
