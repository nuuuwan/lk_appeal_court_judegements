DECIDED ON : 16th October, 2015

Deepali Wijesundera J.

The petitioners have filed this application praying for a writ of

Mandamus against the first respondent directing him to pay them a sum

of Rs. 3,888,0001= as compensation determined by the Human Rights

Commission of Sri Lanka.

The son of the petitioners' who was a qualified Motor Mechanic

employeed in a garage in Trincomalee had been abducted by some

members of the Sri Lanka Army in June 1990 during military operations.

2

The petitioners after complaining to several State Authorities and not

getting any redress have complained to the United Nations Human

Rights Committee. The first petitioner had alleged that by abduction and

disappearance of his son Thevarajah Sarma the Republic of Sri Lanka

had violated his rights under Article 6, 7, 9 and 10 of International

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and that the petitioners' are

victims for violation by state party of Article 7 of the covenant.

United Nations Human Rights Committee after considering the

communication of the petitioners' and the response by the State had

come to the conclusion that the state is responsible for the

disappearance of the first petitioner's son and requested the state to

provide an effective and enforceable remedy and to communicate the

measure taken to enforce the committee's findings. The Secretary to the

Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred the matter to the Human Rights

Commission of Sri Lanka to recommend the computation of the

quantum and payment of compensation.

The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka in the presence of

the petitioners and the officer from the Attorney General Department

representing the State has recommended a total sum of Rs. 3,888,000/=

to be paid as compensation to the petitioners. The petitioners states

3

though they made several requests to pay them the compensation the

State failed to comply with the said request. In these circumstances the

petitioners have filed the instant application for a writ of Mandamus to

compel the first respondent to pay the said compensation.

The petitioners stated that the person who abducted their son was

indicted and convicted in the High Court (P8b) of Trincomalee but no

compensation was paid to them by the State. The petitioners stated the

respondents are using the judgment in Sinharasa case as a convenient

shield to escape from the obligation under protocol. He submitted that

the State while on one hand claims that the payment of compensation to

the petitioners would be contrary to the judgment in Sinharasa case on

the other hand continues to remain a party to the protocol in

contravention of the said judgment and stated that the purported

grounds for non-compliance is totally devoid of merit.

The petitioners stated that the United Nations Human Rights

Committee's views in the petitioners case is not contrary to the

judgment of the High Court and unlike in the Sinharasa case and not in

direct conflict with decisions of the Sri Lankan Courts. The petitioners

further stated that the United Nations Human Rights Committee had the

4

legal competence to receive and inquire into the complaint made by the

petitioners.

The petitioners submitted that after the enactment of ICCPR Act

No. 56 of 2007 all the provisions of the ICCPR have been incorporated

into our law and as such the right to compensation for victims

guaranteed by Article 9-5 and 2 of the ICCPR became part of the Sri

Lankan law hence the respondents can not deny the petitioners their

right to compensation. Petitioners stated that under Article 27 (115) of

our Constitution the State is duty bound to honor International

conventions to which it is a party.

The petitioners further submitted that the State by remaining as a

party to the optional protocol and by not invoking the provisions of

Article 12 of the ICCPR protocol which provides the mechanism by

which a State party could denounce and exit from the protocol

obligations has fostered the legitimate expectations of the petitioners.

The petitioners stated that after the decision of the United Nations

Human Rights Committee the Attorney General advised the Secretary to

the Foreign Ministry to refer the matter to the Human Rights

5

Commission of Sri Lanka to make recommendations with regard to

payment of compensation therefore the petitioners are entitled to seek a

writ of Mandamus to compel the first respondent to pay them

compensation.

Referring to the judgment in Lukmanjee and another Vs

Sylvester and others 2005 (1) SLR the petitioners submitted that

relevant officers who are servants of the State can be compelled by a

writ of Mandamus to pay compensation where it is due from the State,

and that in the instant case the Secretary to the Treasury could be

compelled to pay compensation to the petitioners.

The respondents stated that the petitioners did not taken any

steps to vindicate their fundamental rights under Article 11 and 13 (2) of

the Constitution and the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was not

invoked. The petitioners had made an application to the United Nations

Human Rights Committee stating Article 6, 7, 9 and 10 of the ICCPR

had been violated. After the expression of views by the Committee the

State took possible measures in good faith to comply with the said views

and referred the matter to Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka for

computing of compensation to be paid, the respondents argued. The

respondents stated that the decision of the Supreme Court in

6

1 I

Nallaratnam Sinharasa changed all these and no steps were taken by

the State under the optional protocol of the ICCPR. The petitioners

stated the Supreme Court left no doubt not only that the optional

protocol would be inapplicable within the domestic sphere of Sri Lanka

but in fact it is to be deemed as never having been applicable since the

very act of accession was held to be unconstitutional and thereby a

nullity. Respondents further stated that the United Nations Human

Rights Committee despite adopting the view that the rights of the

petitioners under Article 7 and 9 of the ICCPR had been violated

stopped short of quantifying the compensation to be paid to the

petitioners. The respondents stated that the State refrained from taking

further steps to give effect to the views of the United Nations Human

Rights Committee in compliance with the decision of the Supreme Court

and that the said decision precludes this court from giving effect to a

decision of the United Nations Human Rights Committee.

The respondents further submitted no rights or expectations can

flow from an unconstitutional Act which is the Act of accession of the

said optional protocol. Respondents stated the ICCPR only envisaged

qua state that the states would take steps in accordance with their

constitutional processes to domestically recognized rights.

7

The respondents stated that the rights envisaged under Articles 7

and 9 of the ICCPR have been available in the domestic sphere under

the constitution even prior to the ratification of the ICCPR which are

recognized as fundamental rights and that the Article 126 of the

Constitution provides the legal remedy available for the violation of the

same.

Both parties referred to the case of Minister of State for

Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Vs Ab Hin Teoh 1995 HCA 20. In this

case the court has dealt with consideration of International Law in

domestic policy.

The respondents stated that no writ of Mandamus shall lie with

regard to the implementation of a recommendation by the Human Rights

Commission of Sri Lanka as the procedure to be followed in the event

that such a recommendation is not observed is set out in the Human

Rights Committee Act No. 21 of 1996 and stated that this position has

been emphasized in the judgments of Mahanayake Vs Chairman

Petroleum Corporation and others 2005 2 SLR 193 and Sri Lanka

Telecom Ltd Vs Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka

AAlwritlapp/519/2008.

On the arguments put forward and the documents placed before

this court it has to be decided whether the petitioners are entitled to a

writ of Mandamus, to implement a recommendation by the Human

Rights Committee of Sri Lanka. Sec. 11 (9) of the Human Rights

Committee Act No. 21 of 1996 refers to the discretion of the Human

Rights Commission on awarding of money to aggrieved parties. Sec. 11

deals with powers of the Commission. Sec. 21 states how a person can

be punished for contempt, when a person disregards the orders of the

commission.

The judgments cited by the petitioners in their submissions are

not relevant to the instant case since what has to be decided is whether

a Writ of Mandamus can be issued to implement the recommendations

of the Human Rights Committee of Sri Lanka. There is no issue

regarding the awarding of compensation and the person who abducted

the petitioners' son has been convicted by a Sri Lankan High Court.

The learned counsel for the petitioners at great length made

submission on the United Nations Human Rights Committee and the

optional protocol which is not disputed. The matter to be decided by this

court is something else.

.'

The petitioners have for reasons best known to them failed to

seek redress in the constitutionally stipulated manner though such

remedy was available. Having failed to seek redress they cannot claim

that they possessed a legitimate expectation under the ICCPR or relief

under the Optional Protocol when the identical rights and remedy were

available here.

Article 9 of ICCPR reads thus;

1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No

one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one

shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in

accordance with such procedure as are established by law.

2. Anyone who is arrested shall be informed, at the time of

arrest, of the reasons for his arrest and shall be promptly

informed of any charges against him.

3. Anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge shall be

brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized

by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial

within a reasonable time or to release. It shall not be the

general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in

custody, but release may be subject to guarantees to appear

for trial, at any other stage of the judicial proceedings, and,

should occasion arise, for execution of the judgment.

10

4. Anyone who is deprived 0/ his liberty by arrest or detention

shall be entitled to take proceedings be/ore a court, in order

that court may decide without delay on the lawfulness 0/ his

detention and order his release i/ the detention is not lawful.

5. Anyone who has been the victim 0/ unlawful arrest 0/

detention shall have an en/orceable right to compensation.

Article 13 of the Sri Lankan Constitution states;

1. No person shall be arrested except according to procedure

established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed

0/ the reason lor his arrest.

2. Every person held in custody, detained or otherwise

deprived 0/ personal liberty shall be brought be/ore the

judge 0/ the nearest competent court according to

procedure established by law, and shall not be further held

in custody, detained or deprived 0/ personal liberty except

upon and in terms 0/ the order 0/ such judge made in

accordance with procedure established by law.

3. Any person charged with an ollence shall be entitled to be

heard, in person or by an attorney-at-law, at a lair trial by

a competent court.

11

4. No person shall be punished with death or imprisonment

except by order of a competent courtl made in accordance

with procedure established by law. The arrest holding in

custodYI detention or other deprivation of personal liberty

of a personl pending investigation or triall shall not

constitute punishment

5. Every person shall be presumed innocent until he is proved

guilty;

Provided that the burden of proving particular facts

maYI by lawl be placed on an accused person.

6. No person shall be held guilty of an offence on account of

any act or omission which did not I at the time of such act or

omissionl constitute such an offencel and no penalty shall

be imposed for any offence more severe than the penalty in

force at the time such offence was committed.

Nothing in this Article shall prejudice the trial and

punishment of any person for any act or omission

whichl at the time when it was committedl was

criminal according to the general principles of law

recognized by the community of nations.

It shall not be a contravention 0/ this Article to

require the imposition 0/ a minimum penalty for an

offence provided that such penalty does not exceed

the maximum penalty prescribed for such offence at

the time such offence was committed.

7. The arrest, holding in custody, detention or other

deprivation 0/ personal liberty 0/ a person, by reason 0/ a

removal order or a deportation order made under the

provisions 0/ the Immigrants and Emigrants Act or the

Indo-Ceylon Agreement (Implementation) Act, No. 14 0/

1967, or such other law as may be enacted in substitution

there/ore, shall not be a contravention 0/ this Article.

Article 126 of the Constitution states;

1. The Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive

jurisdiction to hear and determine any question

relating to the infringement or imminent infringement

by executive or administrative action 0/ any

fundamental right or language right declared and

recognized by Chapter III or Chapter IV.

13

2. Where any person alleges that any such fundamental

right or language right relating to such person has

been infringed or is about to be infringed by executive

or administrative action, he may himself or by an

attorney-at-law on his behalf, within one month thereof,

in accordance with such rules of court as may be in

force, apply to the Supreme Court by way of petition in

writing addressed to such Court praying for relief or

redress in respect of such infringement. Such

application may be proceeded with only with leave to

proceed first had and obtained from the Supreme Court,

which leave may be granted or refused, as the case may

be, by not less than two judges.

From the above it is clear that the rights envisaged under

Article 7 and 9 of the ICCPR have been available in the

constitution even prior to the ratification of the ICCPR. The said

rights are recognized as fundamental rights and Article 126 of our

Constitution provides the legal remedy available for violation of

the same.

14

The petitioners claimed the International Covenant on Civil

and Political Rights Act No. 56 of 2007 by way of incorporation of

the rights in the covenant gave rise to a legitimate expectation to

the petitioners. The preamble of the Act indicates the limited

purpose of the Act which does not envisage or provide for

adoption of the entirety of the ICCPR into domestic law. In the

circumstances the petitioners can not claim any legitimate

expectation stemming from the said Act.

For the afore stated reasons this court decides not to grant

a writ of Mandamus as prayed for by the petitioners. The

application of the petitioners' is dismissed. I make no order for

costs.
