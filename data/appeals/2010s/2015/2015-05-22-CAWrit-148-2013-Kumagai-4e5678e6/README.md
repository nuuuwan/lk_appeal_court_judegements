Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

Petitioner to this application Kumagai Gumi Company Limited has filed this application

seeking inter alia.

a) For a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the purported

determination I purported notice dated 21st May 2012 (P-16) of the 1st and lor 2nd Respondent, that the Petitioner is liable to pay EPF and Surcharge in

respect of the 3rd - 9th Respondents and quashing the purported final notice

dated 23rd April 2013 (P-20)

b) For a mandate in the nature of a writ of the Prohibition, prohibiting the 1st

and lor 2nd Respondent and lor their agents or servants from taking any

further legal action against the Petitioner in respect of the recovery of EPF

allegedly due to the 3rd _9th Respondents or Surcharge thereon, and lor from

taking any further action pursuant to the purported notice dated 21st May 2012 (P-16) and lor the purported final notice dated 23rd April 2013 (P-20)

The issue arose in this application between the petitioner and the 1st Respondent was with regard

to a finding given by the 1st Respondent under Employees Provident Fund Act, directing the

petitioner to pay EPF with regard to 7 Employees of the Petitioner Company. The purported orders

of the 1st Respondent were produced marked P-16 and P-20.

The position taken up by the Petitioner right though out this case was that the seven employees

namely 3rd to 9th Respondents to this application were domestic servants (house boys/house

maids) at the Engineers Residences and the "Domestic Servants" are not coming under "covered

employment "which attracts liability to EPF under sec.10 of the EPF Act.

Sec. 10(3) of the Employees Provident Fund Provides,

The liability of an employee in a covered employment and his employer to pay contributions

under this section shall commence on the day immediately after the date fixed in relation to

such employment by the Minister by Order published in the Gazette. Different dates may be

fixed under this subsection for different classes of employees in the same covered employment.

By Gazette No 14,936 dated 11th December 1970 minister had made order fix in relation to the

covered Employment under sec.l0(3) of the Employees Provident Fund Act and paragraph 38 of

the schedule to the Gazette. Notification reads as follows.

38. Employment in the service of any undertakings not being an undertaking carried on by a

person as an undertaking in which only members of his family are employed, in which less than

five persons are employed in any covered employment other than any employment

c) In domestic service.

According to the petitioner, he was summoned for an Inquiry by the 2nd Respondent, by letter

dated 22/02/2012 with regard to nonpayment of EPF to six employees of Petitioner Company. At

the said inquiry Petitioner had submitted his position to the Inquiry Officer. Petitioner was further

summoned for an Inquiry by two letters dated 27th March 2012 with regard to 7 employees

including the 6 employees referred to in the earlier notice dated 22/02/2012.

Petitioner submitted that he consistently maintained that in terms of Gazette No.14, 936 dated

11/12/ 1970 EPF was not payable to the 3rd _9th Respondents, who were admittedly in domestic

service providing assistance as domestic servants at the residences of the Engineers employed by

the Petitioner.

I will now deal with the Inquiry conducted by the officers attached to the 2nd Respondent's office.

At the said Inquiry the statements of the 3rd to 9th Respondents and the statement of the

Petitioners Representative were recorded and those statements are attached to the statement of

objection ofthe 1st Respondent.

3rd to 9th Respondents in their statements had taken up the position that they were employed by

the Petitioner as labourers and thereafter assigned them to work in the official residences of the

Engineers at the Engineer's housing scheme, Dharmapala Mawatha, Galle. However in the

statement of the Petitioners Representative Poruwalage Rohane Karunarathne accountant

attached to the Petitioner Company, has taken up the position that the Petitioner as the chief

contractor of the Galle High Way project was entitled to be re- imbursed under the agreement

between the contactor and RDA, the payments made to the domestic aids of the Engineers

attached to the High Way project. He had further said that 3rd - 9th Respondents were employed by

the Petitioner as domestic aids and in fact they were issued with identity card conforming their

designation.

In addition to making the above statement, Petitioner has submitted a written opinion they

obtained from an Attorney at Law to the inquiry officer.

After the said Inquiry the petitioner had received P- 16 directing him to deposit EPF money. After

receiving P-16 from the 2nd Respondent Petitioner had re submitted the legal opinion they

obtained from an Attorney at Law along with a covering letter but, by letter dated 9th November

2012 the 2nd Respondent had informed the Petitioner that he has been advised by the Legal

Branch that the Petitioner is liable for the payment of EPF dues.

2nd Respondent had thereafter served the Petitioner with a Final Notice to pay Rs. 932 264. 84 as

EPF arrears and penalty with immediate effect.

At the argument before this Court the Petitioner took up the Positions that the 1st and 2nd

respondents have failed to provide reasons in the notice served on him marked P-16. When the

Petitioner appealed against the said order, Petitioner has again submitted a copy of the legal

opinion he obtained from an Attorney at Law but by P-20 2nd Respondent once again ordered the

Petitions to deposit the said money. In any of the said orders, no reasons were given for the

rejection of the position taken up by the Petitioner, and the legal opinion submitted in support of

Petitioners position.

The second Respondent on two occasions i.e. on 21st May 2012 and 23rd April 2013 decided that

the Petitioner is liable to pay EPF to the 3rd to 9th Respondents. As submitted by the Petitioner non of these order contain any reason as to how the 1st and / or 2nd Respondent reached the said

decision rejecting the position taken up by the Petitioner.

1st respondent had produced marked R-10 the reasons and recommendation submitted to him by

the inquiring officer who conducted the inquiry. When go through R-10, we find that the above

recommendation was solely based on the fact, that the petitioner had the control over the 3rd _9th

Respondents and no consideration had been given to the position taken up by the petitioner and

the legal opinion submitted on behalf of the Petitioner.

The Principles of natural justice do not as yet include any general rule that reasons should be given

for decisions.

However, the importance of giving reasons irrespective of the fact that there is no express or

implied obligation to do so had been clearly shown in many Judicial Decisions.

As Wade says, "Nevertheless there is strong case to be made for the giving of reasons as an

essential element of administrative Justice. The need for it has been sharply exposed by the

expanding law of judicial review, now that so many decisions are liable to be quashed or

appealed against on grounds of improper purpose, irrelevant considerations, and errors of law of various kinds. Unless the citizen can discover the reasoning behind the decision, he may be

unable to tell whether it is reviewable or not, and so he may be deprived of the protection of

the law". (H.W.R.Wade and C.F.Forsyth Administrative Law 10th Edition page 436)

The necessity to give reasons were considered by our courts in number of instances. Hapuarachchi

and others Vs Commission of Elections and others 2009 I Sri LR 1, Karunadasa Vs Unique Gem

Stones 1997 I Sri LR 256, Surangani Marapona Vs The Bank of Ceylon 1997 3 Sri LR 156 are few

such decisions.

In the case of Karunadasa Vs Unique Gem Stones Mark Fernando J has observed the need to give

reasons as follow.

''To say that Natural Justice entitles a party to a hearing does not mean merely that his evidence

and submission must be heard and recorded, it necessarily means that he is entitled to a

reasoned consideration of the case which he presents. And whether or not the parties are also

entitled to be told the reasons for the decision, if they are with held, once judicial review

commenced . "

In the case of Hapuarachchi Vs Commissioner of Elections and other Shirani Bandaranayke Chief

Justice observed that lilt is not disputed that in the instant application, although the 1st

respondent had informed this court his reasons for the refusal of petitioners' application for

recognition of the party in question, that in his communique to the petitioners on 21/01/2008

(X7) referred to above, no reasons what so ever were given, which in my view a denial of Justice,

an error of law and more importantly in connection to this matter, the said decision to withhold

the reasons is arbitrary, unfair and unreasonable within the framework of sec. 12(1) of the

constitution"

In the present case as discussed by me earlier, 1st Respondent and / or his officers had failed to

give reason and consider the submission of the Petitioner at the inquiry they conducted to decide

I I III

whether the Petitioner is liable to pay EPF on 3rd to 9th Respondents or not. From the material

placed before this court by the Petitioners, it appears to this court that the petitioner was acting in

good faith and was of the opinion that the 3rd to 9th Respondents who worked as domestic helpers

to Engineers employed at the Southern Highway Project were not considered as covered

employment and therefore are entitled to know under what circumstance 1st and 2nd Respondents

decided that the 3rd to 9th Respondents are coming under "covered employment".

In such circumstance this court decides to issue a mandate in the nature of writ of certiorari

quashing the decision of the 2rd Respondent reflected in P-16 and P-20 and order the 1st and lor

2nd Respondent to hold a fresh inquiry giving due consideration to the matters raised before this

court by the petitioner.
