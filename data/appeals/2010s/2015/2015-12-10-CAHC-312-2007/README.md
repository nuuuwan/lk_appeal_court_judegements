H.N.J.Perera,J.

The accused-appellants were indicted in the High Court of Kurunegala for having committed the murder of one Suppan Sinige Selva Waduwel on 13.05.2000 an offence punishable under section 296 of the Penal code.

After trial the accused-appellants were convicted and sentenced to death. Aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the accused-appellants had preferred this appeal to this court.

According to the prosecution on the day of the incident the wife of the deceased witness Tennakoon Mudiyanselage Gunawathie and her

husband the deceased had been seated on a short wall in their veranda engaged in a conversation. It was her evidence that the 2nd accused-appellant who was known to them had come up to them and abused the

deceased at which point the witness had asked the 2nd accused-appellant to leave them alone and go. The 2nd accused-appellant had been there

for about 20 minutes abusing her husband and she had testified that the deceased did not make any utterance in retaliation. It was the evidence of the said sole eye witness that thereafter the 2nd accused-appellant had

jumped over the short walJ and left their compound and that she had not seen where he had gone.

The said witness has further testified that when she had gone inside the house to get a shirt for the deceased and was coming out she had seen

the deceased being stabbed by the 2nd accused-appellant and the two of them grappling with each other.

It was her position that when the 2nd accused-appellant first came to their house, he had gone to the house of the 1st accused-appellant which was about 40 feet away in the same compound and she had seen the pt

accused-appellant handing over a knife to the 2nd accused-appellant. It was her position that the pt accused-appellant never came to their

house or to the place where the incident took place whilst the 2nd

accused-appellant abused and attacked the deceased, the pt accused-

appellant was in his veranda watching the scene and scolding them.

When this matter was taken up for argument before this court the

learned Counsel for the accused-appellants stated to court that she is unable to find compelling grounds of appeal in respect of the 2nd

accused-appellant. The learned Counsel therefore limited her submissions in this case to the conviction and sentence of the pt

accused-appellant by the learned trial Judge of Kurunegala.

Learned Counsel for the accused-appellants urged two grounds of appeal

as militating against the maintenance of the conviction of the pt

accused-appellant.

(l)The learned trial Judge has seriously misdirected himself on very crucial issues of fact causing serious prejudice to the pt accused-

appellant.

(2) Conviction against the pt accused-appellant on the basis of common intention is factually and legally flawed.

It was contended by the Counsel for the accused-appellants that the learned trial Judge had come to a finding that when the deceased and the witness Gunawathie were talking seated on the short wall, the 2nd accused-appellant had come and abused them and gone to the house of the pt accused-appellant at which point the pt accused-appellant had

given the knife to the 2nd accused-appellant who returned and stabbed

the deceased. The evidence of witness Gunawathie was that when the 2nd accused-appellant first came to their house he was armed with the knife which was given to him by the pt accused-appellant inside the

latter's house. On perusal of the evidence given by the said witness

Gunawathie it is clearly seen that she had stated that the 2nd accused-appellant went into the house of the pt accused-appellant before he

came to the compound of the deceased. She has clearly stated that the 2nd accused-appellant went into the house of the pt accused-appellant

before coming to their compound.

It was further contended by the Counsel for the accused-appellants that the learned trial Judge has further misdirected himself by concluding that the said witness Gunawathie had seen the 2nd accused-appellant grappling with the deceased and the pt accused-appellant had brought

and handed over the knife to the 2nd accused-appellant. On perusal of the evidence of the said witness Gunawathie it is clearly seen that it was her position that the pt accused-appellant never came to their

compound and prior to the 2nd accused-appellant coming to their compound, he has gone to the house of the pt accused-appellant at which point the latter had given a knife to the 2nd accused-appellant

inside his house.

It is very clear that the learned trial Judge has further misdirected himself

when he stated that Gunawathie's evidence established that both accused-appellants had come to the house of the deceased and engaged

in a fight. The witness Gunawathie has categorically stated that whilst the 2nd accused-appellant was abusing them and attacking the deceased in their compound, the pt accused-appellant was watching the incident

from the veranda of his house which was about 40 feet away from the

place of the incident and that he never came to the crime scene.

It is further the contention of the Counsel for the accused-appellants that the learned trial Judge has misdirected himself with regard to the issue of common intention. It had to be established by the prosecution that the two accused-appellants were acting with a common intention. The

I evidence against the pt accused-appellant was that he gave a knife to

the 2nd accused-appellant when he first came to his house and that he was watching and scolding them from his veranda of his house which

was about 40 feet away from the scene of the crime. The said witness Gunawathie was not able to say as to exact words the pt accused-

appellant uttered at that time. Apart from this there is no other evidence to support the proposition that the pt accused-appellant entertained

and acted with the common murderous intention to cause the death of

the deceased.

It is the contention of the Counsel for the accused-appellants that taking

into consideration all the items of evidence, the inference of common intention cannot be drawn in this case and the pt accused-appellant

should not be held responsible for what the 2nd accused-appellant did and therefore the pt accused-appellant should be acquitted.

It is the duty of the prosecution to satisfy beyond reasonable doubt that

a criminal act has been committed, that such act was committed by the

accused-appellants, that they at the time the criminal act was committed were acting in furtherance of the common intention. The inference of common intention should never be reached unless it is a necessary

inference deducible from the circumstances of the case. There should be evidence direct or circumstantial, of pre-arrangement or some other

evidence of common intention.

Section 32 of the Penal Code provides that:-

"When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for the act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone."

In the case of common intention liability is imposed on the offender on the basis that both actus reus and mens rea has been committed by him.

A common meeting of minds has been identified as an essential pre-requisite for the imposition of criminal liability on the basis that the

accused-appellants shared a common intention. The agreement or the common design required for the imposition of liability may have been

arrived at immediately before the offensive act was committed. Mere presence of the accused at the scene is not sufficient to establish that he shared a common intention upon which liability could be imposed on

him.

In Piyathilaka and others V. Republic of Sri Lanka [1996] 2 SrLL.R 141 it

was held that to maintain a charge on the basis of common intention the mere presence is not sufficient and the Code does not make punishable

a mental state however wicked it may be unless it is accompanied by a criminal act which manifests the state of mind. In a case of murder

against all the accused where the accused are sought to be liable on the basis of section 32, the common intention must necessarily be a murderous common intention. Though the accused did not commit any

physical act, yet liability could be imposed on him on the basis that his presence was participatory presence. In a murder case it is imperative that the accused entertain a murderous intention with the perpetrator of the offending act.

In King V. Asappu (1948) 50 N.L.R 324 it was held that in order to justify

the inference of common intention there must be evidence, direct or circumstantial, either of pre-arrangement or a pre-arranged plan or a declaration showing common intention or some other significant fact at the time of the commission of the offence.

The question then, in regard to the pt accused-appellant, is whether his giving a knife to the 2nd accused-appellant immediately prior to the incident and watching the incident from his veranda of his house which

was about 40 feet away from the scene of the crime was a participatory

presence in the sense that he was there as sharing a common intention

with the 2nd accused-appellant to cause the death of the deceased. There

is no evidence whatsoever as to under what circumstances the said knife was given to the 2nd accused-appellant by the pt accused-appellant.

The learned Counsel for the accused-appellants submitted that the charge against the pt accused-appellant cannot be maintained as the evidence is insufficient.

In Queen V. Vincent Fernando 65 N.L.R 265 Basnayake, J. stated as follows:-

"A person who merely shares the criminal intention, or takes a fiendish delight in what is happening but does no criminal act in furtherance of

the common intention of all is not liable for the acts of the others. To be

liable under section 32 a mental sharing of the common intention is not

sufficient, the sharing must be evidenced by a criminal act. The Code does not make punishable a mental state however wicked it may be unless it is accompanied by a criminal act which manifests the state of mind."

In the case of Ariyaratne V.Attorney General S.C 31/92 SCM 15.11.93, G.P.S.de Silva ,J. has reiterated that the inference of common intention must be not merely a possible inference, but an inference from which

there is no escape. The facts revealed that, the principal witness speaks only of the pt accused-appellant handing over a knife immediately prior to the incident to the 2nd accused scolding and watching the incident from the veranda of his house which was about 40 feet from the place of the incident. There is no evidence whatsoever as to under what circumstances the said knife was given to the 2nd accused-appellant by the pt accused-appellant.

I

Having considered the evidence against the pt accused-appellant I am of

the view that evidence is insufficient to sustain the conviction.

On perusal and consideration of the learned trial Judge's judgment and the totality of the evidence led in this case we are of the considered view that the learned trial Judge has come to a right decision in finding the 2nd

accused-appellant guilty of the charge. In my opinion the prosecution has proved the case against the 2nd accused-appellant beyond reasonable

doubt. For these reasons, I affirm the conviction and sentence of the 2nd

accused-appellant and dismiss his appeal. I allow the appeal of the pt accused-appellant and acquit him.

Appeal of the pt accused-appellant allowed. pt accused-appellant

acquitted.

Appeal of the 2nd accused-appellant dismissed.
