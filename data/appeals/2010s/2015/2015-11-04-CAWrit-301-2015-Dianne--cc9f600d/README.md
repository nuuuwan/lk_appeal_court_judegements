CA 301/2015 WRIT APPLICATION

Before Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C.J. (P/CA)&

H.C.J. Madawala, J.

Counsel Asthika Devendra for the petitioner

Chaya Sri Nammuni, SC for Respondents

Argued &

Decided on 02.10.2015

Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C.J. (P/CA)

Heard counsel for the petitioner as well as the State Counsel

The petitioner is before this court asking for relief including

to quash a deed already issued by the NHDA to the 11th

Respondent. It was submitted by the petitioner that the

petitioner's farther was in occupation in the premises in

question until his death in year 2013. The position taken up by

the petitioner was that the 11th Respondent who was also a sister

of her father had claimed for the said premises prior to 2009

and in 2009 when she was to be granted the said premises she

withdraw her request. Petitioner further submits that just

after her father's death the 11th Respondent has re-agitated the

issue and the NHDA without informing and giving an opportunity

to the petitioner a deed had been executed in favour of the 11th

Respondent.

Court observes that the 11th Respondent is a 3rd Generation member

of the original lessee and the petitioner belongs to the 4th

Generation. Learned State Counsel's position before this court

was that when considering such grants the NHDA give priority to

the 3~ generation above the 4~ generation. The position taken

up by the petitioner was that she was not granted an opportunity

to represent before an inquiry if the criteria is to grant 3rd

generation above the 4th generation.

At the same time the position taken up by the leaned State

Counsel was that, at the time the deed was executed and decision

is arrived there was no request from the petitioner for the said

premises. By that time, petitioner's farther had passed away.

Under these circumstances, we see no merit in this application

and therefore we refuse to issue notices in this matter.

Notices are refused.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

H.C.J. Madawala, J.

I agree.
