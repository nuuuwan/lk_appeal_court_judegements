Petitioners to the three applications namely Hatha Kupuralalage Ashoka Dayaratne (CN175/15)

Hikkaduwa Liyanage Padmasiri de Silva (CN176/15) and Ratnayake Mudiyanselage Malhamy

Ratnayake (CN177/15) have come before this court under section 63 (1) of the Provincial Council's

Elections Act No.2 of 1988 challenging their expulsion;

All three petitioners are members of the Democratic Party and Petitioner in CA 175 /12 is a Provincial

Council Member in the Western Provincial Council. Petitioners in CN176/15 and 177/15 are Provincial

Council members of Southern Provincial Council and North Western Provincial Council respectively.

Since all three expulsions are based on similar facts, with identical charge sheet served against each

Petitioner and the expUlsion process carried out by a disciplinary board consists of 3rd to 5th Respondents,

it was agreed by the counsel for all the parties that all three cases should be heard together since they

essentially related to similar issues.

4

Petitioners alleged that, the second respondent by letter dated 12/11/2014 suspended their party

membership and the said letter was produced marked P- 4 in all three Petitions filed before this court. In

the said letter it was alleged that the petitioners have acted in breach of the disciplinary rules by attending

a media briefing organized by another political party on 10/11/2014 without informing or obtaining the

consent of the Democratic Party and acting in such a manner to discredit the party leader Sarath Fonseka

and by publishing through media that the petitioners support a candidate of another political party. It was

further stated that the petitioners have violated the memorandum of understanding entered into with the

party prior to contesting the Provincial Council's Election.

Subsequent to the said suspension, the 2nd Respondent had issued charge sheets dated 21/11/2014 on all

three petitioners. The said charge sheets contained 5 charges against each petitioner alleging that;

a) Without obtaining approval of the Democratic Party, engaging in discussions with a leader

and activists of another political party on or about 10/11/2014.

b) Enabling the said discussion to be covered and telecasted by media in such a manner as to

bring the party to disrepute.

c) Causing the media to publish that the petitioner supports the leader of the said political party

at the upcoming presidential elections.

d) At the time the said discussion took place, the petitioner being well aware that the

Democratic Party was taking steps with regard to the upcoming presidential elections,

proceed to held discussions regarding the same without any approval from the party, acted

in support of a member of another political Party and thereby brought the party and its

leader to disrepute and acted in contravention of the decisions of the Executive Council of

the Party.

e) At the said discussions, acting with several other members in such a manner as to conspire

against the party and causing the public to believe that a large number of members had left

the party.

A disciplinary committee consist of 3rd to 5th Respondents were appointed by the Executive Committee of

the said party and the Petitioners were represented before the said disciplinary committee. At the

5

conclusion of the said Inquiry the Disciplinary Committee has found the petitioners guilty of the charges

against them and recommended to expel the petitioners from the said party. The said recommendations

were approved at the executive committee and accordingly the executive committee of the said party

decided to expel all three petitioners from the said party with effect from 09/03/2015 and to inform the

said decision to the Secretaries of the respective Provincial Council in order to expel them from their

respective positions under the Provisions of the Provincial Council's Elections Act No.2 of 1988 as

amended by Act No. 29 of 1990, 7 of 1993 and 5 of 2004. Against the said decisions of the executive

committee the Petitioners have come before this court under section 63 (1) of the said Act.

Section 63 (1) of the said Act reads as follows;

63(1), Where a member of a Provincial Council ceases, by resignation, expUlsion or otherwise, to

be a member of a recognized political party or independent group on whose nomination paper his

name appeared at the time of his becoming such member, his seat shall become vacant upon the

expiration of a period of one month from the date of his ceasing to be such member.

Provided that in the case of expUlsion of a member of a Provincial Council his seat shall not

become vacant if prior to the expiration of the said period of one month he applies to the Court of

Appeal by Petition in writing and the Court of Appeal upon such application determines that such

expulsion was invalid. Such Petition shall be inquired into by three Judges of the Court of Appeal

who shall make their determination within two months of the filing of such Petition. Where the

Court of Appeal determines that the expulsion was valid the vacancy shall occur from the date of

such determination.

When this matter was taken up for inquiry before us, the Counsel for the 1st to 6th Respondents raised

several preliminary objections challenging the maintainability of this application.

This court at that stage after hearing the submission by both parties, decided to consider both matters, i.e.

the preliminary objection and the main application together, and the inquiry into the main matter too was

proceeded before us.

However, before deciding the preliminary objection on maintainability of this application and the main

application filed under section 63 (1) of the Provincial Council's Election Act No 2 of 1988 (as amended)

this court will have to consider the proviso to the said section which provides that this court shall make

its determination within two months of the filing of such Petition, is mandatory to be followed by this

6

court. This issue was raised in the case of Waruna Deeptha Rajapakse V. Janatha Vimukthi Peramune

and others CA/103/2012, and His Lordship Justice Sisira Abrew has concluded as follows;

"One must consider the provision that the Court of Appeal shall make its determination within two

months of the filing of the case is directory or mandatory. Similar provision is found in the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 (CPC) section 203 of the CPC reads as follows;

"When the case for the prosecution and defence are concluded, the Judge shall forthwith or within

ten days of the conclusion of the trial record a verdict of acquittal or conviction giving reasons

therefore and if the verdict is one of conviction pass sentence on the accused according to Law."

In Anura Shantha Vs, Attorney General [1999J I Sri LR 299 Court of Appeal considering section 203 of

the CPC held; the provisions of section 203 of the code are directory and not mandatory. This is a

procedural objection that has been imposed upon court and it's none compliance would not affect the

individual a failure of justice.' Applying the principle laid down in the above judicial decision, I hold

failure by Court of Appeal to make its determination within the prescribed period will not nullify the

Petition and that section 63(1) of the Act is only directory and not mandatory."

This court prefers to follow the above decision and therefore concludes that the above provisions are only

directory and therefore it should not be strictly adhered to as Mandatory.

At the commencement of the Inquiry before us, both parties informed that they would not be leading any

evidence before us and agreed to make oral submission in support of their respective cases. Thereafter the

counsel representing 15t to 6th Respondents raised several preliminary objections with regard to the

maintainability of this application before this court. Of several preliminary objections raised, following

are the main objections raised by the Respondents.

1. The purported appointment of the Attorney-at -Law for the Petitioner by way of written

proxy is defective in Law and lor contrary to Law and to the practice of the Court and

hence there is no proper application before Court.

2. There is deliberate concealment of facts and misrepresentation of material facts which

warrant dismissal of this application in limine.

7

In support of the lSI objection the respondents have raised several grounds before this court. Drawing the

attention of Rule 12 of the Supreme Court rules, the respondents submitted that the Attorney -at -Law on

record in all three applications before this court had,

a) Failed to divulge the fact that he acted as the defending officer III all three

disciplinary inquires against the three Petitioners

b) Appeared as the instructing attorney on record, knowingly and lor having reasons to

believe that he would be required as a witness in the present case.

An Attorney -at-Law who represents a client before a court of law has no legal duty to divulge his

commitments in the pleadings filed before the court. As an officer of court he has a duty to be truthful to

his client as well as to court, but the respondents have failed to establish a specific instance where the

conduct of the said Attorney-at-Law has disturbed the functions of this court.

Respondents have further argued that, when the disciplinary inquiries were III progress, certain

settlements were proposed by the Petitioners and it is their defending officer, who could give evidence

before this court with regard to the said settlements and therefore under the provisions of Rule 12 he

cannot acted as the instructing attorney in the present cases.

Rule 12 of the Supreme Court Rules (conduct and Etiquette for Attorney-at-Law) 1985 reads as follows,

"An Attorney-at-Law shall not accept any professional matter in respect of which he knows or has

reason to believe that he would be required as witness.

The same principle would apply where an Attorney-at-Law after accepting any professional

matter finds that he would be required as a witness in the same matter; provided however an

Attorney-at-Law may accept any professional matter in which he may required only as a witness

in respect of any formal on non- contentious matter.

As I have referred at the very inception of this Judgment, at the commencement of this inquiry all the

parties agreed to limit the proceeding to oral submissions without leading any evidence. Therefore it can

be argued that there was no likely hood of calling the said Attorney-at-Law as a witness in the present

case. On the other hand I find that the role played by the Attorney-at-Law on record, in the said

8

disciplinary inquiry was purely professional in nature and therefore I see no reason for him to believe that

he would be required to be called as a witness at the present case, Unless he deliberately continued to

appear after such warning by the opponent party is given.

The Respondents during their oral submissions and also in the written submissions tendered before this

court, referred to several judgments in support of the above contention but I see no relevance in any of

the judgments to the preliminary objections raised in the present case.

Based on the above submissions the Respondents submitted that there is no valid proxy before this court

from the instructing attorney and for the said reason there is no proper application before this court. I see

no merit in the said argument and therefore reject the said preliminary objections.

Respondents have further argued that there is deliberate concealment of facts and misrepresentation of

material facts which warrants dismissal of this application. In support of the above contention the

Respondents have submitted,

I True identity of Defending officer was deliberately concealed from this court

II Petitioner had willfully concealed the fact that he had entered into an agreement

between the Party and himself.

As I have pointed out earlier, in this judgment an Attorney-at-Law has no legal duty to divulge his

commitments in the pleadings filed before court. The pleadings in a case referrers to the matters

pertaining to the action before the court but not to the relationship of the Attorney-at-Law with the action

pending.

Therefore I cannot agree with the 1st argument of the Respondent that the failure by the Attorney-at-Law

on record to divulge that he acted as the defending officer in the pleadings of the present case amounts to

a deliberate concealment of facts.

I further observe that the argument by the 1st to 6th Respondents to the effect that "the Petitioner has

willfully concealed the fact that he had entered into an agreement between the party and him" had based

on a wrong premis.

When raising the said argument, the respondents have forgotten the fact that the counsel for both parties

agreed to limit their cases to oral submissions, even though this court was inquiring into the application

of the Petitioners. The parties could have placed evidence in challenging the position taken up by the

9

opposing parties. Therefore if the Petitioners have concealed any material fact it is the duty of the

Respondents to elicit the above facts before this court by leading additional evidence.

This court consistently followed the principle of full and fair disclosure of all material facts in

considering the grant of Prerogative Writs, but I am not inclined to apply the same standard in an inquiry

where the parties are free to place evidence before this court.

I therefore overrule the preliminary objections raised by the counsel for the 15t to 6th Respondents for the

maintainability of these three applications.

I will now proceed to consider the material placed before us by all the parties in the three main cases.

Petitioners in all three applications rested their cases on several points raised by them. The salient issues

raised by the above Petitioners are summarized as follows;

a) The Democratic Party did not have duly adopted constitution nor a duly appointed

Executive Council as at the date of the alleged incident and therefore the charge sheets

issued to the Petitioners are bad in Law

b) The charge sheets did not specify the charges against the Petitioners with sufficient

certainty

c) The Petitioners did not act in contravention of the constitution

d) Principles of Natural Justice were not followed in conducting the inquiry

I. Charge sheets did not contain details of the evidence against the

Petitioners

II. The 2nd Respondent misled the Petitioners that media publications would

not be produced at the inquiry and therefore the Petitioners prepared

their answers to the charge on that basis

III. Evidence against Petitioners were not made available to them prior to

the inquiry and was produced for the first time on the second day of the

inquiry

10

IV. The Petitioners were denied the opportunity to respond to/contradict the

evidence against them nor to defend their case

V. Copies of media publications were not made available to the Petitioners

even prior to preparing written submissions

VI. The position of the 1st to 5th Respondents that there is no requirement to

provide copies of media publications to the Petitioners is flawed

VII. There was apparent bias on the part of the disciplinary committee

especiall y the 5th Respondent

VIII. Petitioners were not given an opportunity to defend their case

a. Democratic Party did not have a duly adopted constitution nor a duly appointed Executive

Council as at the date of the alleged incident and therefore the charge sheet issued to the

Petitioner is bad in Law;

The position taken up by the Petitioners with regard to the above objections was that the Petitioners were

members of the Democratic Party since its inception in January 2012 and at no stage a constitution was

adopted at a General Convention.

Upon its registration as a recognized political party on 01.04.2013, the main events organized by the

Democratic Party were the May Day rallies of 2013, 2014 and the General Convention which was held

on 22. 11. 2014 but, the party constitution was not adopted at anyone of these meetings. In support of the

above contention the Petitioners have annexed marked P- 8A, P- 8B and P- 8C, three affidavits from

another provincial council member, namely Rajitha Hapuarachchi, R.P. Haputhanthre and

H.A.Chandrika two members from the Democratic Party.

At the Inquiry the Respondents failed to challenge the above contention, by placing any additional, oral

or documentary evidence, other than referring to the objections already filed to the effect that the

constitution was duly adopted at the Party May Day rally on 01.05.2014 (D-2) and at the Executive

Council on 10.04.2014 (D-3), which was challenged in the annexures marked P 8A -8e.

According to annexure 8A a member of the Democratic Party and a Provincial Counselor, Rajitha

Hapuarachchi had submitted that he has attended the two May Day rallies held on 01.05.2013 and

01.05.2014 and the General Convention on the 22.11.2014 but the party constitution was never adopted

11

at any of these occasions. This position was confirmed by the other two affidavits submitted by two

members of the Democratic Party namely R.P. Haputhanthre (party membership No.90) and H.A.

Chandrika (party membership No. 91)

The Democratic Party Constitution submitted before this court is a certified copy issued by the

Additional Commissioner of Election and the covering letter signed by the Secretary to the Democratic

Party Ananda Manawadu, indicates the adoption date of the said constitution as 01.05.2014.

When the said position was challenged by the Petitioners by submitting affidavits, the respondents have

failed to counter the said position. Therefore this court has no alternative other than concluding that the

position taken up by the Petitioners that the Constitution of the Democratic Party has not been adopted up

to 10.11.2014, the day on which the alleged violation of the Party constitution took place, is acceptable.

When the Petitioners have challenged the existence of the Party Constitution on 10.11.2014, the fact that

a document purported to be the Party Constitution was submitted to the Election Commissioner is not

proof of its existence. The Respondents have failed to satisfy the court of the Existence of a Party

Constitution at the time the alleged violation of the Constitution took take place.

The Respondents have further alleged that the alleged acts committed by the Petitioners were in violation

of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the party and the each petitioner prior to

the Provincial Councils Election in 2014.

The said MOU is before us produced marked "C" on behalf of the Respondents. The said MOU dated

02.02.2014 has no reference to the Party Constitution either to the constitution which was in operation on

10.11.2014 or any other Constitution which was in operation prior to that.

The next matter to be considered by this court is whether there is a valid charge sheet before this court

based on my conclusion that the Respondents have failed to satisfy this court the existence of the Party

Constitution.

As referred by me earlier in this judgment, the Respondents has produced marked "C" the MOU signed

between the Party and the each Petitioner prior to the Provincial Councils Election 2014. However the

Petitioners in their affidavit tendered before this court submitted that,

29 (d) I have not entered in to any memorandum of understanding with the Party prior to

the Provincial Councils Election.

II

!fI ;i !

12

In reply to the said averment the Respondents whilst denying the said position in their objections had

submitted the said memorandum of understanding marked "C". The Petitioners had not contested the

existence of the said MOD thereafter either in their counter objection or at the inquiry before us, which in

my view confirms the existence of the said MOD signed between the Party and the each Petitioner.

In the said MOD, paragraph 4 and 5 refers to the conduct and the disciplinary procedure of the said Party

and even though there is no reference to the existence of the Party constitution in the said MOD there is

clear reference to the existence of the Executive Council and its powers.

In the said MOU the Petitioners have agreed that if the leader of the party on information he himself

received or on recommendation of the Executive Council satisfies that the second party to the MOD

(each petitioner) had acted in violation of any of the conditions in paragraph 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the MOD,

the said leader or the Executive Council can expel him from the membership and also to inform the

Commissioner of Elections of the said decision. (Paragraph 5)

The petitioners have further agreed that the second party (each petitioner) has renounce all the rights,

entitlements, privileges guaranteed under any law with regard to the conduct of an inquiry, serve a charge

sheet or any other pre requisite prior to the expulsion from the said party as agreed in the said paragraph 5

(paragraph 6).

Even though the Petitioners have renounced their rights to face a disciplinary inquiry in case of a

violation of the said paragraphs by the conduct of the Petitioners, Rules of Natural Justice will not permit

the respondents to act arbitrary in expelling the Petitioners.

As discussed in several cases decided by the Supreme Court including the cases of Jayatillake and

Another Vs, Kaleel and Others 1994 (1) Sri L R 319 and Thilak Karunarathne V. Ms. Sirimavo

Bandaranayake and Others 1993 (2) Sri L R 90 that the relationship of a member of a Political Party

rests on contractual basis.

Therefore I am in agreement with the Respondents that where there has been a breach of party discipline

and the contractual relationship with the Party by violating the provisions of the MOD, the party has

discretion to mete out punishment which is appropriate in the circumstances of each case.

In the said case of Jayatillake and Another Vs. Kaleel and Others Justice Kuiatunga had observed "A

Political Party must be allowed a discretion to decide what sanctions are appropriate for violations of

Party discipline; and if Party decides, bona fide, to expel any member guilty of repudiating the Party, as

the Petitioners have done this court will not in the exercise of its constitutional jurisdiction impose such

It If

ii{

ff ! Ii I !

~ I I!f

13

member on the Party. If that is done Parliamentary Government based on the Political Party System will

become unworkable".

I have already ruled out the existence of the Party Constitution at the time the alleged violations took

place, but I am of the view that the existence of the MOD between the Party and the each Petitioner

provides a basis for the Party to hold disciplinary proceeding against the Petitioners and therefore I

conclude that the Respondents had a legal basis to issue the said charges against the Petitioners and said

charge sheets are valid in law.

The charge sheet did not specify the charges against the Petitioners with sufficient certainty

Petitioner have alleged before this court that the charge sheet do not contain precise charges against the

Petitioners. It was further submitted that the charges are vaguely worded and do not indicate details of the

Political Party and/or its members with whom the Petitioners have allegedly had discussions with or

details of the media institutions which have allegedly published the purported discussion.

In support of their contention Petitioner relied on the decision by the Supreme Court in Sarath

Amunugama and Others V. Karu Jayasuriya 2000 (1) Sri L R 172.

In this regard I would like to discuss the circumstances under which decision had arrived in the said case

of Sarath Amunugama and Others V. Karu Jayasuriya.

It was observed in the said case; that "Admittedly as far as the Petitioner in Application (E) 4/99 Dr.

Sarath Amunugama, is concerned, a letter dated the 3rd of November 1999 had been sent to him by the

General Secretary of the V.N.P that letter as follows;

The Daily News in its publication of Monday 1st November 1999 under the headline Sarath Amunugama

tells BBC he will quit V.N.P as stated, he will definitely leave V.N.P if there is no proper response from

the party for his National Government concept, it is further noted that there has been no denial by you as

to the making of this statement or the accuracy of the contents of the article under reference.

You have thus acted in breach of the Party Constitution, Party Discipline and contrary to the conduct

required of a V.N.P Member in Parliament and the decision of the Parliamentary Group at its meeting

held on 22.10.1999 that no member makes any statements to the media without prior approval of the

Party.

I would be grateful to have your immediate explanation and response to the aforesaid to reach me not

later than Sunday i h November 1999.

!

I

~ t-,f I,

I,Ii r

14

Even though Dr. Sarath Amunugma had responded to the said letter on 5th November the submission of

the Petitioner (Dr. Sarath Amunugama) in the Supreme Court was; "that No explanations were called for,

no charge sheets were served, No notice of the date, time and place of inquiry were given and that the

Petitioners were not called upon to attend the inquiry" and the Supreme Court had observed that the said

position was not challenged by the Respondents during inquiry before Supreme Court.

When consider the circumstances under which the decision in the above case has arrived I am of the view

that the said decision has no relevance to the presents case in the context "the charge sheet did not specify

the charges against the Petitioner with sufficient certainty.

Section 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 refers to the ingredient of a charge in

the context of a criminal prosecution before a court of law. Even though these provisions are not

applicable to a disciplinary proceeding which is conducted purely on a contractual relationship between

the Petitioners and the Respondents (1st to 6th), it can certainly be considered as guide lines to arrive at a

fair decision.

Section 165 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 reads as follows;

165 (1) the charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence and

as to the person (if any) against whom and as to the things (if any) in respect of which it

was committed as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matters with

which he is charged and to show that the offence is not prescribed.

When going through the above provisions it is clear that what is required under law is a statement which

is reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matters with which he is charged.

In the present case not like in the case of Dr. Sarath Amunugama a charge sheet has been served on the

each Petitioner by the secretary of the Political Party, in which the Petitioners are members, and each of

the said charge sheet contained 5 charges. The date of the alleged incident took place and the manner

under which such act took place and the purpose of the said meeting, which is against the interest of the

Democratic Party is explained in the charge sheet even though with whom the said discussion took place

and to whom the Petitioner supported was not clearly indicated.

In the case of Jayatilake and Another V, Kaleel and Others 1994 (1) Sri LR 319 it was held that, "while

natural justice entities a person to a fair and accurate statement of the allegations against him, the mere

fact that he had not been given formal notice of all the matters in which his conduct was to be called in

question, did not necessarily entitle him to contend that the inquiry was breach of the audi alteram

15

partem rule. However it is further observed by this court that the entire case against the Petitioners were

based on audio, video and documentary material but, proper notice of such material was not given to the

Petitioner is also to be considered by this court. I intend discussing this issue separately when I am

considering whether the Principle of Natural Justice were followed, but subject to the above, I observe

that the charges are reasonably sufficient to give adequate notice of the matters with which the Petitioners

are charged.

The Petitioners did not act in contravention of the Constitution

Petitioners further argued that, by the conduct as alleged by the Party, the Petitioners have not violated

the provisions in section 3.7 and 3.8 of the Party Constitution.

However at this stage the court is mindful of the very first argument raised by the Petitioners before this

court to the effect "Democratic Party did not have a duly adopted Constitution nor a duly adopted

Executive Council as at the date of the alleged incident and therefore the charge sheet issued to the

Petitioner is bad in law" and therefore observe that the present argument is contradictory to the said

Argument.

As I have already decided infavour of the Petitioner but concluded that the charges are valid on a

different basis, that is under the MOU signed between the Party and the Complainants. I am not inclined

to consider this submission in my judgment.

Principles of Natural Justice were not followed in conducting the inquiry

Our courts were mindful of the requirement of following the principles of Natural Justice in deciding

applications made against the decisions by political parties for expulsion of their members. This is

evident in a series of cases including Jayathilake and Another V. Kaleel and Others 1994 (1) Sri L R

319, Goonarathne and Others V. Premachandra and Others 1994 (2) Sri L R 137, Ramamoorthy and

Rameshwara V. Douglas Devananda and Others 1998 (2) Sri L R 278 and Sarath Amunugama and

Others V. KaruJayasuriya and Others 2000 (1) Sri L R 173.

All three Petitioners were members of the Democratic Party from its inception. In the year 2013 they

obtained nominations to contest the 2013 Provincial Councils Election from the said Party and the

Petitioner Hatha Kapuralalage Ashoka Dayaratne contested for the Western Provincial Council.

Hikkaduwa Liyanage Padmasiri de Silva Petitioner in CA 176/2015 contested the Southern Provincial

Council and Rathnayake Mudiyanselage Malhamy Ratnayake contested the North Western Provincial

Council and elected as members of the respective Provincial Councils from the Democratic Party.

16

Petitioners have complained that the 1st_6th Respondents failed to follow the rules of Natural Justice

when conducting the inquiries against them and therefore it is necessary to consider the sequence of

events took place with regard to the charge sheets served on the Petitioners;

According to the Petitioners, by letter dated 12.11.2014 (P-4) the 2nd Respondent informed them that

their membership of the Democratic Party has been suspended with immediate effect. It was further

alleged by the said letter that,

"the Petitioners have acted in breach of Disciplinary rules and the MOU entered into with the

Party, prior to contesting the Provincial Councils Election by attending a media briefing without

obtaining permission from the party on 10.11.2014 organized by another political party in support

of a candidate of another political party and thereby discredit the party and its leader and therefore

steps would be take to have a disciplinary action against them."

Subsequent to the said suspension, by letter dated 21.11.2014 (P-5) the Petitioners were served with a

charge sheet which contained 5 charges, against each Petitioner, requesting them to reply within 07 days

of the receipt there of.

The Petitioners by letter dated 30.11.2014 acknowledge the receipt of the said charge sheets and

requested a copy of the Party Constitution in order to answer the said charge sheet and further 14 days

time to reply the said charge sheets. (P-9)

On receipt of the said request the 2nd Respondent had written to the Petitioners on 4th December 2014

informing them to collect the Party Constitution from the Party Head Officer between 11th and 1ih

December 2014 and granting them a further period of 14 days to reply the said charge sheet with effect

from 12.12.2014.

On 16th December 2014 the 2nd Respondent informed the Petitioners, the date and place for the

disciplinary Inquiry as 31st December at 2.00 pm at the Party Head Quarters and requested them to be

present at the said Inquiry (P-12).

However the petitioners, by their letters dated 19.12.2014 requested further fourteen days from the date

of receipt the said letters in order to reply the charge sheet (P-13). 2nd Respondent by letter dated

24.12.2014 informed the Petitioners the new date of inquiry as 06.01.2015 (P-14).

The Petitioners by their letters dated 2nd January 2015 and 3rd January 2015 informed their inability to be

present for the disciplinary inquiry fixed for the 6th for two reasons, (P-15)

1. Their defending officer Attorney -at -Law Niroshan Siriwardena has suddenly fallen ill

2. Paper articles and video tapes relevant to charges are not provided to them and requested

the copies of the same

By telemail dated 5th January, the 2nd responded informed the Petitioners that no further date will be

given to them and therefore requested them to be present for the inquiry with their defending officer. It

was further informed the Petitioners that the paper articles and video tapes would not be submitted for the

inquiry on that day (P-16).

Petitioners protested to the said telemail by their letters dated 06.01.2015 that the above decision of the

party and lor the 2nd Respondent is in violation of the principles of Natural Justice and requested to grant

a fresh date for the above inquiry, preferably a date after 10.01.2015. (P-17)

By letter dated 12.01.2015 the 2nd Respondent informed the Petitioners that the said inquiry was held on

06.01.2015 as scheduled but decided to grant the Petitioners another opportunity to come before the

disciplinary committee and put off the inquiry for 28.01.2015. It was further informed that the News

Paper articles and video tapes would not be submitted on that day (P-18)

The Petitioners replied the charge sheets issued to them by the party, by their letters dated 25.01.2015

which were produced marked P-19 to each petition. They denied all the charges against them and further,

raised objections to the said charges on the ground that there was no Constitution adopted by its

membership to the Democratic Party and therefore no violation of the provisions of the so called

Constitution has taken place as alleged by the charge sheets served on them.

The disciplinary committee consists of 3rd _5 th Respondents met on 28.01. 2015 as scheduled and the three

Petitioners were present and represented by their defending officer.

The disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner in CA 175/15 H.K. Ashoka Dayaratne was commenced

before the said disciplinary committee. The Petitioner had renewed his objection with regard to the non

adoption of the Party Constitution, but the said objection was overruled by the disciplinary committee

and thereafter the 2nd Respondent had submitted the charges against the Petitioner.

, 18

It was evident from proceeding of the said inquiry produced marked, P-20 that the Petitioner has denied

the 1st charge and submitted that the Petitioner had not participated a meeting with a leader of another

political party and not acted in violation of party discipline by attending discussions against the party.

With regard to the 2nd, 4th and 5th charges the 2nd Respondent had undertook to lead audio and video

evidence on the next inquiry date. However the proceeding does not indicate any submission with regard

to 3rd count in the charge sheet.

At the end of the proceedings of that day it was recorded that "with the consent of the parties the inquiry

is put off for another date which will be informed in due course, for leading audio, video and

documentary evidence and for the rest of the proceedings of the disciplinary inquiry. The other two

inquires against L.H. Padmasiri de Silva (Petitioner in CA 176/15) and R.M.M. Ratnayake (Petitioner in

CA 177/15) were put off with the consent of all the parties with further agreement to decide a date later in

consultation with the parties. It is important to observe at this stage that, the charge sheets were not read

out and an opportunity to plead for those charges were not given to the two Petitioners in CA 176/15 and

CA177/15 on 28.01.2015.

The 2nd Respondent by letter dated 03.02.2015 had informed all the petitioners, the next date of inquiry

as 22.02.2015. It was further informed the Petitioners by the said letter that six items of audio, video and

print material (with a list attached) will be submitted as evidence on that day. (P-21)

However when the inquiry was commenced on 22.02.2015 as informed to the Petitioners by the 2nd

Respondent, it is not clear whether the inquiry was commenced against all the three Petitioners or the

inquiry was commenced only against the Petitioners in CA 176/15 and CA177/15 namely L.H. Padmasiri

de Silva and R.M.M. Ratnayake.

According to the proceeding dated 22. 02.2015 which was produced marked P-20 it was recorded that

Petitioner in CA 175/15 H.K. Ashoka Dayaratne has already denied the charges and proceeded to explain

the charges to the other Petitioners. When consider the proceedings taken place on 28.01.2015 I observe

that the plea of the Petitioner in CA 175/15 was separately recorded and the other two matters were

postponed. If there was a decision to take up all three inquiries together, the disciplinary committee could

have taken up all three Petitioners one after the other but it is clear from the proceeding of 28.01.2015,

the disciplinary committee has taken up the disciplinary inquiry against H.K. Ashoka Dayaratne separate

to the disciplinary inquiries of the other two Petitioners, and the two disciplinary inquires against L.H.

Padmasiri de Silva and R.M.M. Ratnayake were also postponed separate to each other.

According to the proceedings of 22.02.2015 the plea of Petitioners Padmasiri de Silva and R.M.M.

Ratnayake were taken up together. The Petitioners have renewed their objection with regard to the non

adoption of the Party Constitution as their first objection and in addition to the above; another objection

was raised against one of the members of the disciplinary committee. The said two objections were

overruled by the disciplinary committee and thereafter moved to lead the audio, video and documentary

evidence.

At that stage the Petitioners have raised several objections for producing the said evidence; the main

objections the Petitioners raised can be summarized as follows;

a) 2nd Respondent had given an undertaking by P-16 and P-18 that the said evidence would

not be called.

b) Charge sheet did not contain details of the evidence against the Petitioners.

c) Copies of the said documents were not made available to the Petitioners

d) No proper notice had been given to the Petitioners before leading the said evidence.

As I have observed earlier, by letters dated 21.11.2014 the 2nd Respondent served charges against all the

Petitioners. However the said charge sheets does not contain details of the evidence relied by the

complainant to establish charges against the Petitioners. Out of the 5 charges framed against the

Petitioners charges 2-5 are solely based on Media Publications, press releases and press conferences

published in Print Media and Electronic Media but the 2nd Respondent has failed to give sufficient notice

of the said material relied by him, to the Petitioners. It is also observed by this court that the Petitioners

were given time to respond to the said charge sheets but when the Petitioners requested by P-15 copies of

relevant paper articles, video and audio tapes, the response of the 2nd Respondent was that the said

material will not be submitted for the inquiry on 06.01.2015. (P-16 and P-18)

After several postponements granted on the request of the Petitioners the inquiry was finally commenced

on 28.01.2015 and it is evident from the proceeding of the said inquiry produced marked P-20 that the

inquiry which commenced on that day was only the inquiry against Petitioner in CA 175/15, H.K.

Ashoka Dayaratne. According to the said proceedings, at the end of the proceedings on that day it was

recorded that, "Both parties agree to postponed the inquiry to a date, which will be agreed later for

leading of audio, video and news paper evidence and for the balance proceedings of the disciplinary

inquiry. In between the said inquiry date and the next date decided by the disciplinary committee, the 2nd

\

tI

, 20

Respondent had given notice to the Petitioners of six news items he intends leading as evidence on the

next date, but failed to provide copies of the same to the Petitioners.

When the Petitioners objected to the production of the said material on 22.02.2015 at the inquiry, it was

submitted before the disciplinary committee that, the Petitioners have agreed that the postponement was

obtained on the previous day to lead the said, material and for the balance proceedings of the inquiry. The

said position was accepted by the disciplinary committee as follows,

However I observe that the above conclusion of the disciplinary committee is erroneous. As I have

observe earlier, the disciplinary inquiry which commenced on 28. 01.2015was only against the Petitioner

in CA 175/15 H.K. Ashoka Dayaratne and therefore it is wrong to conclude that all Petitioners had

agreed to lead documentary, audio and video evidence on the next date of inquiry.

According to P-20 the disciplinary committee had over ruled the objections raised by the Petitioners for

the production of the said audio, video and news paper items on 22.02.2015 and proceeded to lead the

said evidence before them.

The proceeding of the disciplinary inquiry was concluded thereafter even though the Petitioners have

denied the said news items.

This court further observes that, from the Proceedings of the disciplinary inquiry held on 22. 02. 2015 it

is not clear whether the inquiry held on that day was conducted against all the Petitioners or against the

Petitioner's in the applications 176/15 and 177/15 only. However, as observed by me earlier it is clear

that the disciplinary inquiry held on 28.01.2015 was only against the Petitioner in the application 175/15.

In the absence of a specific order by the disciplinary committee to the effect that they have decided to

take up all three inquiries together, I cannot conclude that a proper disciplinary inquiry was held against

the Petitioner in Application 175/15 on 22.01.2015.

In the case of Ramamoorthi and Rameshwaran V. Douglas Devananda and Others it was held that, the

expUlsion was invalid, as there was failure to comply with the Audi Altaram Partem rule. There was no

\i

21

charge sheet served and no explanation for alleged acts of misconduct was called for. A request by

telephone to come for an inquiry is totally inadequate.

In the case of Sarath Amunugama and Others V. Karu Jayasuriya and Others Supreme Court observed

that; no explanations were called from the Petitioners, no charge sheets were served and no inquiry was

held giving an adequate opportunity to the Petitioners to defend themselves and held that, there was no

justification for the failure of the Respondents to observe the principles of natural justice and grant the

Petitioners a hearing before they were expelled. The expulsions of the Petitioners were therefore invalid.

However in the present case, as evident from the documents I have already referred to in this judgment, a

charge sheet comprising of 5 charges were served on each Petitioner and the Petitioners were given more

than two months to answer the said charge sheet. When the Petitioners requested for a copy of the

Constitution of the Party in order to answer the charges against them, by letter marked P-lO the second

Respondent had given them an opportunity to obtain copies from the Party Head Office.

The Respondents have also permitted the Petitioners to be represented by an Attorney-at-Law as their

defending officer.

However Respondents have alleged before this court that the Respondents have failed to follow the rules

of Natural Justice and demonstrated several instances where the Respondents said to have violated and

lor failed to follow, the rules of Natural Justice.

In the case of Canara Bank V. Debasis Das (2003) 4 see 557 Arijit Pasayat (J) discussed the "Rules of

Natural Justice" as follows;

"Over the years by process of judicial interpretation two rules have been evolved as representing

the Principles of Natural Justice in judicial process, including therein quasi judicial and

administrative process. They constitute the basic elements of a fair hearing, having their roots in

the innate sense of man for fair play and justice which is not the preserve of any particular race or

country but is shared in common by all men. The first rule is "nemo judex in causa sua" or "nemo

debet esse judex in propria causa sua" that is "no man shall be judge in his own cause". The

second rule is "audi alteram partem, that is "hear the other side" a corollary has been deducted

from the above two rules and particularly the audi alteram partem rule, namely "qui aliquid

statuerit, parte inaudita altera acqumlicet dixerit, haud acqum fecerit" that is "he who shall

decide anything without the other side having been heard, although he may have said what is ,

ot

!

t l

22

right, will not have been what is right" or in other words, as it is now expressed "justice should

not only be done but should manifestly be seen to be done"

As observed by me earlier the 1st to 6th Respondents had given several postponements to the Petitioners to

get ready for their case, but without giving them and lor informing them the evidence against them. As

pointed out by me earlier, the said material which was not made available to the Petitioners was the only

evidence against the Petitioners in their disciplinary inquiries. The conduct of the disciplinary inquiries

on 28.01.2015 and 22.02.2015 are confusing as pointed out by me earlier. Therefore it appears to me

that the Respondents, specially the 3rd , 4th and 5th Respondents have failed to afford a fair disciplinary

inquiry to the Petitioners in all three cases before us. Therefore I conclude that the expUlsion of all three

parties in cases 175/15, 176/15 and 177/15 were invalid.
