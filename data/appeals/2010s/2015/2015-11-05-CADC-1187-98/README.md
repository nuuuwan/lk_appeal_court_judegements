Plaintiff-respondent-respondent filed this action in the District of

Galle seeking to have the land called Ambagahakoratuwewatta alias

Ambagahawatta, partitioned. Initially there were only two defendants to

the action. At the time of the preliminary survey of the land subjected to

in this case, 3rd defendant-respondent-petitioner claimed a part of the land

before the Commissioner. Accordingly, she made an application to

intervene and then she was added as the 3rd defendant to the action. At

the conclusion of the trial, learned Additional District Judge of Galle made

order to partition the land as shown in his judgment dated 16.10.1998.

Being aggrieved by the said decision of the learned Additional

District Judge, the 1 st defendant filed this appeal seeking to set aside the

judgment and to have an order to partition the corpus as prayed for in the

plaint.

When the appeal was taken up in this Court on 05.08.2013, neither

the plaintiff-respondent nor the 2nd defendant-respondent was present in

this Court even though notices have been sent by the Registrar under

registered cover directing them to be present in this Court on that date.

Accordingly, the appeal was taken up for argument in the absence of the

plaintiff-respondent and the 2nd defendant-respondent. The Attorneys-at-

Law who appeared for the appellant and the 3rd defendant-respondent

moved to file submissions in writing and invited Court to write the

judgment without oral submissions being made.

When this matter was mentioned on the next date to ascertain

whether the parties have filed their submissions, different Counsel

appeared for the 3rd defendant-respondent. He alleged that there had been

a fraud committed by the plaintiff in this connection and made an

application to have another date to support his application. Thereafter,3rd

defendant-respondent-petitioner, by the petition dated 19.03.2014 sought

permission of this Court to receive and admit new evidence in terms of

Section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code, in addition to the evidence

already recorded in the Court of the first instance. Appellant filed

objections to this application. Thereafter, both parties made their

submissions in writing as well on the issue of receiving fresh evidence.

Section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code reads thus:

"Upon hearing the appeal, it shall be competent to the Court

of Appeal to affirm, reverse, correct or modify any judgment,

decree, or order, according to law, or to pass such judgment,

decree, or order therein between and as regards the parties,

or to give such direction to the court below, or to order a

new trial or a further hearing upon such terms as the Court

of Appeal shall think fit, or, if need be, to receive and admit

new evidence additional to, or supplementary of, the

evidence already taken in the court of first instance,

touching the matters at issue in any original cause, suit or

action, as justice may require or to order a new or further

trial on the ground of discovery of fresh evidence

subsequent to the trial.

In the case of Beatrice Dep v. Lalani Meemaduma, [1997 (3) SLR

379] this issue of admitting new evidence had been discussed. In that

decision, several other decisions including that of Hettiarachchi v. Mary

Motha [C.A.1329/82 CALA 141/82 C A Minutes dated 5.11.1986]

Carolis v. Piyadasa [CALA 182/90 C A Minutes dated 16.7.1993]

Jandiris v. Deva Renta [33 NLR 200] Piyaratne Unnanse v. Nandina

[37 NLR 109] Endiris de Silva v. Aronolis [33 CLW 39] Ramasamy v.

Fonseka [62 NLR 90] Ratwatte v. Bandara [70 NLR 231] also had

been discussed. In the aforesaid judgment namely, Beatrice Dep v.

Lalani Meemaduma, (supra) decision in Lada v. Marshall [1954 [3] All

ER 745 at 748] also is cited and in that Denning, L. J had held thus:

"in order to justify the reception of fresh evidence or a new trial, three

conditions must be fulfilled: first, it must be shown that the evidence

could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the

4

..

trial: second, the evidence must be such that, if given, it would

probably have an important influence on the result of the case,

although it need not be decisive,: third, the evidence must be such as

is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently

credible, although it need not be incontrovertible. "

I have no hesitation to agree with the guide lines enumerated in

those decisions when the question of receiving fresh evidence to be

decided at the appeal stage. In the circumstances, I will now tum to

consider whether the matters referred to by the 3rd defendant-respondent-

petitioner would permit this Court to make an order allowing her

application made under Section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Matters referred to in her petition dated 19.03.2014 are basically on

the question of devolution of title of the parties to the land subjected to in

this partition action. Since, it is on the title of the parties, I would like to

refer first to Section 25 of the Partition Act. The said Section 25 of the

Partition Act imposes a duty on the trial judge to investigate title of the

parties when it comes to proceedings in a partition action. Such a duty is

akin to inquisitorial system prevails over civil law jurisdictions. [Galagoda

Matters alleged by the 3rd defendant-respondent-petitioner in order to

act under Section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code are basically in relation to

the devolution of title of the parties to the corpus sUbjected to in this case.

As mentioned earlier, aforesaid Section 25 of the Partition Act imposes a

duty on the trial judge to consider those matters even if the parties have

failed to refer to those matters at the trial. Now that such an issue has come

up before this Court, 3rd defendant has every right to bring it to the notice of

this Court and move for a re-trial even at this appeal stage enabling the trial

judge to act in accordance with Section 25 of the Partition Act. Merely

because her claim was to have an exclusion of a particular portion of the

corpus, she is not prevented from taking up the matters pertaining to the

devolution of title of the parties to the action even at this appeal stage.

Therefore, it is my view that the 3rd defendant-respondent-petitioner is

entitled to make submissions even at this appeal stage as to the title of the

other parties to the action despite the fact that her claim is only for

exclusion. Accordingly, it is not necessary for this Court to make an order in

respect of the application dated 19.03.2004 of the 3rd defendant-respondent-

petitioner made under Section 773 of the Civil Procedure Code. In the

circumstances, I make an order to have the appeal fIxed for argument afresh

6

for another date enabling the 3rd defendant-respondent to make submissions

as to the devolution of title of the parties to the action.

For the aforesaid reasons, this application dated 19.03.2014 is

refused. This matter is to be mentioned on another date to fIx the appeal for

argument.

Application dismissed.
